 <dc:title>Preserving Privacy of Agents in Participatory-Sensing Schemes for
  Traffic Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A measure of privacy infringement for agents (or participants) travelling
across a transportation network in participatory-sensing schemes for traffic
estimation is introduced. The measure is defined to be the conditional
probability that an external observer assigns to the private nodes in the
transportation network, e.g., location of home or office, given all the
position measurements that it broadcasts over time. An algorithm for finding an
optimal trade-off between the measure of privacy infringement and the expected
estimation error, captured by the number of the nodes over which the
participant stops broadcasting its position, is proposed. The algorithm
searches over a family of policies in which an agent stops transmitting its
position measurements if its distance (in terms of the number of hops) to the
privacy sensitive node is smaller than a prescribed threshold. Employing such
symmetric policies are advantageous in terms of the resources required for
implementation and the ease of computation. The results are expanded to more
general policies. Further, the effect of the heterogeneity of the population
density on the optimal policy is explored. Finally, the relationship between
the betweenness measure of centrality and the optimal privacy-preserving policy
of the agents is numerically explored.

 <dc:title>Device-independent characterizations of a shared quantum state
  independent of any Bell inequalities</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In a Bell experiment two parties share a quantum state and perform local
measurements on their subsystems separately, and the statistics of the
measurement outcomes are recorded as a Bell correlation. For any Bell
correlation, it turns out {that} a quantum state with minimal size that is able
to produce this correlation can always be pure. In this work, we first exhibit
two device-independent characterizations for the pure state that Alice and Bob
share using only the correlation data. Specifically, we give two conditions
that the Schmidt coefficients must satisfy, which can be tight, and have
various applications in quantum tasks. First, one of the characterizations
allows us to bound the entanglement between Alice and Bob using Renyi entropies
and also to {bound} the underlying Hilbert space dimension. Second, when the
{Hilbert space dimension bound} is tight, the shared pure quantum state has to
be maximally entangled. Third, the second characterization gives a sufficient
condition that a Bell correlation cannot be generated by particular quantum
states. We also show that our results can be generalized to the case of shared
mixed states.

 <dc:title>Distribution-Specific Hardness of Learning Neural Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Although neural networks are routinely and successfully trained in practice
using simple gradient-based methods, most existing theoretical results are
negative, showing that learning such networks is difficult, in a worst-case
sense over all data distributions. In this paper, we take a more nuanced view,
and consider whether specific assumptions on the &quot;niceness&quot; of the input
distribution, or &quot;niceness&quot; of the target function (e.g. in terms of
smoothness, non-degeneracy, incoherence, random choice of parameters etc.), are
sufficient to guarantee learnability using gradient-based methods. We provide
evidence that neither class of assumptions alone is sufficient: On the one
hand, for any member of a class of &quot;nice&quot; target functions, there are difficult
input distributions. On the other hand, we identify a family of simple target
functions, which are difficult to learn even if the input distribution is
&quot;nice&quot;. To prove our results, we develop some tools which may be of independent
interest, such as extending Fourier-based hardness techniques developed in the
context of statistical queries \cite{blum1994weakly}, from the Boolean cube to
Euclidean space and to more general classes of functions.

 <dc:description>  Application service providers (ASPs) now develop, deploy, and maintain
complex computing platforms within multiple cloud infrastructures to improve
resilience, responsiveness and elasticity of their applications. On the other
hand, complex applications have little control and visibility over network
resources, and need to use low-level hacks to extract network properties and
prioritize traffic. This biased view, limits tenants flexibility while
deploying their applications and prevents them from implementing part of the
application logic in the network. In this paper, we propose the CNSMO (CYCLONE
Network Services Manager/Orchestrator) tool to bring the innovation at
federated cloud environments by bridging these network service capabilities to
cloud based services as part of the overall CYCLONE solution. The integration
of networking aspects with purely federated clouds, will allow users to request
specific infrastructures and manage their dedicated set of coordinated network
and IT resources in an easy and transparent way while operating dynamic
deployments of distributed applications.

 <dc:title>Classifying and sorting cluttered piles of unknown objects with robots:

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of sorting a densely cluttered pile of unknown
objects using a robot. This yet unsolved problem is relevant in the robotic
waste sorting business.
  By extending previous active learning approaches to grasping, we show a
system that learns the task autonomously. Instead of predicting just whether a
grasp succeeds, we predict the classes of the objects that end up being picked
and thrown onto the target conveyor. Segmenting and identifying objects from
the uncluttered target conveyor, as opposed to the working area, is easier due
to the added structure since the thrown objects will be the only ones present.
  Instead of trying to segment or otherwise understand the cluttered working
area in any way, we simply allow the controller to learn a mapping from an RGBD
image in the neighborhood of the grasp to a predicted result---all segmentation
etc. in the working area is implicit in the learned function. The grasp
selection operates in two stages: The first stage is hardcoded and outputs a
distribution of possible grasps that sometimes succeed. The second stage uses a
purely learned criterion to choose the grasp to make from the proposal
distribution created by the first stage.
  In an experiment, the system quickly learned to make good pickups and predict
correctly, in advance, which class of object it was going to pick up and was
able to sort the objects from a densely cluttered pile by color.

 <dc:title>Two-Time-Slot Bidirectional Relaying in Molecular Communication</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the bidirectional/two-way relaying of molecular
communication and propose a relaying scheme with two time slots. Compared to
the four-time-slot and three-time-slot schemes, the proposed two-time-slot
scheme improves the throughput by a significant extent by allowing the end
nodes to transmit simultaneously at the very first time slot. In contrast to
the existing techniques, the proposed scheme employs a homogeneous molecular
communication for bidirectional relaying where all the nodes (i.e., end nodes
and relay node) are allowed to operate on the same type of molecule instead of
utilizing different types of molecule for different nodes. As a result, this
proposal of homogeneous molecular relaying remarkably improves the resource
reuse capability. This paper generically characterizes the transmission and
detection strategies of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we derive the analytical
bit error probabilities for the multiple access and broadcast phases and
present the end-to-end bit error probability of the proposed scheme. It's
noteworthy that we take it into account the effect of molecular interference in
the theoretical derivations. Extensive simulation is carried out, and it is
shown that simulation results match very well with the derived theoretical
analysis.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the spectral efficiency (SE) of multi-cell Massive
Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) using different channel models. Prior works
have derived closed-form SE bounds and approximations for Gaussian distributed
channels, while we consider the double scattering model-a prime example of a
non-Gaussian channel for which it is intractable to obtain closed form SE
expressions. The channels are estimated using limited resources, which gives
rise to pilot contamination, and the estimates are used for linear detection
and to compute the SE numerically. Analytical and numerical examples are used
to describe the key behaviors of the double scattering models, which differ
from conventional Massive MIMO models. Finally, we provide multi-cell
simulation results that compare the double scattering model with uncorrelated
Rayleigh fading and explain under what conditions we can expect to achieve
similar SEs.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel deep architecture for saliency prediction.
Current state of the art models for saliency prediction employ Fully
Convolutional networks that perform a non-linear combination of features
extracted from the last convolutional layer to predict saliency maps. We
propose an architecture which, instead, combines features extracted at
different levels of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our model is composed
of three main blocks: a feature extraction CNN, a feature encoding network,
that weights low and high level feature maps, and a prior learning network. We
compare our solution with state of the art saliency models on two public
benchmarks datasets. Results show that our model outperforms under all
evaluation metrics on the SALICON dataset, which is currently the largest
public dataset for saliency prediction, and achieves competitive results on the
MIT300 benchmark.

crowd. Commonly, user studies are controlled in-lab activities that require the
instruction, monitoring, interviewing and compensation of a number of
participants that are typically hard to recruit. The goal of this work is to
study which user study methods can instead be crowdsourced to generic audiences
to enable the conduct of user studies without the need for expensive lab
experiments. The challenge is understanding how to conduct crowdsourced studies
without giving up too many of the guarantees in-lab settings are able to
provide.

 <dc:description>  We introduce and study four optimization problems that generalize the
well-known subset sum problem. Given a node-weighted digraph, select a subset
of vertices whose total weight does not exceed a given budget. Some additional
constraints need to be satisfied. The (weak resp.) digraph constraint imposes
that if (all incoming nodes of resp.) a node $x$ belongs to the solution, then
the latter comprises all its outgoing nodes (node $x$ itself resp.). The
maximality constraint ensures that a solution cannot be extended without
violating the budget or the (weak) digraph constraint. We study the complexity
of these problems and we present some approximation results according to the
type of digraph given in input, e.g. directed acyclic graphs and oriented
trees.
  Key words. Subset Sum, Maximal problems, digraph constraints, complexity,

 <dc:description>  We describe GTApprox - a new tool for medium-scale surrogate modeling in
industrial design. Compared to existing software, GTApprox brings several
innovations: a few novel approximation algorithms, several advanced methods of
automated model selection, novel options in the form of hints. We demonstrate
the efficiency of GTApprox on a large collection of test problems. In addition,
we describe several applications of GTApprox to real engineering problems.

 <dc:description>  The field of cryo-electron microscopy has made astounding advancements in the
past few years, mainly due to improvements in the hardware of the microscopes.
Yet, one of the key open challenges of the field remains the processing of
heterogeneous data sets, produced from samples containing particles at several
different conformational states. For such data sets, one must first classify
their images into homogeneous groups, where each group corresponds to the same
underlying structure, followed by reconstruction of a three-dimensional model
from each of the homogeneous groups. This task has been proven to be extremely
difficult. In this paper we present an iterative algorithm for processing
heterogeneous data sets that combines the classification and reconstruction
steps. We prove accuracy and stability bounds on the algorithm, and demonstrate
it on simulated as well as experimental data sets.

 <dc:description>  The aim of our work is to evaluate the performance of non-beacon IEEE
802.15.4 networks with acknowledgement (ACK) mode and retransmission limits in
a finer time unit. Moreover, we predict network performance parameters using
backpropagation artificial neural networks (BP-ANNs) with respect to a given
quality of service for real-world applications. Therefore, our proposed methods
can assist the deployment of a star network with its performance specified in a
more practical way. First, the discrete time Markov chain model and M/M/1/k
queue are used to describe the full unslotted carrier sense multiple access
with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm in a non-beacon network.
Considering MAC buffer size, unsaturated traffic, and saturated traffic, we
build three analytical models to derive eight important performance metrics,
e.g., throughput, delay, and reliability. In addition, extensive simulation
results show the accuracy of the analytical models in throughput and
reliability. Finally, we use the analytical data to train the BP-ANNs models to
predict the key parameters such as node number and delay. All results from the
simulation data used to test the BP-ANNs show the accuracy these models. Thus,
these methods and results can be used to deploy star networks in application
environments.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents Deep Retinal Image Understanding (DRIU), a unified
framework of retinal image analysis that provides both retinal vessel and optic
disc segmentation. We make use of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
which have proven revolutionary in other fields of computer vision such as
object detection and image classification, and we bring their power to the
study of eye fundus images. DRIU uses a base network architecture on which two
set of specialized layers are trained to solve both the retinal vessel and
optic disc segmentation. We present experimental validation, both qualitative
and quantitative, in four public datasets for these tasks. In all of them, DRIU
presents super-human performance, that is, it shows results more consistent
with a gold standard than a second human annotator used as control.

 <dc:description>  We are concerned with the recovery of $s-$sparse Wigner-D expansions in terms
of $N$ Wigner-D functions. Considered as a generalization of spherical
harmonics, Wigner-D functions are eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami operator
and form an orthonormal system. However, since they are not uniformly bounded,
the existing results on BOS do not apply. Using previously introduced
preconditioning technique, a new orthonormal and bounded system is obtained for
which RIP property can be established. We show that the number of sufficient
samples for sparse recovery scales with ${N}^{1/6} \,s\, \log^3(s) \,\log(N)$.
The phase transition diagram for this problem is also presented. We will also
discuss the application of our results in the spherical near-field antenna
measurement.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing is a new computational paradigm that offers an innovative
business model for organizations to adopt IT without upfront investment.
Despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the model
security is still questionable which impacts the cloud model adoption. The
security problem becomes more complicated under the cloud model as new
dimensions have entered into the problem scope related to the model
architecture, multi-tenancy, elasticity, and layers dependency stack. In this
paper we introduce a detailed analysis of the cloud security problem. We
investigated the problem from the cloud architecture perspective, the cloud
offered characteristics perspective, the cloud stakeholders' perspective, and
the cloud service delivery models perspective. Based on this analysis we derive
a detailed specification of the cloud security problem and key features that
should be covered by any proposed security solution.

 <dc:description>  Simultaneous broadcasting of multiple messages from the same source vertex in
synchronous networks is considered under restrictions that each vertex receives
at most one message in a unit time step, every received message can be sent out
only in the next time step, no message is sent to already informed vertex. The
number of outgoing messages in unrestricted, messages have unit length, and we
assume full-duplex mode. In [9] we developed a concept of level-disjoint
partitions to study simultaneous broadcasting under this model. In this work we
consider the optimal number of level-disjoint partitions. We also provide a
necessary condition in terms of eccentricity and girth on existence of $k$
$v$-rooted level-disjoint partitions of optimal height. In particular, we
provide a structural characterization of graphs admitting two level-disjoint
partitions with the same root.

 <dc:title>Reflections on Shannon Information: In search of a natural

 <dc:description>  It is not obvious how to extend Shannon's original information entropy to
higher dimensions, and many different approaches have been tried. We replace
the English text symbol sequence originally used to illustrate the theory by a
discrete, bandlimited signal. Using Shannon's later theory of sampling we
derive a new and symmetric version of the second order entropy in 1D. The new
theory then naturally extends to 2D and higher dimensions, where by naturally
we mean simple, symmetric, isotropic and parsimonious. Simplicity arises from
the direct application of Shannon's joint entropy equalities and inequalities
to the gradient (del) vector field image embodying the second order relations
of the scalar image. Parsimony is guaranteed by halving of the vector data rate
using Papoulis' generalized sampling expansion. The new 2D entropy measure,
which we dub delentropy, is underpinned by a computable probability density
function we call deldensity. The deldensity captures the underlying spatial
image structure and pixel co-occurrence. It achieves this because each scalar
image pixel value is nonlocally related to the entire gradient vector field.
Both deldensity and delentropy are highly tractable and yield many interesting
connections and useful inequalities. The new measure explicitly defines a
realizable encoding algorithm and a corresponding reconstruction. Initial tests
show that delentropy compares favourably with the conventional intensity-based
histogram entropy and the compressed data rates of lossless image encoders
(GIF, PNG, WEBP, JP2K-LS and JPG-LS) for a selection of images. The symmetric
approach may have applications to higher dimensions and problems concerning
image complexity measures.

product or service. In this article is done a study of previous work relating
to the application of data mining methodologies for software projects,
specifically for direct marketing projects. Several data sets of demographic

in this area, some of them very new and current are described. The main
contribution of this paper is the proposal of a platform for distributed data
stream processing for the processes of targeting customers and building
predictive models required response; thus facilitating several of the

 <dc:description>  A code is said to be a $r$-local locally repairable code (LRC) if each of its
coordinates can be repaired by accessing at most $r$ other coordinates. When
some of the $r$ coordinates are also erased, the $r$-local LRC can not
accomplish the local repair, which leads to the concept of
$(r,\delta)$-locality. A $q$-ary $[n, k]$ linear code $\cC$ is said to have
$(r, \delta)$-locality ($\delta\ge 2$) if for each coordinate $i$, there exists
a punctured subcode of $\cC$ with support containing $i$, whose length is at
most $r + \delta - 1$, and whose minimum distance is at least $\delta$. The
$(r, \delta)$-LRC can tolerate $\delta-1$ erasures in total, which degenerates
to a $r$-local LRC when $\delta=2$. A $q$-ary $(r,\delta)$ LRC is called
optimal if it meets the Singleton-like bound for $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. A class of
optimal $q$-ary cyclic $r$-local LRCs with lengths $n\mid q-1$ were constructed
by Tamo, Barg, Goparaju and Calderbank based on the $q$-ary Reed-Solomon codes.
In this paper, we construct a class of optimal $q$-ary cyclic $(r,\delta)$-LRCs
($\delta\ge 2$) with length $n\mid q-1$, which generalizes the results of Tamo
\emph{et al.} Moreover, we construct a new class of optimal $q$-ary cyclic
$r$-local LRCs with lengths $n\mid q+1$ and a new class of optimal $q$-ary
cyclic $(r,\delta)$-LRCs ($\delta\ge 2$) with lengths $n\mid q+1$. The
constructed optimal LRCs with length $n=q+1$ have the best-known length $q+1$
for the given finite field with size $q$ when the minimum distance is larger
than $4$.

 <dc:description>  In a cognitive radio system the failure of secondary user (SU) transceivers
to promptly vacate the channel can introduce significant access-latency for
primary or high-priority users (PU). In conventional cognitive radio systems,
the backoff latency is exacerbated by frame structures that only allow sensing
at periodic intervals. Concurrent transmission and sensing using
self-interference suppression has been suggested to improve the performance of
cognitive radio systems, allowing decisions to be taken at multiple points
within the frame. In this paper, we extend this approach by proposing a
sliding-window full-duplex model allowing decisions to be taken on a
sample-by-sample basis. We also derive the access-latency for both the existing
and the proposed schemes. Our results show that the access-latency of the
sliding scheme is decreased by a factor of 2.6 compared to the existing slotted
full-duplex scheme and by a factor of approximately 16 compared to a
half-duplex cognitive radio system. Moreover, the proposed scheme is
significantly more resilient to the destructive effects of residual
self-interference compared to previous approaches.

 <dc:description>  A class of evolution variational inequalities (EVIs), which comprises
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) coupled with variational inequalities
(VIs) associated with time-varying set-valued mappings, is proposed in this
paper. We first study the conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions.
The central idea behind the proof is to rewrite the system dynamics as a
differential inclusion which can be decomposed into a single-valued Lipschitz
map, and a time-dependent maximal monotone operator. Regularity assumptions on
the set-valued mapping determine the regularity of the resulting solutions.
Complementarity systems with time-dependence are studied as a particular case.
We then use this result to study the problem of designing state feedback
control laws for output regulation in systems described by EVIs. The derivation
of control laws for output regulation is based on the use of internal model
principle, and two cases are treated: First, a static feedback control law is
derived when full state feedback is available; In the second case, only the
error to be regulated is assumed to be available for measurement and a dynamic
compensator is designed. As applications, we demonstrate how control input
resulting from the solution of a variational inequality results in regulating
the output of the system while maintaining polyhedral state constraints.
Another application is seen in designing control inputs for regulation in power
converters.

 <dc:description>  Linearizability is a commonly accepted notion of correctness for libraries of
concurrent algorithms, and recent years have seen a number of proposals of
program logics for proving it. Although these logics differ in technical
details, they embody similar reasoning principles. To explicate these
principles, we propose a logic for proving linearizability that is generic: it
can be instantiated with different means of compositional reasoning about
concurrency, such as separation logic or rely-guarantee. To this end, we
generalise the Views framework for reasoning about concurrency to handle
relations between programs, required for proving linearizability. We present
sample instantiations of our generic logic and show that it is powerful enough
to handle concurrent algorithms with challenging features, such as helping.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we draw attention to a connection between skill-based models of
game outcomes and Gaussian process classification models. The Gaussian process
perspective enables a) a principled way of dealing with uncertainty and b) rich
models, specified through kernel functions. Using this connection, we tackle
the problem of predicting outcomes of football matches between national teams.
We develop a player kernel that relates any two football matches through the
players lined up on the field. This makes it possible to share knowledge gained
from observing matches between clubs (available in large quantities) and
matches between national teams (available only in limited quantities). We
evaluate our approach on the Euro 2008, 2012 and 2016 final tournaments.

 <dc:title>A New Approach to Constructing Quadratic Pseudo-Planar Functions over
  $\gf_{2^n}$</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Qu, Longjiang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Planar functions over finite fields give rise to finite projective planes.
They were also used in the constructions of DES-like iterated ciphers,
error-correcting codes, and codebooks. They were originally defined only in
finite fields with odd characteristic, but recently Zhou introduced
pesudo-planar functions in even characteristic which yields similar
applications. All known pesudo-planar functions are quadratic and hence they
give presemifields. In this paper, a new approach to constructing quadratic
pseudo-planar functions is given. Then five explicit families of pseudo-planar
functions are constructed, one of which is a binomial, two of which are
trinomials, and the other two are quadrinomials. All known pesudo-planar
functions are revisited, some of which are generalized. These functions not
only lead to projective planes, relative difference sets and presemifields, but
also give optimal codebooks meeting the Levenstein bound, complete sets of
mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and compressed sensing matrices with low
coherence.

 <dc:title>Cost-efficient Scheduling on Machines from the Cloud</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider a scheduling problem where machines need to be rented from the
cloud in order to process jobs. There are two types of machines available which
can be rented for machine-type dependent prices and for arbitrary durations.
However, a machine-type dependent setup time is required before a machine is
available for processing. Jobs arrive online over time, have machine-type
dependent sizes and have individual deadlines. The objective is to rent
machines and schedule jobs so as to meet all deadlines while minimizing the
rental cost.
  Since we observe the slack of jobs to have a fundamental influence on the
competitiveness, we study the model when instances are parameterized by their
(minimum) slack. An instance is called to have a slack of $\beta$ if, for all
jobs, the difference between the job's release time and the latest point in
time at which it needs to be started is at least $\beta$. While for $\beta &lt; s$
no finite competitiveness is possible, our main result is an
$O(\frac{c}{\varepsilon} + \frac{1}{\varepsilon^3})$-competitive online
algorithm for $\beta = (1+\varepsilon)s$ with $\frac{1}{s} \leq \varepsilon
\leq 1$, where $s$ and $c$ denotes the largest setup time and the cost ratio of
the machine-types, respectively. It is complemented by a lower bound of
$\Omega(\frac{c}{\varepsilon})$.

 <dc:description>  The State and its citizens generate lots of data. Once stored and processed,
data can help resolve questions in Social Sciences, where it is common to need
data in a different level of aggregation than the data is presented. In
election results, we would like to understand the decision of each voter or
group of voters, but the data is only available at the polling-place level.
This problem is known as ecological inference. In this work we compare two
methods to estimate the share of votes for each party according to different
age groups. This work is complemented with the analysis of votes between the
first and second rounds, as well as a referendum during the first. This
analysis was performed on the 2014 uruguayan presidential elections.

 <dc:title>Bi-Text Alignment of Movie Subtitles for Spoken English-Arabic

 <dc:description>  We describe efforts towards getting better resources for English-Arabic
machine translation of spoken text. In particular, we look at movie subtitles
as a unique, rich resource, as subtitles in one language often get translated
into other languages. Movie subtitles are not new as a resource and have been
explored in previous research; however, here we create a much larger bi-text
(the biggest to date), and we further generate better quality alignment for it.
Given the subtitles for the same movie in different languages, a key problem is
how to align them at the fragment level. Typically, this is done using
length-based alignment, but for movie subtitles, there is also time
information. Here we exploit this information to develop an original algorithm
that outperforms the current best subtitle alignment tool, subalign. The
evaluation results show that adding our bi-text to the IWSLT training bi-text
yields an improvement of over two BLEU points absolute.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing revolutionized the information technology (IT) industry by
offering dynamic and infinite scaling, on-demand resources and utility-oriented
usage. However, recent changes in user traffic and requirements have exposed
the shortcomings of cloud computing, particularly the inability to deliver
real-time responses and handle massive surge in data volumes. Fog computing,
that brings back partial computation load from the cloud to the edge devices,
is envisioned to be the next big change in computing, and has the potential to
address these challenges. Being a highly distributed, loosely coupled and still
in the emerging phase, standardization, quality-of-service management and
dynamic adaptability are the key challenges faced by fog computing research
fraternity today. This article aims to address these issues by proposing a
service-oriented middleware that leverages the convergence of cloud and fog
computing along with software defined networking (SDN) and network function
virtualization (NFV) to achieve the aforementioned goals. The proposed system,
called &quot;Software Defined Fog&quot; (SDFog), abstracts connected entities as services
and allows applications to orchestrate these services with end-to-end QoS
requirements. A use-case showing the necessity of such a middleware has been
presented to show the efficacy of the SDN-based QoS control over the Fog. This
article aims at developing an integrated system to realize the software-defined
control over fog infrastructure.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces the first system for performing automatic orchestration
based on a real-time piano input. We believe that it is possible to learn the
underlying regularities existing between piano scores and their orchestrations
by notorious composers, in order to automatically perform this task on novel
piano inputs. To that end, we investigate a class of statistical inference
models called conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (cRBM). We introduce a
specific evaluation framework for orchestral generation based on a prediction
task in order to assess the quality of different models. As prediction and
creation are two widely different endeavours, we discuss the potential biases
in evaluating temporal generative models through prediction tasks and their
impact on a creative system. Finally, we introduce an implementation of the
proposed model called Live Orchestral Piano (LOP), which allows to perform
real-time projective orchestration of a MIDI keyboard input.

 <dc:description>  While a wide range of different, sometimes heterogeneous test coverage
criteria have been proposed, there exists no generic formalism to describe
them, and available test automation tools usually support only a small subset
of them. We introduce a unified specification language, called HTOL, providing
a powerful generic mechanism to define test objectives, which permits encoding
numerous existing criteria and supporting them in a unified way. HTOL comes
with a formal semantics and can express complex requirements over several
executions (using a novel notion of hyperlabels), as well as alternative
requirements or requirements over a whole program execution. A novel
classification of a large class of existing criteria is proposed. Finally, a
coverage measurement tool for HTOL objectives has been implemented. Initial
experiments suggest that the proposed approach is both efficient and practical.

 <dc:title>Embedding AC Power Flow in the Complex Plane Part II: A Reliable
  Framework for Voltage Collapse Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Suetin, Sergey P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Part II of this paper elaborates on the unique capability of the proposed
power flow analysis framework to obtain the true solution corresponding to the
stable operating point of a network. It explains the significance of obtaining
the true solution for an accurate assessment of the voltage collapse margin.
This feature distinguishes the framework from all iterative and non-iterative
heuristic approaches as demonstrated in the context of a 7-bus network with
Newton-Raphson, its variants and semidefinite and moment-based relaxations of
power flow. Another important feature of this framework is that it obtains the
true solution when it exists and declares its non-existence otherwise. This is
demonstrated in the context of small networks and in comparison with heuristic
approaches. This paper also explores how the proposed framework detects a
limit-induced bifurcation where a network controller reaching its limit can
initiate voltage collapse.

 <dc:title>An implementation of Deflate in Coq</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Senjak, Christoph-Simon</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The widely-used compression format &quot;Deflate&quot; is defined in RFC 1951 and is
based on prefix-free codings and backreferences. There are unclear points about
the way these codings are specified, and several sources for confusion in the
standard. We tried to fix this problem by giving a rigorous mathematical
specification, which we formalized in Coq. We produced a verified
implementation in Coq which achieves competitive performance on inputs of
several megabytes. In this paper we present the several parts of our
implementation: a fully verified implementation of canonical prefix-free
codings, which can be used in other compression formats as well, and an elegant
formalism for specifying sophisticated formats, which we used to implement both
a compression and decompression algorithm in Coq which we formally prove
inverse to each other -- the first time this has been achieved to our
knowledge. The compatibility to other Deflate implementations can be shown
empirically. We furthermore discuss some of the difficulties, specifically
regarding memory and runtime requirements, and our approaches to overcome them.

 <dc:title>The Robustness of Estimator Composition</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We formalize notions of robustness for composite estimators via the notion of
a breakdown point. A composite estimator successively applies two (or more)
estimators: on data decomposed into disjoint parts, it applies the first
estimator on each part, then the second estimator on the outputs of the first
estimator. And so on, if the composition is of more than two estimators.
Informally, the breakdown point is the minimum fraction of data points which if
significantly modified will also significantly modify the output of the
estimator, so it is typically desirable to have a large breakdown point. Our
main result shows that, under mild conditions on the individual estimators, the
breakdown point of the composite estimator is the product of the breakdown
points of the individual estimators. We also demonstrate several scenarios,
ranging from regression to statistical testing, where this analysis is easy to
apply, useful in understanding worst case robustness, and sheds powerful
insights onto the associated data analysis.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning is the current bet for image classification. Its greed for huge
amounts of annotated data limits its usage in medical imaging context. In this
scenario transfer learning appears as a prominent solution. In this report we
aim to clarify how transfer learning schemes may influence classification
results. We are particularly focused in the automated melanoma screening
problem, a case of medical imaging in which transfer learning is still not
widely used. We explored transfer with and without fine-tuning, sequential
transfers and usage of pre-trained models in general and specific datasets.
Although some issues remain open, our findings may drive future researches.

 <dc:description>  Accurately determining dependency structure is critical to discovering a
system's causal organization. We recently showed that the transfer entropy
fails in a key aspect of this---measuring information flow---due to its
conflation of dyadic and polyadic relationships. We extend this observation to
demonstrate that this is true of all such Shannon information measures when
used to analyze multivariate dependencies. This has broad implications,
particularly when employing information to express the organization and
mechanisms embedded in complex systems, including the burgeoning efforts to
combine complex network theory with information theory. Here, we do not suggest
that any aspect of information theory is wrong. Rather, the vast majority of
its informational measures are simply inadequate for determining the meaningful
dependency structure within joint probability distributions. Therefore, such
information measures are inadequate for discovering intrinsic causal relations.
We close by demonstrating that such distributions exist across an arbitrary set
of variables.

 <dc:description>  The negative sampling (NEG) objective function, used in word2vec, is a
simplification of the Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) method. NEG was found
to be highly effective in learning continuous word representations. However,
unlike NCE, it was considered inapplicable for the purpose of learning the
parameters of a language model. In this study, we refute this assertion by
providing a principled derivation for NEG-based language modeling, founded on a
novel analysis of a low-dimensional approximation of the matrix of pointwise
mutual information between the contexts and the predicted words. The obtained
language modeling is closely related to NCE language models but is based on a
simplified objective function. We thus provide a unified formulation for two
main language processing tasks, namely word embedding and language modeling,
based on the NEG objective function. Experimental results on two popular
language modeling benchmarks show comparable perplexity results, with a small
advantage to NEG over NCE.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider methods whereby a subset of players in a
$(k,n)$-threshold scheme can &quot;repair&quot; another player's share in the event that
their share has been lost or corrupted. This will take place without the
participation of the dealer who set up the scheme. The repairing protocol
should not compromise the (unconditional) security of the threshold scheme, and
it should be efficient, where efficiency is measured in terms of the amount of
information exchanged during the repairing process. We study two approaches to
repairing. The first method is based on the &quot;enrollment protocol&quot; from
\cite{NSG} which was originally developed to add a new player to a threshold
scheme (without the participation of the dealer) after the scheme was set up.
The second method distributes &quot;multiple shares&quot; to each player, as defined by a
suitable combinatorial design. This method results in larger shares, but lower
communication complexity, as compared to the first method.

 <dc:description>  OpenCL is an open standard for parallel programming of heterogeneous compute
devices, such as GPUs, CPUs, DSPs or FPGAs. However, the verbosity of its C
host API can hinder application development. In this paper we present cf4ocl, a
software library for rapid development of OpenCL programs in pure C. It aims to
reduce the verbosity of the OpenCL API, offering straightforward memory
management, integrated profiling of events (e.g., kernel execution and data
transfers), simple but extensible device selection mechanism and user-friendly
error management. We compare two versions of a conceptual application example,
one based on cf4ocl, the other developed directly with the OpenCL host API.
Results show that the former is simpler to implement and offers more features,
at the cost of an effectively negligible computational overhead. Additionally,
the tools provided with cf4ocl allowed for a quick analysis on how to optimize
the application.

 <dc:description>  A proper circular-arc (PCA) model is a pair ${\cal M} = (C, \cal A)$ where
$C$ is a circle and $\cal A$ is a family of inclusion-free arcs on $C$ in which
no two arcs of $\cal A$ cover $C$. A PCA model $\cal U = (C,\cal A)$ is a $(c,
\ell)$-CA model when $C$ has circumference $c$, all the arcs in $\cal A$ have
length $\ell$, and all the extremes of the arcs in $\cal A$ are at a distance
at least $1$. If $c \leq c'$ and $\ell \leq \ell'$ for every $(c', \ell')$-CA
model equivalent (resp. isomorphic) to $\cal U$, then $\cal U$ is minimal
(resp. minimum). In this article we prove that every PCA model is isomorphic to
a minimum model. Our main tool is a new characterization of those PCA models
that are equivalent to $(c,\ell)$-CA models, that allows us to conclude that
$c$ and $\ell$ are integer when $\cal U$ is minimal. As a consequence, we
obtain an $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space algorithm to solve the minimal
representation problem, while we prove that the minimum representation problem
is NP-complete.

 <dc:description>  Exascale computing will feature novel and potentially disruptive hardware
architectures. Exploiting these to their full potential is non-trivial.
Numerical modelling frameworks involving finite difference methods are
currently limited by the 'static' nature of the hand-coded discretisation
schemes and repeatedly may have to be re-written to run efficiently on new
hardware. In contrast, OpenSBLI uses code generation to derive the model's code
from a high-level specification. Users focus on the equations to solve, whilst
not concerning themselves with the detailed implementation. Source-to-source
translation is used to tailor the code and enable its execution on a variety of
hardware.

 <dc:description>  Most people do not know how much energy they are spending for different
purposes and also they are unaware of potential electrical consumption
reduction level they could make by changing their consumption behaviors or
investing in new efficient technology products. Providing electrical
consumption information to household and make the consumption information
tangible is very effective strategy in reducing electrical consumption in
households. In Home Displays provide consumers real time information on
electrical consumption level and related expenditure, with that strategy
turning an intangible electric bill into transparent and controllable is
possible. We interviewed the participants before the start to our study in
order to have knowledge of their income, environmental attitudes and the
knowledge level of their electrical consumption conserving activities.
Monitoring over 3 to 5 months maximal of five households electrical consumption
and comparing that consumption level with the previous year had been realized.
Households received advanced real time appliance level feedback. Behavioral
change associated electrical consumption reduction levels were identified. It
is also realized that setting goals via an electrical energy consumption
display have high potential on reducing the total electricity consumption in
households. We found 0, 0, 13.21, 3.42, 1.59 % electricity savings on house 1,
house 2, house 3, house 4 and house 5 correspondingly. It is suggested that
further attention need to be given on potential reduction effect of applying
different type of monitor designs and implication of special designed
stimulants that can be used all over the house that can alert households with
their current consumption level. Also, it is suggested to concentrate on time
periods in order to analyze and try to reveal specific time periods for
specific consumption behaviors.

 <dc:description>  This German paper was written entirely at the University of Duisburg-Essen in
2011 for a 3D modeling masters course in applied computer science. We publish
this paper, thus, interested people can acquire a first impression of the topic
&quot;volume raycasting&quot;. In addition to writing this paper, we developed a
functioning open-source OpenCL raycaster. A video of this raycaster is
available: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMMsQnf4zEY. Additionally, we
archived and published the complete source code of the raycaster in the Google
Code Archive: http://code.google.com/p/gputracer/. If this is no longer the
case, those who are interested can also write an email to the author, hence, we
can provide the source code.
  This paper provides an introduction and overview of the topic &quot;volume ray
casting with OpenCL&quot;. We show how volume data can be loaded, manipulated, and
visualized by modern GPUs in real time. In addition, we present basic
algorithms and data structures that are necessary for building such a
raycaster. Then, we describe how we built a rudimentary raycaster using OpenCL
and .NET C#. Furthermore, we analyze different gradient operators
(CentralDifference, Sobel3D and Zucker-Hummel) for surface detection and show
an evaluation of these with respect to their performance. Finally, we present
optimization techniques (hitpoint refinement, adaptive sampling, octrees, and
empty-space-skipping) for improving a raycaster.

 <dc:title>Analytic Performance Model of a Main-Memory Index Structure</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>H.3.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Efficient evaluation of multi-dimensional range queries in a main-memory
database is an important, but difficult task. State-of-the-art techniques rely
on optimised sequential scans or tree-based structures. For range queries with
small result sets, sequential scans exhibit poor asymptotic performance. Also,
as the dimensionality of the data set increases, the performance of tree-based
structures degenerates due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent literature
proposed the Elf, a main-memory structure that is optimised for the case of
such multi-dimensional low-selectivity queries. The Elf outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in manually tuned scenarios. However, choosing an
optimal parameter configuration for the Elf is vital, since for poor
configurations, the search performance degrades rapidly. Consequently, further
knowledge about the behaviour of the Elf in different configurations is
required to achieve robust performance. In this thesis, we therefore propose a
numerical cost model for the Elf. Like all main-memory index structures, the
Elf response time is not dominated by disk accesses, refusing a straightforward
analysis. Our model predicts the size and shape of the Elf region that is
examined during search. We propose that the response time of a search is linear
to the size of this region. Furthermore, we study the impact of skewed data
distributions and correlations on the shape of the Elf. We find that they lead
to behaviour that is accurately describable through simple reductions in
attribute cardinality. Our experimental results indicate that for data sets of
up to 15 dimensions, our cost model predicts the size of the examined Elf
region with relative errors below 5%. Furthermore, we find that the size of the
Elf region examined during search predicts the response time with an accuracy
of 80%.

 <dc:description>  The increasing number of connected vehicles in densely populated urban areas
provides an interesting opportunity to counteract the high wireless data
demands in high density and highly mobile scenarios. The idea is to support the
macro base station (BS) with a secondary communication tier composed of a set
of smart and connected vehicles that are in movement in the urban area.
  As a first step towards a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of this
architecture, this paper considers the case where these vehicles are equipped
with femto-mobile Access Points (fmAPs) and constitute a mobile out-of-band
relay infrastructure. In particular, three techniques to select an fmAP (if
more than one is available) are proposed and the maximal feasible gain in the
packet delivery rate and data rate as a function of the vehicle density,
average vehicle speeds, handoff overhead cost, as well as physical layer
parameters is characterized. The analytical and simulation results provide a
first benchmark characterizing this architecture and the definition of
guidelines for its future realistic study and implementation.

 <dc:description>  Computer graphics can not only generate synthetic images and ground truth but
it also offers the possibility of constructing virtual worlds in which: (i) an
agent can perceive, navigate, and take actions guided by AI algorithms, (ii)
properties of the worlds can be modified (e.g., material and reflectance),
(iii) physical simulations can be performed, and (iv) algorithms can be learnt
and evaluated. But creating realistic virtual worlds is not easy. The game
industry, however, has spent a lot of effort creating 3D worlds, which a player
can interact with. So researchers can build on these resources to create
virtual worlds, provided we can access and modify the internal data structures
of the games. To enable this we created an open-source plugin UnrealCV
(http://unrealcv.github.io) for a popular game engine Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). We
show two applications: (i) a proof of concept image dataset, and (ii) linking
Caffe with the virtual world to test deep network algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We present a computer-aided detection algorithm for polyps in optical
colonoscopy images. Polyps are the precursors to colon cancer. In the US alone,
more than 14 million optical colonoscopies are performed every year, mostly to
screen for polyps. Optical colonoscopy has been shown to have an approximately
25% polyp miss rate due to the convoluted folds and bends present in the colon.
In this work, we present an automatic detection algorithm to detect these
polyps in the optical colonoscopy images. We use a machine learning algorithm
to infer a depth map for a given optical colonoscopy image and then use a
detailed pre-built polyp profile to detect and delineate the boundaries of
polyps in this given image. We have achieved the best recall of 84.0% and the
best specificity value of 83.4%.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a joint audio-video fingerprint Automatic Content
Recognition (ACR) technology for media retrieval. The problem is focused on how
to balance the query accuracy and the size of fingerprint, and how to allocate
the bits of the fingerprint to video frames and audio frames to achieve the
best query accuracy. By constructing a novel concept called Coverage, which is
highly correlated to the query accuracy, we are able to form a rate-coverage
model to translate the original problem into an optimization problem that can
be resolved by dynamic programming. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that uses joint audio-video fingerprint ACR technology for media
retrieval with a theoretical problem formulation. Experimental results indicate
that compared to reference algorithms, the proposed method has up to 25% query
accuracy improvement while using 60% overall bit-rates, and 25% bit-rate
reduction while achieving 85% accuracy, and it significantly outperforms the
solution with single audio or video source fingerprint.

 <dc:description>  User engagement modeling for manipulating actions in vision-based interfaces
is one of the most important case studies of user mental state detection. In a
Virtual Reality environment that employs camera sensors to recognize human
activities, we have to know when user intends to perform an action and when
not. Without a proper algorithm for recognizing engagement status, any kind of
activities could be interpreted as manipulating actions, called &quot;Midas Touch&quot;
problem. Baseline approach for solving this problem is activating gesture
recognition system using some focus gestures such as waiving or raising hand.
However, a desirable natural user interface should be able to understand user's
mental status automatically. In this paper, a novel multi-modal model for
engagement detection, DAIA, is presented. using DAIA, the spectrum of mental
status for performing an action is quantized in a finite number of engagement
states. For this purpose, a Finite State Transducer (FST) is designed. This
engagement framework shows how to integrate multi-modal information from user
biometric data streams such as 2D and 3D imaging. FST is employed to make the
state transition smoothly using combination of several boolean expressions. Our
FST true detection rate is 92.3% in total for four different states. Results
also show FST can segment user hand gestures more robustly.

 <dc:description>  Airborne acquisition and on-road mobile mapping provide complementary 3D
information of an urban landscape: the former acquires roof structures, ground,
and vegetation at a large scale, but lacks the facade and street-side details,
while the latter is incomplete for higher floors and often totally misses out
on pedestrian-only areas or undriven districts. In this work, we introduce an
approach that efficiently unifies a detailed street-side Structure-from-Motion
(SfM) or Multi-View Stereo (MVS) point cloud and a coarser but more complete
point cloud from airborne acquisition in a joint surface mesh. We propose a
point cloud blending and a volumetric fusion based on ray casting across a 3D
tetrahedralization (3DT), extended with data reduction techniques to handle
large datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to adopt a 3DT
approach for airborne/street-side data fusion. Our pipeline exploits typical
characteristics of airborne and ground data, and produces a seamless,
watertight mesh that is both complete and detailed. Experiments on 3D urban
data from multiple sources and different data densities show the effectiveness
and benefits of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Significant effort has been made to understand user motivation and to elicit

i.e., designing incentives that can purposefully motivate users, is still an
open question and remains one of the key challenges of crowdsourcing
initiatives. In this work in progress, we propose a general and systematic
incentive engineering framework that system designers can use to implement
appropriate incentives in order to effect desirable user behaviours.

 <dc:description>  Identifying emerging influential or popular node/item in future on network is
a current interest of the researchers. Most of previous works focus on
identifying leaders in time evolving networks on the basis of network structure
or node's activity separate way. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid model
which considers both, node's structural centrality and recent activity of nodes
together. We consider that the node is active when it is receiving more links
in a given recent time window, rather than in the whole past life of the node.
Furthermore our model is flexible to implement structural rank such as PageRank
and webpage click information as activity of the node. For testing the
performance of our model, we adopt the PageRank algorithm and linear
preferential attachment based model as the baseline methods. Experiments on
three real data sets (i.e Movielens, Netflix and Facebook wall post data set),
we found that our model shows better performance in terms of finding the
emerging influential nodes that were not popular in past.

inverse iteration) for computing the maximal eigenpair of a class of real
matrices. The initials not only avoid the collapse of the algorithm but are
also unexpectedly efficient. The initials presented here are based on our
analytic estimates of the maximal eigenvalue and a mimic of its eigenvector for
many years of accumulation in the study of stochastic stability speed. In
parallel, the same problem for computing the next to the maximal eigenpair is
also studied.

 <dc:description>  There has been significant recent interest towards achieving highly efficient
deep neural network architectures. A promising paradigm for achieving this is
the concept of evolutionary deep intelligence, which attempts to mimic
biological evolution processes to synthesize highly-efficient deep neural
networks over successive generations. An important aspect of evolutionary deep
intelligence is the genetic encoding scheme used to mimic heredity, which can
have a significant impact on the quality of offspring deep neural networks.
Motivated by the neurobiological phenomenon of synaptic clustering, we
introduce a new genetic encoding scheme where synaptic probability is driven
towards the formation of a highly sparse set of synaptic clusters. Experimental
results for the task of image classification demonstrated that the synthesized
offspring networks using this synaptic cluster-driven genetic encoding scheme
can achieve state-of-the-art performance while having network architectures
that are not only significantly more efficient (with a ~125-fold decrease in
synapses for MNIST) compared to the original ancestor network, but also
tailored for GPU-accelerated machine learning applications.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating a Fourier-sparse signal from noisy
samples, where the sampling is done over some interval $[0, T]$ and the
frequencies can be &quot;off-grid&quot;. Previous methods for this problem required the
gap between frequencies to be above 1/T, the threshold required to robustly
identify individual frequencies. We show the frequency gap is not necessary to
estimate the signal as a whole: for arbitrary $k$-Fourier-sparse signals under
$\ell_2$ bounded noise, we show how to estimate the signal with a constant
factor growth of the noise and sample complexity polynomial in $k$ and
logarithmic in the bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio.
  As a special case, we get an algorithm to interpolate degree $d$ polynomials
from noisy measurements, using $O(d)$ samples and increasing the noise by a
constant factor in $\ell_2$.

fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN to induce an object specific channel (OSC) and
systematically identifying it for the human face object has been developed.
Based on the basic OSC features, we introduce a multi-resolution approach to
constructing robust face heatmaps for fast face detection in unconstrained
settings. We show that multi-resolution OSC can be used to develop state of the
art face detectors which have the advantage of being simple and compact.

 <dc:description>  Although commercial and open-source software exist to reconstruct a static
object from a sequence recorded with an RGB-D sensor, there is a lack of tools
that build rigged models of articulated objects that deform realistically and
can be used for tracking or animation. In this work, we fill this gap and
propose a method that creates a fully rigged model of an articulated object
from depth data of a single sensor. To this end, we combine deformable mesh
tracking, motion segmentation based on spectral clustering and skeletonization
based on mean curvature flow. The fully rigged model then consists of a
watertight mesh, embedded skeleton, and skinning weights.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach to finding the $k$-sink on dynamic path networks
with general edge capacities. Our first algorithm runs in $O(n \log n + k^2
\log^4 n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of vertices on the given path, and our
second algorithm runs in $O(n \log^3 n)$ time. Together, they improve upon the
previously most efficient $O(kn \log^2 n)$ time algorithm due to Arumugam et
al. for all values of $k$. In the case where all the edges have the same
capacity, we again present two algorithms that run in $O(n + k^2 \log^2n)$ time
and $O(n \log n)$ time, respectively, and they together improve upon the
previously best $O(kn)$ time algorithm due to Higashikawa et al. for all values
of $k$.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Parallel Transport Control Protocol (TCP) has been used to effectively
utilize bandwidth for data intensive applications over high Bandwidth-Delay
Product (BDP) networks. On the other hand, it has been argued that, a
single-based TCP connection with proper modification such as HSTCP can emulate
and capture the robustness of parallel TCP and can well replace it. In this
work a Comparison between Single-Based and the proposed parallel TCP has been
conducted to show the differences in their performance measurements such as
throughput performance and throughput ratio, as well as the link sharing
Fairness also has been observed to show the impact of using the proposed
Parallel TCP on the existing Single-Based TCP connections. The experiment
results show that, single-based TCP cannot overcome Parallel TCP especially in
heterogeneous networks where the packet losses are common. Furthermore, the
proposed parallel TCP does not affect TCP fairness which makes parallel TCP
highly recommended to effectively utilize bandwidth for data intensive
applications.

 <dc:description>  Image deconvolution is still to be a challenging ill-posed problem for
recovering a clear image from a given blurry image, when the point spread
function is known. Although competitive deconvolution methods are numerically
impressive and approach theoretical limits, they are becoming more complex,
making analysis, and implementation difficult. Furthermore, accurate estimation
of the regularization parameter is not easy for successfully solving image
deconvolution problems. In this paper, we develop an effective approach for
image restoration based on one explicit image filter - guided filter. By
applying the decouple of denoising and deblurring techniques to the
deconvolution model, we reduce the optimization complexity and achieve a simple
but effective algorithm to automatically compute the parameter in each
iteration, which is based on Morozov's discrepancy principle. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms many
state-of-the-art deconvolution methods in terms of both ISNR and visual
quality.

 <dc:description>  In the early stages of designing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the look
(appearance) can be easily presented by sketching, but the feel (interactive
behaviors) cannot, and often requires an accompanying description of how it
works (Myers et al. 2008). We propose to use crowdsourcing to augment early
sketches with interactive behaviors generated, used, and reused by collective
&quot;wizards-of-oz&quot; as opposed to a single wizard as in prior work (Davis et al.
2007). This demo presents an extension of Apparition (Lasecki et al. 2015), a
crowd-powered prototyping tool that allows end users to create functional GUIs
using speech and sketch. In Apparition, crowd workers collaborate in real-time
on a shared canvas to refine the user-requested sketch interactively, and with
the assistance of the end users. Our demo extends this functionality to let
crowd workers &quot;demonstrate&quot; the canvas changes that are needed for a behavior
and refine their demonstrations to improve the fidelity of interactive
behaviors. The system then lets workers &quot;remix&quot; these behaviors to make
creating future behaviors more efficient.

 <dc:description>  A Delta-Sigma modulator that is often utilized to convert analog signals into
digital signals can be modeled as a static uniform quantizer with an error
feedback filter. In this paper, we present a rate-distortion analysis of
quantizers with error feedback including the Delta-Sigma modulators, assuming
that the error owing to overloading in the static quantizer is negligible. We
demonstrate that the amplitude response of the optimal error feedback filter
that minimizes the mean squared quantization error can be parameterized by one
parameter. This parameterization enables us to determine the optimal error
feedback filter numerically. The relationship between the number of bits used
for the quantization and the achievable mean squared error can be obtained
using the optimal error feedback filter. This clarifies the rate-distortion
property of quantizers with error feedback. Then, ideal optimal error feedback
filters are approximated by practical filters using the Yule-Walker method and
the linear matrix inequality-based method. Numerical examples are provided for
demonstrating our analysis and synthesis.

 <dc:description>  A Learning Model Predictive Controller (LMPC) for iterative tasks is
presented. The controller is reference-free and is able to improve its
performance by learning from previous iterations. A safe set and a terminal
cost function are used in order to guarantee recursive feasibility and
non-increasing performance at each iteration. The paper presents the control
design approach, and shows how to recursively construct terminal set and
terminal cost from state and input trajectories of previous iterations.
Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control logic.

 <dc:description>  Thumbnails play such an important role in online videos. As the most
representative snapshot, they capture the essence of a video and provide the
first impression to the viewers; ultimately, a great thumbnail makes a video
more attractive to click and watch. We present an automatic thumbnail selection
system that exploits two important characteristics commonly associated with
meaningful and attractive thumbnails: high relevance to video content and
superior visual aesthetic quality. Our system selects attractive thumbnails by
analyzing various visual quality and aesthetic metrics of video frames, and
performs a clustering analysis to determine the relevance to video content,
thus making the resulting thumbnails more representative of the video. On the
task of predicting thumbnails chosen by professional video editors, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our system against six baseline methods, using
a real-world dataset of 1,118 videos collected from Yahoo Screen. In addition,
we study what makes a frame a good thumbnail by analyzing the statistical
relationship between thumbnail frames and non-thumbnail frames in terms of
various image quality features. Our study suggests that the selection of a good
thumbnail is highly correlated with objective visual quality metrics, such as
the frame texture and sharpness, implying the possibility of building an
automatic thumbnail selection system based on visual aesthetics.

 <dc:description>  RC4 can be made more secured if an additional RC4-like Post-KSA Random
Shuffing (PKRS) process is introduced between KSA and PRGA. It can also be made
significantly faster if RC4 bytes are processed in a FPGA embedded system using
multiple coprocessors functioning in parallel. The PKRS process is tuned to
form as many S-boxes as required by particular design architectures involving
multiple coprocessors, each one undertaking byte-by-byte processing. Following
a ecent idea [1] [2] the speed of execution of each processor is also enhanced
by another fold if the byte-by-byte processing is replaced by a scheme of
processing two consecutive bytes together. Adopting some new innovative
concepts, three hardware design architectures are proposed in a suitable FPGA
embedded system involving 1, 2 and 4 coprocessors functioning in parallel and a
study is made on accelerating RC4 by processing bytes in byte-by-byte mode
achieving throughputs from 1-byte-in-1-clock to 4-bytes-in-1-clock. The
hardware designs are appropriately upgraded to accelerate RC4 further by
processing 2 onsecutive RC4 bytes together and it has been possible to achieve
a maximum throughput of 8-bytes per clock in Xilinx Virtex-5 LX110t FPGA [3]
architecture followed by secured data communication between two FPGA boards.

 <dc:description>  Providing opinions through labeling of images, tweets, etc. have drawn
immense interest in crowdsourcing markets. This invokes a major challenge of
aggregating multiple opinions received from different crowd workers for
deriving the final judgment. Generally, opinion aggregation models deal with
independent opinions, which are given unanimously and are not visible to all.
However, in many real-life cases, it is required to make the opinions public as
soon as they are received. This makes the opinions dependent and might
incorporate some bias. In this paper, we address a novel problem, hereafter
denoted as dependent judgment analysis, and discuss the requirements for
developing an appropriate model to deal with this problem. The challenge
remains to be improving the consensus by revealing true opinions.

 <dc:description>  At present many blind assistive systems have been implemented but there is no
such kind of good system to navigate a blind person and also to track the
movement of a blind person and rescue him/her if he/she is lost. In this paper,
we have presented a blind assistive and tracking embedded system. In this
system the blind person is navigated through a spectacle interfaced with an
android application. The blind person is guided through Bengali/English voice
commands generated by the application according to the obstacle position. Using
voice command a blind person can establish voice call to a predefined number
without touching the phone just by pressing the headset button. The blind
assistive application gets the latitude and longitude using GPS and then sends
them to a server. The movement of the blind person is tracked through another
android application that points out the current position in Google map. We took
distances from several surfaces like concrete and tiles floor in our experiment
where the error rate is 5%.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing enables clients with limited computational power to
economically outsource their large scale computations to a public cloud with
huge computational power. Cloud has the massive storage, computational power
and software which can be used by clients for reducing their computational
overhead and storage limitation. But in case of outsourcing, privacy of
client's confidential data must be maintained. We have designed a protocol for
outsourcing large scale Eigen value problem to a malicious cloud which provides
input/output data security, result verifiability and client's efficiency. As
the direct computation method to find all eigenvectors is computationally
expensive for large dimensionality, we have used power iterative method for
finding the largest Eigen value and the corresponding Eigen vector of a matrix.
For protecting the privacy, some transformations are applied to the input
matrix to get encrypted matrix which is sent to the cloud and then decrypting
the result that is returned from the cloud for getting the correct solution of
Eigen value problem. We have also proposed result verification mechanism for
detecting robust cheating and provided theoretical analysis and experimental
result that describes high-efficiency, correctness, security and robust
cheating resistance of the proposed protocol.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a logo classification system based on the appearance of logo
images is proposed. The proposed classification system makes use of global
characteristics of logo images for classification. Color, texture, and shape of
a logo wholly describe the global characteristics of logo images. The various
combinations of these characteristics are used for classification. The
combination contains only with single feature or with fusion of two features or
fusion of all three features considered at a time respectively. Further, the
system categorizes the logo image into: a logo image with fully text or with
fully symbols or containing both symbols and texts.. The K-Nearest Neighbour
(K-NN) classifier is used for classification. Due to the lack of color logo
image dataset in the literature, the same is created consisting 5044 color logo
images. Finally, the performance of the classification system is evaluated
through accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure computed from the confusion
matrix. The experimental results show that the most promising results are
obtained for fusion of features.

 <dc:description>  Information retrieval (IR) and recommender systems (RS) have been employed
for addressing search tasks executed during literature review and the overall
scholarly communication lifecycle. Majority of the studies have concentrated on
algorithm design for improving the accuracy and usefulness of these systems.
Contextual elements related to the scholarly tasks have been largely ignored.
In this paper, we propose a framework called the Scientific Paper Recommender
and Retrieval Framework (SPRRF) that combines aspects of user role modeling and
user-interface features with IR/RS components. The framework is based on eight
emergent themes identified from participants feedback in a user evaluation
study conducted with a prototype assistive system. 119 researchers participated
in the study for evaluating the prototype system that provides recommendations
for two literature review and one manuscript writing tasks. This holistic
framework is meant to guide future studies in this area.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a multi-layer market for vehicle-to-grid energy
trading. In the macro layer, we consider a double auction mechanism, under
which the utility company act as an auctioneer and energy buyers and sellers
interact. This double auction mechanism is strategy-proof and converges
asymptotically. In the micro layer, the aggregators, which are the sellers in
the macro layer, are paid with commissions to sell the energy of plug-in hybrid
electric vehicles (PHEVs) and to maximize their utilities. We analyze the
interaction between the macro and micro layers and study some simplified cases.
Depending on the elasticity of supply and demand, the utility is analyzed under
different scenarios. Simulation results show that our approach can
significantly increase the utility of PHEVs.

 <dc:title>Coexistence in 5G: Analysis of Cross-Interference between OFDM/OQAM and

 <dc:description>  To optimize the use of the spectrum, it is expected that the next generation
of wireless networks (5G) will enable coexistence of newly introduced services
with legacy cellular networks. These new services, like Device-To-Device (D2D)
communication, should require limited synchronization with the legacy cell to
limit the amount of signaling overhead in the network. However, it is known
that Cyclic Prefix-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) used in
Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) is not fit for asynchronous environments.
This has motivated the search for a new waveform, able to enhance coexistence
with CP-OFDM. Namely, it has been widely suggested that new devices could use
OFDM/Offset-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OFDM/OQAM) to reduce the
interference they inject to legacy cellular users. However, values of
interference are usually measured at the input antenna of the receiver, based
on the PSD of the interfering signal. We showed in previous works that this
measurement is not representative of the actual interference that is seen after
the demodulation operations. Building on this finding, we provide in this paper
the first exact closed forms of cross-interference between OFDM/OQAM and
CP-OFDM users. Our results prove that using OFDM/OQAM only marginally reduces
interference to legacy users, in contradiction with many results in the
literature.

 <dc:description>  A coexistence scenario between filter bank (FB) based waveforms and legacy
Cyclic Prefix-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) is studied.
It is shown that studies available on that matter use a wrong metric to rate
the interference between the coexisting systems. Specifically, it is shown that
even well spectrally localized FB waveforms interfere at a high level with
incumbent CP-OFDM receivers. The presented results invalidate a number of
studies in the literature, which stated that FB based waveforms could be very
efficiently used to insert communications in parts of spectrum left free by
incumbent legacy CP-OFDM users.

 <dc:title>Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network Models for Joint Intent

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Attention-based encoder-decoder neural network models have recently shown
promising results in machine translation and speech recognition. In this work,
we propose an attention-based neural network model for joint intent detection
and slot filling, both of which are critical steps for many speech
understanding and dialog systems. Unlike in machine translation and speech
recognition, alignment is explicit in slot filling. We explore different
strategies in incorporating this alignment information to the encoder-decoder
framework. Learning from the attention mechanism in encoder-decoder model, we
further propose introducing attention to the alignment-based RNN models. Such
attentions provide additional information to the intent classification and slot
label prediction. Our independent task models achieve state-of-the-art intent
detection error rate and slot filling F1 score on the benchmark ATIS task. Our
joint training model further obtains 0.56% absolute (23.8% relative) error
reduction on intent detection and 0.23% absolute gain on slot filling over the
independent task models.

 <dc:description>  Ties between individuals on a social network can represent different
dimensions of interactions, and the spreading of information and innovations on
these networks could potentially be driven by some dimensions more than by
others. In this paper we investigate this issue by studying the diffusion of
microfinance within rural India villages and accounting for the whole
multilayer structure of the underlying social networks. We define a new measure
of node centrality, diffusion versatility, and show that this is a better
predictor of microfinance participation rate than previously introduced
measures defined on aggregated single-layer social networks. Moreover, we
untangle the role played by each social dimension and find that the most
prominent role is played by the nodes that are central on layers concerned with
trust, shedding new light on the key triggers of the diffusion of microfinance.

 <dc:description>  Predictive coding (PDC) has recently attracted attention in the neuroscience
and computing community as a candidate unifying paradigm for neuronal studies
and artificial neural network implementations particularly targeted at
unsupervised learning systems. The Mismatch Negativity (MMN) has also recently
been studied in relation to PC and found to be a useful ingredient in neural
predictive coding systems. Backed by the behavior of living organisms, such
networks are particularly useful in forming spatio-temporal transitions and
invariant representations of the input world. However, most neural systems
still do not account for large number of synapses even though this has been
shown by a few machine learning researchers as an effective and very important
component of any neural system if such a system is to behave properly. Our
major point here is that PDC systems with the MMN effect in addition to a large
number of synapses can greatly improve any neural learning system's performance
and ability to make decisions in the machine world. In this paper, we propose a
novel bio-mimetic computational intelligence algorithm -- the Deviant Learning
Algorithm, inspired by these key ideas and functional properties of recent
brain-cognitive discoveries and theories. We also show by numerical experiments
guided by theoretical insights, how our invented bio-mimetic algorithm can
achieve competitive predictions even with very small problem specific data.

 <dc:description>  Prior work has shown that multibiometric systems are vulnerable to
presentation attacks, assuming that their matching score distribution is
identical to that of genuine users, without fabricating any fake trait. We have
recently shown that this assumption is not representative of current
fingerprint and face presentation attacks, leading one to overestimate the
vulnerability of multibiometric systems, and to design less effective fusion
rules. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a statistical
meta-model of face and fingerprint presentation attacks that characterizes a
wider family of fake score distributions, including distributions of known and,
potentially, unknown attacks. This allows us to perform a thorough security
evaluation of multibiometric systems against presentation attacks, quantifying
how their vulnerability may vary also under attacks that are different from
those considered during design, through an uncertainty analysis. We empirically
show that our approach can reliably predict the performance of multibiometric
systems even under never-before-seen face and fingerprint presentation attacks,
and that the secure fusion rules designed using our approach can exhibit an
improved trade-off between the performance in the absence and in the presence
of attack. We finally argue that our method can be extended to other biometrics
besides faces and fingerprints.

 <dc:description>  Speaker intent detection and semantic slot filling are two critical tasks in
spoken language understanding (SLU) for dialogue systems. In this paper, we
describe a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that jointly performs intent
detection, slot filling, and language modeling. The neural network model keeps
updating the intent estimation as word in the transcribed utterance arrives and
uses it as contextual features in the joint model. Evaluation of the language
model and online SLU model is made on the ATIS benchmarking data set. On
language modeling task, our joint model achieves 11.8% relative reduction on
perplexity comparing to the independent training language model. On SLU tasks,
our joint model outperforms the independent task training model by 22.3% on
intent detection error rate, with slight degradation on slot filling F1 score.
The joint model also shows advantageous performance in the realistic ASR
settings with noisy speech input.

 <dc:description>  We attempt to identify the different node hubs of a road network using
PageRank for preparation for possible random terrorist attacks. The robustness
of a road network against such attack is crucial to be studied because it may
cripple its connectivity by simply shutting down these hubs. We show the
important hubs in a road network based on network structure and propose a model
for robustness analysis. By identifying important hubs in a road network,
possible preparation schemes may be done earlier to mitigate random terrorist
attacks, including defense reinforcement and transportation security. A case
study of the Metro Manila road network is also presented. The case study shows
that the most important hubs in the Metro Manila road network are near
airports, piers, major highways and expressways

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the Multi-Instance-Learning (MIL) problem when bag
labels are naturally represented as ordinal variables (Multi--Instance--Ordinal
Regression). Moreover, we consider the case where bags are temporal sequences
of ordinal instances. To model this, we propose the novel Multi-Instance
Dynamic Ordinal Random Fields (MI-DORF). In this model, we treat
instance-labels inside the bag as latent ordinal states. The MIL assumption is
modelled by incorporating a high-order cardinality potential relating bag and
instance-labels,into the energy function. We show the benefits of the proposed
approach on the task of weakly-supervised pain intensity estimation from the
UNBC Shoulder-Pain Database. In our experiments, the proposed approach
significantly outperforms alternative non-ordinal methods that either ignore
the MIL assumption, or do not model dynamic information in target data.

 <dc:title>Joint Alignment of Multiple Point Sets with Batch and Incremental

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of registering multiple point sets.
Solutions to this problem are often approximated by repeatedly solving for
pairwise registration, which results in an uneven treatment of the sets forming
a pair: a model set and a data set. The main drawback of this strategy is that
the model set may contain noise and outliers, which negatively affects the
estimation of the registration parameters. In contrast, the proposed
formulation treats all the point sets on an equal footing. Indeed, all the
points are drawn from a central Gaussian mixture, hence the registration is
cast into a clustering problem. We formally derive batch and incremental EM
algorithms that robustly estimate both the GMM parameters and the rotations and
translations that optimally align the sets. Moreover, the mixture's means play
the role of the registered set of points while the variances provide rich
information about the contribution of each component to the alignment. We
thoroughly test the proposed algorithms on simulated data and on challenging
real data collected with range sensors. We compare them with several
state-of-the-art algorithms, and we show their potential for surface
reconstruction from depth data.

 <dc:description>  Q-learning is a simple and powerful tool in solving dynamic problems where
environments are unknown. It uses a balance of exploration and exploitation to
find an optimal solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose using four
basic emotions: joy, sadness, fear, and anger to influence a Qlearning agent.
Simulations show that the proposed affective agent requires lesser number of
steps to find the optimal path. We found when affective agent finds the optimal
path, the ratio between exploration to exploitation gradually decreases,
indicating lower total step count in the long run

 <dc:description>  Open Trip Planner was identified as the most promising open source
multi-modal trip planning software. Open Street Map, which provides mapping
data to Open Trip Planner, is one of the most well-known open source
international repository of geographic data. General Transit Feed
Specification, which provides transportation data to Open Trip Planner, has
been the standard for describing transit systems and platform for numerous
applications. Together, when used to implement an instance of Open Trip
Planner, these software has been helping in traffic decongestion all over the
world by assisting commuters to shift from using private transportation modes
to public ones. Their potential however goes beyond providing multi-modal
public transportation routes. This paper aims to first discuss the researchers'
experience in implementing a public transportation route planner for the
purpose of traffic decongestion.The researchers would examine the prospective
of using the system for disaster preparedness and recovery and concrete ways on
how to realize them.

 <dc:description>  Leading HPC systems achieve their status through use of highly parallel
devices such as NVIDIA GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi many-core CPUs. The concept of
performance portability across such architectures, as well as traditional CPUs,
is vital for the application programmer. In this paper we describe targetDP, a
lightweight abstraction layer which allows grid-based applications to target
data parallel hardware in a platform agnostic manner. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our pragmatic approach by presenting performance results for a
complex fluid application (with which the model was co-designed), plus a
separate lattice QCD particle physics code. For each application, a single
source code base is seen to achieve portable performance, as assessed within
the context of the Roofline model. TargetDP can be combined with MPI to allow
use on systems containing multiple nodes: we demonstrate this through provision
of scaling results on traditional and GPU-accelerated large scale
supercomputers.

 <dc:description>  In presence of multiple clustering solutions for the same dataset, a
clustering ensemble approach aims to yield a single clustering of the dataset
by achieving a consensus among the input clustering solutions. The goal of this
consensus is to improve the quality of clustering. It has been seen that there
are some image clustering tasks that cannot be easily solved by computer. But
if these images can be outsourced to the general people (crowd workers) to
group them based on some similar features, and opinions are collected from
them, then this task can be managed in an efficient manner and time effective
way. In this work, the power of crowd has been used to annotate the images so
that multiple clustering solutions can be obtained from them and thereafter a
Markov chain based ensemble method is introduced to make a consensus of
multiple clustering solutions.

 <dc:description>  There is a stage in the GPU computing pipeline where a grid of thread-blocks,
in \textit{parallel space}, is mapped onto the problem domain, in \textit{data
space}. Since the parallel space is restricted to a box type geometry, the
mapping approach is typically a $k$-dimensional bounding box (BB) that covers a
$p$-dimensional data space. Threads that fall inside the domain perform
computations while threads that fall outside are discarded at runtime. In this
work we study the case of mapping threads efficiently onto triangular domain
problems and propose a block-space linear map $\lambda(\omega)$, based on the
properties of the lower triangular matrix, that reduces the number of
unnnecessary threads from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Performance
results for global memory accesses show an improvement of up to $18\%$ with
respect to the \textit{bounding-box} approach, placing $\lambda(\omega)$ on
second place below the \textit{rectangular-box} approach and above the
\textit{recursive-partition} and \textit{upper-triangular} approaches. For
shared memory scenarios $\lambda(\omega)$ was the fastest approach achieving
$7\%$ of performance improvement while preserving thread locality. The results
obtained in this work make $\lambda(\omega)$ an interesting map for efficient
GPU computing on parallel problems that define a triangular domain with or
without neighborhood interactions. The extension to tetrahedral domains is
analyzed, with applications to triplet-interaction n-body applications.

 <dc:description>  Cyber-physical systems (CPS), which integrate algorithmic control with
physical processes, often consist of physically distributed components
communicating over a network. A malfunctioning or compromised component in such
a CPS can lead to costly consequences, especially in the context of public
infrastructure. In this short paper, we argue for the importance of
constructing invariants (or models) of the physical behaviour exhibited by CPS,
motivated by their applications to the control, monitoring, and attestation of
components. To achieve this despite the inherent complexity of CPS, we propose
a new technique for learning invariants that combines machine learning with
ideas from mutation testing. We present a preliminary study on a water
treatment system that suggests the efficacy of this approach, propose
strategies for establishing confidence in the correctness of invariants, then
summarise some research questions and the steps we are taking to investigate
them.

 <dc:description>  Starting from a generalization of the standard axioms for a monoid we present
a stepwise development of various, mutually equivalent foundational axiom
systems for category theory. Our axiom sets have been formalized in the
Isabelle/HOL interactive proof assistant, and this formalization utilizes a
semantically correct embedding of free logic in classical higher-order logic.
The modeling and formal analysis of our axiom sets has been significantly
supported by series of experiments with automated reasoning tools integrated
with Isabelle/HOL. We also address the relation of our axiom systems to
alternative proposals from the literature, including an axiom set proposed by
Freyd and Scedrov for which we reveal a technical issue (when encoded in free
logic where free variables range over defined and undefined objects): either
all operations, e.g. morphism composition, are total or their axiom system is
inconsistent. The repair for this problem is quite straightforward, however.

facilitate a number of traditional image processing and computer vision tasks.
A crucial ingredient in such endeavors is accurate depth recovery. We present a
novel framework that allows the recovery of a high quality continuous depth map
from light field data. To this end we propose a generative model of a light
field that is fully parametrized by its corresponding depth map. The model
allows for the integration of powerful regularization techniques such as a
non-local means prior, facilitating accurate depth map estimation.

 <dc:description>  In spring 2015, the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (Leibniz-Rechenzentrum,
LRZ), installed their new Peta-Scale System SuperMUC Phase2. Selected users
were invited for a 28 day extreme scale-out block operation during which they
were allowed to use the full system for their applications. The following
projects participated in the extreme scale-out workshop: BQCD (Quantum
Physics), SeisSol (Geophysics, Seismics), GPI-2/GASPI (Toolkit for HPC),
Seven-League Hydro (Astrophysics), ILBDC (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Iphigenie
(Molecular Dynamic), FLASH (Astrophysics), GADGET (Cosmological Dynamics), PSC
(Plasma Physics), waLBerla (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Musubi (Lattice Boltzmann
CFD), Vertex3D (Stellar Astrophysics), CIAO (Combustion CFD), and LS1-Mardyn
(Material Science). The projects were allowed to use the machine exclusively
during the 28 day period, which corresponds to a total of 63.4 million
core-hours, of which 43.8 million core-hours were used by the applications,
resulting in a utilization of 69%. The top 3 users were using 15.2, 6.4, and
4.7 million core-hours, respectively.

 <dc:description>  We study the task of maximizing rewards from recommending items (actions) to
users sequentially interacting with a recommender system. Users are modeled as
latent mixtures of C many representative user classes, where each class
specifies a mean reward profile across actions. Both the user features (mixture
distribution over classes) and the item features (mean reward vector per class)
are unknown a priori. The user identity is the only contextual information
available to the learner while interacting. This induces a low-rank structure
on the matrix of expected rewards r a,b from recommending item a to user b. The
problem reduces to the well-known linear bandit when either user or item-side
features are perfectly known. In the setting where each user, with its
stochastically sampled taste profile, interacts only for a small number of
sessions, we develop a bandit algorithm for the two-sided uncertainty. It
combines the Robust Tensor Power Method of Anandkumar et al. (2014b) with the
OFUL linear bandit algorithm of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011). We provide the
first rigorous regret analysis of this combination, showing that its regret
after T user interactions is $\tilde O(C\sqrt{BT})$, with B the number of
users. An ingredient towards this result is a novel robustness property of
OFUL, of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  An upper dominating set in a graph is a minimal (with respect to set
inclusion) dominating set of maximum cardinality. The problem of finding an
upper dominating set is generally NP-hard. We study the complexity of this
problem in classes of graphs defined by finitely many forbidden induced
subgraphs and conjecture that the problem admits a dichotomy in this family,
i.e. it is either NP-hard or polynomial-time solvable for each class in the
family. A helpful tool to study the complexity of an algorithmic problem on
finitely defined classes of graphs is the notion of boundary classes. However,
none of such classes has been identified so far for the upper dominating set
problem. In the present paper, we discover the first boundary class for this
problem and prove the dichotomy for classes defined by a single forbidden
induced subgraph.

 <dc:title>Faster O(|V|^2|E|W)-Time Energy Algorithms for Optimal Strategy

 <dc:creator>Comin, Carlo</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rizzi, Romeo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This study strengthens the links between Mean Payoff Games (\MPG{s}) and
Energy Games (EG{s}). Firstly, we offer a faster $O(|V|^2|E|W)$
pseudo-polynomial time and $\Theta(|V|+|E|)$ space deterministic algorithm for
solving the Value Problem and Optimal Strategy Synthesis in \MPG{s}. This
improves the best previously known estimates on the pseudo-polynomial time
complexity to: \[ O(|E|\log |V|) + \Theta\Big(\sum_{v\in
V}\texttt{deg}_{\Gamma}(v)\cdot\ell_{\Gamma}(v)\Big) = O(|V|^2|E|W), \] where
$\ell_{\Gamma}(v)$ counts the number of times that a certain energy-lifting
operator $\delta(\cdot, v)$ is applied to any $v\in V$, along a certain
sequence of Value-Iterations on reweighted \EG{s}; and
$\texttt{deg}_{\Gamma}(v)$ is the degree of $v$. This improves significantly
over a previously known pseudo-polynomial time estimate, i.e.
$\Theta\big(|V|^2|E|W + \sum_{v\in
V}\texttt{deg}_{\Gamma}(v)\cdot\ell_{\Gamma}(v)\big)$ \citep{CR15, CR16}, as
the pseudo-polynomiality is now confined to depend solely on $\ell_\Gamma$.
Secondly, we further explore on the relationship between Optimal Positional
Strategies (OPSs) in \MPG{s} and Small Energy-Progress Measures (SEPMs) in
reweighted \EG{s}. It is observed that the space of all OPSs,
$\texttt{opt}_{\Gamma}\Sigma^M_0$, admits a unique complete decomposition in
terms of extremal-SEPM{s} in reweighted EG{s}. This points out what we called
the &quot;Energy-Lattice $\mathcal{X}^*_{\Gamma}$ associated to
$\texttt{opt}_{\Gamma}\Sigma^M_0$&quot;. Finally, it is offered a pseudo-polynomial
total-time recursive procedure for enumerating (w/o repetitions) all the
elements of $\mathcal{X}^*_{\Gamma}$, and for computing the corresponding
partitioning of $\texttt{opt}_{\Gamma}\Sigma^M_0$.

 <dc:description>  Motion estimation across low-resolution frames and the reconstruction of
high-resolution images are two coupled subproblems of multi-frame
super-resolution. This paper introduces a new joint optimization approach for
motion estimation and image reconstruction to address this interdependence. Our
method is formulated via non-linear least squares optimization and combines two
principles of robust super-resolution. First, to enhance the robustness of the
joint estimation, we propose a confidence-aware energy minimization framework
augmented with sparse regularization. Second, we develop a tailor-made
Levenberg-Marquardt iteration scheme to jointly estimate motion parameters and
the high-resolution image along with the corresponding model confidence
parameters. Our experiments on simulated and real images confirm that the
proposed approach outperforms decoupled motion estimation and image
reconstruction as well as related state-of-the-art joint estimation algorithms.

 <dc:description>  A new work has been proposed in this paper in order to overcome one of the
main drawbacks that found in the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM)
systems, namely Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). Furthermore, this work will
be compared with a previously published work that uses the neural network (NN)
as a solution to remedy this deficiency. The proposed work could be considered
as a special averaging technique (SAT), which consists of wavelet
transformation in its first stage, a globally statistical adaptive detecting
algorithm as a second stage; and in the third stage it replaces the affected
peaks by making use of moving average filter process. In the NN work, the
learning process makes use of a previously published work that is based on
three linear coding techniques. In order to check the proposed work validity, a
MATLAB simulation has been run and has two main variables to compare with;
namely BER and CCDF curves. This is true under the same bandwidth occupancy and
channel characteristics. Two types of tested data have been used; randomly
generated data and a practical data that have been extracted from a funded
project entitled by ECEM. From the achieved simulation results, the work that
is based on SAT shows promising results in reducing the PAPR effect reached up
to 80% over the work in the literature and our previously published work. This
means that this work gives an extra reduction up to 15% of our previously
published work. However, this achievement will be under the cost of complexity.
This penalty could be optimized by imposing the NN to the SAT work in order to
enhance the wireless systems performance.

 <dc:description>  Public scientists (scientists only from now onwards), understood as a member
of the teaching and/or research staff of a public university or a public
research organization (including humanities and social sciences), benefit the
academic community, industry and other social collectives through teaching and
research. Active involvement of scientists in culture is part of the richness
of developed societies. Some voices in current debates on the evaluation of
societal impact and the role of universities towards social development are
claiming a refocus from a socioeconomic perspective to also including
sociocultural benefits from academiaIn this paper we will focus in one facet of
cultural engagement; writing literary fiction. We will narrow our general
objective to local activities, due to the interest in the engagement of
scientist on this geographic dimension. Do local publishers include the
literary work of scientists? Are works written by scientists more likely to be
local than works not written by scientists?

 <dc:title>Quantum one-way permutation over the finite field of two elements</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>de Castro, Alexandre</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In quantum cryptography, a one-way permutation is a bounded unitary operator
$U:\mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ that is easy
to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random
input. Levin [Probl. Inf. Transm., vol. 39 (1): 92-103 (2003)] has conjectured
that the unitary transformation $g(a,x)=(a,f(x)+ax)$, where $f$ is any
length-preserving function and $a,x \in GF_{{2}^{\|x\|}}$, is an
information-theoretically secure operator within a polynomial factor. Here, we
show that Levin's one-way permutation is provably secure because its output
values are four maximally entangled two-qubit states, and whose probability of
factoring them approaches zero faster than the multiplicative inverse of any
positive polynomial $poly(x)$ over the Boolean ring of all subsets of $x$. Our
results demonstrate through well-known theorems that existence of classical
one-way functions implies existence of a universal quantum one-way permutation
that cannot be inverted in subexponential time in the worst ca

 <dc:description>  The development of multicore architectures supporting parallel data
processing has led to a paradigm shift, which affects communication systems
significantly. This article provides a scalable parallel approach of an
iterative LDPC decoder, presented in a tutorial-based style. It is suitable for
decoding any irregular LDPC code without the limitation of the maximum node
degree, and it includes a parallel calculation of the syndrome. This is the
main difference from algorithms presented so far. The proposed approach can be
implemented in applications supporting massive parallel computing, such as GPU
or FPGA devices. The implementation of the LDPC decoder with the use the OpenCL
and CUDA frameworks is discussed and the performance evaluation is given at the
end of this contribution.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method for template matching in unconstrained
environments. Its essence is the Best-Buddies Similarity (BBS), a useful,
robust, and parameter-free similarity measure between two sets of points. BBS
is based on counting the number of Best-Buddies Pairs (BBPs)--pairs of points
in source and target sets, where each point is the nearest neighbor of the
other. BBS has several key features that make it robust against complex
geometric deformations and high levels of outliers, such as those arising from
background clutter and occlusions. We study these properties, provide a
statistical analysis that justifies them, and demonstrate the consistent
success of BBS on a challenging real-world dataset while using different types
of features.

 <dc:description>  Clinicians are expected to have up-to-date and broad knowledge of disease
treatment options for a patient. Online health knowledge resources contain a
wealth of information. However, because of the time investment needed to
disseminate and rank pertinent information, there is a need to summarize the
information in a more concise format. Our aim of the study is to provide
clinicians with a concise overview of popular treatments for a given disease
using information automatically computed from Medline abstracts. We analyzed
the treatments of two disorders - Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart
Failure. We calculated the precision, recall, and f-scores of our two ranking
methods to measure the accuracy of the results. For Atrial Fibrillation
disorder, maximum f-score for the New Treatments weighing method is 0.611,
which occurs at 60 treatments. For Congestive Heart Failure disorder, maximum
f-score for the New Treatments weighing method is 0.503, which occurs at 80
treatments.

 <dc:title>On the Existence of Weak One-Way Functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rass, Stefan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>68Q15, 94A60</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This note is an attempt to unconditionally prove the existence of weak one
way functions (OWF). Starting from a provably intractable decision problem
$L_D$ (whose existence is nonconstructively assured from the well-known
discrete time-hierarchy theorem from complexity theory), we construct another
intractable decision problem $L\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ that has its words
scattered across $\{0,1\}^\ell$ at a relative frequency $p(\ell)$, for which
upper and lower bounds can be worked out. The value $p(\ell)$ is computed from
the density of the language within $\{0,1\}^\ell$ divided by the total word
count $2^\ell$. It corresponds to the probability of retrieving a yes-instance
of a decision problem upon a uniformly random draw from $\{0,1\}^\ell$. The
trick to find a language with known bounds on $p(\ell)$ relies on switching
from $L_D$ to $L_0:=L_D\cap L'$, where $L'$ is an easy-to-decide language with
a known density across $\{0,1\}^*$. In defining $L'$ properly (and upon a
suitable G\&quot;odel numbering), the hardness of deciding $L_D\cap L'$ is inherited
from $L_D$, while its density is controlled by that of $L'$. The lower and
upper approximation of $p(\ell)$ then let us construct an explicit threshold
function (as in random graph theory) that can be used to efficiently and
intentionally sample yes- or no-instances of the decision problem (language)
$L_0$ (however, without any auxiliary information that could ease the decision
like a polynomial witness). In turn, this allows to construct a weak OWF that
encodes a bit string $w\in\{0,1\}^*$ by efficiently (in polynomial time)
emitting a sequence of randomly constructed intractable decision problems,
whose answers correspond to the preimage $w$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we proposed two different approaches, a rule-based approach
and a machine-learning based approach, to identify active heart failure cases
automatically by analyzing electronic health records (EHR). For the rule-based
approach, we extracted cardiovascular data elements from clinical notes and
matched patients to different colors according their heart failure condition by
using rules provided by experts in heart failure. It achieved 69.4% accuracy
and 0.729 F1-Score. For the machine learning approach, with bigram of clinical
notes as features, we tried four different models while SVM with linear kernel
achieved the best performance with 87.5% accuracy and 0.86 F1-Score. Also, from
the classification comparison between the four different models, we believe
that linear models fit better for this problem. Once we combine the
machine-learning and rule-based algorithms, we will enable hospital-wide
surveillance of active heart failure through increased accuracy and
interpretability of the outputs.

 <dc:description>  In the rendezvous problem, two parties with different labelings of the
vertices of a complete graph are trying to meet at some vertex at the same
time. It is well-known that if the parties have predetermined roles, then the
strategy where one of them waits at one vertex, while the other visits all $n$
vertices in random order is optimal, taking at most $n$ steps and averaging
about $n/2$. Anderson and Weber considered the symmetric rendezvous problem,
where both parties must use the same randomized strategy. They analyzed
strategies where the parties repeatedly play the optimal asymmetric strategy,
determining their role independently each time by a biased coin-flip. By tuning
the bias, Anderson and Weber achieved an expected meeting time of about $0.829
n$, which they conjectured to be asymptotically optimal.
  We change perspective slightly: instead of minimizing the expected meeting
time, we seek to maximize the probability of meeting within a specified time
$T$. The Anderson-Weber strategy, which fails with constant probability when
$T= \Theta(n)$, is not asymptotically optimal for large $T$ in this setting.
Specifically, we exhibit a symmetric strategy that succeeds with probability
$1-o(1)$ in $T=4n$ steps. This is tight: for any $\alpha &lt; 4$, any symmetric
strategy with $T = \alpha n$ fails with constant probability. Our strategy uses
a new combinatorial object that we dub a &quot;rendezvous code,&quot; which may be of
independent interest.
  When $T \le n$, we show that the probability of meeting within $T$ steps is
indeed asymptotically maximized by the Anderson-Weber strategy. Our results
imply new lower bounds, showing that the best symmetric strategy takes at least
$0.638 n$ steps in expectation. We also present some partial results for the
symmetric rendezvous problem on other vertex-transitive graphs.

this approach is the complete elimination of multiplications and replacing them
by less costly squarings. Our approach uses Logan's identity, which proposes to
replace the calculation of the product of two numbers on summing the squares
via the Binomial Theorem. Replacing multiplications by squarings implies
reducing power consumption as well as decreases hardware circuit complexity.

 <dc:description>  Rare diseases are very difficult to identify among large number of other
possible diagnoses. Better availability of patient data and improvement in
machine learning algorithms empower us to tackle this problem computationally.
In this paper, we target one such rare disease - cardiac amyloidosis. We aim to
automate the process of identifying potential cardiac amyloidosis patients with
the help of machine learning algorithms and also learn most predictive factors.
With the help of experienced cardiologists, we prepared a gold standard with 73
positive (cardiac amyloidosis) and 197 negative instances. We achieved high
average cross-validation F1 score of 0.98 using an ensemble machine learning
classifier. Some of the predictive variables were: Age and Diagnosis of cardiac
arrest, chest pain, congestive heart failure, hypertension, prim open angle
glaucoma, and shoulder arthritis. Further studies are needed to validate the
accuracy of the system across an entire health system and its generalizability
for other diseases.

 <dc:title>CRTS: A type system for representing clinical recommendations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Background: Clinical guidelines and recommendations are the driving wheels of
the evidence-based medicine (EBM) paradigm, but these are available primarily
as unstructured text and are generally highly heterogeneous in nature. This
significantly reduces the dissemination and automatic application of these
recommendations at the point of care. A comprehensive structured representation
of these recommendations is highly beneficial in this regard. Objective: The
objective of this paper to present Clinical Recommendation Type System (CRTS),
a common type system that can effectively represent a clinical recommendation
in a structured form. Methods: CRTS is built by analyzing 125 recommendations
and 195 research articles corresponding to 6 different diseases available from
UpToDate, a publicly available clinical knowledge system, and from the National
Guideline Clearinghouse, a public resource for evidence-based clinical practice
guidelines. Results: We show that CRTS not only covers the recommendations but
also is flexible to be extended to represent information from primary
literature. We also describe how our developed type system can be applied for
clinical decision support, medical knowledge summarization, and citation
retrieval. Conclusion: We showed that our proposed type system is precise and
comprehensive in representing a large sample of recommendations available for
various disorders. CRTS can now be used to build interoperable information
extraction systems that automatically extract clinical recommendations and
related data elements from clinical evidence resources, guidelines, systematic
reviews and primary publications.

 <dc:description>  To reduce the large amount of time spent screening, identifying, and
recruiting patients into clinical trials, we need prescreening systems that are
able to automate the data extraction and decision-making tasks that are
typically relegated to clinical research study coordinators. However, a major
obstacle is the vast amount of patient data available as unstructured free-form
text in electronic health records. Here we propose an information
extraction-based approach that first automatically converts unstructured text
into a structured form. The structured data are then compared against a list of
eligibility criteria using a rule-based system to determine which patients
qualify for enrollment in a heart failure clinical trial. We show that we can
achieve highly accurate results, with recall and precision values of 0.95 and
0.86, respectively. Our system allowed us to significantly reduce the time
needed for prescreening patients from a few weeks to a few minutes. Our
open-source information extraction modules are available for researchers and
could be tested and validated in other cardiovascular trials. An approach such
as the one we demonstrate here may decrease costs and expedite clinical trials,
and could enhance the reproducibility of trials across institutions and
populations.

 <dc:title>Direct Feedback Alignment Provides Learning in Deep Neural Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>N&#xf8;kland, Arild</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Artificial neural networks are most commonly trained with the
back-propagation algorithm, where the gradient for learning is provided by
back-propagating the error, layer by layer, from the output layer to the hidden
layers. A recently discovered method called feedback-alignment shows that the
weights used for propagating the error backward don't have to be symmetric with
the weights used for propagation the activation forward. In fact, random
feedback weights work evenly well, because the network learns how to make the
feedback useful. In this work, the feedback alignment principle is used for
training hidden layers more independently from the rest of the network, and
from a zero initial condition. The error is propagated through fixed random
feedback connections directly from the output layer to each hidden layer. This
simple method is able to achieve zero training error even in convolutional
networks and very deep networks, completely without error back-propagation. The
method is a step towards biologically plausible machine learning because the
error signal is almost local, and no symmetric or reciprocal weights are
required. Experiments show that the test performance on MNIST and CIFAR is
almost as good as those obtained with back-propagation for fully connected
networks. If combined with dropout, the method achieves 1.45% error on the
permutation invariant MNIST task.

 <dc:description>  Novel information retrieval methods to identify citations relevant to a
clinical topic can overcome the knowledge gap existing between the primary
literature (MEDLINE) and online clinical knowledge resources such as UpToDate.
Searching the MEDLINE database directly or with query expansion methods returns
a large number of citations that are not relevant to the query. The current
study presents a citation retrieval system that retrieves citations for
evidence-based clinical knowledge summarization. This approach combines query
expansion, concept-based screening algorithm, and concept-based vector
similarity. We also propose an information extraction framework for automated
concept (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Disease) extraction. We
evaluated our proposed system on all topics (as queries) available from
UpToDate for two diseases, heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AFib).
The system achieved an overall F-score of 41.2% on HF topics and 42.4% on AFib
topics on a gold standard of citations available in UpToDate. This is
significantly high when compared to a query-expansion based baseline (F-score
of 1.3% on HF and 2.2% on AFib) and a system that uses query expansion with
disease hyponyms and journal names, concept-based screening, and term-based
vector similarity system (F-score of 37.5% on HF and 39.5% on AFib). Evaluating
the system with top K relevant citations, where K is the number of citations in
the gold standard achieved a much higher overall F-score of 69.9% on HF topics
and 75.1% on AFib topics. In addition, the system retrieved up to 18 new
relevant citations per topic when tested on ten HF and six AFib clinical
topics.

associated with an underlying distribution. Amongst other properties, we (a)
obtain speed-ups over the best known quantum algorithms for identity testing,
equivalence testing and uniformity testing of probability distributions; (b)
study the power of these oracles for testing properties of boolean functions,
and obtain an algorithm for checking whether an $n$-input $m$-output boolean

 <dc:description>  Context awareness is increasingly gaining applicability in interactive
ubiquitous mobile computing systems. Each context-aware application has its own
set of behaviors to react to context modifications. This paper is concerned
with the context modeling and the development methodology for context-aware
systems. We proposed a rule-based approach and use the adaption tree to model
the adaption rule of context-aware systems. We illustrate this idea in an
arithmetic game application.

 <dc:description>  Currently, most of the online social networks (OSN) keep their data secret
and in centralized manner. Researchers are allowed to crawl the underlying
social graphs (and data) but with limited rates, leading to only partial views
of the true social graphs. To overcome this constraint, we may start from user
perspective, the contributors of the OSNs. More precisely, if users cautiously
collaborate with one another, they can use the very infrastructure of the OSNs
to exchange noisy friend lists with their neighbors in several rounds. In the
end, they can build local subgraphs, also called local views of the true social
graph. In this paper, we propose such protocols for the problem of
\textit{private link exchange} over social graphs.
  The problem is unique in the sense that the disseminated data over the links
are the links themselves. However, there exist fundamental questions about the
feasibility of this model. The first question is how to define simple and
effective privacy concepts for the link exchange processes. The second question
comes from the high volume of link lists in exchange which may increase
exponentially round after round. While storage and computation complexity may
be affordable for desktop PCs, communication costs are non-trivial. We address
both questions by a simple $(\alpha,\beta)$-exchange using Bloom filters.

 <dc:title>A Cross-layer Contention Based Synchronous MAC Protocol for Transmission
  Delay Reduction in Multi-Hop WSNs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently designed cross-layer contention based synchronous MAC protocols like
the PRMAC protocol, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) enable a node to
schedule multi-hop transmission of multiple data packets in a cycle. However,
these systems accommodate both the request-to-send data process and the
confirmation-to-send data process in the same data transmission scheduling
window (i.e. data window). This reduces the length of the multi-hop flow setup
in the data window. In a multi-hop scenario, this degrades both the packet
delivery ratio (PDR) and the end-to-end transmission delay (E2ETD). In this
paper, we propose a cross-layer contention based synchronous MAC protocol,
which accommodates the request-to-send data process in the data window and the
confirmation-to-send data process in the sleep window for increased efficiency.
We evaluate our proposed protocol through ns-2.35 simulations and compare its
performance with the PRMAC protocol. Results suggest that in multi-hop
scenario, proposed protocol outperforms PRMAC both in terms of the E2ETD and
the packet delivery ratio (PDR).

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to further explore the usefulness of the
two-dimensional complexity-entropy causality plane as a texture image
descriptor. A multiscale generalization is introduced in order to distinguish
between different roughness features of images at small and large spatial
scales. Numerically generated two-dimensional structures are initially
considered for illustrating basic concepts in a controlled framework. Then,
more realistic situations are studied. Obtained results allow us to confirm
that intrinsic spatial correlations of images are successfully unveiled by
implementing this multiscale symbolic information-theory approach.
Consequently, we conclude that the proposed representation space is a versatile
and practical tool for identifying, characterizing and discriminating image
textures.

 <dc:description>  The VIPAFLEET project consists in developing models and algorithms for man-
aging a fleet of Individual Public Autonomous Vehicles (VIPA). Hereby, we
consider a fleet of cars distributed at specified stations in an industrial
area to supply internal transportation, where the cars can be used in different
modes of circulation (tram mode, elevator mode, taxi mode). One goal is to
develop and implement suitable algorithms for each mode in order to satisfy all
the requests under an economic point of view by minimizing the total tour
length or the makespan. The innovative idea and challenge of the project is to
develop and install a dynamic fleet management system that allows the operator
to switch between the differ- ent modes within the different periods of the day
according to the dynamic transportation demands of the users. We model the
underlying online transportation system and propose an according fleet
management framework, to handle modes, demands and commands. We propose for
each mode appropriate online algorithms and evaluate their performance.

 <dc:description>  It is common for people to access multiple social networks, for example,
using phone, email, and social media. Together, the multi-layer social
interactions form a &quot;integrated social network.&quot; How can we extend well
developed knowledge about single-layer networks, including vertex centrality
and community structure, to such heterogeneous structures? In this paper, we
approach these challenges by proposing a principled framework of network
composition based on a unified dynamical process. Mathematically, we consider
the following abstract problem: Given multi-layer network data and additional
parameters for intra and inter-layer dynamics, construct a (single) weighted
network that best integrates the joint process. We use transformations of
dynamics to unify heterogeneous layers under a common dynamics. For inter-layer
compositions, we will consider several cases as the inter-layer dynamics plays
different roles in various social or technological networks. Empirically, we
provide examples to highlight the usefulness of this framework for network
analysis and network design.

 <dc:description>  A spoof attack, a subset of presentation attacks, is the use of an artificial
replica of a biometric in an attempt to circumvent a biometric sensor. Liveness
detection, or presentation attack detection, distinguishes between live and
fake biometric traits and is based on the principle that additional information
can be garnered above and beyond the data procured by a standard authentication
system to determine if a biometric measure is authentic. The goals for the
Liveness Detection (LivDet) competitions are to compare software-based
fingerprint liveness detection and artifact detection algorithms (Part 1), as
well as fingerprint systems which incorporate liveness detection or artifact
detection capabilities (Part 2), using a standardized testing protocol and
large quantities of spoof and live tests. The competitions are open to all
academic and industrial institutions which have a solution for either
softwarebased or system-based fingerprint liveness detection. The LivDet
competitions have been hosted in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015 and have shown
themselves to provide a crucial look at the current state of the art in
liveness detection schemes. There has been a noticeable increase in the number
of participants in LivDet competitions as well as a noticeable decrease in
error rates across competitions. Participants have grown from four to the most
recent thirteen submissions for Fingerprint Part 1. Fingerprints Part 2 has
held steady at two submissions each competition in 2011 and 2013 and only one
for the 2015 edition. The continuous increase of competitors demonstrates a
growing interest in the topic.

 <dc:description>  It is an ill-posed problem to recover the true scene colors from a color
biased image by discounting the effects of scene illuminant and camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) at the same time. Most color constancy (CC) models have been
designed to first estimate the illuminant color, which is then removed from the
color biased image to obtain an image taken under white light, without the
explicit consideration of CSS effect on CC. This paper first studies the CSS
effect on illuminant estimation arising in the inter-dataset-based CC
(inter-CC), i.e., training a CC model on one dataset and then testing on
another dataset captured by a distinct CSS. We show the clear degradation of
existing CC models for inter-CC application. Then a simple way is proposed to
overcome such degradation by first learning quickly a transform matrix between
the two distinct CSSs (CSS-1 and CSS-2). The learned matrix is then used to
convert the data (including the illuminant ground truth and the color biased
images) rendered under CSS-1 into CSS-2, and then train and apply the CC model
on the color biased images under CSS-2, without the need of burdensome
acquiring of training set under CSS-2. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real images show that our method can clearly improve the inter-CC performance
for traditional CC algorithms. We suggest that by taking the CSS effect into
account, it is more likely to obtain the truly color constant images invariant
to the changes of both illuminant and camera sensors.

 <dc:description>  Application development in the Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging
because it involves dealing with issues that attribute to different life-cycle
phases. First, the application logic has to be analyzed and then separated into
a set of distributed tasks for an underlying network. Then, the tasks have to
be implemented for the specific hardware. Moreover, we take different IoT
applications and present development of these applications using IoTSuite. In
this paper, we introduce a design and implementation of ToolSuite, a suite of
tools, for reducing burden of each stage of IoT application development
process. We take different class of IoT applications, largely found in the IoT
literature, and demonstrate these IoT application development using IoTSuite.
These applications have been tested on several IoT technologies such as
Android, Raspberry PI, Arduino, and JavaSE-enabled devices, Messaging protocols
such as MQTT, CoAP, WebSocket, Server technologies such as Node.js, Relational
database such as MySQL, and Microsoft Azure Cloud services.

 <dc:description>  The sources separated by most single channel audio source separation
techniques are usually distorted and each separated source contains residual
signals from the other sources. To tackle this problem, we propose to enhance
the separated sources to decrease the distortion and interference between the
separated sources using deep neural networks (DNNs). Two different DNNs are
used in this work. The first DNN is used to separate the sources from the mixed
signal. The second DNN is used to enhance the separated signals. To consider
the interactions between the separated sources, we propose to use a single DNN
to enhance all the separated sources together. To reduce the residual signals
of one source from the other separated sources (interference), we train the DNN
for enhancement discriminatively to maximize the dissimilarity between the
predicted sources. The experimental results show that using discriminative
enhancement decreases the distortion and interference between the separated
sources.

 <dc:description>  We describe a number of recently developed techniques for improving the
performance of large-scale nuclear configuration interaction calculations on
high performance parallel computers. We show the benefit of using a
preconditioned block iterative method to replace the Lanczos algorithm that has
traditionally been used to perform this type of computation. The rapid
convergence of the block iterative method is achieved by a proper choice of
starting guesses of the eigenvectors and the construction of an effective
preconditioner. These acceleration techniques take advantage of special
structure of the nuclear configuration interaction problem which we discuss in
detail. The use of a block method also allows us to improve the concurrency of
the computation, and take advantage of the memory hierarchy of modern
microprocessors to increase the arithmetic intensity of the computation
relative to data movement. We also discuss implementation details that are
critical to achieving high performance on massively parallel multi-core
supercomputers, and demonstrate that the new block iterative solver is two to
three times faster than the Lanczos based algorithm for problems of moderate
sizes on a Cray XC30 system.

 <dc:description>  We propose a unified coded framework for distributed computing with
straggling servers, by introducing a tradeoff between &quot;latency of computation&quot;
and &quot;load of communication&quot; for some linear computation tasks. We show that the
coded scheme of [1]-[3] that repeats the intermediate computations to create
coded multicasting opportunities to reduce communication load, and the coded
scheme of [4], [5] that generates redundant intermediate computations to combat
against straggling servers can be viewed as special instances of the proposed
framework, by considering two extremes of this tradeoff: minimizing either the
load of communication or the latency of computation individually. Furthermore,
the latency-load tradeoff achieved by the proposed coded framework allows to
systematically operate at any point on that tradeoff to perform distributed
computing tasks. We also prove an information-theoretic lower bound on the
latency-load tradeoff, which is shown to be within a constant multiplicative
gap from the achieved tradeoff at the two end points.

 <dc:description>  This work advocates Eulerian motion representation learning over the current
standard Lagrangian optical flow model. Eulerian motion is well captured by
using phase, as obtained by decomposing the image through a complex-steerable
pyramid. We discuss the gain of Eulerian motion in a set of practical use
cases: (i) action recognition, (ii) motion prediction in static images, (iii)
motion transfer in static images and, (iv) motion transfer in video. For each
task we motivate the phase-based direction and provide a possible approach.

 <dc:description>  Learning both hierarchical and temporal representation has been among the
long-standing challenges of recurrent neural networks. Multiscale recurrent
neural networks have been considered as a promising approach to resolve this
issue, yet there has been a lack of empirical evidence showing that this type
of models can actually capture the temporal dependencies by discovering the
latent hierarchical structure of the sequence. In this paper, we propose a
novel multiscale approach, called the hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural
networks, which can capture the latent hierarchical structure in the sequence
by encoding the temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel
update mechanism. We show some evidence that our proposed multiscale
architecture can discover underlying hierarchical structure in the sequences
without using explicit boundary information. We evaluate our proposed model on
character-level language modelling and handwriting sequence modelling.

 <dc:description>  Studies on microscopic pedestrian requires large amounts of trajectory data
from real-world pedestrian crowds. Such data collection, if done manually,
needs tremendous effort and is very time consuming. Though many studies have
asserted the possibility of automating this task using video cameras, we found
that only a few have demonstrated good performance in very crowded situations
or from a top-angled view scene. This paper deals with tracking pedestrian
crowd under heavy occlusions from an angular scene. Our automated tracking
system consists of two modules that perform sequentially. The first module
detects moving objects as blobs. The second module is a tracking system. We
employ probability distribution from the detection of each pedestrian and use
Bayesian update to track the next position. The result of such tracking is a
database of pedestrian trajectories over time and space. With certain prior
information, we showed that the system can track a large number of people under
occlusion and clutter scene.

 <dc:title>Human pose estimation via Convolutional Part Heatmap Regression</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bulat, Adrian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tzimiropoulos, Georgios</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is on human pose estimation using Convolutional Neural Networks.
Our main contribution is a CNN cascaded architecture specifically designed for
learning part relationships and spatial context, and robustly inferring pose
even for the case of severe part occlusions. To this end, we propose a
detection-followed-by-regression CNN cascade. The first part of our cascade
outputs part detection heatmaps and the second part performs regression on
these heatmaps. The benefits of the proposed architecture are multi-fold: It
guides the network where to focus in the image and effectively encodes part
constraints and context. More importantly, it can effectively cope with
occlusions because part detection heatmaps for occluded parts provide low
confidence scores which subsequently guide the regression part of our network
to rely on contextual information in order to predict the location of these
parts. Additionally, we show that the proposed cascade is flexible enough to
readily allow the integration of various CNN architectures for both detection
and regression, including recent ones based on residual learning. Finally, we
illustrate that our cascade achieves top performance on the MPII and LSP data
sets. Code can be downloaded from http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxab5/

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of layering general directed graphs under height and
possibly also width constraints. Given a directed graph G = (V,A) and a maximal
height, we propose a layering approach that minimizes a weighted sum of the
number of reversed arcs, the arc lengths, and the width of the drawing. We call
this the Compact Generalized Layering Problem (CGLP). Here, the width of a
drawing is defined as the maximum sum of the number of vertices placed on a
layer and the number of dummy vertices caused by arcs traversing the layer. The
CGLP is NP-hard. We present two MIP models for this problem. The first one
(EXT) is our extension of a natural formulation for directed acyclic graphs as
suggested by Healy and Nikolov. The second one (CGL) is a new formulation based
on partial orderings. Our computational experiments on two benchmark sets show
that the CGL formulation can be solved much faster than EXT using standard
commercial MIP solvers. Moreover, we suggest a variant of CGL, called MML, that
can be seen as a heuristic approach. In our experiments, MML clearly improves
on CGL in terms of running time while it does not considerably increase the
average arc lengths and widths of the layouts although it solves a slightly
different problem where the dummy vertices are not taken into account.

 <dc:description>  Context: Data miners have been widely used in software engineering to, say,
generate defect predictors from static code measures. Such static code defect
predictors perform well compared to manual methods, and they are easy to use
and useful to use. But one of the &quot;black art&quot; of data mining is setting the
tunings that control the miner. Objective:We seek simple, automatic, and very
effective method for finding those tunings. Method: For each experiment with
different data sets (from open source JAVA systems), we ran differential
evolution as anoptimizer to explore the tuning space (as a first step) then
tested the tunings using hold-out data. Results: Contrary to our prior
expectations, we found these tunings were remarkably simple: it only required
tens, not thousands,of attempts to obtain very good results. For example, when
learning software defect predictors, this method can quickly find tuningsthat
alter detection precision from 0% to 60%. Conclusion: Since (1) the
improvements are so large, and (2) the tuning is so simple, we need to change
standard methods insoftware analytics. At least for defect prediction, it is no
longer enough to just run a data miner and present the resultwithoutconducting
a tuning optimization study. The implication for other kinds of analytics is
now an open and pressing issue

 <dc:description>  The mapping of populations socio-economic well-being is highly constrained by
the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes
across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to
assess; thus the speed of which policies can be designed and evaluated is
limited. However, recent studies have shown the value of mobile phone data as
an enabling methodology for demographic modeling and measurement. In this work,
we investigate whether indicators extracted from mobile phone usage can reveal
information about the socio-economical status of microregions such as districts
(i.e., average spatial resolution &lt; 2.7km). For this we examine anonymized
mobile phone metadata combined with beneficiaries records from unemployment
benefit program. We find that aggregated activity, social, and mobility
patterns strongly correlate with unemployment. Furthermore, we construct a
simple model to produce accurate reconstruction of district level unemployment
from their mobile communication patterns alone. Our results suggest that
reliable and cost-effective economical indicators could be built based on
passively collected and anonymized mobile phone data. With similar data being
collected every day by telecommunication services across the world,
survey-based methods of measuring community socioeconomic status could
potentially be augmented or replaced by such passive sensing methods in the
future.

 <dc:description>  The finite spectrum of a first-order sentence is the set of positive integers
that are the sizes of its models. The class of finite spectra is known to be
the same as the complexity class NE. We consider the spectra obtained by
limiting models to be either planar (in the graph-theoretic sense) or by
bounding the degree of elements. We show that the class of such spectra is
still surprisingly rich by establishing that significant fragments of NE are
included among them. At the same time, we establish non-trivial upper bounds
showing that not all sets in NE are obtained as planar or bounded-degree
spectra.

 <dc:description>  Leverage scores, loosely speaking, reflect the importance of the rows and
columns of a matrix. Ideally, given the leverage scores of a rank-$r$ matrix
$M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, that matrix can be reliably completed from just
$O(rn\log^{2}n)$ samples if the samples are chosen randomly from a nonuniform
distribution induced by the leverage scores. In practice, however, the leverage
scores are often unknown a priori. As such, the sample complexity in uniform
matrix completion---using uniform random sampling---increases to
$O(\eta(M)\cdot rn\log^{2}n)$, where $\eta(M)$ is the largest leverage score of
$M$. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm called MC$^2$ for matrix
completion: in the first phase, the leverage scores are estimated based on
uniform random samples, and then in the second phase the matrix is resampled
nonuniformly based on the estimated leverage scores and then completed. For
well-conditioned matrices, the total sample complexity of MC$^2$ is no worse
than uniform matrix completion, and for certain classes of well-conditioned
matrices---namely, reasonably coherent matrices whose leverage scores exhibit
mild decay---MC$^2$ requires substantially fewer samples. Numerical simulations
suggest that the algorithm outperforms uniform matrix completion in a broad
class of matrices, and in particular, is much less sensitive to the condition
number than our theory currently requires.

 <dc:title>Data Detection in Large Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems via Approximate
  Semidefinite Relaxation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Practical data detectors for future wireless systems with hundreds of
antennas at the base station must achieve high throughput and low error rate at
low complexity. Since the complexity of maximum-likelihood (ML) data detection
is prohibitive for such large wireless systems, approximate methods are
necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel data detection algorithm referred
to as Triangular Approximate SEmidefinite Relaxation (TASER), which is suitable
for two application scenarios: (i) coherent data detection in large multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems and (ii) joint
channel estimation and data detection in large single-input multiple-output
(SIMO) wireless systems. For both scenarios, we show that TASER achieves
near-ML error-rate performance at low complexity by relaxing the associated
ML-detection problems into a semidefinite program, which we solve approximately
using a preconditioned forward-backward splitting procedure. Since the
resulting problem is non-convex, we provide convergence guarantees for our
algorithm. To demonstrate the efficacy of TASER in practice, we design a
systolic architecture that enables our algorithm to achieve high throughput at
low hardware complexity, and we develop reference field-programmable gate array
(FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs for various
antenna configurations.

 <dc:description>  Recently sparse representation has gained great success in face image
super-resolution. The conventional sparsity-based methods enforce sparse coding
on face image patches and the representation fidelity is measured by
$\ell_{2}$-norm. Such a sparse coding model regularizes all facial patches
equally, which however ignores distinct natures of different facial patches for
image reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a new weighted-patch
super-resolution method based on AdaBoost. Specifically, in each iteration of
the AdaBoost operation, each facial patch is weighted automatically according
to the performance of the model on it, so as to highlight those patches that
are more critical for improving the reconstruction power in next step. In this
way, through the AdaBoost training procedure, we can focus more on the patches
(face regions) with richer information. Various experimental results on
standard face database show that our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both objective metrics and visual quality.

 <dc:description>  Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model is computer simulation model of
pedestrian movement where every pedestrian in the model is treated as
individual. Most of pedestrian researches have been done on macroscopic level,
which does not consider the interaction between pedestrians and does not well
suited for prediction of pedestrian flow performance in pedestrian areas or
building with some objects that reduce the effective width of it. In the other
hand, microscopic level has more general usage and considers detail of the
design. Tough the analytical model for microscopic pedestrian model is existed
exist, the numerical solution of the model is very difficult and simulation is
favorable. The model has practical application of Evacuation from building,
Design of pedestrian area, and Experimental &amp; Optimization Design Tool. In
general, Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model consist of two terms, that
make the pedestrian moving toward the destination and make repulsive effect
toward other pedestrian or obstacles.

 <dc:description>  To deal with many pedestrian data, automatic data collection is needed. This
paper describes how to automate the microscopic pedestrian flow data collection
from video files. The study is restricted only to pedestrians without
considering vehicular - pedestrian interaction. Pedestrian tracking system
consists of three sub-systems, which calculates the image processing, object
tracking and traffic flow variables. The system receives input of stacks of
images and parameters. The first sub-system performs Image Processing analysis
while the second sub-system carries out the tracking of pedestrians by matching
the features and tracing the pedestrian numbers frame by frame. The last
sub-system deals with a NTXY database to calculate the pedestrian traffic-flow
characteristic such as flow rate, speed and area module. Comparison with manual
data collection method confirmed that the procedures described have significant
potential to automate the data collection of both microscopic and macroscopic
pedestrian flow variables.

 <dc:description>  The read channel of a Flash memory cell degrades after repetitive program and
erase (P/E) operations. This degradation is often modeled as a function of the
number of P/E cycles. In contrast, this paper models the degradation as a
function of the cumulative effect of the charge written and erased from the
cell. Based on this modeling approach, this paper dynamically allocates voltage
using lower-voltage write thresholds at the beginning of the device lifetime
and increasing the thresholds as needed to maintain the mutual information of
the read channel in the face of degradation. The paper introduces the technique
in an idealized setting and then removes ideal assumptions about channel
knowledge and available voltage resolution to conclude with a practical scheme
with performance close to that of the idealized setting.

prove an upper bound on the modulus p in terms of the number of cosets. We
have, as a corollary, that there is no prime $p$ for which there exists a
partition of Z/pZ* into 13 cosets that yields a 13-color Ramsey algebra. Thus

 <dc:description>  Query-based video summarization is the task of creating a brief visual
trailer, which captures the parts of the video (or a collection of videos) that
are most relevant to the user-issued query. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised label propagation approach for this task. Our approach effectively
captures the multimodal semantics of queries and videos using state-of-the-art
deep neural networks and creates a summary that is both semantically coherent
and visually attractive. We describe the theoretical framework of our
graph-based approach and empirically evaluate its effectiveness in creating
relevant and attractive trailers. Finally, we showcase example video trailers
generated by our system.

 <dc:description>  This study evaluates the cyber-risks to Business Information Assets posed by
the adoption of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) to the workplace. BYOD is an
emerging trend where employees bring and use personal computing devices on the
companys network to access applications and sensitive data like emails,
calendar and scheduling applications, documents, etc. Employees are captivated
by BYOD because they can have access to private items as well as perform
certain job functions while being unrestricted to their desks. This is however
usually done on the blind side of management or the system administrator; a
situation that tends to expose vital and sensitive corporate information to
various threats like unwanted network traffic, unknown applications, malwares,
and viruses. Expert opinions were elicited in this exploratory study. The study
evaluated the characteristics of BYOD, assessed associated risks, threats and
vulnerabilities. The findings indicate that little or no security measures were
instituted to mitigate risks associated with BYOD. Though, profound benefits
abound with BYOD adoption, they could be eroded by security threats and costs
of mitigation in curing breaches. The most significant risk was found to be
Data Loss which was in consonance with similar studies on Smartphone security
risks. Some mitigation measures are then recommended.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing is a new paradigm and innovation in the technology service
delivery. It is utilized for IT-enabled value creation. The capex-free nature
of cloud service delivery renders it very attractive to many SMEs. But it is
saddled with multi-tenancy issues; prominent under this study are concerns of
privacy, trust and availability. How do end-users trust providers with their
sensitive data? How secured and confidential are their corporate assets? Amidst
the perennial power outages (a.k.a. Dumsor), what is the acceptable available
uptime? We sampled and interviewed cloud service providers (CSPs) as well as
end-users in Ghana, a developing economy. We also gleaned through some
secondary data to ascertain some operational concerns. The results indicate
that security and service level agreements (SLAs) are key concerns in respect
of privacy and trust issues. Similarly, perennial power outages and security
were key availability concerns. This was expected as end-users use cloud
services for mission critical information assets, and so requires high
availability. The implications are that the cyber-security concerns ought to be
addressed if SMEs in developing economies are to adopt and accept cloud
computing resources for IT-enabled competitive advantage.

 <dc:description>  Ghana's Decentralization Policy has made significant contribution in
infrastructural implementation and delivery through Metropolitan, Municipal and
District Assemblies as an alternative development strategy to ensure the
implementation of the overall national agenda. To date, many systems and
strategies have been implemented towards improving development of
infrastructure at the local government level. Given that initiation and
implementation of infrastructural development at the local level involves the
multi-institutional participation of various stakeholders in local governance
for effective monitoring and development, several governance forms including
e-governance have been initiated towards improvement and effective management
of the assemblies. E-Governance through the use of relevant Information and
Communication Technology has been implemented through the Government Policy on
Information and Communications Technology for Accelerated Development as a
catalyst to facilitate the cross-sectoral participation in the implementation
of infrastructural development. Unfortunately, to date, the ICT4AD does not
appear to be successfully on course having been in existence for over a decade.
Similarly, the development and monitoring of the physical infrastructure at the
local level continue to suffer several setbacks and it is currently clearly
evident that a refined system of best practices must be put in place to
simplify and harmonize the entire development process. This paper is aimed at
the assessment of the challenges of e-governance in infrastructural development
at the local government level in Ghana. Using a mixed approach with purposive
sampling, data gathered from the MMDAs in Ashanti Region suggest that the

 <dc:description>  Caching is an effective technique to improve user perceived experience for
content delivery in wireless networks. Wireless caching differs from
traditional web caching in that it can exploit the broadcast nature of wireless
medium and hence opportunistically change the network topologies. This paper
studies a cache-aided MIMO interference network with 3 transmitters each
equipped with M antennas and 3 receivers each with N antennas. With caching at
both the transmitter and receiver sides, the network is changed to hybrid forms
of MIMO broadcast channel, MIMO X channel, and MIMO multicast channels. We
analyze the degrees of freedom (DoF) of these new channel models using
practical interference management schemes. Based on the collective use of these
DoF results, we then obtain an achievable normalized delivery time (NDT) of the
network, an information-theoretic metric that evaluates the worst-case delivery
time at given cache sizes. The obtained NDT is for arbitrary M, N and any
feasible cache sizes. It is shown to be optimal in certain cases and within a
multiplicative gap of 3 from the optimum in other cases. The extension to the
network with arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers is also discussed.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a Triangle based approach to classify flower images.
Initially, flowers are segmented using whorl based region merging segmentation.
Skeleton of a flower is obtained from the segmented flower using a skeleton
pruning method. The Delaunay triangulation is obtained from the endpoints and
junction points detected on the skeleton. The length and angle features are
extracted from the obtained Delaunay triangles and then are aggregated to
represent in the form of interval-valued type data. A suitable classifier has
been explored for the purpose of classification. To corroborate the efficacy of
the proposed method, an experiment is conducted on our own data set of 30
classes of flowers, containing 3000 samples.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a method for the classification of animal in images.
Initially, a graph cut based method is used to perform segmentation in order to
eliminate the background from the given image. The segmented animal images are
partitioned in to number of blocks and then the color texture moments are
extracted from different blocks. Probabilistic neural network and K-nearest
neighbors are considered here for classification. To corroborate the efficacy
of the proposed method, an experiment was conducted on our own data set of 25
classes of animals, which consisted of 4000 sample images. The experiment was
conducted by picking images randomly from the database to study the effect of
classification accuracy, and the results show that the K-nearest neighbors
classifier achieves good performance.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Consider a swarm of particles controlled by global inputs. This paper
presents algorithms for shaping such swarms in 2D using boundary walls. The
range of configurations created by conforming a swarm to a boundary wall is
limited. We describe the set of stable configurations of a swarm in two
canonical workspaces, a circle and a square. To increase the diversity of
configurations, we add boundary interaction to our model. We provide algorithms
using friction with walls to place two robots at arbitrary locations in a
rectangular workspace. Next, we extend this algorithm to place $n$ agents at
desired locations. We conclude with efficient techniques to control the
covariance of a swarm not possible without wall-friction. Simulations and
hardware implementations with 100 robots validate these results.
  These methods may have particular relevance for current micro- and
nano-robots controlled by global inputs.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a new approach for efficient edge-preserving image
deconvolution. Our algorithm is based on a novel type of explicit image filter
- guided filter. The guided filter can be used as an edge-preserving smoothing
operator like the popular bilateral filter, but has better behaviors near
edges. We propose an efficient iterative algorithm with the decouple of
deblurring and denoising steps in the restoration process. In deblurring step,
we proposed two cost function which could be computed with fast Fourier
transform efficiently. The solution of the first one is used as the guidance
image, and another solution will be filtered in next step. In the denoising
step, the guided filter is used with the two obtained images for efficient
edge-preserving filtering. Furthermore, we derive a simple and effective method
to automatically adjust the regularization parameter at each iteration. We
compare our deconvolution algorithm with many competitive deconvolution
techniques in terms of ISNR and visual quality.

 <dc:description>  We propose an expectation-maximization-like(EMlike) method to train Boltzmann
machine with unconstrained connectivity. It adopts Monte Carlo approximation in
the E-step, and replaces the intractable likelihood objective with efficiently
computed objectives or directly approximates the gradient of likelihood
objective in the M-step. The EM-like method is a modification of alternating
minimization. We prove that EM-like method will be the exactly same with
contrastive divergence in restricted Boltzmann machine if the M-step of this
method adopts special approximation. We also propose a new measure to assess
the performance of Boltzmann machine as generative models of data, and its
computational complexity is O(Rmn). Finally, we demonstrate the performance of
EM-like method using numerical experiments.

multiple access technique for the next generation cellular communication
networks. In this paper, we first discuss a simple NOMA model with two users
served by a single-carrier simultaneously to illustrate its basic principles.
Then, a more general model with multicarrier serving an arbitrary number of
users on each subcarrier is also discussed. An overview of existing works on
performance analysis, resource allocation, and multiple-input multiple-output
NOMA are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the key features of
NOMA and its potential research challenges.

 <dc:description>  A popular approach to semantic image understanding is to manually tag images
with keywords and then learn a mapping from vi- sual features to keywords.
Manually tagging images is a subjective pro- cess and the same or very similar
visual contents are often tagged with different keywords. Furthermore, not all
tags have the same descriptive power for visual contents and large vocabulary
available from natural language could result in a very diverse set of keywords.
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised visual theme discovery framework as a
better (more compact, efficient and effective) alternative to semantic
represen- tation of visual contents. We first show that tag based annotation
lacks consistency and compactness for describing visually similar contents. We
then learn the visual similarity between tags based on the visual features of
the images containing the tags. At the same time, we use a natural language
processing technique (word embedding) to measure the seman- tic similarity
between tags. Finally, we cluster tags into visual themes based on their visual
similarity and semantic similarity measures using a spectral clustering
algorithm. We conduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness and
rationality of the visual themes discovered by our unsu- pervised algorithm and
obtains promising result. We then design three common computer vision tasks,
example based image search, keyword based image search and image labelling to
explore potential applica- tion of our visual themes discovery framework. In
experiments, visual themes significantly outperforms tags on semantic image
understand- ing and achieve state-of-art performance in all three tasks. This
again demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of proposed framework.

 <dc:description>  Real-time industrial application requires routing protocol that guarantees
data delivery with reliable, efficient and low end-to-end delay. Existing
Routing(THVR) [13] is based velocity of Two-Hop Velocity and protocol relates
two-hop velocity to delay to select the next forwarding node, that has overhead
of exchanging control packets, and depleting the available energy in nodes. We
propose a Real-Time Reliable Data delivery based on Virtual Coordinates Routing
(RRDVCR) algorithm, based on the number of hops to the destination rather than
geographic distance. Selection of forwarding node is based on packet progress
offered by two-hops, link quality and available energy at the forwarding nodes.
All these metric are co-related by dynamic co-relation factor. The proposed
protocol uses selective acknowledgment scheme that results in lower overhead
and energy consumption. Simulation results shows that there is about 22% and
9.5% decrease in energy consumption compared to SPEED [8] and THVR [13]
respectively, 16% and 38% increase in packet delivery compared to THVR [13] and
SPEED[8] respectively, and overhead is reduced by 50%.

 <dc:description>  This paper extends the standard chaining technique to prove excess risk upper
bounds for empirical risk minimization with random design settings even if the
magnitude of the noise and the estimates is unbounded. The bound applies to
many loss functions besides the squared loss, and scales only with the
sub-Gaussian or subexponential parameters without further statistical
assumptions such as the bounded kurtosis condition over the hypothesis class. A
detailed analysis is provided for slope constrained and penalized linear least
squares regression with a sub-Gaussian setting, which often proves tight sample
complexity bounds up to logartihmic factors.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of approximate nearest neighbor search in
the compressed domain. We introduce polysemous codes, which offer both the
distance estimation quality of product quantization and the efficient
comparison of binary codes with Hamming distance. Their design is inspired by
algorithms introduced in the 90's to construct channel-optimized vector
quantizers. At search time, this dual interpretation accelerates the search.
Most of the indexed vectors are filtered out with Hamming distance, letting
only a fraction of the vectors to be ranked with an asymmetric distance
estimator.
  The method is complementary with a coarse partitioning of the feature space
such as the inverted multi-index. This is shown by our experiments performed on
several public benchmarks such as the BIGANN dataset comprising one billion
vectors, for which we report state-of-the-art results for query times below
0.3\,millisecond per core. Last but not least, our approach allows the
approximate computation of the k-NN graph associated with the Yahoo Flickr
Creative Commons 100M, described by CNN image descriptors, in less than 8 hours
on a single machine.

 <dc:description>  The notion of Total Interference Degree (TID) is traditionally used to
estimate the intensity of prevalent interference in a
Multi-RadioMulti-ChannelWirelessMesh Network (MRMC WMN). Numerous Channel
Assignment (CA) approaches, linkscheduling algorithms and routing schemes have
been proposed for WMNs which rely entirely on the concept of TID estimates.
They focus on minimizing TID to create a minimal interference scenario for the
network. In our prior works [1] and [2], we have questioned the efficacy of TID
estimate and then proposed two reliable interference estimation metrics viz.,
Channel Distribution Across Links Cost (CDALcost) and Cumulative X-Link-Set
Weight (CXLSwt). In this work, we assess the ability of these interference
estimation metrics to replace TID as the interferenceminimizing factor in a CA
scheme implemented on a grid MRMC WMN. We carry out a comprehensive evaluation
on ns-3 and then conclude from the results that the performance of the network
increases by 10-15% when the CA scheme uses CXLSwt as the underlying
Interference Mitigation Function (IMF) when compared with CA using TID as IMF.
We also confirm that CDALcost is not a better IMF than TID and CXLSwt.

 <dc:description>  We introduce DAiSEE, the largest multi-label video classification dataset
comprising of over two-and-a-half million video frames (2,723,882), 9068 video
snippets (about 25 hours of recording) captured from 112 users for recognizing
user affective states, including engagement, in the wild. In addition to
engagement, it also includes associated affective states of boredom, confusion,
and frustration, which are relevant to such applications. The dataset has four
levels of labels from very low to very high for each of the affective states,
collected using crowd annotators and correlated with a gold standard annotation
obtained from a team of expert psychologists. We have also included benchmark
results on this dataset using state-of-the-art video classification methods
that are available today, and the baselines on each of the labels is included
with this dataset. To the best of our knowledge, DAiSEE is the first and
largest such dataset in this domain. We believe that DAiSEE will provide the
research community with challenges in feature extraction, context-based
inference, and development of suitable machine learning methods for related
tasks, thus providing a springboard for further research.

 <dc:title>Query Optimization Techniques In Graph Databases</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ammar, Ali Ben</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Graph databases (GDB) have recently been arisen to overcome the limits of
traditional databases for storing and managing data with graph-like structure.
Today, they represent a requirement for many applications that manage
graph-like data, like social networks. Most of the techniques, applied to
optimize queries in graph databases, have been used in traditional databases,
distribution systems... or they are inspired from graph theory. However, their
reuse in graph databases should take care of the main characteristics of graph
databases, such as dynamic structure, highly interconnected data, and ability
to efficiently access data relationships. In this paper, we survey the query
optimization techniques in graph databases. In particular, we focus on the
features they have introduced to improve querying graph-like data.

 <dc:description>  Distributed compressive sensing is a framework considering jointly sparsity
within signal ensembles along with multiple measurement vectors (MMVs). The
current theoretical bound of performance for MMVs, however, is derived to be
the same with that for single MV (SMV) because no assumption about signal
ensembles is made.
  In this work, we propose a new concept of inducing the factor called
&quot;Euclidean distances between signals&quot; for the performance analysis of MMVs. The
novelty is that the size of signal ensembles will be taken into consideration
in our analysis to theoretically show that MMVs indeed exhibit better
performance than SMV. Although our concept can be broadly applied to CS
algorithms with MMVs, the case study conducted on a well-known greedy solver
called simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) will be explored in this
paper. We show that the performance of SOMP, when incorporated with our concept
by modifying the steps of support detection and signal estimations, will be
improved remarkably, especially when the Euclidean distances between signals
are short. The performance of modified SOMP is verified to meet our theoretical
prediction.

 <dc:title>Polyp Detection and Segmentation from Video Capsule Endoscopy: A Review</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is used widely nowadays for visualizing the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Capsule endoscopy exams are prescribed usually as
an additional monitoring mechanism and can help in identifying polyps,
bleeding, etc. To analyze the large scale video data produced by VCE exams
automatic image processing, computer vision, and learning algorithms are
required. Recently, automatic polyp detection algorithms have been proposed
with various degrees of success. Though polyp detection in colonoscopy and
other traditional endoscopy procedure based images is becoming a mature field,
due to its unique imaging characteristics detecting polyps automatically in VCE
is a hard problem. We review different polyp detection approaches for VCE
imagery and provide systematic analysis with challenges faced by standard image
processing and computer vision methods.

 <dc:title>SNOPS: Short Non-Orthogonal Pilot Sequences for Downlink Channel State
  Estimation in FDD Massive MIMO</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a significant bottleneck in
the design of Massive MIMO wireless systems, due to the length of the training
sequences required to distinguish the antennas (in the downlink) and the users
(for the uplink where a given spectral resource can be shared by a large number
of users). In this article, we focus on the downlink CSI estimation case.
Considering the presence of spatial correlation at the base transceiver station
(BTS) side, and assuming that the per-user channel statistics are known, we
seek to exploit this correlation to minimize the length of the pilot sequences.
We introduce a scheme relying on non-orthogonal pilot sequences and feedback
from the user terminal (UT), which enables the BTS to estimate all downlink
channels. Thanks to the relaxed orthogonality assumption on the pilots, the
length of the obtained pilot sequences can be strictly lower than the number of
antennas at the BTS, while the CSI estimation error is kept arbitrarily small.
We introduce two algorithms to dynamically design the required pilot sequences,
analyze and validate the performance of the proposed CSI estimation method
through numerical simulations using a realistic scenario based on the one-ring
channel model.

 <dc:title>A Model for Partial Kantian Cooperation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work presents a game theoretic model to describe game situations in
which there is a partial cooperation among the players. Specifically, we assume
that the players partially follow Kant's &quot;Categorical Imperative&quot;. The model is
stated for games with a continuum of players and the basic assumption made is
that the participants consider that they belong to virtual groups in which they
optimize their actions as if they were bound to follow the same strategy. The
relation with the Nash, (Bentham-) Harsanyi, Rawls difference and Roemer
solutions is then studied. We derive necessary conditions characterizing the
partial Kantian equilibria, using a reduction to a set of optimal control
problems. Finally, some examples are given.

 <dc:description>  Shannon Entropy has been extensively used for characterizing complexity of
time series arising from chaotic dynamical systems and stochastic processes
such as Markov chains. However, for short and noisy time series, Shannon
entropy performs poorly. Complexity measures which are based on lossless
compression algorithms are a good substitute in such scenarios. We evaluate the
performance of two such Compression-Complexity Measures namely Lempel-Ziv
complexity ($LZ$) and Effort-To-Compress ($ETC$) on short time series from
chaotic dynamical systems in the presence of noise. Both $LZ$ and $ETC$
outperform Shannon entropy ($H$) in accurately characterizing the dynamical
complexity of such systems. For very short binary sequences (which arise in
neuroscience applications), $ETC$ has higher number of distinct complexity
values than $LZ$ and $H$, thus enabling a finer resolution. For two-state
ergodic Markov chains, we empirically show that $ETC$ converges to a steady
state value faster than $LZ$. Compression-Complexity Measures are promising for
applications which involve short and noisy time series.

 <dc:description>  Computation is classically studied in terms of automata, formal languages and
algorithms; yet, the relation between neural dynamics and symbolic
representations and operations is still unclear in traditional eliminative
connectionism. Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central
issue, to which we would like to refer as to transparent connectionism, by
proposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural
substrates. In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a
symbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time
simulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Goedelization of
versatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems
evolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear
dynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping
defines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data,
symbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in
activation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while
maintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting
networks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in absence
of network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture
and their consequences, we present two examples: i) the design of a Central
Pattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and ii) the
creation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports
the parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics
experiments.

 <dc:title>A three-dimensional approach to Visual Speech Recognition using Discrete
  Cosine Transforms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Heidenreich, Toni</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Spratling, Michael W.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Visual speech recognition aims to identify the sequence of phonemes from
continuous speech. Unlike the traditional approach of using 2D image feature
extraction methods to derive features of each video frame separately, this
paper proposes a new approach using a 3D (spatio-temporal) Discrete Cosine
Transform to extract features of each feasible sub-sequence of an input video
which are subsequently classified individually using Support Vector Machines
and combined to find the most likely phoneme sequence using a tailor-made
Hidden Markov Model. The algorithm is trained and tested on the VidTimit
database to recognise sequences of phonemes as well as visemes (visual speech
units). Furthermore, the system is extended with the training on phoneme or
viseme pairs (biphones) to counteract the human speech ambiguity of
co-articulation. The test set accuracy for the recognition of phoneme sequences
is 20%, and the accuracy of viseme sequences is 39%. Both results improve the
best values reported in other papers by approximately 2%. The contribution of
the result is three-fold: Firstly, this paper is the first to show that 3D
feature extraction methods can be applied to continuous sequence recognition
tasks despite the unknown start positions and durations of each phoneme.
Secondly, the result confirms that 3D feature extraction methods improve the
accuracy compared to 2D features extraction methods. Thirdly, the paper is the
first to specifically compare an otherwise identical method with and without
using biphones, verifying that the usage of biphones has a positive impact on
the result.

 <dc:title>Path planning and Obstacle avoidance approaches for Mobile robot</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new path planning method for Mobile Robots (MR) has been developed and
implemented. On the one hand, based on the shortest path from the start point
to the goal point, this path planner can choose the best moving directions of
the MR, which helps to reach the target point as soon as possible. On the other
hand, with an intelligent obstacle avoidance, our method can find the target
point with the near-shortest path length while avoiding some infinite loop
traps of several obstacles in unknown environments. The combination of two
approaches helps the MR to reach the target point with a very reliable
algorithm. Moreover, by continuous updates of the on-board sensors information,
this approach can generate the MRs trajectory both in static and dynamic
environments. A large number of simulations in some similar studies
environments demonstrate the power of the proposed path planning algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We describe a new method of reduced Google matrix which allows to establish
direct and hidden links between a subset of nodes of a large directed network.
This approach uses parallels with quantum scattering theory, developed for
processes in nuclear and mesoscopic physics and quantum chaos. The method is
applied to the Wikipedia networks in different language editions analyzing
several groups of political leaders of USA, UK, Germany, France, Russia and
G20. We demonstrate that this approach allows to recover reliably direct and

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of public Wi-Fi hotspots has brought new business
potentials for Wi-Fi networks, which carry a significant amount of global
mobile data traffic today. In this paper, we propose a novel Wi-Fi monetization
model for venue owners (VOs) deploying public Wi-Fi hotspots, where the VOs can
generate revenue by providing two different Wi-Fi access schemes for mobile
users (MUs): (i) the premium access, in which MUs directly pay VOs for their
Wi-Fi usage, and (ii) the advertising sponsored access, in which MUs watch
advertisements in exchange of the free usage of Wi-Fi. VOs sell their ad spaces
to advertisers (ADs) via an ad platform, and share the ADs' payments with the
ad platform. We formulate the economic interactions among the ad platform, VOs,
MUs, and ADs as a three-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the ad platform
announces its advertising revenue sharing policy. In Stage II, VOs determine
the Wi-Fi prices (for MUs) and advertising prices (for ADs). In Stage III, MUs
make access choices and ADs purchase advertising spaces. We analyze the
sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the proposed game systematically, and our
analysis shows the following useful observations. First, the ad platform's
advertising revenue sharing policy in Stage I will affect only the VOs' Wi-Fi
prices but not the VOs' advertising prices in Stage II. Second, both the VOs'
Wi-Fi prices and advertising prices are non-decreasing in the advertising
concentration level and non-increasing in the MU visiting frequency. Numerical
results further show that the VOs are capable of generating large revenues
through mainly providing one type of Wi-Fi access (the premium access or
advertising sponsored access), depending on their advertising concentration
levels and MU visiting frequencies.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  DFST proposes an optimized visual tracking algorithm based on the real-time
selection of locally and temporally discriminative features. A feature
selection mechanism is embedded in the Adaptive colour Names (CN) tracking
system that adaptively selects the top-ranked discriminative features for
tracking. DFST provides a significant gain in accuracy and precision allowing
the use of a dynamic set of features that results in an increased system
flexibility. DFST is based on the unsupervised method &quot;Infinite Feature
Selection&quot; (Inf-FS), which ranks features according with their &quot;redundancy&quot;
without using class labels. By using a fast online algorithm for learning
dictionaries the size of the box is adapted during the processing. At each
update, we use multiple examples around the target (at different positions and
scales). DFST also improved the CN by adding micro-shift at the predicted
position and bounding box adaptation.

 <dc:title>Auction-Based Coopetition between LTE Unlicensed and Wi-Fi</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the recent efforts in extending LTE to the unlicensed spectrum,
we propose a novel spectrum sharing framework for the coopetition (i.e.,
cooperation and competition) between LTE and Wi-Fi in the unlicensed band.
Basically, the LTE network can choose to work in one of the two modes: in the
competition mode, it randomly accesses an unlicensed channel, and interferes
with the Wi-Fi access point using the same channel; in the cooperation mode, it
delivers traffic for the Wi-Fi users in exchange for the exclusive access of
the corresponding channel. Because the LTE network works in an
interference-free manner in the cooperation mode, it can achieve a much larger
data rate than that in the competition mode, which allows it to effectively
serve both its own users and the Wi-Fi users. We design a second-price reverse
auction mechanism, which enables the LTE provider and the Wi-Fi access point
owners (APOs) to effectively negotiate the operation mode. Specifically, the
LTE provider is the auctioneer (buyer), and the APOs are the bidders (sellers)
who compete to sell their channel access opportunities to the LTE provider. In
Stage I of the auction, the LTE provider announces a reserve rate. In Stage II
of the auction, the APOs submit their bids. We show that the auction involves
allocative externalities, i.e., the cooperation between the LTE provider and
one APO benefits other APOs who are not directly involved in this cooperation.
As a result, a particular APO's willingness to cooperate is affected by its
belief about other APOs' willingness to cooperate. This makes our analysis much
more challenging than that of the conventional second-price auction, where
bidding truthfully is a weakly dominant strategy. We show that the APOs have a
unique form of the equilibrium bidding strategies in Stage II, based on which
we analyze the LTE provider's optimal reserve rate in Stage I.

 <dc:description>  Social media tend to be rife with rumours while new reports are released
piecemeal during breaking news. Interestingly, one can mine multiple reactions
expressed by social media users in those situations, exploring their stance
towards rumours, ultimately enabling the flagging of highly disputed rumours as
being potentially false. In this work, we set out to develop an automated,
supervised classifier that uses multi-task learning to classify the stance
expressed in each individual tweet in a rumourous conversation as either
supporting, denying or questioning the rumour. Using a classifier based on
Gaussian Processes, and exploring its effectiveness on two datasets with very
different characteristics and varying distributions of stances, we show that
our approach consistently outperforms competitive baseline classifiers. Our
classifier is especially effective in estimating the distribution of different
types of stance associated with a given rumour, which we set forth as a desired
characteristic for a rumour-tracking system that will warn both ordinary users
of Twitter and professional news practitioners when a rumour is being rebutted.

 <dc:description>  Many cloud-based applications employ a data centre as a central server to
process data that is generated by edge devices, such as smartphones, tablets
and wearables. This model places ever increasing demands on communication and
computational infrastructure with inevitable adverse effect on
Quality-of-Service and Experience. The concept of Edge Computing is predicated
on moving some of this computational load towards the edge of the network to
harness computational capabilities that are currently untapped in edge nodes,
such as base stations, routers and switches. This position paper considers the
challenges and opportunities that arise out of this new direction in the
computing landscape.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) methods have widely been
applied in data visualization. These methods minimize the divergence between
the pairwise similarities of high- and low-dimensional data. Despite their
popularity, the current SNE methods experience the &quot;crowding problem&quot; when the
data include highly imbalanced similarities. This implies that the data points
with higher total similarity tend to get crowded around the display center. To
solve this problem, we normalize the similarity matrix to be doubly stochastic
such that all the data points have equal total similarities. A fast
normalization method is proposed. Furthermore, we show empirically and
theoretically that the doubly stochasticity constraint often leads to
approximately spherical embeddings. This suggests replacing a flat space with
spheres as the embedding space. The spherical embedding eliminates the
discrepancy between the center and the periphery in visualization and thus
resolves the &quot;crowding problem&quot;. We compared the proposed method with the
state-of-the-art SNE method on three real-world datasets. The results indicate
that our method is more favorable in terms of visualization quality.

 <dc:description>  A theoretical framework is developed to describe the transformation that
distributes probability density functions uniformly over space. In one
dimension, the cumulative distribution can be used, but does not generalize to
higher dimensions, or non-separable distributions. A potential function is
shown to link probability density functions to their transformation, and to
generalize the cumulative. A numerical method is developed to compute the
potential, and examples are shown in two dimensions.

 <dc:description>  Personal robots are expected to interact with the user by recognizing the
user's face. However, in most of the service robot applications, the user needs
to move himself/herself to allow the robot to see him/her face to face. To
overcome such limitations, a method for estimating human body orientation is
required. Previous studies used various components such as feature extractors
and classification models to classify the orientation which resulted in low
performance. For a more robust and accurate approach, we propose the light
weight convolutional neural networks, an end to end system, for estimating
human body orientation. Our body orientation estimation model achieved 81.58%
and 94% accuracy with the benchmark dataset and our own dataset respectively.
The proposed method can be used in a wide range of service robot applications
which depend on the ability to estimate human body orientation. To show its
usefulness in service robot applications, we designed a simple robot
application which allows the robot to move towards the user's frontal plane.
With this, we demonstrated an improved face detection rate.

 <dc:description>  The complexity of ICT products and services has brought them to the level of
disposable `species'. The combination of the race to optimal performance and
disposability has resulted in considerable footprint and impact. Although
approaches such as increasing efficiency, reducing the total cost of ownership,
life cycle assessment and management, and circular economy have been put
forward to manage and reduce the footprint and impact, the complexity of
processes involved and especially invisibility of key but unobservable
processes has resulted in some lower bounds for minimal achievable footprint.
In this work, a modified approach to the Genetic Algorithm is proposed in order
to introduce the notion of 'nondisposability' to the ICT products and services
in order to implicitly influence and manage unobservable processes, and
ultimately reduce the overall footprint and resource consumption. The proposed
genetic algorithm is called FairGA, and it is compared with the traditional
Genetic Algorithm against standard optimization functions. Also, the impact of
the FairGA on the resource extraction has been illustrated with promising
results.

 <dc:description>  RNA junctions are important structural elements of RNA molecules. They are
formed when three or more helices come together in three-dimensional space.
Recent studies have focused on the annotation and prediction of coaxial helical
stacking (CHS) motifs within junctions. Here we exploit such predictions to
develop an efficient alignment tool to handle RNA secondary structures with CHS
motifs. Specifically, we build upon our Junction-Explorer software for
predicting coaxial stacking and RNAJAG for modelling junction topologies as
tree graphs to incorporate constrained tree matching and dynamic programming
algorithms into a new method, called CHSalign, for aligning the secondary
structures of RNA molecules containing CHS motifs. Thus, CHSalign is intended
to be an efficient alignment tool for RNAs containing similar junctions.
Experimental results based on thousands of alignments demonstrate that CHSalign
can align two RNA secondary structures containing CHS motifs more accurately
than other RNA secondary structure alignment tools. CHSalign yields a high
score when aligning two RNA secondary structures with similar CHS motifs or
helical arrangement patterns, and a low score otherwise. This new method has
been implemented in a web server, and the program is also made freely
available, at http://bioinformatics.njit.edu/CHSalign/.

 <dc:description>  This letter deals with the problem of adaptive signal detection in
partially-homogeneous and persymmetric Gaussian disturbance within the
framework of invariance theory. First, a suitable group of transformations
leaving the problem invariant is introduced and the Maximal Invariant Statistic
(MIS) is derived. Then, it is shown that the (Two-step) Generalized-Likelihood
Ratio test, Rao and Wald tests can be all expressed in terms of the MIS, thus
proving that they all ensure a Constant False-Alarm Rate (CFAR).

 <dc:title>Unifying task specification in reinforcement learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>White, Martha</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning tasks are typically specified as Markov decision
processes. This formalism has been highly successful, though specifications
often couple the dynamics of the environment and the learning objective. This
lack of modularity can complicate generalization of the task specification, as
well as obfuscate connections between different task settings, such as episodic
and continuing. In this work, we introduce the RL task formalism, that provides
a unification through simple constructs including a generalization to
transition-based discounting. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate the
generality and utility of this formalism. Finally, we extend standard learning
constructs, including Bellman operators, and extend some seminal theoretical
results, including approximation errors bounds. Overall, we provide a
well-understood and sound formalism on which to build theoretical results and
simplify algorithm use and development.

 <dc:creator>Gupta, Harsh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  World Wide Consortium (W3C) as an standard setting organization for the world
wide web plays a very important role in shaping the web. We focus on the
ongoing controversy related to Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) and found that
there was a serious lack of participation from people from non western
countries. We also found serious lack of gender diversity in the EME debate.

 <dc:title>Energy-constrained private and quantum capacities of quantum channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper establishes a general theory of energy-constrained quantum and
private capacities of quantum channels. We begin by defining various
energy-constrained communication tasks, including quantum communication with a
uniform energy constraint, entanglement transmission with an average energy
constraint, private communication with a uniform energy constraint, and secret
key transmission with an average energy constraint. We develop several code
conversions, which allow us to conclude non-trivial relations between the
capacities corresponding to the above tasks. We then show how the regularized,
energy-constrained coherent information is an achievable rate for all of the
tasks, whenever the energy observable satisfies the Gibbs condition of having a
well defined thermal state for all temperatures and the channel satisfies a
finite output-entropy condition. For degradable channels satisfying these
conditions, we find that the single-letter energy-constrained coherent
information is equal to all of the capacities. We finally apply our results to
degradable quantum Gaussian channels and recover several results already
established in the literature (in some cases, we prove new results in this
domain). Contrary to what may appear from some statements made in the
literature recently, proofs of these results do not require the solution of any
kind of minimum output-entropy conjecture or entropy photon-number inequality.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Cities: A Cybernetic Perspective on Urban Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Cities are changing constantly. All urban systems face different conditions
from day to day. Even when averaged regularities can be found, urban systems
will be more efficient if they can adapt to changes at the same speeds at which
these occur. Technology can assist humans in achieving this adaptation.
Inspired by cybernetics, we propose a description of cities as adaptive
systems. We identify three main components: information, algorithms, and
agents, which we illustrate with current and future examples. The implications
of adaptive cities are manifold, with direct impacts on mobility,
sustainability, resilience, governance, and society. Still, the potential of
adaptive cities will not depend so much on technology as on how we use it.

 <dc:title>Dense Motion Estimation for Smoke</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motion estimation for highly dynamic phenomena such as smoke is an open
challenge for Computer Vision. Traditional dense motion estimation algorithms
have difficulties with non-rigid and large motions, both of which are
frequently observed in smoke motion. We propose an algorithm for dense motion
estimation of smoke. Our algorithm is robust, fast, and has better performance
over different types of smoke compared to other dense motion estimation
algorithms, including state of the art and neural network approaches. The key
to our contribution is to use skeletal flow, without explicit point matching,
to provide a sparse flow. This sparse flow is upgraded to a dense flow. In this
paper we describe our algorithm in greater detail, and provide experimental
evidence to support our claims.

 <dc:title>In the Name of the Name: RDF literals, ER Attributes and the Potential

 <dc:creator>Peponakis, Manolis</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The aim of this study is to contribute to the field of machine-processable
bibliographic data that is suitable for the Semantic Web. We examine the Entity
Relationship (ER) model, which has been selected by IFLA as a &quot;conceptual
framework&quot; in order to model the FR family (FRBR, FRAD, and RDA), and the
problems ER causes as we move towards the Semantic Web. Subsequently, while
maintaining the semantics of the aforementioned standards but rejecting the ER
as a conceptual framework for bibliographic data, this paper builds on the RDF
(Resource Description Framework) potential and documents how both the RDF and
Linked Data's rationale can affect the way we model bibliographic data. In this
way, a new approach to bibliographic data emerges where the distinction between
description and authorities is obsolete. Instead, the integration of the
authorities with descriptive information becomes fundamental so that a network
of correlations can be established between the entities and the names by which
the entities are known. Naming is a vital issue for human cultures because
names are not random sequences of characters or sounds that stand just as
identifiers for the entities; they also have socio-cultural meanings and
interpretations. Thus, instead of describing indivisible resources, we could
describe entities that appear in a variety of names on various resources. In
this study, a method is proposed to connect the names with the entities they
represent and, in this way, to document the provenance of these names by
connecting specific resources with specific names.

 <dc:description>  An analytical model is presented for assessing the performance of the
bit-error-rate (BER) in the differential m-level phase shift keying (m-PSK)
transmission systems, where the influence of equalization enhanced phase noise
(EEPN) has been considered. Theoretical analysis has been carried out in
differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK), differential 8-PSK (D8PSK),
and differential 16-PSK (D16PSK) coherent optical transmission systems. The
influence of EEPN on the BER performance, in term of signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), are investigated for different fiber dispersion, LO laser linewidths,
symbol rates, and modulation formats. Our analytical model achieves a good
agreement with previously reported EEPN induced BER floors, and can give an
accurate prediction for the DQPSK system, and a leading-order approximation for
the D8PSK and the D16PSK systems.

 <dc:description>  There is overwhelming evidence that human intelligence is a product of
Darwinian evolution. Investigating the consequences of self-modification, and
more precisely, the consequences of utility function self-modification, leads
to the stronger claim that not only human, but any form of intelligence is
ultimately only possible within evolutionary processes. Human-designed
artificial intelligences can only remain stable until they discover how to
manipulate their own utility function. By definition, a human designer cannot
prevent a superhuman intelligence from modifying itself, even if protection
mechanisms against this action are put in place. Without evolutionary pressure,
sufficiently advanced artificial intelligences become inert by simplifying
their own utility function. Within evolutionary processes, the implicit utility
function is always reducible to persistence, and the control of superhuman
intelligences embedded in evolutionary processes is not possible. Mechanisms
against utility function self-modification are ultimately futile. Instead,
scientific effort toward the mitigation of existential risks from the
development of superintelligences should be in two directions: understanding
consciousness, and the complex dynamics of evolutionary systems.

 <dc:description>  The application of psychophysiology in human-computer interaction is a
growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of
physiological signals and analysis techniques. This paper focuses on the
aggregation of multiple physiological measurements, obtained from one or more
sensors. This approach requires the classification of relatively large samples
of multidimensional data, which must be associated to specific cognitive or
affective states. Researchers generally attempt to solve this problem by
utilising machine learning techniques. We present a short review to serve as a
primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core
concepts. We put special emphasis on work-related human-computer interface
applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports uses of
psychophysiology.
  This paper is an extract from a comprehensive review of the entire field of
ambulatory psychophysiology, including 12 similar chapters, plus application
guidelines and systematic review. Thus any citation should be made using the

 <dc:description>  This article proposes a performance analysis of kernel least squares support
vector machines (LS-SVMs) based on a random matrix approach, in the regime
where both the dimension of data $p$ and their number $n$ grow large at the
same rate. Under a two-class Gaussian mixture model for the input data, we
prove that the LS-SVM decision function is asymptotically normal with means and
covariances shown to depend explicitly on the derivatives of the kernel
function. This provides improved understanding along with new insights into the
internal workings of SVM-type methods for large datasets.

 <dc:description>  Today, money laundering (ML) poses a serious threat not only to financial
institutions but also to the nations. This criminal activity is becoming more
and more sophisticated and seems to have moved from the clichy of drug
trafficking to financing terrorism and surely not forgetting personal gain.
Most of the financial institutions internationally have been implementing
anti-money laundering solutions (AML) to fight investment fraud activities. In
AML, the customer identification is an important task which helps AML experts
to monitor customer habits: some being customer domicile, transactions that
they are involved in etc. However, simple query tools provided by current DBMS
as well as naive approaches in customer searching may produce incorrect and
ambiguous results and their processing time is also very high due to the
complexity of the database system architecture. In this paper, we present a new
approach for identifying customers registered in an investment bank. This
approach is developed as a tool that allows AML experts to quickly identify
customers who are managed independently across separate databases. It is tested
on real-world datasets, which are real and large financial datasets. Some
preliminary experimental results show that this new approach is efficient and
effective.

 <dc:description>  Traditional dehazing techniques, as a well studied topic in image processing,
are now widely used to eliminate the haze effects from individual images.
However, even the state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms may not provide
sufficient support to video analytics, as a crucial pre-processing step for
video-based decision making systems (e.g., robot navigation), due to the
limitations of these algorithms on poor result coherence and low processing
efficiency. This paper presents a new framework, particularly designed for
video dehazing, to output coherent results in real time, with two novel
techniques. Firstly, we decompose the dehazing algorithms into three generic
components, namely transmission map estimator, atmospheric light estimator and
haze-free image generator. They can be simultaneously processed by multiple
threads in the distributed system, such that the processing efficiency is
optimized by automatic CPU resource allocation based on the workloads.
Secondly, a cross-frame normalization scheme is proposed to enhance the
coherence among consecutive frames, by sharing the parameters of atmospheric
light from consecutive frames in the distributed computation platform. The
combination of these techniques enables our framework to generate highly
consistent and accurate dehazing results in real-time, by using only 3 PCs
connected by Ethernet.

 <dc:description>  Markov Random Fields (MRFs), a formulation widely used in generative image
modeling, have long been plagued by the lack of expressive power. This issue is
primarily due to the fact that conventional MRFs formulations tend to use
simplistic factors to capture local patterns. In this paper, we move beyond
such limitations, and propose a novel MRF model that uses fully-connected
neurons to express the complex interactions among pixels. Through theoretical
analysis, we reveal an inherent connection between this model and recurrent
neural networks, and thereon derive an approximated feed-forward network that
couples multiple RNNs along opposite directions. This formulation combines the
expressive power of deep neural networks and the cyclic dependency structure of
MRF in a unified model, bringing the modeling capability to a new level. The
feed-forward approximation also allows it to be efficiently learned from data.
Experimental results on a variety of low-level vision tasks show notable
improvement over state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:description>  Manual correction of speech transcription can involve a selection from
plausible transcriptions. Recent work has shown the feasibility of employing a
mismatched crowd for speech transcription. However, it is yet to be established
whether a mismatched worker has sufficiently fine-granular speech perception to
choose among the phonetically proximate options that are likely to be generated
from the trellis of an ASRU. Hence, we consider five languages, Arabic, German,
Hindi, Russian and Spanish. For each we generate synthetic, phonetically
proximate, options which emulate post-editing scenarios of varying difficulty.
We consistently observe non-trivial crowd ability to choose among fine-granular
options.

 <dc:title>Fast and Efficient Asynchronous Neural Computation with Adapting Spiking
  Neural Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zambrano, Davide</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Biological neurons communicate with a sparing exchange of pulses - spikes. It
is an open question how real spiking neurons produce the kind of powerful
neural computation that is possible with deep artificial neural networks, using
only so very few spikes to communicate. Building on recent insights in
neuroscience, we present an Adapting Spiking Neural Network (ASNN) based on
adaptive spiking neurons. These spiking neurons efficiently encode information
in spike-trains using a form of Asynchronous Pulsed Sigma-Delta coding while
homeostatically optimizing their firing rate. In the proposed paradigm of
spiking neuron computation, neural adaptation is tightly coupled to synaptic
plasticity, to ensure that downstream neurons can correctly decode upstream
spiking neurons. We show that this type of network is inherently able to carry
out asynchronous and event-driven neural computation, while performing
identical to corresponding artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, we
show that these adaptive spiking neurons can be drop in replacements for ReLU
neurons in standard feedforward ANNs comprised of such units. We demonstrate
that this can also be successfully applied to a ReLU based deep convolutional
neural network for classifying the MNIST dataset. The ASNN thus outperforms
current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implementations, while responding (up
to) an order of magnitude faster and using an order of magnitude fewer spikes.
Additionally, in a streaming setting where frames are continuously classified,
we show that the ASNN requires substantially fewer network updates as compared
to the corresponding ANN.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a new, optimization-based method to exhibit cyclic
behavior in non-reversible stochastic processes. While our method is general,
it is strongly motivated by discrete simulations of ordinary differential
equations representing non-reversible biological processes, in particular
molecular simulations. Here, the discrete time steps of the simulation are
often very small compared to the time scale of interest, i.e., of the whole
process. In this setting, the detection of a global cyclic behavior of the
process becomes difficult because transitions between individual states may
appear almost reversible on the small time scale of the simulation. We address
this difficulty using a mixed-integer programming model that allows us to
compute a cycle of clusters with maximum net flow, i.e., large forward and
small backward probability. For a synthetic genetic regulatory network
consisting of a ring-oscillator with three genes, we show that this approach
can detect the most productive overall cycle, outperforming classical spectral
analysis methods. Our method applies to general non-equilibrium steady state
systems such as catalytic reactions, for which the objective value computes the
effectiveness of the catalyst.

 <dc:title>Practical Data Compression for Modern Memory Hierarchies</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pekhimenko, Gennady</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Operating Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this thesis, we describe a new, practical approach to integrating
hardware-based data compression within the memory hierarchy, including on-chip
caches, main memory, and both on-chip and off-chip interconnects. This new
approach is fast, simple, and effective in saving storage space. A key insight
in our approach is that access time (including decompression latency) is
critical in modern memory hierarchies. By combining inexpensive hardware
support with modest OS support, our holistic approach to compression achieves
substantial improvements in performance and energy efficiency across the memory
hierarchy. Using this new approach, we make several major contributions in this
thesis. First, we propose a new compression algorithm, Base-Delta-Immediate
Compression (BDI), that achieves high compression ratio with very low
compression/decompression latency. BDI exploits the existing low dynamic range
of values present in many cache lines to compress them to smaller sizes using
Base+Delta encoding. Second, we observe that the compressed size of a cache
block can be indicative of its reuse. We use this observation to develop a new
cache insertion policy for compressed caches, the Size-based Insertion Policy
(SIP), which uses the size of a compressed block as one of the metrics to
predict its potential future reuse. Third, we propose a new main memory
compression framework, Linearly Compressed Pages (LCP), that significantly
reduces the complexity and power cost of supporting main memory compression. We
demonstrate that any compression algorithm can be adapted to fit the
requirements of LCP, and that LCP can be efficiently integrated with the
existing cache compression designs, avoiding extra compression/decompression.

 <dc:title>Quantitative recovery conditions for tree-based compressed sensing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  As shown in [Blumensath and Davies 2009, Baraniuk et al. 2010], signals whose
wavelet coefficients exhibit a rooted tree structure can be recovered using
specially-adapted compressed sensing algorithms from just n=O(k) measurements,
where k is the sparsity of the signal. Motivated by these results, we introduce
a simplified proportional-dimensional asymptotic framework which enables the
quantitative evaluation of recovery guarantees for tree-based compressed
sensing. In the context of Gaussian matrices, we apply this framework to
existing worst-case analysis of the Iterative Tree Projection (ITP) algorithm
which makes use of the tree-based Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Within
the same framework, we then obtain quantitative results based on a new method
of analysis, recently introduced in [Cartis and Thompson, 2015], which
considers the fixed points of the algorithm. By exploiting the realistic
average-case assumption that the measurements are statistically independent of
the signal, we obtain significant quantitative improvements when compared to
the tree-based RIP analysis. Our results have a refreshingly simple
interpretation, explicitly determining a bound on the number of measurements
that are required as a multiple of the sparsity. For example we prove that
exact recovery of binary tree-based signals from noiseless Gaussian
measurements is asymptotically guaranteed for ITP with constant stepsize
provided n&gt;50k. All our results extend to the more realistic case in which
measurements are corrupted by noise.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sub-surface scattering is key to our perception of translucent materials.
Models based on diffusion theory are used to render such materials in a
realistic manner by evaluating an approximation of the material BSSRDF at any
two points of the surface. Under the assumption of perpendicular incidence,
this BSSRDF approximation can be tabulated over 2 dimensions to provide fast
evaluation and importance sampling. However, accounting for non-perpendicular
incidence with the same approach would require to tabulate over 4 dimensions,
making the model too large for practical applications. In this report, we
present a method to efficiently evaluate and importance sample the
multi-scattering component of diffusion based BSSRDFs for non-perpendicular
incidence. Our approach is based on tabulating a compressed angular model of
Photon Beam Diffusion. We explain how to generate, evaluate and sample our
model. We show that 1 MiB is enough to store a model of the multi-scattering
BSSRDF that is within $0.5\%$ relative error of Photon Beam Diffusion. Finally,
we present a method to use our model in a Monte Carlo particle tracer and show
results of our implementation in PBRT.

 <dc:description>  Language change is a complex social phenomenon, revealing pathways of
communication and sociocultural influence. But, while language change has long
been a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research
methods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change
from differences between older and younger speakers. In this paper, we use a
data set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in
progress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social
influence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and &quot;netspeak&quot;
abbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken
language. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections
are more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We
find that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties
are significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality
appears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to
support the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically
local social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Visual saliency is a fundamental problem in both cognitive and computational
sciences, including computer vision. In this paper, we discover that a
high-quality visual saliency model can be learned from multiscale features
extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have had many
successes in visual recognition tasks. For learning such saliency models, we
introduce a neural network architecture, which has fully connected layers on
top of CNNs responsible for feature extraction at three different scales. The
penultimate layer of our neural network has been confirmed to be a
discriminative high-level feature vector for saliency detection, which we call
deep contrast feature. To generate a more robust feature, we integrate
handcrafted low-level features with our deep contrast feature. To promote
further research and evaluation of visual saliency models, we also construct a
new large database of 4447 challenging images and their pixelwise saliency
annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is
capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance on all public benchmarks,
improving the F- measure by 6.12% and 10.0% respectively on the DUT-OMRON
dataset and our new dataset (HKU-IS), and lowering the mean absolute error by
9% and 35.3% respectively on these two datasets.

 <dc:description>  While Boolean logic has been the backbone of digital information processing,
there are classes of computationally hard problems wherein this conventional
paradigm is fundamentally inefficient. Vertex coloring of graphs, belonging to
the class of combinatorial optimization represents such a problem; and is well
studied for its wide spectrum of applications in data sciences, life sciences,
social sciences and engineering and technology. This motivates alternate, and
more efficient non-Boolean pathways to their solution. Here, we demonstrate a
coupled relaxation oscillator based dynamical system that exploits the
insulator-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2), to efficiently solve the
vertex coloring of graphs. By harnessing the natural analogue between
optimization, pertinent to graph coloring solutions, and energy minimization
processes in highly parallel, interconnected dynamical systems, we harness the
physical manifestation of the latter process to approximate the optimal
coloring of k-partite graphs. We further indicate a fundamental connection
between the eigen properties of a linear dynamical system and the spectral
algorithms that can solve approximate graph coloring. Our work not only
elucidates a physics-based computing approach but also presents tantalizing
opportunities for building customized analog co-processors for solving hard
problems efficiently.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we advance a recently-proposed uncertainty decoding scheme for
DNN-HMM (deep neural network - hidden Markov model) hybrid systems. This
numerical sampling concept averages DNN outputs produced by a finite set of
feature samples (drawn from a probabilistic distortion model) to approximate
the posterior likelihoods of the context-dependent HMM states. As main
innovation, we propose a weighted DNN-output averaging based on a minimum
classification error criterion and apply it to a probabilistic distortion model
for spatial diffuseness features. The experimental evaluation is performed on
the 8-channel REVERB Challenge task using a DNN-HMM hybrid system with
multichannel front-end signal enhancement. We show that the recognition
accuracy of the DNN-HMM hybrid system improves by incorporating uncertainty
decoding based on random sampling and that the proposed weighted DNN-output
averaging further reduces the word error rate scores.

 <dc:title>Stability of higher-dimensional interval decomposable persistence

 <dc:description>  The algebraic stability theorem for pointwise finite dimensional (p.f.d.)
$\mathbb{R}$-persistence modules is a central result in the theory of stability
for persistence modules. We present a stability theorem for $n$-dimensional
rectangle decomposable p.f.d. persistence modules up to a constant $(2n-1)$
that is a generalization of the algebraic stability theorem. We give an example
to show that the bound cannot be improved for $n=2$. The same technique is then
applied to free $n$-dimensional modules and what we call triangle decomposable
modules, where we obtain smaller constants. The result for triangle
decomposable modules combined with work by Botnan and Lesnick proves a version
of the algebraic stability theorem for zigzag modules and the persistent
homology of Reeb graphs. We also prove slightly weaker versions of the results
for interval decomposable modules that are not assumed to be p.f.d.
  This work grew out of my master's degree at the Department of Mathematical
Sciences at NTNU.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a deep network architecture called DerainNet for removing rain
streaks from an image. Based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we
directly learn the mapping relationship between rainy and clean image detail
layers from data. Because we do not possess the ground truth corresponding to
real-world rainy images, we synthesize images with rain for training. In
contrast to other common strategies that increase depth or breadth of the
network, we use image processing domain knowledge to modify the objective
function and improve deraining with a modestly-sized CNN. Specifically, we
train our DerainNet on the detail (high-pass) layer rather than in the image
domain. Though DerainNet is trained on synthetic data, we find that the learned
network translates very effectively to real-world images for testing. Moreover,
we augment the CNN framework with image enhancement to improve the visual
results. Compared with state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods, our
method has improved rain removal and much faster computation time after network
training.

 <dc:description>  For any integers $d, n \geq 2$ and $1/({\min\{n,d\}})^{0.4999} &lt;
\varepsilon&lt;1$, we show the existence of a set of $n$ vectors $X\subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ such that any embedding $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ satisfying
$$ \forall x,y\in X,\ (1-\varepsilon)\|x-y\|_2^2\le \|f(x)-f(y)\|_2^2 \le
(1+\varepsilon)\|x-y\|_2^2 $$ must have $$ m = \Omega(\varepsilon^{-2} \lg n).
$$ This lower bound matches the upper bound given by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
lemma [JL84]. Furthermore, our lower bound holds for nearly the full range of
$\varepsilon$ of interest, since there is always an isometric embedding into
dimension $\min\{d, n\}$ (either the identity map, or projection onto
$\mathop{span}(X)$).
  Previously such a lower bound was only known to hold against linear maps $f$,
and not for such a wide range of parameters $\varepsilon, n, d$ [LN16]. The
best previously known lower bound for general $f$ was $m =
\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2}\lg n/\lg(1/\varepsilon))$ [Wel74, Lev83, Alo03], which
is suboptimal for any $\varepsilon = o(1)$.

 <dc:description>  The method of shifted partial derivatives was used to prove a
super-polynomial lower bound on the size of depth four circuits needed to
compute the permanent. We show that this method alone cannot prove that the
padded permanent $\ell^{n-m} perm_m$ cannot be realized inside the
$GL_{n^2}$-orbit closure of the determinant $ det_n$ when $n&gt;2m^2+2m$. Our
proof relies on several simple degenerations of the determinant polynomial,
Macaulay's theorem that gives a lower bound on the growth of an ideal, and a
lower bound estimate from Gupta et. al. regarding the shifted partial
derivatives of the determinant.

 <dc:description>  The availability of public computing resources in the cloud has
revolutionized data analysis, but requesting cloud resources often involves
complex decisions for consumers. Under the current pricing mechanisms, cloud
service providers offer several service options and charge consumers based on
the resources they use. Before they can decide which cloud resources to
request, consumers have to estimate the completion time and cost of their
computational tasks for different service options and possibly for different
service providers. This estimation is challenging even for expert cloud users.
We propose a new market-based framework for pricing computational tasks in the
cloud. Our framework introduces an agent between consumers and cloud providers.
The agent takes data and computational tasks from users, estimates time and
cost for evaluating the tasks, and returns to consumers contracts that specify
the price and completion time. Our framework can be applied directly to
existing cloud markets without altering the way cloud providers offer and price
services. In addition, it simplifies cloud use for consumers by allowing them
to compare contracts, rather than choose resources directly. We present design,
analytical, and algorithmic contributions focusing on pricing computation
contracts, analyzing their properties, and optimizing them in complex
workflows. We conduct an experimental evaluation of our market framework over a
real-world cloud service and demonstrate empirically that our market ensures
three key properties: competitiveness, fairness, and resilience. Finally, we
present a fine-grained pricing mechanism for complex workflows and show that it
can increase agent profits by more than an order of magnitude in some cases.

 <dc:title>Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Division for Multiuser MISO Broadcast

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a discrete-time multiuser multiple-input single-output
(MISO) Gaussian broadcast channel~(BC), in which channel state information
(CSI) is available at both the transmitter and the receivers. The flexible and
explicit design of a uniquely decomposable constellation group (UDCG) is
provided based on pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and rectangular quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. With this, a modulation division
(MD) transmission scheme is developed for the MISO BC. The proposed MD scheme
enables each receiver to uniquely and efficiently detect their desired signals
from the superposition of mutually interfering cochannel signals in the absence
of noise. In our design, the optimal transmitter beamforming problem is solved
in a closed-form for two-user MISO BC using max-min fairness as a design
criterion. Then, for a general case with more than two receivers, we develop a
user-grouping-based beamforming scheme, where the grouping method, beamforming
vector design and power allocation problems are addressed by using weighted
max-min fairness. It is shown that our proposed approach has a lower
probability of error compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) method when the
Hermitian angle between the two channel vectors is small in a two-user case. In
addition, simulation results also reveal that for the general channel model
with more than two users, our user-grouping-based scheme significantly
outperforms the ZF, time division (TD), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and
signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) based techniques in moderate and high
SNR regimes when the number of users approaches to the number of base station
(BS) antennas and it degrades into the ZF scheme when the number of users is
far less than the number of BS antennas in Rayleigh fading channels.

 <dc:description>  This work studies the impact of time- synchronization in molecular timing
(MT) channels by analyzing three different modulation techniques. The first
requires transmitter-receiver synchronization and is based on modulating
information on the release timing of information particles. The other two are
asynchronous and are based on modulating information on the relative time
between two consecutive releases of information particles using
indistinguishable or distinguishable particles. All modulation schemes result
in a system that relate the transmitted and the received signals through an
additive noise, which follows a stable distribution. As the common notion of
the variance of a signal is not suitable for defining the power of stable
distributed signals (due to infinite variance), we derive an expression for the
geometric power of a large class of stable distributions, and then use this
result to characterize the geometric signal-to-noise ratio (G-SNR) for each of
the modulation techniques. In addition, for binary communication, we derive the
optimal detection rules for each modulation technique. Numerical evaluations
indicate that the bit error rate (BER) is constant for a given G-SNR, and the
performance gain obtained by using synchronized communication is significant.
Yet, it is also shown that by using two distinguishable particles per bit
instead of one, the BER of the asynchronous technique can approach that of the
synchronous one.

 <dc:description>  In a variety of application domains the content to be recommended to users is
associated with text. This includes research papers, movies with associated
plot summaries, news articles, blog posts, etc. Recommendation approaches based
on latent factor models can be extended naturally to leverage text by employing
an explicit mapping from text to factors. This enables recommendations for new,
unseen content, and may generalize better, since the factors for all items are
produced by a compactly-parametrized model. Previous work has used topic models
or averages of word embeddings for this mapping. In this paper we present a
method leveraging deep recurrent neural networks to encode the text sequence
into a latent vector, specifically gated recurrent units (GRUs) trained
end-to-end on the collaborative filtering task. For the task of scientific
paper recommendation, this yields models with significantly higher accuracy. In
cold-start scenarios, we beat the previous state-of-the-art, all of which
ignore word order. Performance is further improved by multi-task learning,
where the text encoder network is trained for a combination of content
recommendation and item metadata prediction. This regularizes the collaborative
filtering model, ameliorating the problem of sparsity of the observed rating
matrix.

 <dc:description>  Degrees of freedom (DoF) is studied in the downlink of a heterogenous
wireless network modeled as a two-layered interference network. The first layer
of the interference network is the backhaul layer between macro base stations
(MB) and small cell base stations (SB), which is modeled as a Wyner type linear
network. The second layer is the transmission layer between SBs and mobile
terminals (MTs), which is modeled as a linear Wyner $L_T$ network, i.e., each
MT is connected to $L_T+1$ SBs. The SBs are assumed to be half-duplex, thus
restricting the per user degrees of freedom (puDoF) in the system to $1/2$. The
puDoF can be further restricted by the number of antennas at the MB. For $L_T
\in \{1,2\}$, the optimal puDoF can be achieved by using simple interference
avoidance schemes. The increase in the connectivity of transmission layer
beyond $L_T=2$ limits the achievable puDoF using only zero-forcing schemes to
less than 1/2, even in the presence of large number of antennas at each MB but
the optimal puDoF can be achieved by making each message available at multiple
SBs. This is done by sending an appropriate linear combination to the SB to
zero-force interference at the intended user. The maximum per user DoF of 1/2
can be achieved in the linear network with sufficient number of antennas using
only interference avoidance schemes. These results are also extended to a more
realistic hexagonal cellular model as well.

 <dc:description>  Research on generative models is a central project in the emerging field of
network science, and it studies how statistical patterns found in real networks
could be generated by formal rules. Output from these generative models is then
the basis for designing and evaluating computational methods on networks, and
for verification and simulation studies. During the last two decades, a variety
of models has been proposed with an ultimate goal of achieving comprehensive
realism for the generated networks. In this study, we (a) introduce a new
generator, termed ReCoN; (b) explore how ReCoN and some existing models can be
fitted to an original network to produce a structurally similar replica, (c)
use ReCoN to produce networks much larger than the original exemplar, and
finally (d) discuss open problems and promising research directions. In a
comparative experimental study, we find that ReCoN is often superior to many
other state-of-the-art network generation methods. We argue that ReCoN is a
scalable and effective tool for modeling a given network while preserving
important properties at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and for scaling the
exemplar data by orders of magnitude in size.

 <dc:title>UberNet: Training a `Universal' Convolutional Neural Network for Low-,

 <dc:description>  In this work we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) that jointly
handles low-, mid-, and high-level vision tasks in a unified architecture that
is trained end-to-end. Such a universal network can act like a `swiss knife'
for vision tasks; we call this architecture an UberNet to indicate its
overarching nature.
  We address two main technical challenges that emerge when broadening up the
range of tasks handled by a single CNN: (i) training a deep architecture while
relying on diverse training sets and (ii) training many (potentially unlimited)
tasks with a limited memory budget. Properly addressing these two problems
allows us to train accurate predictors for a host of tasks, without
compromising accuracy.
  Through these advances we train in an end-to-end manner a CNN that
simultaneously addresses (a) boundary detection (b) normal estimation (c)
saliency estimation (d) semantic segmentation (e) human part segmentation (f)
semantic boundary detection, (g) region proposal generation and object
detection. We obtain competitive performance while jointly addressing all of
these tasks in 0.7 seconds per frame on a single GPU. A demonstration of this
system can be found at http://cvn.ecp.fr/ubernet/.

 <dc:title>Optimizing Codes for Source Separation in Color Image Demosaicing and
  Compressive Video Recovery</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kotwal, Alankar</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rajwade, Ajit</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There exist several applications in image processing (eg: video compressed
sensing [Hitomi, Y. et al, &quot;Video from a single coded exposure photograph using
a learned overcomplete dictionary&quot;] and color image demosaicing [Moghadam, A.
A. et al, &quot;Compressive Framework for Demosaicing of Natural Images&quot;]) which
require separation of constituent images given measurements in the form of a
coded superposition of those images. Physically practical code patterns in
these applications are non-negative, systematically structured, and do not
always obey the nice incoherence properties of other patterns such as Gaussian
codes, which can adversely affect reconstruction performance. The contribution
of this paper is to design code patterns for video compressed sensing and
demosaicing by minimizing the mutual coherence of the matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi
\Psi}$ where $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ represents the sensing matrix created from the
code, and $\boldsymbol{\Psi}$ is the signal representation matrix. Our main
contribution is that we explicitly take into account the special structure of
those code patterns as required by these applications: (1)~non-negativity,
(2)~block-diagonal nature, and (3)~circular shifting. In particular, the last
property enables for accurate and seamless patch-wise reconstruction for some
important compressed sensing architectures.

 <dc:description>  Various methods to automate traffic data collection have recently been
developed by many researchers. A macroscopic data collection through image
processing has been proposed. For microscopic traffic flow data, such as
individual speed and time or distance headway, tracking of individual movement
is needed. The tracking algorithms for pedestrian or vehicle have been
developed to trace the movement of one or two pedestrians based on sign
pattern, and feature detection. No research has been done to track many
pedestrians or vehicles at once. This paper describes a new and fast algorithm
to track the movement of many individual vehicles or pedestrians

 <dc:description>  We consider a non-stationary formulation of the stochastic multi-armed bandit
where the rewards are no longer assumed to be identically distributed. For the
best-arm identification task, we introduce a version of Successive Elimination
based on random shuffling of the $K$ arms. We prove that under a novel and mild
assumption on the mean gap $\Delta$, this simple but powerful modification
achieves the same guarantees in term of sample complexity and cumulative regret
than its original version, but in a much wider class of problems, as it is not
anymore constrained to stationary distributions. We also show that the original
{\sc Successive Elimination} fails to have controlled regret in this more
general scenario, thus showing the benefit of shuffling. We then remove our
mild assumption and adapt the algorithm to the best-arm identification task
with switching arms. We adapt the definition of the sample complexity for that
case and prove that, against an optimal policy with $N-1$ switches of the
optimal arm, this new algorithm achieves an expected sample complexity of
$O(\Delta^{-2}\sqrt{NK\delta^{-1} \log(K \delta^{-1})})$, where $\delta$ is the
probability of failure of the algorithm, and an expected cumulative regret of
$O(\Delta^{-1}{\sqrt{NTK \log (TK)}})$ after $T$ time steps.

effectiveness of the dominance of one class in the data they process. We aim at
understanding if there is any positive or negative bias in workers seeing many
negative examples in the identification of positive labels. To test our
hypothesis, we design an experiment where crowd workers are asked to judge the
relevance of documents presented in different orders. Our findings indicate
that there is a significant improvement in the quality of relevance judgements
when presenting relevant results before the non-relevant ones.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the distributed sampled-data control problem of a group
of mobile robots connected via distance-induced proximity networks. A dwell
time is assumed in order to avoid chattering in the neighbor relations that may
be caused by abrupt changes of positions when updating information from
neighbors. Distributed sampled-data control laws are designed based on nearest
neighbour rules, which in conjunction with continuous-time dynamics results in
hybrid closed-loop systems. For uniformly and independently initial states, a
sufficient condition is provided to guarantee synchronization for the system
without leaders. In order to steer all robots to move with the desired
orientation and speed, we then introduce a number of leaders into the system,
and quantitatively establish the proportion of leaders needed to track either
constant or time-varying signals. All these conditions depend only on the
neighborhood radius, the maximum initial moving speed and the dwell time,
without assuming a prior properties of the neighbor graphs as are used in most
of the existing literature.

 <dc:description>  We study the dynamics of an online algorithm for learning a sparse leading
eigenvector from samples generated from a spiked covariance model. This
algorithm combines the classical Oja's method for online PCA with an
element-wise nonlinearity at each iteration to promote sparsity. In the
high-dimensional limit, the joint empirical measure of the underlying sparse
eigenvector and its estimate provided by the algorithm is shown to converge
weakly to a deterministic, measure-valued process. This scaling limit is
characterized as the unique solution of a nonlinear PDE, and it provides exact
information regarding the asymptotic performance of the algorithm. For example,
performance metrics such as the cosine similarity and the misclassification
rate in sparse support recovery can be obtained by examining the limiting
dynamics. A steady-state analysis of the nonlinear PDE also reveals an
interesting phase transition phenomenon. Although our analysis is asymptotic in
nature, numerical simulations show that the theoretical predictions are
accurate for moderate signal dimensions.

 <dc:description>  Energy transparency is a concept that makes a program's energy consumption
visible, from hardware up to software, through the different system layers.
Such transparency can enable energy optimizations at each layer and between
layers, and help both programmers and operating systems make energy-aware
decisions. In this paper, we focus on deeply embedded devices, typically used
for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, and demonstrate how to enable energy
transparency through existing Static Resource Analysis (SRA) techniques and a
new target-agnostic profiling technique, without hardware energy measurements.
Our novel mapping technique enables software energy consumption estimations at
a higher level than the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), namely the LLVM
Intermediate Representation (IR) level, and therefore introduces energy
transparency directly to the LLVM optimizer. We apply our energy estimation
techniques to a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including single- and also
multi-threaded embedded programs from two commonly used concurrency patterns,
task farms and pipelines. Using SRA, our LLVM IR results demonstrate a high
accuracy with a deviation in the range of 1% from the ISA SRA. Our profiling
technique captures the actual energy consumption at the LLVM IR level with an
average error of 3%.

 <dc:description>  Many security techniques working at the physical layer need a correct channel
state information (CSI) at the transmitter, especially when devices are
equipped with multiple antennas. Therefore such techniques are vulnerable to
pilot contamination attacks (PCAs) by which an attacker aims at inducing false
CSI. In this paper we provide a solution to some PCA methods, by letting two
legitimate parties to compare their channel estimates. The comparison is made
in order to minimize the information leakage on the channel to a possible
attacker. By reasonable assumptions on both the channel knowledge by the
attacker and the correlation properties of the attacker and legitimate channels
we show the validity of our solution. An accurate analysis of possible attacks
and countermeasures is provided, together with a numerical evaluation of the
attainable secrecy outage probability when our solution is used in conjunction
with beamforming for secret communications.

 <dc:description>  In this contribution, we introduce an efficient method for solving the
optimal control problem for an unconstrained nonlinear switched system with an
arbitrary cost function. We assume that the sequence of the switching modes are
given but the switching time in between consecutive modes remains to be
optimized. The proposed method uses a two-stage approach as introduced by Xu
and Antsaklis (2004) where the original optimal control problem is transcribed
into an equivalent problem parametrized by the switching times and the optimal
control policy is obtained based on the solution of a two-point boundary value
differential equation. The main contribution of this paper is to use a
Sequential Linear Quadratic approach to synthesize the optimal controller
instead of solving a boundary value problem. The proposed method is numerically
more efficient and scales very well to the high dimensional problems. In order
to evaluate its performance, we use two numerical examples as benchmarks to
compare against the baseline algorithm. In the third numerical example, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the Center of Mass control problem in a
quadruped robot locomotion task.

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic models with discrete latent variables naturally capture
datasets composed of discrete classes. However, they are difficult to train
efficiently, since backpropagation through discrete variables is generally not
possible. We present a novel method to train a class of probabilistic models
with discrete latent variables using the variational autoencoder framework,
including backpropagation through the discrete latent variables. The associated
class of probabilistic models comprises an undirected discrete component and a
directed hierarchical continuous component. The discrete component captures the
distribution over the disconnected smooth manifolds induced by the continuous
component. As a result, this class of models efficiently learns both the class
of objects in an image, and their specific realization in pixels, from
unsupervised data, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets.

 <dc:description>  Estimators of information theoretic measures such as entropy and mutual
information are a basic workhorse for many downstream applications in modern
data science. State of the art approaches have been either geometric (nearest
neighbor (NN) based) or kernel based (with a globally chosen bandwidth). In
this paper, we combine both these approaches to design new estimators of
entropy and mutual information that outperform state of the art methods. Our
estimator uses local bandwidth choices of $k$-NN distances with a finite $k$,
independent of the sample size. Such a local and data dependent choice improves
performance in practice, but the bandwidth is vanishing at a fast rate, leading
to a non-vanishing bias. We show that the asymptotic bias of the proposed
estimator is universal; it is independent of the underlying distribution.
Hence, it can be pre-computed and subtracted from the estimate. As a byproduct,
we obtain a unified way of obtaining both kernel and NN estimators. The
corresponding theoretical contribution relating the asymptotic geometry of
nearest neighbors to order statistics is of independent mathematical interest.

 <dc:description>  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that
can produce images of the eye at the microscopic level. OCT image segmentation
to localise retinal layer boundaries is a fundamental procedure for diagnosing
and monitoring the progression of retinal and optical nerve disorders. In this
paper, we introduce a novel and accurate geodesic distance method (GDM) for OCT
segmentation of both healthy and pathological images in either two- or
three-dimensional spaces. The method uses a weighted geodesic distance by an
exponential function, taking into account both horizontal and vertical
intensity variations. The weighted geodesic distance is efficiently calculated
from an Eikonal equation via the fast sweeping method. The segmentation is then
realised by solving an ordinary differential equation with the geodesic
distance. The results of the GDM are compared with manually segmented retinal
layer boundaries/surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GDM is robust to complex retinal structures with large curvatures and
irregularities and it outperforms the parametric active contour algorithm as
well as the graph theoretic based approaches for delineating the retinal layers
in both healthy and pathological images.

 <dc:description>  Though deep learning has pushed the boundaries of classification forward, in
recent years hints of the limits of standard classification have begun to
emerge. Problems such as fooling, adding new classes over time, and the need to
retrain learning models only for small changes to the original problem all
point to a potential shortcoming in the classic classification regime, where a
comprehensive a priori knowledge of the possible classes or concepts is
critical. Without such knowledge, classifiers misjudge the limits of their
knowledge and overgeneralization therefore becomes a serious obstacle to
consistent performance. In response to these challenges, this paper extends the
classic regime by reframing classification instead with the assumption that
concepts present in the training set are only a sample of the hypothetical
final set of concepts. To bring learning models into this new paradigm, a novel
elaboration of standard architectures called the competitive overcomplete
output layer (COOL) neural network is introduced. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of COOL by applying it to fooling, separable concept learning,
one-class neural networks, and standard classification benchmarks. The results
suggest that, unlike conventional classifiers, the amount of generalization in
COOL networks can be tuned to match the problem.

 <dc:title>Optimal ALOHA-like Random Access with Heterogeneous QoS Guarantees for

 <dc:description>  There is a paucity of random access protocols designed for alleviating
collisions in visible light communication (VLC) systems, where carrier sensing
is hard to be achieved due to the directionality of light. To resolve the
problem of collisions, we adopt the successive interference cancellation (SIC)
algorithm to enable the coordinator to simultaneously communicate with multiple
devices, which is referred to as the multi-packet reception (MPR) capability.
However, the MPR capability could be fully utilized only when random access
algorithms are properly designed. Considering the characteristics of the SIC
aided random access VLC system, we propose a novel effective capacity
(EC)-based ALOHA-like distributed random access algorithm for MPR-aided uplink
VLC systems having heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. Firstly,
we model the VLC network as a conflict graph and derive the EC for each device.
Then, we formulate the VLC QoS-guaranteed random access problem as a saturation
throughput maximization problem subject to multiple statistical QoS
constraints. Finally, the resultant non-concave optimization problem (OP) is
solved by a memetic search algorithm relying on invasive weed optimization and
differential evolution (IWO-DE). We demonstrate that our derived EC expression
matches the Monte Carlo simulation results accurately, and the performance of
our proposed algorithms is competitive.

 <dc:description>  Hebbian plasticity is a powerful principle that allows biological brains to
learn from their lifetime experience. By contrast, artificial neural networks
trained with backpropagation generally have fixed connection weights that do
not change once training is complete. While recent methods can endow neural
networks with long-term memories, Hebbian plasticity is currently not amenable
to gradient descent. Here we derive analytical expressions for activity
gradients in neural networks with Hebbian plastic connections. Using these
expressions, we can use backpropagation to train not just the baseline weights
of the connections, but also their plasticity. As a result, the networks &quot;learn
how to learn&quot; in order to solve the problem at hand: the trained networks
automatically perform fast learning of unpredictable environmental features
during their lifetime, expanding the range of solvable problems. We test the
algorithm on various on-line learning tasks, including pattern completion,
one-shot learning, and reversal learning. The algorithm successfully learns how
to learn the relevant associations from one-shot instruction, and fine-tunes
the temporal dynamics of plasticity to allow for continual learning in response
to changing environmental parameters. We conclude that backpropagation of
Hebbian plasticity offers a powerful model for lifelong learning.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, auto insurance companies set personalized insurance rate based on
data gathered directly from their customers' cars. In this paper, we show such
a personalized insurance mechanism -- wildly adopted by many auto insurance
companies -- is vulnerable to exploit. In particular, we demonstrate that an
adversary can leverage off-the-shelf hardware to manipulate the data to the
device that collects drivers' habits for insurance rate customization and
obtain a fraudulent insurance discount. In response to this type of attack, we
also propose a defense mechanism that escalates the protection for insurers'
data collection. The main idea of this mechanism is to augment the insurer's
data collection device with the ability to gather unforgeable data acquired
from the physical world, and then leverage these data to identify manipulated
data points. Our defense mechanism leveraged a statistical model built on
unmanipulated data and is robust to manipulation methods that are not foreseen
previously. We have implemented this defense mechanism as a proof-of-concept
prototype and tested its effectiveness in the real world. Our evaluation shows
that our defense mechanism exhibits a false positive rate of 0.032 and a false
negative rate of 0.013.

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic modeling is one of the foundations of modern machine learning
and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel type of
probabilistic models named latent dependency forest models (LDFMs). A LDFM
models the dependencies between random variables with a forest structure that
can change dynamically based on the variable values. It is therefore capable of
modeling context-specific independence. We parameterize a LDFM using a
first-order non-projective dependency grammar. Learning LDFMs from data can be
formulated purely as a parameter learning problem, and hence the difficult
problem of model structure learning is circumvented. Our experimental results
show that LDFMs are competitive with existing probabilistic models.

 <dc:description>  One of the objectives of understanding pedestrian behavior is to predict the
effect of proposed changes in the design or evaluation of pedestrian
facilities. We want to know the impact to the user of the facilities, as the
design of the facilities change. That impact was traditionally evaluated by
level of service standards. Another design criterion to measure the impact of
design change is measured by the pedestrian flow performance index. This paper
describes the determination of pedestrian flow performance based video tracking
or any microscopic pedestrian simulation models. Most of pedestrian researches
have been done on a macroscopic level, which is an aggregation of all
pedestrian movement in pedestrian areas into flow, average speed and area
module. Macroscopic level, however, does not consider the interaction between
pedestrians. It is also not well suited for prediction of pedestrian flow
performance in pedestrian areas or in buildings with some obstruction, that
reduces the effective width of the walkways. On the other hand, the microscopic
level has a more general usage and considers detail in the design. More
efficient pedestrian flow can even be reached with less space. Those results
have rejected the linearity assumption of space and flow in the macroscopic
level.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of super-resolving the line spectrum of a
multisinusoidal signal from a finite number of samples, some of which may be
completely corrupted. Measurements of this form can be modeled as an additive
mixture of a sinusoidal and a sparse component. We propose to demix the two
components and super-resolve the spectrum of the multisinusoidal signal by
solving a convex program. Our main theoretical result is that-- up to
logarithmic factors-- this approach is guaranteed to be successful with high
probability for a number of spectral lines that is linear in the number of
measurements, even if a constant fraction of the data are outliers. The result
holds under the assumption that the phases of the sinusoidal and sparse
components are random and the line spectrum satisfies a minimum-separation
condition. We show that the method can be implemented via semidefinite
programming and explain how to adapt it in the presence of dense perturbations,
as well as exploring its connection to atomic-norm denoising. In addition, we
propose a fast greedy demixing method which provides good empirical results
when coupled with a local nonconvex-optimization step.

 <dc:description>  Recently we proposed relative observability for supervisory control of
discrete-event systems under partial observation. Relative observability is
closed under set unions and hence there exists the supremal relatively
observable sublanguage of a given language. In this paper we present a new
characterization of relative observability, based on which an operator on
languages is proposed whose largest fixpoint is the supremal relatively
observable sublanguage. Iteratively applying this operator yields a monotone
sequence of languages; exploiting the linguistic concept of support based on
Nerode equivalence, we prove for regular languages that the sequence converges
finitely to the supremal relatively observable sublanguage, and the operator is
effectively computable. Moreover, for the purpose of control, we propose a
second operator that in the regular case computes the supremal relatively
observable and controllable sublanguage. The computational effectiveness of the
operator is demonstrated on a case study.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the real achievable performance of mobile ad hoc networks
(MANETs) under practical network constraints is of great importance for their
applications in future highly heterogeneous wireless network environments. This
paper explores, for the first time, the performance modeling for MANETs under a
general limited buffer constraint, where each network node maintains a limited
source buffer of size $B_s$ to store its locally generated packets and also a
limited shared relay buffer of size $B_r$ to store relay packets for other
nodes. Based on the Queuing theory and birth-death chain theory, we first
develop a general theoretical framework to fully depict the source/relay buffer
occupancy process in such a MANET, which applies to any distributed MAC
protocol and any mobility model that leads to the uniform distribution of
nodes' locations in steady state. With the help of this framework, we then
derive the exact expressions of several key network performance metrics,
including achievable throughput, throughput capacity, and expected end-to-end
delay. We further conduct case studies under two network scenarios and provide
the corresponding theoretical/simulation results to demonstrate the application
as well as the efficiency of our theoretical framework. Finally, we present
extensive numerical results to illustrate the impacts of buffer constraint on
the performance of a buffer-limited MANET.

 <dc:description>  Generalized matrix approximation plays a fundamental role in many machine
learning problems, such as CUR decomposition, kernel approximation, and matrix
low rank approximation. Especially with today's applications involved in larger
and larger dataset, more and more efficient generalized matrix approximation
algorithems become a crucially important research issue. In this paper, we find
new sketching techniques to reduce the size of the original data matrix to
develop new matrix approximation algorithms. Our results derive a much tighter
bound for the approximation than previous works: we obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$
approximation ratio with small sketched dimensions which implies a more
efficient generalized matrix approximation.

 <dc:title>Deformable Map Matching for Uncertain Loop-Less Maps</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tanaka, Kanji</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the classical context of robotic mapping and localization, map matching is
typically defined as the task of finding a rigid transformation (i.e., 3DOF
rotation/translation on the 2D moving plane) that aligns the query and
reference maps built by mobile robots. This definition is valid in loop-rich
trajectories that enable a mapper robot to close many loops, for which precise
maps can be assumed. The same cannot be said about the newly emerging
autonomous navigation and driving systems, which typically operate in loop-less
trajectories that have no large loop (e.g., straight paths). In this paper, we
propose a solution that overcomes this limitation by merging the two maps. Our
study is motivated by the observation that even when there is no large loop in
either the query or reference map, many loops can often be obtained in the
merged map. We add two new aspects to map matching: (1) image retrieval with
discriminative deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features, which
efficiently generates a small number of good initial alignment hypotheses; and
(2) map merge, which jointly deforms the two maps to minimize differences in
shape between them. To realize practical computation time, we also present a
preemption scheme that avoids excessive evaluation of useless map-matching
hypotheses. To verify our approach experimentally, we created a novel
collection of uncertain loop-less maps by utilizing the recently published
North Campus Long-Term (NCLT) dataset and its ground-truth GPS data. The
results obtained using these map collections confirm that our approach improves
on previous map-matching approaches.

 <dc:title>Learning Action Concept Trees and Semantic Alignment Networks from

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Action classification in still images has been a popular research topic in
computer vision. Labelling large scale datasets for action classification
requires tremendous manual work, which is hard to scale up. Besides, the action
categories in such datasets are pre-defined and vocabularies are fixed. However
humans may describe the same action with different phrases, which leads to the
difficulty of vocabulary expansion for traditional fully-supervised methods. We
observe that large amounts of images with sentence descriptions are readily
available on the Internet. The sentence descriptions can be regarded as weak
labels for the images, which contain rich information and could be used to
learn flexible expressions of action categories. We propose a method to learn
an Action Concept Tree (ACT) and an Action Semantic Alignment (ASA) model for
classification from image-description data via a two-stage learning process. A
new dataset for the task of learning actions from descriptions is built.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms several baseline methods
significantly.

 <dc:title>Resource Allocation for CoMP in Cellular Networks with Base Station

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Base station switching (BSS) can results in significant reduction in energy
consumption of cellular networks during low traffic conditions. We show that
the coverage loss due to BSS can be compensated via coordinated multi-point
(CoMP) based transmission in a cluster of base stations. For a BSS with CoMP
based system, we propose various BSS patterns to achieve suitable trade-offs
between energy savings and throughput. We formulate the CoMP resource
allocation and user scheduling as a joint optimization problem. We derive the
optimal time fraction and user scheduling for this problem and use it to
formulate a simplified BSS with CoMP optimization problem. A heuristic that
solves this problem is presented. Through extensive simulations, we show that
suitable trade-offs among energy, coverage, and rate can be achieved by
appropriately selecting the BSS pattern, CoMP cluster, and rate threshold.

 <dc:description>  The application of physical layer security in ad hoc networks has attracted
considerable academic attention recently. However, the available studies mainly
focus on the single-hop and two-hop network scenarios, and the price in terms
of degradation of communication quality of service (QoS) caused by improving
security is largely uninvestigated. As a step to address these issues, this
paper explores the physical layer security-aware routing and performance
tradeoffs in a multi-hop ad hoc network. Specifically, for any given end-to-end
path we first derive its connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage
probability (SOP) in closed-form, which serve as the performance metrics of
communication QoS and transmission security, respectively. Based on the
closed-form expressions, we then study the security-QoS tradeoffs to minimize
COP (resp. SOP) conditioned on that SOP (resp. COP) is guaranteed. With the
help of analysis of a given path, we further propose the routing algorithms
which can achieve the optimal performance tradeoffs for any pair of source and
destination nodes in a distributed manner. Finally, simulation and numerical
results are presented to validate the efficiency of our theoretical analysis,
as well as to illustrate the security-QoS tradeoffs and the routing
performance.

 <dc:title>Performance Analysis of CSMA with Multi-Packet Reception: The
  Inhomogeneous Case</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ashrafi, Shwan</dc:creator>

 <dc:creator>Roy, Sumit</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) with multi-packet
reception (MPR) is studied. Most prior work has focused on the homogeneous
case, where all the mobile users are assumed to have identical packet arrival
rates and transmission probabilities. The inhomogeneous case remains largely
open in the literature. In this work, we make a first step towards this open
problem by deriving throughput and delay expressions for inhomogeneous CSMA,
with a particular focus on a family of MPR models called the &quot;all-or-nothing&quot;
symmetric MPR. This family of MPR models allows us to overcome several
technical challenges associated with conventional analysis and to derive
accurate throughput and delay expressions in the large-systems regime.
Interestingly, this family of MPR models is still general enough to include a
number of useful MPR techniques - such as successive interference cancellation
(SIC), compute-and-forward (C&amp;F), and successive compute-and-forward (SCF) - as
special cases. Based on these throughput and delay expressions, we provide
theoretical guidelines for meeting quality-of-service requirements and for
achieving global stability; we also evaluate the performances of various MPR
techniques, highlighting the clear advantages offered by SCF.

 <dc:title>Soft Recovery Through $\ell_{1,2}$ Minimization with Applications in

 <dc:description>  This article provides a new type of analysis of a compressed-sensing based
technique for recovering column-sparse matrices, namely minimization of the
$\ell_{1,2}$-norm. Rather than providing conditions on the measurement matrix
which guarantees the solution of the program to be exactly equal to the ground
truth signal (which already has been thoroughly investigated), it presents a
condition which guarantees that the solution is approximately equal to the
ground truth. Soft recovery statements of this kind are to the best knowledge
of the author a novelty in Compressed Sensing. Apart from the theoretical
analysis, we present two heuristic proposes how this property of the
$\ell_{1,2}$-program can be utilized to design algorithms for recovery of
matrices which are sparse and have low rank at the same time.

 <dc:description>  Computer networks have become a critical infrastructure. Designing dependable
computer networks however is challenging, as such networks should not only meet
strict requirements in terms of correctness, availability, and performance, but
they should also be flexible enough to support fast updates, e.g., due to a
change in the security policy, an increasing traffic demand, or a failure. The
advent of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) promises to provide such
flexiblities, allowing to update networks in a fine-grained manner, also
enabling a more online traffic engineering. In this paper, we present a
structured survey of mechanisms and protocols to update computer networks in a
fast and consistent manner. In particular, we identify and discuss the
different desirable update consistency properties a network should provide, the
algorithmic techniques which are needed to meet these consistency properties,
their implications on the speed and costs at which updates can be performed. We
also discuss the relationship of consistent network update problems to classic
algorithmic optimization problems. While our survey is mainly motivated by the
advent of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), the fundamental underlying problems
are not new, and we also provide a historical perspective of the subject.

 <dc:description>  The channel law for amplitude-modulated solitons transmitted through a
nonlinear optical fibre with ideal distributed amplification and a receiver
based on the nonlinear Fourier transform is a noncentral chi-distribution with
$2n$ degrees of freedom, where $n=2$ and $n=3$ correspond to the single- and
dual-polarisation cases, respectively. In this paper, we study capacity lower
bounds of this channel under an average power constraint in bits per channel
use. We develop an asymptotic semi-analytic approximation for a capacity lower
bound for arbitrary $n$ and a Rayleigh input distribution. It is shown that
this lower bound grows logarithmically with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
independently of the value of $n$. Numerical results for other continuous input
distributions are also provided. A half-Gaussian input distribution is shown to
give larger rates than a Rayleigh input distribution for $n=1,2,3$. At an SNR
of $25$ dB, the best lower bounds we developed are approximately $3.68$ bit per
channel use. The practically relevant case of amplitude shift-keying (ASK)
constellations is also numerically analysed. For the same SNR of $25$ dB, a
$16$-ASK constellation yields a rate of approximately $3.45$ bit per channel
use.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a distributed agent-based automated theorem proving
framework based on order-sorted first-order logic. Each agent in our framework
has its own knowledge base, communicating to its neighboring agent(s) using
message-passing algorithms. The communication language between agents is
restricted in such a manner that each agent can only communicate to its
neighboring agent(s) by means of their common language. In this paper we
provide a refutation-complete report procedure for automated theorem proving in
order-sorted first-order logic in a subclass of distributed agent-based
networks. Rather than studying and evaluating the performance improvement of
the automated theorem proving in order-sorted first-order logic using parallel
or distributed agents, this paper focuses on building proofs in order-sorted
first-order logic in a distributed manner under the restriction that agents may
report their knowledge or observations only with their predefined language.

 <dc:description>  Computer networks today typically do not provide any mechanisms to the users
to learn, in a reliable manner, which paths have (and have not) been taken by
their packets. Rather, it seems inevitable that as soon as a packet leaves the
network card, the user is forced to trust the network provider to forward the
packets as expected or agreed upon. This can be undesirable, especially in the
light of today's trend toward more programmable networks: after a successful
cyber attack on the network management system or Software-Defined Network (SDN)
control plane, an adversary in principle has complete control over the network.
  This paper presents a low-cost and efficient solution to detect misbehaviors
and ensure trustworthy routing over untrusted or insecure providers, in
particular providers whose management system or control plane has been
compromised (e.g., using a cyber attack). We propose
Routing-Verification-as-a-Service (RVaaS): RVaaS offers clients a flexible
interface to query information relevant to their traffic, while respecting the
autonomy of the network provider. RVaaS leverages key features of
OpenFlow-based SDNs to combine (passive and active) configuration monitoring,
logical data plane verification and actual in-band tests, in a novel manner.

 <dc:description>  The application of psychophysiological in human-computer interaction is a
growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of
physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Stream processing sytems (SPS) are emerging computational platforms that can
be utilized in human-computer interaction for real-time analysis of high-volume
multimodal signals. Usage of complementary information contained in multiple
signals is desireable as it can make HCI systems more robust. In this preprint
we review existing software and hardware solutions for HCI-centric stream
processing systems. The preprint also includes a brief introduction into SPS
design considerations and structure from the perspective of analysing
physiological signals.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid
familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on
everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more
common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce new Stein identities for gamma target
distribution as well as a new non-linear channel specifically designed for
gamma inputs. From these two ingredients, we derive an explicit and simple
formula for the derivative of the input-output mutual information of this
non-linear channel with respect to the channel quality parameter. This relation
is reminiscent of the well-known link between the derivative of the
input-output mutual information of additive Gaussian noise channel with respect
to the signal-to-noise ratio and the minimum mean-square error. The proof
relies on a rescaled version of De Bruijn identity for gamma target
distribution together with a stochastic representation for the gamma specific
Fisher information. Finally, we are able to derive precise bounds and
asymptotics for the input-output mutual information of the non-linear channel
with gamma inputs.

 <dc:description>  The 911 emergency service belongs to one of the 16 critical infrastructure
sectors in the United States. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks
launched from a mobile phone botnet pose a significant threat to the
availability of this vital service. In this paper we show how attackers can
exploit the cellular network protocols in order to launch an anonymized DDoS
attack on 911. The current FCC regulations require that all emergency calls be
immediately routed regardless of the caller's identifiers (e.g., IMSI and
IMEI). A rootkit placed within the baseband firmware of a mobile phone can mask
and randomize all cellular identifiers, causing the device to have no genuine
identification within the cellular network. Such anonymized phones can issue
repeated emergency calls that cannot be blocked by the network or the emergency
call centers, technically or legally. We explore the 911 infrastructure and
discuss why it is susceptible to this kind of attack. We then implement
different forms of the attack and test our implementation on a small cellular
network. Finally, we simulate and analyze anonymous attacks on a model of
current 911 infrastructure in order to measure the severity of their impact. We
found that with less than 6K bots (or $100K hardware), attackers can block
emergency services in an entire state (e.g., North Carolina) for days. We
believe that this paper will assist the respective organizations, lawmakers,
and security professionals in understanding the scope of this issue in order to
prevent possible 911-DDoS attacks in the future.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Regularization in Convex Composite Optimization for Variational
  Imaging Problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose an adaptive regularization scheme in a variational framework where
a convex composite energy functional is optimized. We consider a number of
imaging problems including denoising, segmentation and motion estimation, which
are considered as optimal solutions of the energy functionals that mainly
consist of data fidelity, regularization and a control parameter for their
trade-off. We presents an algorithm to determine the relative weight between
data fidelity and regularization based on the residual that measures how well
the observation fits the model. Our adaptive regularization scheme is designed
to locally control the regularization at each pixel based on the assumption
that the diversity of the residual of a given imaging model spatially varies.
The energy optimization is presented in the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) framework where the adaptive regularization is iteratively
applied along with mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm. We
demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our adaptive regularization
through experimental results presenting that the qualitative and quantitative
evaluation results of each imaging task are superior to the results with a
constant regularization scheme. The desired properties, robustness and
effectiveness, of the regularization parameter selection in a variational
framework for imaging problems are achieved by merely replacing the static
regularization parameter with our adaptive one.

 <dc:description>  We present a practical approach to capturing ear-to-ear face models
comprising both 3D meshes and intrinsic textures (i.e. diffuse and specular
albedo). Our approach is a hybrid of geometric and photometric methods and
requires no geometric calibration. Photometric measurements made in a
lightstage are used to estimate view dependent high resolution normal maps. We
overcome the problem of having a single photometric viewpoint by capturing in
multiple poses. We use uncalibrated multiview stereo to estimate a coarse base
mesh to which the photometric views are registered. We propose a novel approach
to robustly stitching surface normal and intrinsic texture data into a
seamless, complete and highly detailed face model. The resulting relightable
models provide photorealistic renderings in any view.

 <dc:description>  Melanoma is amongst most aggressive types of cancer. However, it is highly
curable if detected in its early stages. Prescreening of suspicious moles and
lesions for malignancy is of great importance. Detection can be done by images
captured by standard cameras, which are more preferable due to low cost and
availability. One important step in computerized evaluation of skin lesions is
accurate detection of lesion region, i.e. segmentation of an image into two
regions as lesion and normal skin. Accurate segmentation can be challenging due
to burdens such as illumination variation and low contrast between lesion and
healthy skin. In this paper, a method based on deep neural networks is proposed
for accurate extraction of a lesion region. The input image is preprocessed and
then its patches are fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). Local texture
and global structure of the patches are processed in order to assign pixels to
lesion or normal classes. A method for effective selection of training patches
is used for more accurate detection of a lesion border. The output segmentation
mask is refined by some post processing operations. The experimental results of
qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can
outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms exist in the literature.

 <dc:title>Feasibility Study on Disaster Management with Hybrid Network of LTE and
  Satellite Links</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mboli, Julius Sechang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We are highly vulnerable to either natural or artificial catastrophes and
therefore, Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) operators need reliable
wireless communications for successful operations especially in critical rescue
missions. PPDR dedicated or commercial terrestrial networks have always been
used which at most times lead to unsuccessful operations. This is due to the
fact these networks are all infrastructure-based which can be destroyed, fail
to deliver the required service or the networks are not able to support and
sustain the sudden traffic surge. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is earmarked as the
future candidate technology for PPDR purpose and so much have been put into it
in terms of research, perhaps suitable architecture that will meet
mission-critical requirements can be developed. This can only work if
terrestrial networks will always be available. Unfortunately, in worst case
scenarios, infrastructures might get damaged totally or might be destroyed by
subsequent disasters. As a result, adequate guarantees can only be possible in
the hypothesis of very high financial involvement. Fortunately, considering
availability, coverage ubiquity and reliability, satellite technologies have
lately proven good. So, to maximize the high channel performance of terrestrial
networks and the availability and reliability of non-terrestrial networks, the
solution lies in a hybrid system. It is on this ground that this work deals
with the integration of LTE and satellite networks in both infrastructure-based
and infrastructure-less topologies for PPDR purpose. It is aim at providing
people trapped in disaster and field operators with a transparent accessibility
and guaranteed coverage even when infrastructures are damaged. The requirements
are defined and the model simulated. The network is able to provide network
coverage, enhanced capacity and promised greater resilience.

 <dc:title>Improved Optimistic Mirror Descent for Sparsity and Curvature</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kamalaruban, Parameswaran</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online Convex Optimization plays a key role in large scale machine learning.
Early approaches to this problem were conservative, in which the main focus was
protection against the worst case scenario. But recently several algorithms
have been developed for tightening the regret bounds in easy data instances
such as sparsity, predictable sequences, and curved losses. In this work we
unify some of these existing techniques to obtain new update rules for the
cases when these easy instances occur together. First we analyse an adaptive
and optimistic update rule which achieves tighter regret bound when the loss
sequence is sparse and predictable. Then we explain an update rule that
dynamically adapts to the curvature of the loss function and utilizes the
predictable nature of the loss sequence as well. Finally we extend these
results to composite losses.

 <dc:title>Request Patterns and Caching for VoD Services with Recommendation
  Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gupta, Samarth</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Moharir, Sharayu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Video on Demand (VoD) services like Netflix and YouTube account for ever
increasing fractions of Internet traffic. It is estimated that this fraction
will cross 80% in the next three years. Most popular VoD services have
recommendation engines which recommend videos to users based on their viewing
history, thus introducing time-correlation in user requests. Understanding and
modeling this time-correlation in user requests is critical for network traffic
engineering. The primary goal of this work is to use empirically observed
properties of user requests to model the effect of recommendation engines on
the request patterns in VoD services. We propose a Markovian request model to
capture the time-correlation in user requests and show that our model is
consistent with the observations of existing empirical studies.
  Most large-scale VoD services deliver content to users via a distributed
network of servers as serving users requests via geographically co-located
servers reduces latency and network bandwidth consumption. The content
replication policy, i.e., determining which contents to cache on the servers is
a key resource allocation problem for VoD services. Recent studies show that
low start-up delay is a key Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of users of
VoD services. This motivates the need to pre-fetch (fetch before contents are
requested) and cache content likely to be request in the near future. Since
pre-fetching leads to an increase in the network bandwidth usage, we use our
Markovian model to explore the trade-offs and feasibility of implementing
recommendation based pre-fetching.

 <dc:title>Reduced-Rank Channel Estimation for Large-Scale MIMO Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Ko-Feng</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present two reduced-rank channel estimators for large-scale
multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems and analyze their mean square
error (MSE) performance. Taking advantage of the channel's transform domain
sparseness, the estimators yield outstanding performance and may offer
additional mean angle-of-arrival (AoA) information. It is shown that, for the
estimators to be effective, one has to select a proper predetermined unitary
basis (transform) and be able to determine the dominant channel rank and the
associated subspace. Further MSE analysis reveals the relations among the array
size, channel rank, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the estimators'
performance. It provides rationales for the proposed rank determination and
mean AoA estimation algorithms as well.
  An angle alignment operation included in one of our channel models is proved
to be effective in further reducing the required rank, shifting the dominant
basis vectors' range (channel spectrum) and improving the estimator's
performance when a suitable basis is used. We also draw insightful analogies
among MIMO channel modeling, transform coding, parallel spatial search, and
receive beamforming. Computer experiment results are provided to examine the
numerical effects of various estimator parameters and the advantages of the
proposed channel estimators and rank determination method.

at a level of abstraction that is difficult to combat from the code level. We
introduce ITect, a scalable approach to malware similarity detection based on
information theory. ITect targets file entropy patterns in different ways to
achieve 100% precision with 90% accuracy but it could target 100% recall
instead. It outperforms VirusTotal for precision and accuracy on combined

 <dc:description>  The widespread adoption of smartphones in recent years has made it possible
for us to collect large amounts of traffic data. Special software installed on
the phones of drivers allow us to gather GPS trajectories of their vehicles on
the road network. In this paper, we simulate the trajectories of multiple
agents on a road network and use various models to forecast the short-term
traffic speed of various links. Our results show that traditional techniques
like multiple regression and artificial neural networks work well but simpler
adaptive models that do not require prior training also perform comparatively
well.

 <dc:title>Practical Demonstration of a Memristive Fuse</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Since its inception the memristive fuse has been a good example of how small
numbers of memristors can be combined to obtain useful behaviours unachievable
by individual devices. In this work, we link the memristive fuse concept with
that of the Complementary Resistive Switch (CRS), exploit that link to
experimentally demonstrate a practical memristive fuse using TiOx-based ReRAM
cells and explain its basic operational principles. The fuse is stimulated by
trains of identical pulses where successive pulse trains feature opposite
polarities. In response, we observe a gradual (analogue) drop in resistive
state followed by a gradual recovery phase regardless of input stimulus
polarity; echoing traditional, binary CRS behaviour. This analogue switching
property opens the possibility of operating the memristive fuse as a
single-component step change detector. Moreover, we discover that the
characteristics of the individual memristors used to demonstrate the memristive
fuse concept in this work allow our fuse to be operated in a regime where one
of the two constituent devices can be switched largely independently from the
other. This property, not present in the traditional CRS, indicates that the
inherently analogue memristive fuse architecture may support additional
operational flexibility through e.g. allowing finer control over its resistive
state.

 <dc:description>  While network densification is considered an important solution to cater the
ever-increasing capacity demand, its effect on the handover (HO) rate is
overlooked. In dense 5G networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the
gains offered by network densification. Hence, user mobility imposes a
nontrivial challenge to harvest capacity gains via network densification. In
this paper, we propose a velocity-aware HO management scheme for two-tier
downlink cellular network to mitigate the HO effect on the foreseen
densification throughput gains. The proposed HO scheme sacrifices the best BS
connectivity, by skipping HO to some BSs along the user's trajectory, to
maintain longer connection durations and reduce HO rates. Furthermore, the
proposed scheme enables cooperative BS service and strongest interference
cancellation to compensate for skipping the best connectivity. To this end, we
consider different HO skipping scenarios and develop a velocity-aware
mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the
proposed HO scheme in terms of the coverage probability and user throughput.
The results highlight the HO rate problem in dense cellular environments and
show the importance of the proposed HO schemes. Finally, the value of BS
cooperation along with handover skipping is quantified for different user
mobility profiles.

 <dc:title>What can (partition) logic contribute to information theory?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Logical probability theory was developed as a quantitative measure based on
Boole's logic of subsets. But information theory was developed into a mature
theory by Claude Shannon with no such connection to logic. A recent development
in logic changes this situation. In category theory, the notion of a subset is
dual to the notion of a quotient set or partition, and recently the logic of
partitions has been developed in a parallel relationship to the Boolean logic
of subsets (subset logic is usually mis-specified as the special case of
propositional logic). What then is the quantitative measure based on partition
logic in the same sense that logical probability theory is based on subset
logic? It is a measure of information that is named &quot;logical entropy&quot; in view
of that logical basis. This paper develops the notion of logical entropy and
the basic notions of the resulting logical information theory. Then an
extensive comparison is made with the corresponding notions based on Shannon
entropy.

 <dc:title>The Incentive Ratio in Exchange Economies</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The incentive ratio measures the utility gains from strategic behaviour.
Without any restrictions on the setup, ratios for linear, Leontief and
Cobb-Douglas exchange markets are unbounded, showing that manipulating the
equilibrium is a worthwhile endeavour, even if it is computationally
challenging. Such unbounded improvements can be achieved even if agents only
misreport their utility functions. This provides a sharp contrast with previous
results from Fisher markets. When the Cobb-Douglas setup is more restrictive,
the maximum utility gain is bounded by the number of commodities. By means of
an example, we show that it is possible to exceed a known upper bound for
Fisher markets in exchange economies.

 <dc:description>  As the next generation cellular system, 5G network is required to provide a
large variety of services for different kinds of terminals, from traditional
voice and data services over mobile phones to small packet transmission over
massive machine-type terminals. Although orthogonal-subcarrier based waveform
has been widely used nowadays in many practical systems, it can hardly meet the
future requirements in the coming 5G networks. Therefore, more flexible
waveforms have been proposed to address the unprecedented challenges. In this
article, we will provide comprehensive analysis and comparison for the typical
waveform candidates. To obtain insightful analysis, we will not only introduce
the basic principles of the waveforms but also reveal the underlying
characteristics of each waveform. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison in terms
of different performance metrics will be also presented in this article, which
provide an overall understanding of the new waveforms.

 <dc:title>Incremental Consistency Guarantees for Replicated Objects</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Programming with replicated objects is difficult. Developers must face the
fundamental trade-off between consistency and performance head on, while
struggling with the complexity of distributed storage stacks. We introduce
Correctables, a novel abstraction that hides most of this complexity, allowing
developers to focus on the task of balancing consistency and performance. To
aid developers with this task, Correctables provide incremental consistency
guarantees, which capture successive refinements on the result of an ongoing
operation on a replicated object. In short, applications receive both a
preliminary---fast, possibly inconsistent---result, as well as a
final---consistent---result that arrives later.
  We show how to leverage incremental consistency guarantees by speculating on
preliminary values, trading throughput and bandwidth for improved latency. We
experiment with two popular storage systems (Cassandra and ZooKeeper) and three
applications: a Twissandra-based microblogging service, an ad serving system,
and a ticket selling system. Our evaluation on the Amazon EC2 platform with
YCSB workloads A, B, and C shows that we can reduce the latency of strongly
consistent operations by up to 40% (from 100ms to 60ms) at little cost (10%
bandwidth increase, 6% throughput drop) in the ad system. Even if the
preliminary result is frequently inconsistent (25% of accesses), incremental
consistency incurs a bandwidth overhead of only 27%.

 <dc:title>Large-Scale Multi-Antenna Multi-Sine Wireless Power Transfer</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Yang</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is expected to be a technology reshaping the
landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things, Radio
Frequency identification (RFID) networks, etc. Although there has been some
progress towards multi-antenna multi-sine WPT design, the large-scale design of
WPT, reminiscent of massive MIMO in communications, remains an open challenge.
In this paper, we derive efficient multiuser algorithms based on a
generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit sinewaves
that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study
highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity introduced by the
rectification process on the design of waveforms in multiuser systems.
Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial domain beamforming,
obtained prior to the frequency domain power allocation optimization, turns out
to be Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT). In contrast, in the general weighted
sum criterion maximization problem, the spatial domain beamforming optimization
and the frequency domain power allocation optimization are coupled. Assuming
channel hardening, low-complexity algorithms are proposed based on asymptotic
analysis, to maximize the two criteria. The structure of the asymptotically
optimal spatial domain precoder can be found prior to the optimization. The
performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. Numerical results confirm
the inefficiency of the linear model-based design for the single and multi-user
scenarios. It is also shown that as nonlinear model-based designs, the proposed
algorithms can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves.

 <dc:description>  We study the performance of cognitive Underlay System (US) that employ power
control mechanism at the Secondary Transmitter (ST) from a deployment
perspective. Existing baseline models considered for performance analysis
either assume the knowledge of involved channels at the ST or retrieve this
information by means of a band manager or a feedback channel, however, such
situations rarely exist in practice. Motivated by this fact, we propose a novel
approach that incorporates estimation of the involved channels at the ST, in
order to characterize the performance of the US in terms of interference power
received at the primary receiver and throughput at the secondary receiver (or
\textit{secondary throughput}). Moreover, we apply an outage constraint that
captures the impact of imperfect channel knowledge, particularly on the
uncertain interference. Besides this, we employ a transmit power constraint at
the ST to classify the operation of the US in terms of an interference-limited
regime and a power-limited regime. In addition, we characterize the expressions
of the uncertain interference and the secondary throughput for the case where
the involved channels encounter Nakagami-$m$ fading. Finally, we investigate a
fundamental tradeoff between the estimation time and the secondary throughput
depicting an optimized performance of the US.

 <dc:description>  Minimum-Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes have emerged as a viable alternative
to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes as they minimize the repair bandwidth while they are
still optimal in terms of reliability and storage overhead. Although several
MSR constructions exist, so far they have not been practically implemented
mainly due to the big number of I/O operations. In this paper, we analyze
high-rate MDS codes that are simultaneously optimized in terms of storage,
reliability, I/O operations, and repair-bandwidth for single and multiple
failures of the systematic nodes. The codes were recently introduced in
\cite{7463553} without any specific name. Due to the resemblance between the
hashtag sign \# and the procedure of the code construction, we call them in
this paper \emph{HashTag Erasure Codes (HTECs)}. HTECs provide the lowest
data-read and data-transfer, and thus the lowest repair time for an arbitrary
sub-packetization level $\alpha$, where $\alpha \leq r^{\lceil \sfrac{k}{r}
\rceil}$, among all existing MDS codes for distributed storage including MSR
codes. The repair process is linear and highly parallel. Additionally, we show
that HTECs are the first high-rate MDS codes that reduce the repair bandwidth
for more than one failure. Practical implementations of HTECs in Hadoop release
3.0.0-alpha2 demonstrate their great potentials.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation systems are being explored by Cable TV operators to improve
user satisfaction with services, such as Live TV and Video on Demand (VOD)
services. More recently, Catch-up TV has been introduced, allowing users to
watch recent broadcast content whenever they want to. These services give users
a large set of options from which they can choose from, creating an information
overflow problem. Thus, recommendation systems arise as essential tools to
solve this problem by helping users in their selection, which increases not
only user satisfaction but also user engagement and content consumption. In
this paper we present a learning to rank approach that uses contextual
information and implicit feedback to improve recommendation systems for a Cable

 <dc:title>End-to-End Eye Movement Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hoppe, Sabrina</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Common computational methods for automated eye movement detection - i.e. the
task of detecting different types of eye movement in a continuous stream of
gaze data - are limited in that they either involve thresholding on
hand-crafted signal features, require individual detectors each only detecting
a single movement, or require pre-segmented data. We propose a novel approach
for eye movement detection that only involves learning a single detector
end-to-end, i.e. directly from the continuous gaze data stream and
simultaneously for different eye movements without any manual feature crafting
or segmentation. Our method is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN)
that recently demonstrated superior performance in a variety of tasks in
computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning. We further introduce
a novel multi-participant dataset that contains scripted and free-viewing
sequences of ground-truth annotated saccades, fixations, and smooth pursuits.
We show that our CNN-based method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a
large margin on this challenging dataset, thereby underlining the significant
potential of this approach for holistic, robust, and accurate eye movement
protocol analysis.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, Cable TV operators provide their users multiple ways to watch TV
content, such as Live TV and Video on Demand (VOD) services. In the last years,
Catch-up TV has been introduced, allowing users to watch recent broadcast
content whenever they want to. Understanding how the users interact with such
services is important to develop solutions that may increase user satisfaction
, user engagement and user consumption. In this paper, we characterize, for the
first time, how users interact with a large European Cable TV operator that
provides Live TV, Catch-up TV and VOD services. We analyzed many
characteristics, such as the service usage, user engagement, program type,
program genres and time periods. This characterization will help us to have a
deeper understanding on how users interact with these different services, that
may be used to enhance the recommendation systems of Cable TV providers.

 <dc:title>Voltage stabilization in DC microgrids: an approach based on

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of stabilizing voltages in DC microGrids (mGs) given
by the interconnection of Distributed Generation Units (DGUs), power lines and
loads. We propose a decentralized control architecture where the primary
controller of each DGU can be designed in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion,
allowing the seamless addition of new DGUs. Differently from several other
approaches to primary control, local design is independent of the parameters of
power lines. Moreover, differently from the PnP control scheme in [1], the
plug-in of a DGU does not require to update controllers of neighboring DGUs.
Local control design is cast into a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem
that, if unfeasible, allows one to deny plug-in requests that might be
dangerous for mG stability. The proof of closed-loop stability of voltages
exploits structured Lyapunov functions, the LaSalle invariance theorem and
properties of graph Laplacians. Theoretical results are backed up by
simulations in PSCAD.

finding those families by using hill climbing techniques over Balanced XOR
codes. Due to the hill climbing search, those families of codes have always
better decoding probability than the codes generated in a typical Random Linear

result that for small values of $k$, the decoding probability of our codes in
$GF(2)$ is very close to the decoding probability of the codes obtained by
Random Linear Network Coding but in the higher finite field $GF(4)$.

 <dc:description>  In order to deal with the scaling problem of volumetric map representations
we propose spatially local methods for high-ratio compression of 3D maps,
represented as truncated signed distance fields. We show that these compressed
maps can be used as meaningful descriptors for selective decompression in
scenarios relevant to robotic applications. As compression methods, we compare
using PCA-derived low-dimensional bases to non-linear auto-encoder networks and
novel mixed architectures that combine both. Selecting two application-oriented
performance metrics, we evaluate the impact of different compression rates on
reconstruction fidelity as well as to the task of map-aided ego-motion
estimation. It is demonstrated that lossily compressed distance fields used as
cost functions for ego-motion estimation, can outperform their uncompressed
counterparts in challenging scenarios from standard RGB-D data-sets.

 <dc:title>Quantifying Radiographic Knee Osteoarthritis Severity using Deep

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new approach to automatically quantify the severity of
knee osteoarthritis (OA) from radiographs using deep convolutional neural
networks (CNN). Clinically, knee OA severity is assessed using Kellgren \&amp;
Lawrence (KL) grades, a five point scale. Previous work on automatically
predicting KL grades from radiograph images were based on training shallow
classifiers using a variety of hand engineered features. We demonstrate that
classification accuracy can be significantly improved using deep convolutional
neural network models pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on knee OA images.
Furthermore, we argue that it is more appropriate to assess the accuracy of
automatic knee OA severity predictions using a continuous distance-based
evaluation metric like mean squared error than it is to use classification
accuracy. This leads to the formulation of the prediction of KL grades as a
regression problem and further improves accuracy. Results on a dataset of X-ray
images and KL grades from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) show a sizable
improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by community detection, we characterise the spectrum of the
non-backtracking matrix $B$ in the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model.
  Specifically, we consider a random graph on $n$ vertices partitioned into two
equal-sized clusters. The vertices have i.i.d. weights $\{ \phi_u \}_{u=1}^n$
with second moment $\Phi^{(2)}$. The intra-cluster connection probability for
vertices $u$ and $v$ is $\frac{\phi_u \phi_v}{n}a$ and the inter-cluster
connection probability is $\frac{\phi_u \phi_v}{n}b$.
  We show that with high probability, the following holds: The leading
eigenvalue of the non-backtracking matrix $B$ is asymptotic to $\rho =
\frac{a+b}{2} \Phi^{(2)}$. The second eigenvalue is asymptotic to $\mu_2 =
\frac{a-b}{2} \Phi^{(2)}$ when $\mu_2^2 &gt; \rho$, but asymptotically bounded by
$\sqrt{\rho}$ when $\mu_2^2 \leq \rho$. All the remaining eigenvalues are
asymptotically bounded by $\sqrt{\rho}$. As a result, a clustering
positively-correlated with the true communities can be obtained based on the
second eigenvector of $B$ in the regime where $\mu_2^2 &gt; \rho.$
  In a previous work we obtained that detection is impossible when $\mu_2^2 &lt;
\rho,$ meaning that there occurs a phase-transition in the sparse regime of the
Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model.
  As a corollary, we obtain that Degree-Corrected Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs
asymptotically satisfy the graph Riemann hypothesis, a quasi-Ramanujan
property.
  A by-product of our proof is a weak law of large numbers for
local-functionals on Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Models, which could be
of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  We present a method to determine Fashion DNA, coordinate vectors locating
fashion items in an abstract space. Our approach is based on a deep neural
network architecture that ingests curated article information such as tags and
images, and is trained to predict sales for a large set of frequent customers.
In the process, a dual space of customer style preferences naturally arises.
Interpretation of the metric of these spaces is straightforward: The product of
Fashion DNA and customer style vectors yields the forecast purchase likelihood
for the customer-item pair, while the angle between Fashion DNA vectors is a
measure of item similarity. Importantly, our models are able to generate
unbiased purchase probabilities for fashion items based solely on article
information, even in absence of sales data, thus circumventing the &quot;cold-start
problem&quot; of collaborative recommendation approaches. Likewise, it generalizes
easily and reliably to customers outside the training set. We experiment with
Fashion DNA models based on visual and/or tag item data, evaluate their
recommendation power, and discuss the resulting article similarities.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of detecting non-isotropic high-dimensional
geometric structure in random graphs. Namely, we study a model of a random
geometric graph in which vertices correspond to points generated randomly and
independently from a non-isotropic $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution, and
two vertices are connected if the distance between them is smaller than some
pre-specified threshold. We derive new notions of dimensionality which depend
upon the eigenvalues of the covariance of the Gaussian distribution. If
$\alpha$ denotes the vector of eigenvalues, and $n$ is the number of vertices,
then the quantities $\left(\frac{||\alpha||_2}{||\alpha||_3}\right)^6/n^3$ and
$\left(\frac{||\alpha||_2}{||\alpha||_4}\right)^4/n^3$ determine upper and
lower bounds for the possibility of detection. This generalizes a recent result
by Bubeck, Ding, R\'acz and the first named author from [BDER14] which shows
that the quantity $d/n^3$ determines the boundary of detection for isotropic
geometry. Our methods involve Fourier analysis and the theory of characteristic
functions to investigate the underlying probabilities of the model. The proof
of the lower bound uses information theoretic tools, based on the method
presented in [BG15].

 <dc:description>  Accurate pedestrian detection has a primary role in automotive safety: for
example, by issuing warnings to the driver or acting actively on car's brakes,
it helps decreasing the probability of injuries and human fatalities. In order
to achieve very high accuracy, recent pedestrian detectors have been based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Unfortunately, such approaches require
vast amounts of computational power and memory, preventing efficient
implementations on embedded systems. This work proposes a CNN-based detector,
adapting a general-purpose convolutional network to the task at hand. By
thoroughly analyzing and optimizing each step of the detection pipeline, we
develop an architecture that outperforms methods based on traditional image
features and achieves an accuracy close to the state-of-the-art while having
low computational complexity. Furthermore, the model is compressed in order to
fit the tight constrains of low power devices with a limited amount of embedded
memory available. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) it proves that a
region based deep neural network can be finely tuned to achieve adequate
accuracy for pedestrian detection (2) it achieves a very low memory usage
without reducing detection accuracy on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset.

 <dc:description>  This work draws its inspiration from three important sources of research on
dissimilarity-based clustering and intertwines those three threads into a
consistent principled functorial theory of clustering. Those three are the
overlapping clustering of Jardine and Sibson, the functorial approach of
Carlsson and Memoli to partition-based clustering, and the Isbell/Dress
school's study of injective envelopes. Carlsson and Memoli introduce the idea
of viewing clustering methods as functors from a category of metric spaces to a
category of clusters, with functoriality subsuming many desirable properties.
Our first series of results extends their theory of functorial clustering
schemes to methods that allow overlapping clusters in the spirit of Jardine and
Sibson. This obviates some of the unpleasant effects of chaining that occur,
for example with single-linkage clustering. We prove an equivalence between
these general overlapping clustering functors and projections of weight spaces
to what we term clustering domains, by focusing on the order structure
determined by the morphisms. As a specific application of this machinery, we
are able to prove that there are no functorial projections to cut metrics, or
even to tree metrics. Finally, although we focus less on the construction of
clustering methods (clustering domains) derived from injective envelopes, we
lay out some preliminary results, that hopefully will give a feel for how the
third leg of the stool comes into play.

 <dc:title>Interference-Free OFDM: Rethinking OFDM for Interference Networks with
  Inter-Symbol Interference</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Namyoon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers a $K$-user single-input-single-output interference
channel with inter-symbol interference (ISI), in which the channel coefficients
are assumed to be linear time-invariant with finite-length impulse response.
The primary finding of this paper is that, with no channel state information at
a transmitter (CSIT), the sum-spectral efficiency can be made to scale linearly
with $K$, provided that the desired links have longer impulse response than do
the interfering links. This linear gain is achieved by a novel multi-carrier
communication scheme which we call \textit{interference-free orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (IF-OFDM)}. Furthermore, when a transmitter is
able to learn CSIT from its paired receiver only, a higher sum-spectral
efficiency can be achieved by a two-stage transmission method that concatenates
IF-OFDM and vector coding based on singular value decomposition with
water-filling power allocation. A major implication of the derived results is
that separate encoding across subcarriers per link is sufficient to linearly
increase the sum-spectral efficiency with $K$ in the interference channel with
ISI. Simulation results support this claim.

 <dc:title>Not All Fluctuations are Created Equal: Spontaneous Variations in
  Thermodynamic Function</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Almost all processes -- highly correlated, weakly correlated, or correlated
not at all---exhibit statistical fluctuations. Often physical laws, such as the
Second Law of Thermodynamics, address only typical realizations -- as
highlighted by Shannon's asymptotic equipartition property and as entailed by
taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom.
Indeed, our interpretations of the functioning of macroscopic thermodynamic
cycles are so focused. Using a recently derived Second Law for information
processing, we show that different subsets of fluctuations lead to distinct
thermodynamic functioning in Maxwellian Demons. For example, while typical
realizations may operate as an engine -- converting thermal fluctuations to
useful work -- even &quot;nearby&quot; fluctuations (nontypical, but probable
realizations) behave differently, as Landauer erasers -- converting available
stored energy to dissipate stored information. One concludes that ascribing a
single, unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system, especially one on
the nanoscale, is at best misleading, likely masking an array of simultaneous,
parallel thermodynamic transformations. This alters how we conceive of cellular
processes, engineering design, and evolutionary adaptation.

 <dc:title>DiSMEC - Distributed Sparse Machines for Extreme Multi-label
  Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Extreme multi-label classification refers to supervised multi-label learning
involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of labels. Datasets in extreme
classification exhibit fit to power-law distribution, i.e. a large fraction of
labels have very few positive instances in the data distribution. Most
state-of-the-art approaches for extreme multi-label classification attempt to
capture correlation among labels by embedding the label matrix to a
low-dimensional linear sub-space. However, in the presence of power-law
distributed extremely large and diverse label spaces, structural assumptions
such as low rank can be easily violated.
  In this work, we present DiSMEC, which is a large-scale distributed framework
for learning one-versus-rest linear classifiers coupled with explicit capacity
control to control model size. Unlike most state-of-the-art methods, DiSMEC
does not make any low rank assumptions on the label matrix. Using double layer
of parallelization, DiSMEC can learn classifiers for datasets consisting
hundreds of thousands labels within few hours. The explicit capacity control
mechanism filters out spurious parameters which keep the model compact in size,
without losing prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation
on publicly available real-world datasets consisting upto 670,000 labels. We
compare DiSMEC with recent state-of-the-art approaches, including - SLEEC which
is a leading approach for learning sparse local embeddings, and FastXML which
is a tree-based approach optimizing ranking based loss function. On some of the
datasets, DiSMEC can significantly boost prediction accuracies - 10% better
compared to SLECC and 15% better compared to FastXML, in absolute terms.

 <dc:description>  AND-OR networks are Boolean networks where each coordinate function is either
the AND or OR logical operator. We study the number of fixed points of these
Boolean networks in the case that they have a wiring diagram with chain
topology. We find closed formulas for subclasses of these networks and
recursive formulas in the general case. Our results allow for an effective
computation of the number of fixed points in the case that the topology of the
Boolean network is an open chain (finite or infinite) or a closed chain.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports the activities and outcomes in the Workshop on Grasping
and Manipulation Datasets that was organized under the International Conference
on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2016. The half day workshop was packed with
nine invited talks, 12 interactive presentations, and one panel discussion with
ten panelists. This paper summarizes all the talks and presentations and recaps
what has been discussed in the panels session. This summary servers as a review
of recent developments in data collection in grasping and manipulation. Many of
the presentations describe ongoing efforts or explorations that could be
achieved and fully available in a year or two. The panel discussion not only
commented on the current approaches, but also indicates new directions and
focuses. The workshop clearly displayed the importance of quality datasets in
robotics and robotic grasping and manipulation field. Hopefully the workshop
could motivate larger efforts to create big datasets that are comparable with
big datasets in other communities such as computer vision.

 <dc:description>  Named Data Networks provide a clean-slate redesign of the Future Internet for
efficient content distribution. Because Internet of Things are expected to
compose a significant part of Future Internet, most content will be managed by
constrained devices. Such devices are often equipped with limited CPU, memory,
bandwidth, and energy supply. However, the current Named Data Networks design
neglects the specific requirements of Internet of Things scenarios and many
data structures need to be further optimised. The purpose of this research is
to provide an efficient strategy to route in Named Data Networks by
constructing a Forwarding Information Base using Iterated Bloom Filters defined
as I(FIB)F. We propose the use of content names based on iterative hashes. This
strategy leads to reduce the overhead of packets. Moreover, the memory and the
complexity required in the forwarding strategy are lower than in current
solutions. We compare our proposal with solutions based on hierarchical names
and Standard Bloom Filters. We show how to further optimise I(FIB)F by
exploiting the structure information contained in hierarchical content names.
Finally, two strategies may be followed to reduce: (i) the overall memory for
routing or (ii) the probability of false positives.

 <dc:description>  Mainstream machine-learning techniques such as deep learning and
probabilistic programming rely heavily on sampling from generally intractable
probability distributions. There is increasing interest in the potential
advantages of using quantum computing technologies as sampling engines to speed
up these tasks or to make them more effective. However, some pressing
challenges in state-of-the-art quantum annealers have to be overcome before we
can assess their actual performance. The sparse connectivity, resulting from
the local interaction between quantum bits in physical hardware
implementations, is considered the most severe limitation to the quality of
constructing powerful generative unsupervised machine-learning models. Here we
use embedding techniques to add redundancy to data sets, allowing us to
increase the modeling capacity of quantum annealers. We illustrate our findings
by training hardware-embedded graphical models on a binarized data set of
handwritten digits and two synthetic data sets in experiments with up to 940
quantum bits. Our model can be trained in quantum hardware without full
knowledge of the effective parameters specifying the corresponding quantum
Gibbs-like distribution; therefore, this approach avoids the need to infer the
effective temperature at each iteration, speeding up learning; it also
mitigates the effect of noise in the control parameters, making it robust to
deviations from the reference Gibbs distribution. Our approach demonstrates the
feasibility of using quantum annealers for implementing generative models, and
it provides a suitable framework for benchmarking these quantum technologies on
machine-learning-related tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the routing and rebalancing problem for a fleet of
autonomous vehicles providing on-demand transportation within a congested urban
road network (that is, a road network where traffic speed depends on vehicle
density). We show that the congestion-free routing and rebalancing problem is
NP-hard and provide a randomized algorithm which finds a low-congestion
solution to the routing and rebalancing problem that approximately minimizes
the number of vehicles on the road in polynomial time. We provide theoretical
bounds on the probability of violating the congestion constraints; we also
characterize the expected number of vehicles required by the solution with a
commonly-used empirical congestion model and provide a bound on the
approximation factor of the algorithm. Numerical experiments on a realistic
road network with real-world customer demands show that our algorithm
introduces very small amounts of congestion. The performance of our algorithm
in terms of travel times and required number of vehicles is very close to (and
sometimes better than) the optimal congestion-free solution.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to an error in the
  proofs of Theorem 3.4 (bound on the probability of violating the congestion
  constraints) and Lemma 3.5 (approximation factor of the algorithm)</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Robotic commands in natural language usually contain various spatial
descriptions that are semantically similar but syntactically different. Mapping
such syntactic variants into semantic concepts that can be understood by robots
is challenging due to the high flexibility of natural language expressions. To
tackle this problem, we collect robotic commands for navigation and
manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further define a robot language and
use a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from
natural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to
simulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing
platforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to
robot language with paraphrases.

 <dc:description>  Neuromorphic chip refers to an unconventional computing architecture that is
modelled on biological brains. It is ideally suited for processing sensory data
for intelligence computing, decision-making or context cognition. Despite rapid
development, conventional artificial synapses exhibit poor connection
flexibility and require separate data acquisition circuitry, resulting in
limited functionalities and significant hardware redundancy. Here we report a
novel light-stimulated artificial synapse based on a graphene-nanotube hybrid
phototransistor that can directly convert optical stimuli into a &quot;neural image&quot;
for further neuronal analysis. Our optically-driven synapses involve multiple
steps of plasticity mechanisms and importantly exhibit flexible tuning of both
short- and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, our neuromorphic phototransistor
can take multiple pre-synaptic light stimuli via wavelength-division
multiplexing and allows advanced optical processing through
charge-trap-mediated optical coupling. The capability of complex neuromorphic
functionalities in a simple silicon-compatible device paves the way for novel
neuromorphic computing architectures involving photonics.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditional Scene Understanding problems such as Object Detection and
Semantic Segmentation have made breakthroughs in recent years due to the
adoption of deep learning. However, the former task is not able to localise
objects at a pixel level, and the latter task has no notion of different
instances of objects of the same class. We focus on the task of Instance
Segmentation which recognises and localises objects down to a pixel level. Our
model is based on a deep neural network trained for semantic segmentation. This
network incorporates a Conditional Random Field with end-to-end trainable
higher order potentials based on object detector outputs. This allows us to
reason about instances from an initial, category-level semantic segmentation.
Our simple method effectively leverages the great progress recently made in
semantic segmentation and object detection. The accurate instance-level
segmentations that our network produces is reflected by the considerable
improvements obtained over previous work.

 <dc:description>  Many AI applications rely on knowledge encoded in a locigal knowledge base
(KB). The most essential benefit of such logical KBs is the opportunity to
perform automatic reasoning which however requires a KB to meet some minimal
quality criteria such as consistency. Without adequate tool assistance, the
task of resolving such violated quality criteria in a KB can be extremely hard,
especially when the problematic KB is large and complex. To this end,
interactive KB debuggers have been introduced which ask a user queries whether
certain statements must or must not hold in the intended domain. The given
answers help to gradually restrict the search space for KB repairs.
  Existing interactive debuggers often rely on a pool-based strategy for query
computation. A pool of query candidates is precomputed, from which the best
candidate according to some query quality criterion is selected to be shown to
the user. This often leads to the generation of many unnecessary query
candidates and thus to a high number of expensive calls to logical reasoning
services. We tackle this issue by an in-depth mathematical analysis of diverse
real-valued active learning query selection measures in order to determine
qualitative criteria that make a query favorable. These criteria are the key to
devising efficient heuristic query search methods. The proposed methods enable
for the first time a completely reasoner-free query generation for interactive
KB debugging while at the same time guaranteeing optimality conditions, e.g.
minimal cardinality or best understandability for the user, of the generated
query that existing methods cannot realize.
  Further, we study different relations between active learning measures. The
obtained picture gives a hint about which measures are more favorable in which
situation or which measures always lead to the same outcomes, based on given
types of queries.

 <dc:description>  The predator/prey (capture) problem is a prototype of many network-related
applications. We study the capture process on complex networks by considering
multiple predators from multiple sources. In our model, some lions start from
multiple sources simultaneously to capture the lamb by biased random walks,
which are controlled with a free parameter $\alpha$. We derive the distribution
of the lamb's lifetime and the expected lifetime $\left\langle T\right\rangle
$. Through simulation, we find that the expected lifetime drops substantially
with the increasing number of lions. We also study how the underlying
topological structure affects the capture process, and obtain that locating on
small-degree nodes is better than large-degree nodes to prolong the lifetime of
the lamb. Moreover, dense or homogeneous network structures are against the
survival of the lamb.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an incentive proactive cache mechanism in cache-enabled small
cell networks (SCNs) is proposed, in order to motivate the content providers
(CPs) to participate in the caching procedure. A network composed of a single
mobile network operator (MNO) and multiple CPs is considered. The MNO aims to
define the price it charges the CPs to maximize its revenue while the CPs
compete to determine the number of files they cache at the MNO's small base
stations (SBSs) to improve the quality of service (QoS) of their users. This
problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game where a single MNO is considered as
the leader and the multiple CPs willing to cache files are the followers. The
followers game is modeled as a non-cooperative game and both the existence and
uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE) are proved. The closed-form expression of
the NE which corresponds to the amount of storage each CP requests from the MNO
is derived. An optimization problem is formulated at the MNO side to determine
the optimal price that the MNO should charge the CPs. Simulation results show
that at the equilibrium, the MNO and CPs can all achieve a utility that is up
to 50% higher than the cases in which the prices and storage quantities are
requested arbitrarily.

 <dc:description>  Different versions of peer-to-peer electronic cash exist as data represented
by separate blockchains. Payments between such systems cannot be sent directly
from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
Bitcoin provided part of the solution but its utility is limited to
intra-blockchain transactions. The benefits are lost if a trusted third party
is required to execute inter-blockchain transactions. We propose a solution to
the inter-blockchain transaction problem using the same fundamental principles
of Bitcoin. The protocol is described by the Uberledger framework, a
hierarchical meta-blockchain layer that encapsulates information regarding the
fidelity of peer-to-peer transaction facilitators.

 <dc:description>  A wireless sensor network is composed of many sensor nodes that have been
given out in a specific zone and each of them had an ability of collecting
information from the environment and sending collected data to the sink. The
most significant issues in wireless sensor networks despite the recent progress
is the trouble of the severe limitations of energy resources. Since that in
different applications of sensor nets we could throw a static or mobile sink
then all aspects of such networks should be planned with an awareness of
energy. One of the most significant topics related to these networks is
routing. One of the most widely used and efficient methods of routing is a
hierarchy (based on clustering) method. In The present study with the objective
of cutting down energy consumption and persistence of network coverage we have
offered a novel algorithm based on clustering algorithms and multi hop routing.
To achieve this goal first we layer the network environment based on the size
of the network. We will identify the optimal number of cluster heads and every
cluster head based on the mechanism of topology control will start to accept
members. Likewise we set the first layer as gate layer and subsequently
identifying the gate nodes we would turn away half of the sensors and then stop
using energy and the remaining nodes in this layer will join the gate nodes
because they hold a critical part in bettering the functioning of the system.
Cluster heads off following layers send the information to cluster heads in the
above layer until sent data will be sent to gate nodes and finally will be sent
to sink. We have tested the proposed algorithm in two situations 1) when the
sink is off and 2) when a sink is on and simulation data shows that proposed
algorithm has better performance in terms of the life span of a network than
LEACH and E LEACH protocols.

 <dc:description>  We consider the best-arm identification problem in multi-armed bandits, which
focuses purely on exploration. A player is given a fixed budget to explore a
finite set of arms, and the rewards of each arm are drawn independently from a
fixed, unknown distribution. The player aims to identify the arm with the
largest expected reward. We propose a general framework to unify sequential
elimination algorithms, where the arms are dismissed iteratively until a unique
arm is left. Our analysis reveals a novel performance measure expressed in
terms of the sampling mechanism and number of eliminated arms at each round.
Based on this result, we develop an algorithm that divides the budget according
to a nonlinear function of remaining arms at each round. We provide theoretical
guarantees for the algorithm, characterizing the suitable nonlinearity for
different problem environments described by the number of competitive arms.
Matching the theoretical results, our experiments show that the nonlinear
algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art. We finally study the
side-observation model, where pulling an arm reveals the rewards of its related
arms, and we establish improved theoretical guarantees in the pure-exploration
setting.

 <dc:description>  We capitalize on large amounts of unlabeled video in order to learn a model
of scene dynamics for both video recognition tasks (e.g. action classification)
and video generation tasks (e.g. future prediction). We propose a generative
adversarial network for video with a spatio-temporal convolutional architecture
that untangles the scene's foreground from the background. Experiments suggest
this model can generate tiny videos up to a second at full frame rate better
than simple baselines, and we show its utility at predicting plausible futures
of static images. Moreover, experiments and visualizations show the model
internally learns useful features for recognizing actions with minimal
supervision, suggesting scene dynamics are a promising signal for
representation learning. We believe generative video models can impact many
applications in video understanding and simulation.

 <dc:title>Why is Differential Evolution Better than Grid Search for Tuning Defect
  Predictors?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fu, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nair, Vivek</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Context: One of the black arts of data mining is learning the magic
parameters which control the learners. In software analytics, at least for
defect prediction, several methods, like grid search and differential evolution
(DE), have been proposed to learn these parameters, which has been proved to be
able to improve the performance scores of learners.
  Objective: We want to evaluate which method can find better parameters in
terms of performance score and runtime cost.
  Methods: This paper compares grid search to differential evolution, which is
an evolutionary algorithm that makes extensive use of stochastic jumps around
the search space.
  Results: We find that the seemingly complete approach of grid search does no
better, and sometimes worse, than the stochastic search. When repeated 20 times
to check for conclusion validity, DE was over 210 times faster than grid search
to tune Random Forests on 17 testing data sets with F-Measure
  Conclusions: These results are puzzling: why does a quick partial search be
just as effective as a much slower, and much more, extensive search? To answer
that question, we turned to the theoretical optimization literature. Bergstra
and Bengio conjecture that grid search is not more effective than more
randomized searchers if the underlying search space is inherently low
dimensional. This is significant since recent results show that defect
prediction exhibits very low intrinsic dimensionality-- an observation that
explains why a fast method like DE may work as well as a seemingly more
thorough grid search. This suggests, as a future research direction, that it
might be possible to peek at data sets before doing any optimization in order
to match the optimization algorithm to the problem at hand.

analogous to the physics of a soap bubble, with the system's Lie bracket
supplying an &quot;inflation pressure&quot; that is balanced by a &quot;surface tension&quot; term
derived from a Riemannian metric on the system's shape space. We demonstrate
this optimizer on a variety of system geometries (including Purcell's swimmer)
and for optimization criteria that include maximizing displacement and
efficiency of motion for both translation and turning motions.

 <dc:description>  Recently developed information communication technologies, particularly the
Internet, have affected how we, both as individuals and as a society, create,
store, and recall information. Internet also provides us with a great
opportunity to study memory using transactional large scale data, in a
quantitative framework similar to the practice in statistical physics. In this
project, we make use of online data by analysing viewership statistics of
Wikipedia articles on aircraft crashes. We study the relation between recent
events and past events and particularly focus on understanding memory
triggering patterns. We devise a quantitative model that explains the flow of
viewership from a current event to past events based on similarity in time,
geography, topic, and the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia articles. We show
that on average the secondary flow of attention to past events generated by
such remembering processes is larger than the primary attention flow to the
current event. We are the first to report these cascading effects.

 <dc:description>  Most real-world social networks are inherently dynamic, composed of
communities that are constantly changing in membership. To track these evolving
communities, we need dynamic community detection techniques. This article
evaluates the performance of a set of game theoretic approaches for identifying
communities in dynamic networks. Our method, D-GT (Dynamic Game Theoretic
community detection), models each network node as a rational agent who
periodically plays a community membership game with its neighbors. During game
play, nodes seek to maximize their local utility by joining or leaving the
communities of network neighbors. The community structure emerges after the
game reaches a Nash equilibrium. Compared to the benchmark community detection
methods, D-GT more accurately predicts the number of communities and finds
community assignments with a higher normalized mutual information, while
retaining a good modularity.

 <dc:title>Robust Structure from Motion in the Presence of Outliers and Missing
  Data</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Guanghui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Structure from motion is an import theme in computer vision. Although great
progress has been made both in theory and applications, most of the algorithms
only work for static scenes and rigid objects. In recent years, structure and
motion recovery of non-rigid objects and dynamic scenes have received a lot of
attention. In this paper, the state-of-the-art techniques for structure and
motion factorization of non-rigid objects are reviewed and discussed. First, an
introduction of the structure from motion problem is presented, followed by a
general formulation of non-rigid structure from motion. Second, an augmented
affined factorization framework, by using homogeneous representation, is
presented to solve the registration issue in the presence of outlying and
missing data. Third, based on the observation that the reprojection residuals
of outliers are significantly larger than those of inliers, a robust
factorization strategy with outlier rejection is proposed by means of the
reprojection residuals, followed by some comparative experimental evaluations.
Finally, some future research topics in non-rigid structure from motion are
discussed.

 <dc:title>O(f) Bi-Approximation for Capacitated Covering with Hard Capacities</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider capacitated vertex cover with hard capacity constraints (VC-HC)
on hypergraphs. In this problem we are given a hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ with a
maximum edge size $f$. Each edge is associated with a demand and each vertex is
associated with a weight (cost), a capacity, and an available multiplicity. The
objective is to find a minimum-weight vertex multiset such that the demands of
the edges can be covered by the capacities of the vertices and the multiplicity
of each vertex does not exceed its available multiplicity.
  In this paper we present an $O(f)$ bi-approximation for VC-HC that gives a
trade-off on the number of augmented multiplicity and the cost of the resulting
cover. In particular, we show that, by augmenting the available multiplicity by
a factor of $k \ge 2$, a~cover with a cost ratio of
$\Big(1+\frac{1}{k-1}\Big)(f-1)$ to the optimal cover for the original instance
can be obtained. This improves over a previous result, which has a cost ratio
of $f^2$ via augmenting the available multiplicity by a factor of $f$.

 <dc:description>  Role discovery in graphs is an emerging area that allows analysis of complex
graphs in an intuitive way. In contrast to other graph prob- lems such as
community discovery, which finds groups of highly connected nodes, the role
discovery problem finds groups of nodes that share similar graph topological
structure. However, existing work so far has two severe limitations that
prevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which
is undesirable for a number of reasons. Secondly, most work is limited to a
single relational graph. We address both these lim- itations in an intuitive
and easy to implement alternating least squares framework. Our framework allows
convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem which can provide
useful supervision. In par- ticular we explore supervision to enforce i)
sparsity, ii) diversity and iii) alternativeness. We then show how to lift this
work for multi-relational graphs. A natural representation of a
multi-relational graph is an order 3 tensor (rather than a matrix) and that a
Tucker decomposition allows us to find complex interactions between collections
of entities (E-groups) and the roles they play for a combination of relations
(R-groups). Existing Tucker decomposition methods in tensor toolboxes are not
suited for our purpose, so we create our own algorithm that we demonstrate is
pragmatically useful.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of jointly retrieving the state of a
dynamical system, as well as the state of the sensors deployed to estimate it.
We assume that the sensors possess a simple computational unit that is capable
of performing simple operations, such as retaining the current state and model
of the system in its memory.
  We assume the system to be observable (given all the measurements of the
sensors), and we ask whether each sub-collection of sensors can retrieve the
state of the underlying physical system, as well as the state of the remaining
sensors. To this end, we consider communication between neighboring sensors,
whose adjacency is captured by a communication graph. We then propose a linear
update strategy that encodes the sensor measurements as states in an augmented
state space, with which we provide the solution to the problem of retrieving
the system and sensor states.
  The present paper contains three main contributions. First, we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure observability of the system and
sensor states from any sensor. Second, we address the problem of adding
communication between sensors when the necessary and sufficient conditions are
not satisfied, and devise a strategy to this end. Third, we extend the former
case to include different costs of communication between sensors. Finally, the
concepts defined and the method proposed are used to assess the state of an
example of approximate structural brain dynamics through linearized
measurements.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the channel estimation problem in Millimeter wave
(mmWave) wireless systems with large antenna arrays. By exploiting the inherent
sparse nature of the mmWave channel, we develop a novel rate-adaptive channel
estimation (RACE) algorithm, which can adaptively adjust the number of required
channel measurements based on an expected probability of estimation error
(PEE). To this end, we design a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator to optimally
extract the path information and the associated probability of error from the
increasing number of channel measurements. Based on the ML estimator, the
algorithm is able to measure the channel using a variable number of beam
patterns until the receiver believes that the estimated direction is correct.
This is in contrast to the existing mmWave channel estimation algorithms, in
which the number of measurements is typically fixed. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the number of channel
estimation measurements while still retaining a high level of accuracy,
compared to existing multi-stage channel estimation algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In the multisensor sequential change detection problem, a disruption occurs
in an environment monitored by multiple sensors. This disruption induces a
change in the observations of an unknown subset of sensors. In the Byzantine
version of this problem, which is the focus of this work, it is further assumed
that the postulated change-point model may be misspecified for an unknown
subset of sensors. The problem then is to detect the change quickly and
reliably, for any possible subset of affected sensors, even if the misspecified
sensors are controlled by an adversary. Given a user-specified upper bound on
the number of compromised sensors, we propose and study three families of
sequential change-detection rules for this problem. These are designed and
evaluated under a generalization of Lorden's criterion, where conditional
expected detection delay and expected time to false alarm are both computed in
the worst-case scenario for the compromised sensors. The first-order asymptotic
performance of these procedures is characterized as the worst-case false alarm
rate goes to 0. The insights from these theoretical results are corroborated by
a simulation study.

 <dc:title>Machine Learning with Guarantees using Descriptive Complexity and SMT

 <dc:description>  Machine learning is a thriving part of computer science. There are many
efficient approaches to machine learning that do not provide strong theoretical
guarantees, and a beautiful general learning theory. Unfortunately, machine
learning approaches that give strong theoretical guarantees have not been
efficient enough to be applicable. In this paper we introduce a logical
approach to machine learning. Models are represented by tuples of logical
formulas and inputs and outputs are logical structures. We present our
framework together with several applications where we evaluate it using SAT and
SMT solvers. We argue that this approach to machine learning is particularly
suited to bridge the gap between efficiency and theoretical soundness. We
exploit results from descriptive complexity theory to prove strong theoretical
guarantees for our approach. To show its applicability, we present experimental
results including learning complexity-theoretic reductions rules for board
games. We also explain how neural networks fit into our framework, although the
current implementation does not scale to provide guarantees for real-world
neural networks.

 <dc:title>SIGDROP: Signature-based ROP Detection using Hardware Performance

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) is a software exploit for system
compromise. By chaining short instruction sequences from existing code pieces,
ROP can bypass static code-integrity checking approaches and non-executable
page protections. Existing defenses either require access to source code or
binary, a customized compiler or hardware modifications, or suffer from high
performance and storage overhead. In this work, we propose SIGDROP, a low-cost
approach for ROP detection which uses low-level properties inherent to ROP
attacks. Specifically, we observe special patterns of certain hardware events
when a ROP attack occurs during program execution. Such hardware event-based
patterns form signatures to flag ROP attacks at runtime. SIGDROP leverages
Hardware Performance Counters, which are already present in commodity
processors, to efficiently capture and extract the signatures. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SIGDROP can effectively detect ROP attacks with acceptable
performance overhead and negligible storage overhead.

collection of jobs of various sizes. Jobs arrive at different times and have
different deadlines. The objective is to minimize the *recharge rate*, which is
the rate at which the device has to harvest energy in order to feasibly
schedule all jobs. The main result is a polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm
for processors with a natural set of discrete speed/power pairs.

 <dc:description>  Human behaviors exhibit ubiquitous correlations in many aspects, such as
individual and collective levels, temporal and spatial dimensions, content,
social and geographical layers. With rich Internet data of online behaviors
becoming available, it attracts academic interests to explore human mobility
similarity from the perspective of social network proximity. Existent analysis
shows a strong correlation between online social proximity and offline mobility
similari- ty, namely, mobile records between friends are significantly more
similar than between strangers, and those between friends with common neighbors
are even more similar. We argue the importance of the number and diversity of
com- mon friends, with a counter intuitive finding that the number of common
friends has no positive impact on mobility similarity while the diversity plays
a key role, disagreeing with previous studies. Our analysis provides a novel
view for better understanding the coupling between human online and offline
behaviors, and will help model and predict human behaviors based on social
proximity.

 <dc:description>  An important issue in public goods game is whether player's behaviour changes
over time, and if so, how significant it is. In this game players can be
classified into different groups according to the level of their participation
in the public good. This problem can be considered as a concept drift problem
by asking the amount of change that happens to the clusters of players over a
sequence of game rounds. In this study we present a method for measuring
changes in clusters with the same items over discrete time points using
external clustering validation indices and area under the curve. External
clustering indices were originally used to measure the difference between
suggested clusters in terms of clustering algorithms and ground truth labels
for items provided by experts. Instead of different cluster label comparison,
we use these indices to compare between clusters of any two consecutive time
points or between the first time point and the remaining time points to measure
the difference between clusters through time points. In theory, any external
clustering indices can be used to measure changes for any traditional
(non-temporal) clustering algorithm, due to the fact that any time point alone
is not carrying any temporal information. For the public goods game, our
results indicate that the players are changing over time but the change is
smooth and relatively constant between any two time points.

 <dc:description>  In a power distribution network, the network topology information is
essential for an efficient operation of the network. This information of
network connectivity is not accurately available, at the low voltage level, due
to uninformed changes that happen from time to time. In this paper, we propose
a novel data--driven approach to identify the underlying network topology
including the load phase connectivity from time series of energy measurements.
The proposed method involves the application of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and its graph-theoretic interpretation to infer the topology from smart
meter energy measurements. The method is demonstrated through simulation on
randomly generated networks and also on IEEE recognized Roy Billinton
distribution test system.

 <dc:description>  One of the most important issues in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is severe
energy restrictions. As the performance of Sensor Networks is strongly
dependence to the network lifetime, researchers seek a way to use node energy
supply effectively and increasing network lifetime. As a consequence, it is
crucial to use routing algorithms result in decrease energy consumption and
better bandwidth utilization. The purpose of this paper is to increase Wireless
Sensor Networks lifetime using LEACH-algorithm. So before clustering Network
environment, it is divided into two virtual layers (using distance between
sensor nodes and base station) and then regarding to sensors position in each
of two layers, residual energy of sensor and distance from base station is used
in clustering. In this article, we compare proposed algorithm with well-known
LEACH and ELEACH algorithms in homogeneous environment (with equal energy for
all sensors) and heterogeneous one (energy of half of sensors get doubled),
also for static and dynamic situation of base station. Results show that our
proposed algorithm delivers improved performance.

 <dc:description>  Layouts and sub-layouts constitute an important clue while searching a
document on the basis of its structure, or when textual content is
unknown/irrelevant. A sub-layout specifies the arrangement of document entities
within a smaller portion of the document. We propose an efficient graph-based
matching algorithm, integrated with hash-based indexing, to prune a possibly
large search space. A user can specify a combination of sub-layouts of interest
using sketch-based queries. The system supports partial matching for
unspecified layout entities. We handle cases of segmentation pre-processing
errors (for text/non-text blocks) with a symmetry maximization-based strategy,
and accounting for multiple domain-specific plausible segmentation hypotheses.
We show promising results of our system on a database of unstructured entities,
containing 4776 newspaper images.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the first implementation of a regular register by n
servers that is tolerant to both mobile Byzantine agents, and transient
failures (it is self-stabilizing) in a round-free synchronous model. We
consider the most difficult model for mobile Byzantine agents to date where the
message delay, $\delta$, and the speed of mobile Byzantine agents, $\Delta$,
are completely decoupled. Moreover, servers are not aware of their state
(infected or correct) after mobile Byzantine agents left them. The register is
maintained by n servers and our algorithm tolerates (i) any number of transient
failures , and (ii) up to f Mobile Byzantine agents. Our implementation uses
bounded timestamps from the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ domain, and is optimal with respect
to the number of tolerated mobile Byzantine agents. The convergence time of our
solution is upper bounded by $3\Delta + T\_{5write()}$ , where $T_{5write()}$
is the time needed to execute five complete write() operations.

 <dc:description>  The segmentation, seen as the association of a partition with an image, is a
difficult task. It can be decomposed in two steps: at first, a family of
contours associated with a series of nested partitions (or hierarchy) is
created and organized, then pertinent contours are extracted. A coarser
partition is obtained by merging adjacent regions of a finer partition. The
strength of a contour is then measured by the level of the hierarchy for which
its two adjacent regions merge. We present an automatic segmentation strategy
using a wide range of stochastic watershed hierarchies. For a given set of
homogeneous images, our approach selects automatically the best hierarchy and
cut level to perform image simplification given an evaluation score.
Experimental results illustrate the advantages of our approach on several
real-life images datasets.

 <dc:description>  The Minimum Sum Coloring Problem (MSCP) is derived from the Graph Coloring
Problem (GCP) by associating a weight to each color. The aim of MSCP is to find
a coloring solution of a graph such that the sum of color weights is minimum.
MSCP has important applications in fields such as scheduling and VLSI design.
We propose in this paper new upper bounds of the chromatic strength, i.e. the
minimum number of colors in an optimal solution of MSCP, based on an
abstraction of all possible colorings of a graph called motif. Experimental
results on standard benchmarks show that our new bounds are significantly
tighter than the previous bounds in general, allowing to reduce substantially
the search space when solving MSCP .

 <dc:description>  Online reviews have increasingly become a very important resource for
consumers when making purchases. Though it is becoming more and more difficult
for people to make well-informed buying decisions without being deceived by
fake reviews. Prior works on the opinion spam problem mostly considered
classifying fake reviews using behavioral user patterns. They focused on
prolific users who write more than a couple of reviews, discarding one-time
reviewers. The number of singleton reviewers however is expected to be high for
many review websites. While behavioral patterns are effective when dealing with
elite users, for one-time reviewers, the review text needs to be exploited. In
this paper we tackle the problem of detecting fake reviews written by the same
person using multiple names, posting each review under a different name. We
propose two methods to detect similar reviews and show the results generally
outperform the vectorial similarity measures used in prior works. The first
method extends the semantic similarity between words to the reviews level. The
second method is based on topic modeling and exploits the similarity of the
reviews topic distributions using two models: bag-of-words and
bag-of-opinion-phrases. The experiments were conducted on reviews from three
different datasets: Yelp (57K reviews), Trustpilot (9K reviews) and Ott dataset
(800 reviews).

 <dc:description>  The world's collective knowledge is evolving through research and new
scientific discoveries. It is becoming increasingly difficult to objectively
rank the impact research institutes have on global advancements. However, since
the funding, governmental support, staff and students quality all mirror the
projected quality of the institution, it becomes essential to measure the
affiliation's rating in a transparent and widely accepted way. We propose and
investigate several methods to rank affiliations based on the number of their
accepted papers at future academic conferences. We carry out our investigation
using publicly available datasets such as the Microsoft Academic Graph, a
heterogeneous graph which contains various information about academic papers.
We analyze several models, starting with a simple probabilities-based method
and then gradually expand our training dataset, engineer many more features and
use mixed models and gradient boosted decision trees models to improve our
predictions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present an interactive tool that can be used to quantify fat
infiltration in lumbar muscles, which is useful in studying fat infiltration
and lower back pain (LBP) in adults. Currently, a qualitative assessment by
visual grading via a 5-point scale is used to study fat infiltration in lumbar
muscles from an axial view of lumbar-spine MR Images. However, a quantitative
approach (on a continuous scale of 0-100\%) may provide a greater insight. In
this paper, we propose a method to precisely quantify the fat deposition /
infiltration in a user-defined region of the lumbar muscles, which may aid
better diagnosis and analysis. The key steps are interactively segmenting the
region of interest (ROI) from the lumbar muscles using the well known livewire
technique, identifying fatty regions in the segmented region based on
variable-selection of threshold and softness levels, automatically detecting
the center of the spinal column and fragmenting the lumbar muscles into smaller
regions with reference to the center of the spinal column, computing key
parameters [such as total and region-wise fat content percentage, total-cross
sectional area (TCSA) and functional cross-sectional area (FCSA)] and exporting
the computations and associated patient information from the MRI, into a
database. A standalone application using MATLAB R2014a was developed to perform
the required computations along with an intuitive graphical user interface
(GUI).

 <dc:description>  Opinion mining from customer reviews has become pervasive in recent years.
Sentences in reviews, however, are usually classified independently, even
though they form part of a review's argumentative structure. Intuitively,
sentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the
review structure and sentential context should thus inform the classification
of each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based
sentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review
with a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical model
outperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results competitive with
the state-of-the-art, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on five
multilingual, multi-domain datasets without any hand-engineered features or
external resources.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our deep learning-based approach to sentiment analysis
in Twitter as part of SemEval-2016 Task 4. We use a convolutional neural
network to determine sentiment and participate in all subtasks, i.e. two-point,
three-point, and five-point scale sentiment classification and two-point and
five-point scale sentiment quantification. We achieve competitive results for
two-point scale sentiment classification and quantification, ranking fifth and
a close fourth (third and second by alternative metrics) respectively despite
using only pre-trained embeddings that contain no sentiment information. We
achieve good performance on three-point scale sentiment classification, ranking
eighth out of 35, while performing poorly on five-point scale sentiment
classification and quantification. An error analysis reveals that this is due
to low expressiveness of the model to capture negative sentiment as well as an
inability to take into account ordinal information. We propose improvements in
order to address these and other issues.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our deep learning-based approach to multilingual
aspect-based sentiment analysis as part of SemEval 2016 Task 5. We use a
convolutional neural network (CNN) for both aspect extraction and aspect-based
sentiment analysis. We cast aspect extraction as a multi-label classification
problem, outputting probabilities over aspects parameterized by a threshold. To
determine the sentiment towards an aspect, we concatenate an aspect vector with
every word embedding and apply a convolution over it. Our constrained system
(unconstrained for English) achieves competitive results across all languages
and domains, placing first or second in 5 and 7 out of 11 language-domain pairs
for aspect category detection (slot 1) and sentiment polarity (slot 3)
respectively, thereby demonstrating the viability of a deep learning-based
approach for multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis.

 <dc:description>  More and more people are regularly using mobile and battery-powered handsets,
such as smartphones and tablets. At the same time, thanks to the technological
innovation and to the high user demands, those devices are integrating
extensive functionalities and developers are writing battery-draining apps,
which results in a surge of energy consumption of these devices. This scenario
leads many people to often look for opportunities to charge their devices at
public charging stations: the presence of such stations is already prominent
around public areas such as hotels, shopping malls, airports, gyms and museums,
and is expected to significantly grow in the future. While most of the time the
power comes for free, there is no guarantee that the charging station is not
maliciously controlled by an adversary, with the intention to exfiltrate data
from the devices that are connected to it.
  In this paper, we illustrate for the first time how an adversary could
leverage a maliciously controlled charging station to exfiltrate data from the
smartphone via a USB charging cable (i.e., without using the data transfer
functionality), controlling a simple app running on the device, and without
requiring any permission to be granted by the user to send data out of the
device. We show the feasibility of the proposed attack through a prototype
implementation in Android, which is able to send out potentially sensitive
information, such as IMEI, contacts' phone number, and pictures.

 <dc:description>  We consider lambda-Y-calculus as a non-interpreted functional programming
language: the result of the execution of a program is its normal form that can
be seen as the tree of calls to built-in operations. Weak monadic second-order
logic (wMSOL) is well suited to express properties of such trees. We give a
type system for ensuring that the result of the execution of a lambda-Y-program
satisfies a given wMSOL property. In order to prove soundness and completeness
of the system we construct a denotational semantics of lambda-Y-calculus that
is capable of computing properties expressed in wMSOL.

 <dc:description>  In the past few years, the use of smartphones has increased exponentially,
and so have the capabilities of such devices. Together with an increase in raw
processing power, modern smartphones are equipped with a wide variety of
sensors and expose an extensive set of API (Accessible Programming Interface).
These capabilities allow us to extract a wide spectrum of data that ranges from
information about the environment (e.g., position, orientation) to user habits
(e.g., which apps she uses and when), as well as about the status of the
operating system itself (e.g., memory, network adapters). This data can be
extremely valuable in many research fields such as user authentication,
intrusion detection and detection of information leaks. For these reasons,
researchers need to use a solid and reliable logging tool to collect data from
mobile devices.
  In this paper, we first survey the existing logging tools available on the
Android platform, comparing the features offered by different tools and their
impact on the system, and highlighting some of their shortcomings. Then, we
present DELTA - Data Extraction and Logging Tool for Android, which improves
the existing Android logging solutions in terms of flexibility, fine-grained
tuning capabilities, extensibility, and available set of logging features. We
performed a full implementation of DELTA and we run a thorough evaluation on
its performance. The results show that our tool has low impact on the
performance of the system, on battery consumption, and on user experience.
Finally, we make the DELTA source code and toolset available to the research
community.

 <dc:title>Image and Video Mining through Online Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Within the field of image and video recognition, the traditional approach is
a dataset split into fixed training and test partitions. However, the labelling
of the training set is time-consuming, especially as datasets grow in size and
complexity. Furthermore, this approach is not applicable to the home user, who
wants to intuitively group their media without tirelessly labelling the
content. Our interactive approach is able to iteratively cluster classes of
images and video. Our approach is based around the concept of an image
signature which, unlike a standard bag of words model, can express
co-occurrence statistics as well as symbol frequency. We efficiently compute
metric distances between signatures despite their inherent high dimensionality
and provide discriminative feature selection, to allow common and distinctive
elements to be identified from a small set of user labelled examples. These
elements are then accentuated in the image signature to increase similarity
between examples and pull correct classes together. By repeating this process
in an online learning framework, the accuracy of similarity increases
dramatically despite labelling only a few training examples. To demonstrate
that the approach is agnostic to media type and features used, we evaluate on
three image datasets (15 scene, Caltech101 and FG-NET), a mixed text and image
dataset (ImageTag), a dataset used in active learning (Iris) and on three
action recognition datasets (UCF11, KTH and Hollywood2). On the UCF11 video
dataset, the accuracy is 86.7% despite using only 90 labelled examples from a
dataset of over 1200 videos, instead of the standard 1122 training videos. The
approach is both scalable and efficient, with a single iteration over the full
UCF11 dataset of around 1200 videos taking approximately 1 minute on a standard
desktop machine.

 <dc:description>  Image classification is one of the main research problems in computer vision
and machine learning. Since in most real-world image classification
applications there is no control over how the images are captured, it is
necessary to consider the possibility that these images might be affected by
noise (e.g. sensor noise in a low-quality surveillance camera). In this paper
we analyse the impact of three different types of noise on descriptors
extracted by two widely used feature extraction methods (LBP and HOG) and how
denoising the images can help to mitigate this problem. We carry out
experiments on two different datasets and consider several types of noise,
noise levels, and denoising methods. Our results show that noise can hinder
classification performance considerably and make classes harder to separate.
Although denoising methods were not able to reach the same performance of the
noise-free scenario, they improved classification results for noisy data.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows the capability the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) has to track, in a distributed manner, the optimal down-link
beam-forming solution in a multiple input multiple output (MISO) multi-cell
network given a dynamic channel. Each time the channel changes, ADMM is allowed
to perform one algorithm iteration. In order to implement the proposed scheme,
the base stations are not required to exchange channel state information (CSI),
but will require to exchange interference values once. We show ADMM's tracking
ability in terms of the algorithm's Lyapunov function given that the primal and
dual solutions to the convex optimization problem at hand can be understood as
a continuous mapping from the problem's parameters. We show that this holds
true even considering that the problem looses strong convexity when it is made
distributed. We then show that these requirements hold for the down-link, and
consequently up-link, beam-forming case. Numerical examples corroborating the
theoretical findings are also provided.

 <dc:description>  As an environment-friendly substitute for conventional fuel-powered vehicles,
electric vehicles (EVs) and their components have been widely developed and
deployed worldwide. The large-scale integration of EVs into power grid brings
both challenges and opportunities to the system performance. On one hand, the
load demand from EV charging imposes large impact on the stability and
efficiency of power grid. On the other hand, EVs could potentially act as
mobile energy storage systems to improve the power network performance, such as
load flattening, fast frequency control, and facilitating renewable energy
integration. Evidently, uncontrolled EV charging could lead to inefficient
power network operation or even security issues. This spurs enormous research
interests in designing charging coordination mechanisms. A key design challenge
here lies in the lack of complete knowledge of events that occur in the future.
Indeed, the amount of knowledge of future events significantly impacts the
design of efficient charging control algorithms. This article focuses on
introducing online EV charging scheduling techniques that deal with different
degrees of uncertainty and randomness of future knowledge. Besides, we
highlight the promising future research directions for EV charging control.

 <dc:description>  The assignment problem is one of the most well-studied settings in social
choice, matching, and discrete allocation. We consider the problem with the
additional feature that agents' preferences involve uncertainty. The setting
with uncertainty leads to a number of interesting questions including the
following ones. How to compute an assignment with the highest probability of
being Pareto optimal? What is the complexity of computing the probability that
a given assignment is Pareto optimal? Does there exist an assignment that is
Pareto optimal with probability one? We consider these problems under two
natural uncertainty models: (1) the lottery model in which each agent has an
independent probability distribution over linear orders and (2) the joint
probability model that involves a joint probability distribution over
preference profiles. For both of the models, we present a number of algorithmic
and complexity results.

 <dc:description>  The security infrastructure is ill-equipped to detect and deter the smuggling
of non-explosive devices that enable terror attacks such as those recently
perpetrated in western Europe. The detection of so-called &quot;small metallic
threats&quot; (SMTs) in cargo containers currently relies on statistical risk
analysis, intelligence reports, and visual inspection of X-ray images by
security officers. The latter is very slow and unreliable due to the difficulty
of the task: objects potentially spanning less than 50 pixels have to be
detected in images containing more than 2 million pixels against very complex
and cluttered backgrounds. In this contribution, we demonstrate for the first
time the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of Deep Learning,
to automate the detection of SMTs in fullsize X-ray images of cargo containers.
Novel approaches for dataset augmentation allowed to train CNNs from-scratch
despite the scarcity of data available. We report fewer than 6% false alarms
when detecting 90% SMTs synthetically concealed in stream-of-commerce images,
which corresponds to an improvement of over an order of magnitude over
conventional approaches such as Bag-of-Words (BoWs). The proposed scheme offers
potentially super-human performance for a fraction of the time it would take
for a security officers to carry out visual inspection (processing time is
approximately 3.5s per container image).

 <dc:description>  Online harassment has been a problem to a greater or lesser extent since the
early days of the internet. Previous work has applied anti-spam techniques like
machine-learning based text classification (Reynolds, 2011) to detecting
harassing messages. However, existing public datasets are limited in size, with
labels of varying quality. The #HackHarassment initiative (an alliance of 1
tech companies and NGOs devoted to fighting bullying on the internet) has begun
to address this issue by creating a new dataset superior to its predecssors in
terms of both size and quality. As we (#HackHarassment) complete further rounds
of labelling, later iterations of this dataset will increase the available
samples by at least an order of magnitude, enabling corresponding improvements
in the quality of machine learning models for harassment detection. In this
paper, we introduce the first models built on the #HackHarassment dataset v1.0
(a new open dataset, which we are delighted to share with any interested
researcherss) as a benchmark for future research.

 <dc:description>  Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used the Kohn-Sham scheme of
density functional theory to solve electronic structure problems in a wide
variety of scientific fields, ranging from materials science to biochemistry to
astrophysics. Machine learning holds the promise of learning the kinetic energy
functional via examples, by-passing the need to solve the Kohn-Sham equations.
This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing either larger
systems or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this
functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present
work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and
energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. Both improved
accuracy and lower computational cost with this method are demonstrated by
reproducing DFT energies for a range of molecular geometries generated during
molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, the methodology could be applied
directly to quantum chemical calculations, allowing construction of density

 <dc:description>  Tracking Facial Points in unconstrained videos is challenging due to the
non-rigid deformation that changes over time. In this paper, we propose to
exploit incremental learning for person-specific alignment in wild conditions.
Our approach takes advantage of part-based representation and cascade
regression for robust and efficient alignment on each frame. Unlike existing
methods that usually rely on models trained offline, we incrementally update
the representation subspace and the cascade of regressors in a unified
framework to achieve personalized modeling on the fly. To alleviate the
drifting issue, the fitting results are evaluated using a deep neural network,
where well-aligned faces are picked out to incrementally update the
representation and fitting models. Both image and video datasets are employed
to valid the proposed method. The results demonstrate the superior performance
of our approach compared with existing approaches in terms of fitting accuracy
and efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Scientists are drawn to synchrotrons and accelerator based light sources
because of their brightness, coherence and flux. The rate of improvement in
brightness and detector technology has outpaced Moore's law growth seen for
computers, networks, and storage, and is enabling novel observations and
discoveries with faster frame rates, larger fields of view, higher resolution,
and higher dimensionality. Here we present an integrated software/algorithmic
framework designed to capitalize on high throughput experiments, and describe
the streamlined processing pipeline of ptychography data analysis. The pipeline
provides throughput, compression, and resolution as well as rapid feedback to
the microscope operators.

 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency is a key requirement for the Internet of Things, as many
sensors are expected to be completely stand-alone and able to run for years
without battery replacement. Data compression aims at saving some energy by
reducing the volume of data sent over the network, but also affects the quality
of the received information. In this work, we formulate an optimization problem
to jointly design the source coding and transmission strategies for
time-varying channels and sources, with the twofold goal of extending the
network lifetime and granting low distortion levels. We propose a scalable
offline optimal policy that allocates both energy and transmission parameters
(i.e., times and powers) in a network with a dynamic Time Division Multiple
Access (TDMA)-based access scheme.

 <dc:description>  If you were to open your own cafe, would you not want to effortlessly
identify the most suitable location to set up your shop? Choosing an optimal
physical location is a critical decision for numerous businesses, as many
factors contribute to the final choice of the location. In this paper, we seek
to address the issue by investigating the use of publicly available Facebook
Pages data---which include user check-ins, types of business, and business
locations---to evaluate a user-selected physical location with respect to a
type of business. Using a dataset of 20,877 food businesses in Singapore, we
conduct analysis of several key factors including business categories,
locations, and neighboring businesses. From these factors, we extract a set of
relevant features and develop a robust predictive model to estimate the
popularity of a business location. Our experiments have shown that the
popularity of neighboring business contributes the key features to perform
accurate prediction. We finally illustrate the practical usage of our proposed
approach via an interactive web application system.

 <dc:title>Undersampled Phase Retrieval via Majorization-Minimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Qiu, Tianyu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Palomar, Daniel P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the undersampled phase retrieval problem, the goal is to recover an
$N$-dimensional complex signal $\mathbf{x}$ from only $M&lt;N$ noisy intensity
measurements without phase information. This problem has drawn a lot of
attention to reduce the number of required measurements since a recent theory
established that $M\approx4N$ intensity measurements are necessary and
sufficient to recover a generic signal $\mathbf{x}$. In this paper, we propose
to exploit the sparsity in the original signal and develop low-complexity
algorithms with superior performance based on the majorization-minimization
(MM) framework. The proposed algorithms are preferred to existing benchmark
methods since at each iteration a simple surrogate problem is solved with a
closed-form solution that monotonically decreases the original objective
function. Experimental results validate that our algorithms outperform existing
up-to-date methods in terms of recovery probability and accuracy, under the
same settings.

 <dc:title>Distributed Online Optimization in Dynamic Environments Using Mirror

 <dc:description>  This work addresses decentralized online optimization in non-stationary
environments. A network of agents aim to track the minimizer of a global
time-varying convex function. The minimizer evolves according to a known
dynamics corrupted by an unknown, unstructured noise. At each time, the global
function can be cast as a sum of a finite number of local functions, each of
which is assigned to one agent in the network. Moreover, the local functions
become available to agents sequentially, and agents do not have a prior
knowledge of the future cost functions. Therefore, agents must communicate with
each other to build an online approximation of the global function. We propose
a decentralized variation of the celebrated Mirror Descent, developed by
Nemirovksi and Yudin. Using the notion of Bregman divergence in lieu of
Euclidean distance for projection, Mirror Descent has been shown to be a
powerful tool in large-scale optimization. Our algorithm builds on Mirror
Descent, while ensuring that agents perform a consensus step to follow the
global function and take into account the dynamics of the global minimizer. To
measure the performance of the proposed online algorithm, we compare it to its
offline counterpart, where the global functions are available a priori. The gap
between the two is called dynamic regret. We establish a regret bound that
scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network, and more notably it
represents the deviation of minimizer sequence with respect to the given
dynamics. We then show that our results subsume a number of results in
distributed optimization. We demonstrate the application of our method to
decentralized tracking of dynamic parameters and verify the results via
numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  Spoken dialogue systems allow humans to interact with machines using natural
speech. As such, they have many benefits. By using speech as the primary
communication medium, a computer interface can facilitate swift, human-like
acquisition of information. In recent years, speech interfaces have become ever
more popular, as is evident from the rise of personal assistants such as Siri,
Google Now, Cortana and Amazon Alexa. Recently, data-driven machine learning
methods have been applied to dialogue modelling and the results achieved for
limited-domain applications are comparable to or outperform traditional
approaches. Methods based on Gaussian processes are particularly effective as
they enable good models to be estimated from limited training data.
Furthermore, they provide an explicit estimate of the uncertainty which is
particularly useful for reinforcement learning. This article explores the
additional steps that are necessary to extend these methods to model multiple
dialogue domains. We show that Gaussian process reinforcement learning is an
elegant framework that naturally supports a range of methods, including prior
knowledge, Bayesian committee machines and multi-agent learning, for
facilitating extensible and adaptable dialogue systems.

 <dc:description>  We examine the power of statistical zero knowledge proofs (captured by the
complexity class SZK) and their variants. First, we give the strongest known
relativized evidence that SZK contains hard problems, by exhibiting an oracle
relative to which SZK (indeed, even NISZK) is not contained in the class UPP,
containing those problems solvable by randomized algorithms with unbounded
error. This answers an open question of Watrous from 2002 [Aar]. Second, we
&quot;lift&quot; this oracle separation to the setting of communication complexity,
thereby answering a question of G\&quot;o\&quot;os et al. (ICALP 2016). Third, we give
relativized evidence that perfect zero knowledge proofs (captured by the class
PZK) are weaker than general zero knowledge proofs. Specifically, we exhibit
oracles relative to which SZK is not contained in PZK, NISZK is not contained
in NIPZK, and PZK is not equal to coPZK. The first of these results answers a
question raised in 1991 by Aiello and H{\aa}stad (Information and Computation),
and the second answers a question of Lovett and Zhang (2016). We also describe
additional applications of these results outside of structural complexity.
  The technical core of our results is a stronger hardness amplification
theorem for approximate degree, which roughly says that composing the
gapped-majority function with any function of high approximate degree yields a
function with high threshold degree.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient variational integrator for multibody systems.
Variational integrators reformulate the equations of motion for multibody
systems as discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations, transforming forward
integration into a root-finding problem for the DEL equations. Variational
integrators have been shown to be more robust and accurate in preserving
fundamental properties of systems, such as momentum and energy, than many
frequently used numerical integrators. However, state-of-the-art algorithms
suffer from $O(n^3)$ complexity, which is prohibitive for articulated multibody
systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, $n$, in generalized
coordinates. Our key contribution is to derive a recursive algorithm that
evaluates DEL equations in $O(n)$, which scales up well for complex multibody
systems such as humanoid robots. Inspired by recursive Newton-Euler algorithm,
our key insight is to formulate DEL equation individually for each body rather
than for the entire system. Furthermore, we introduce a new quasi-Newton method
that exploits the impulse-based dynamics algorithm, which is also $O(n)$, to
avoid the expensive Jacobian inversion in solving DEL equations. We demonstrate
scalability and efficiency, as well as extensibility to holonomic constraints
through several case studies.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a Markov chain for sampling from the uniform distribution on a
Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$, which we call the $\textit{geodesic walk}$.
We prove that the mixing time of this walk on any manifold with positive
sectional curvature $C_{x}(u,v)$ bounded both above and below by $0 &lt;
\mathfrak{m}_{2} \leq C_{x}(u,v) \leq \mathfrak{M}_2 &lt; \infty$ is
$\mathcal{O}^*\left(\frac{\mathfrak{M}_2}{\mathfrak{m}_2}\right)$. In
particular, this bound on the mixing time does not depend explicitly on the
dimension of the manifold. In the special case that $\mathcal{M}$ is the
boundary of a convex body, we give an explicit and computationally tractable
algorithm for approximating the exact geodesic walk. As a consequence, we
obtain an algorithm for sampling uniformly from the surface of a convex body
that has running time bounded solely in terms of the curvature of the body.

 <dc:description>  Spectral methods are popular in detecting global structures in the given data
that can be represented as a matrix. However when the data matrix is sparse or
noisy, classic spectral methods usually fail to work, due to localization of
eigenvectors (or singular vectors) induced by the sparsity or noise. In this
work, we propose a general method to solve the localization problem by learning
a regularization matrix from the localized eigenvectors. Using matrix
perturbation analysis, we demonstrate that the learned regularizations suppress
down the eigenvalues associated with localized eigenvectors and enable us to
recover the informative eigenvectors representing the global structure. We show
applications of our method in several inference problems: community detection
in networks, clustering from pairwise similarities, rank estimation and matrix
completion problems. Using extensive experiments, we illustrate that our method
solves the localization problem and works down to the theoretical detectability
limits in different kinds of synthetic data. This is in contrast with existing
spectral algorithms based on data matrix, non-backtracking matrix, Laplacians
and those with rank-one regularizations, which perform poorly in the sparse
case with noise.

 <dc:description>  We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on
graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional
neural networks which operate directly on graphs. We motivate the choice of our
convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of
spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph
edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph
structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation
networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms related methods by a significant margin.

 <dc:title>An architecture for ethical robots</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Robots are becoming ever more autonomous. This expanding ability to take
unsupervised decisions renders it imperative that mechanisms are in place to
guarantee the safety of behaviours executed by the robot. Moreover, smart
autonomous robots should be more than safe; they should also be explicitly
ethical -- able to both choose and justify actions that prevent harm. Indeed,
as the cognitive, perceptual and motor capabilities of robots expand, they will
be expected to have an improved capacity for making moral judgements. We
present a control architecture that supplements existing robot controllers.
This so-called Ethical Layer ensures robots behave according to a predetermined
set of ethical rules by predicting the outcomes of possible actions and
evaluating the predicted outcomes against those rules. To validate the proposed
architecture, we implement it on a humanoid robot so that it behaves according
to Asimov's laws of robotics. In a series of four experiments, using a second
humanoid robot as a proxy for the human, we demonstrate that the proposed
Ethical Layer enables the robot to prevent the human from coming to harm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel image denoising algorithm using
collaborative support-agnostic sparse reconstruction. An observed image is
first divided into patches. Similarly structured patches are grouped together
to be utilized for collaborative processing. In the proposed collaborative
schemes, similar patches are assumed to share the same support taps. For sparse
reconstruction, the likelihood of a tap being active in a patch is computed and
refined through a collaboration process with other similar patches in the same
group. This provides very good patch support estimation, hence enhancing the
quality of image restoration. Performance comparisons with state-of-the-art
algorithms, in terms of SSIM and PSNR, demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning (ML) models may be deemed confidential due to their
sensitive training data, commercial value, or use in security applications.
Increasingly often, confidential ML models are being deployed with publicly
accessible query interfaces. ML-as-a-service (&quot;predictive analytics&quot;) systems
are an example: Some allow users to train models on potentially sensitive data
and charge others for access on a pay-per-query basis.
  The tension between model confidentiality and public access motivates our
investigation of model extraction attacks. In such attacks, an adversary with
black-box access, but no prior knowledge of an ML model's parameters or
training data, aims to duplicate the functionality of (i.e., &quot;steal&quot;) the
model. Unlike in classical learning theory settings, ML-as-a-service offerings
may accept partial feature vectors as inputs and include confidence values with
predictions. Given these practices, we show simple, efficient attacks that
extract target ML models with near-perfect fidelity for popular model classes
including logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees. We
demonstrate these attacks against the online services of BigML and Amazon
Machine Learning. We further show that the natural countermeasure of omitting
confidence values from model outputs still admits potentially harmful model
extraction attacks. Our results highlight the need for careful ML model
deployment and new model extraction countermeasures.

Latent Dirichlet Al-location algorithm to associate posts with topics, and the
TF-IDF metric to identify the key posts associated with each top-ic. The model
was demonstrated in the domain of customer relationship by enabling careful
monitoring of evolving &quot;storms&quot; created by individuals which tend to impact
large audiences (either positively or negatively). Future research should be
engaged in order to extend the scope of the corpus by including additional

 <dc:title>Freeway Lane Management Approach in Mixed Traffic Environment with

 <dc:description>  Connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) technologies are about to be in the
market in the near future. This requires transportation facilities ready to
operate in a mixed traffic environment where a portion of vehicles are CAVs and
the remaining are manual vehicles. Since CAVs are able to run with less spacing
and headway compared with manual vehicles or mixed traffic, allocating a number
of freeway lanes exclusive to CAVs may improve the overall performance of
freeways. In this paper, we propose an analytical managed lane model to
evaluate the freeway flow in mixed traffic and to determine the optimal number
of lanes to be allocated to CAVs. The proposed model is investigated in two
different operation environments: single-lane and managed lane environments. We
further define three different CAV technology scenarios: neutral, conservative,
and aggressive. In the single-lane problem, the influence of CAV penetration
rates on mixed traffic capacity is examined in each scenario. In the managed
lanes problem, we propose a method to determine the optimal number of dedicated
lanes for CAVs under different settings. A number of numerical examples with
different geometries and demand levels are investigated for all three
scenarios. A sensitivity analysis on the penetration rates is conducted. The
results show that more aggressive CAV technologies need less specific allocated
lanes because they can follow the vehicles with less time and space headways.

 <dc:title>Control Flow Change in Assembly as a Classifier in Malware Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  As currently classical malware detection methods based on signatures fail to
detect new malware, they are not always efficient with new obfuscation
techniques. Besides, new malware is easily created and old malware can be
recoded to produce new one. Therefore, classical Antivirus becomes consistently
less effective in dealing with those new threats. Also malware gets hand
tailored to bypass network security and Antivirus. But as analysts do not have
enough time to dissect suspected malware by hand, automated approaches have
been developed. To cope with the mass of new malware, statistical and machine
learning methods proved to be a good approach classifying programs, especially
when using multiple approaches together to provide a likelihood of software
being malicious. In normal approach, some steps have been taken, mostly by
analyzing the opcodes or mnemonics of disassembly and their distribution. In
this paper, we focus on the control flow change (CFC) itself and finding out if
it is significant to detect malware. In the scope of this work, only relative
control flow changes are contemplated, as these are easier to extract from the
first chosen disassembler library and are within a range of 256 addresses.
These features are analyzed as a raw feature, as n-grams of length 2, 4 and 6
and the even more abstract feature of the occurrences of the n-grams is used.
Statistical methods were used as well as the Naive-Bayes algorithm to find out
if there is significant data in CFC. We also test our approach with real-world
datasets.

cues under ideal conditions in which context provided by an oracle. Based on
this study, we propose a region-based context re-scoring method with dynamic
context selection to remove noise and emphasize informative context. We
introduce latent indicator variables to select (or ignore) potential contextual
regions, and learn the selection strategy with latent-SVM. We conduct
experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed context selection
method on the SUN RGB-D dataset. The method achieves a significant improvement
in terms of mean average precision (mAP), compared with both appearance based
detectors and a conventional context model without the selection scheme.

 <dc:description>  Today, a mobile phone is not just a phone but it is a computer that you can
also use for calling someone. Besides, in criminal investigations the
importance of evidence from the mobile phone is increasing as more and more
phones are seized at the Digital Forensic Department of the police. Indeed, the
amount of memory cards of these mobile phones that need to be investigated
separately is also increasing. Possible reasons are that the mobile phone
investigation software does not support the specific mobile phone or the
specific, for that investigation, artefacts. Sometimes the software
investigates just the internal memory of the mobile phone and not the data
which is written on the memory card. Fact is also that although the mobile
phone was investigated by the dedicated software, the possibility that the
associated memory card contains additional important information is evident.
The current procedure to get all of the usable information from a memory card
of a mobile phone is very time-consuming process and not user friendly. In this
paper, we present a new single tool to simplify the investigation of a memory
card from a mobile phone. We also test our tool with WhatsApp application
installed on the memory card from different mobile phones.

 <dc:description>  There are many applications available for personal computers and mobile
devices that facilitate users in meeting potential partners. There is, however,
a risk associated with the level of anonymity on using instant message
applications, because there exists the potential for predators to attract and
lure vulnerable users. Today Instant Messaging within a Virtual Universe (IMVU)
combines custom avatars, chat or instant message (IM), community, content
creation, commerce, and anonymity. IMVU is also being exploited by criminals to
commit a wide variety of offenses. However, there are very few researches on
digital forensic acquisition of IMVU applications. In this paper, we discuss
first of all on challenges of IMVU forensics. We present a forensic acquisition
of an IMVU 3D application as a case study. We also describe and analyse our

 <dc:description>  We study the performance of linear solvers for graph Laplacians based on the
combinatorial cycle adjustment methodology proposed by
[Kelner-Orecchia-Sidford-Zhu STOC-13]. The approach finds a dual flow solution
to this linear system through a sequence of flow adjustments along cycles. We
study both data structure oriented and recursive methods for handling these
adjustments.
  The primary difficulty faced by this approach, updating and querying long
cycles, motivated us to study an important special case: instances where all
cycles are formed by fundamental cycles on a length $n$ path. Our methods
demonstrate significant speedups over previous implementations, and are
competitive with standard numerical routines.

 <dc:description>  Most Arabic natural language processing tools and resources are developed to
serve Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the official written language in
the Arab World. Some Dialectal Arabic varieties, notably Egyptian Arabic, have
received some attention lately and have a growing collection of resources that
include annotated corpora and morphological analyzers and taggers. Gulf Arabic,
however, lags behind in that respect. In this paper, we present the Gumar
Corpus, a large-scale corpus of Gulf Arabic consisting of 110 million words
from 1,200 forum novels. We annotate the corpus for sub-dialect information at
the document level. We also present results of a preliminary study in the
morphological annotation of Gulf Arabic which includes developing guidelines
for a conventional orthography. The text of the corpus is publicly browsable
through a web interface we developed for it.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the stabilization of linear systems with process noise
under packet drops between the sensor and the controller. Our aim is to ensure
exponential convergence of the second moment of the plant state to a given
bound in finite time. Motivated by considerations about the efficient use of
the available resources, we adopt an event-triggering approach to design the
transmission policy. In our design, the sensor's decision to transmit or not
the state to the controller is based on an online evaluation of the future
satisfaction of the control objective. The resulting event-triggering policy is
hence specifically tailored to the control objective. We formally establish
that the proposed event-triggering policy meets the desired objective and
quantify its efficiency by providing an upper bound on the fraction of expected
number of transmissions in an infinite time interval. Simulations for scalar
and vector systems illustrate the results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we numerically investigated the in vivo wireless communication
channel for the human male torso at 915 MHz. The results show that in vivo
channel is different from the classical communication channel, and location
dependency is very critical for link budget calculations. A statistical path
loss model based on the angle, depth and body region is introduced for near and
far field regions. Furthermore, multipath characteristics are investigated
using a power delay profile as well.

 <dc:description>  Today, mobile phones are very popular, fast growing technology. Mobile phones
of the present day are more and more like small computers. The so-called
&quot;smartphones&quot; contain a wealth of information each. This information has been
proven to be very useful in crime investigations, because relevant evidence can
be found in data retrieved from mobile phones used by criminals. In traditional
methods, the data from mobile phones can be extracted using an USB-cable.
However, for some reason this USB-cable connection cannot be made, the data
should be extracted in an alternative way. In this paper, we study the
possibility of extracting data from mobile devices using a Wi-Fi connection. We
describe our approach on mobile devices containing the Android Operating
System. Through our experiments, we also give recommendation on which
application and protocol can be used best to retrieve data.

 <dc:description>  High-performance industrial automation systems rely on tens of simultaneously
active sensors and actuators and have stringent communication latency and
reliability requirements. Current wireless technologies like WiFi, Bluetooth,
and LTE are unable to meet these requirements, forcing the use of wired
communication in industrial control systems. This paper introduces a wireless
communication protocol that capitalizes on multiuser diversity and cooperative
communication to achieve the ultra-reliability with a low-latency constraint.
  Our protocol is analyzed using the communication-theoretic
delay-limited-capacity framework and compared to baseline schemes that
primarily exploit frequency diversity. For a scenario inspired by an industrial
printing application with thirty nodes in the control loop, 20B messages
transmitted between pairs of nodes and a cycle time of $2$ ms, an idealized
protocol can achieve a cycle failure probability (probability that any packet
in a cycle is not successfully delivered) lower than $10^{-9}$ with nominal SNR
below 5 dB in a 20MHz wide channel.

 <dc:description>  With the introduction of consumer light field cameras, light field imaging
has recently become widespread. However, there is an inherent trade-off between
the angular and spatial resolution, and thus, these cameras often sparsely
sample in either spatial or angular domain. In this paper, we use machine
learning to mitigate this trade-off. Specifically, we propose a novel
learning-based approach to synthesize new views from a sparse set of input
views. We build upon existing view synthesis techniques and break down the
process into disparity and color estimation components. We use two sequential
convolutional neural networks to model these two components and train both
networks simultaneously by minimizing the error between the synthesized and
ground truth images. We show the performance of our approach using only four
corner sub-aperture views from the light fields captured by the Lytro Illum
camera. Experimental results show that our approach synthesizes high-quality
images that are superior to the state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of
challenging real-world scenes. We believe our method could potentially decrease
the required angular resolution of consumer light field cameras, which allows
their spatial resolution to increase.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, financial data analysis is becoming increasingly important in the
business market. As companies collect more and more data from daily operations,
they expect to extract useful knowledge from existing collected data to help
make reasonable decisions for new customer requests, e.g. user credit category,
churn analysis, real estate analysis, etc. Financial institutes have applied
different data mining techniques to enhance their business performance.
However, simple ap-proach of these techniques could raise a performance issue.
Besides, there are very few general models for both understanding and
forecasting different finan-cial fields. We present in this paper a new
classification model for analyzing fi-nancial data. We also evaluate this model
with different real-world data to show its performance.

 <dc:description>  Networking data analytics is increasingly used for enhanced network
visibility and controllability. We draw the similarities between the Software
Defined Networking (SDN) architecture and the MapReduce programming model.
Inspired by the similarity, we suggest the necessary data plane innovations to
make network data plane devices function as distributed mappers and optionally,
reducers. A streaming network data MapReduce architecture can therefore
conveniently solve a series of network monitoring and management problems.
Unlike the traditional networking data analytical system, our proposed system
embeds the data analytics engine directly in the network infrastructure. The
affinity leads to a concise system architecture and better cost performance
ratio. On top of this architecture, we propose a general MapReduce-like
programming model for real-time and one-pass networking data analytics, which
involves joint in-network and out-of-network computing. We show this model can
address a wide range of interactive queries from various network applications.
This position paper strives to make a point that the white-box trend does not
necessarily lead to simple and dumb networking devices. Rather, the defining
characteristics of the next generation white-box are open and programmable, so
that the network devices can be made smart and versatile to support new
services and applications.

 <dc:description>  The technique of coded caching proposed by Madddah-Ali and Niesen is a
promising approach to alleviate the load of networks during busy times.
Recently, placement delivery array (PDA) was presented to characterize both the
placement and delivery phase in a single array for the centralized coded
caching algorithm. In this paper, we interpret PDA from a new perspective,
i.e., the strong edge coloring of bipartite graph. We prove that, a PDA is
equivalent to a strong edge colored bipartite graph. Thus, we can construct a
class of PDAs from existing structures in bipartite graphs. The class includes
the scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali \textit{et al.} and a more general class of
PDAs proposed by Shangguan \textit{et al.} as special cases. Moreover, it is
capable of generating a lot of PDAs with flexible tradeoff between the
sub-packet level and load.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes MP3, the second privacy-preserving presence protocol that
leaks no information about the graph structure of the social network. Several
cryptographic techniques are applied to improve the existing DP5 protocol---the
first privacy-preserving presence protocol---while maintaining the same level
of privacy. The key contribution of this paper is the use of a dynamic
broadcast encryption scheme to reduce the size of the presence database. This
enables cheaper registration and lookup required for the protocol. As compared
to DP5, MP3 requires on the order of ten times less bandwidth of the servers
during registration, and requires on the order of two times less bandwidth for
lookup, for a small number of users ($N=10000$). Furthermore, these savings
asymptotically increase with the number of users. The client-side latency is
also improved significantly in MP3, as compared with DP5. We provide an
evaluation of the performance and scalability of both protocols.

 <dc:description>  We consider scenarios from the real-time strategy game StarCraft as new
benchmarks for reinforcement learning algorithms. We propose micromanagement
tasks, which present the problem of the short-term, low-level control of army
members during a battle. From a reinforcement learning point of view, these
scenarios are challenging because the state-action space is very large, and
because there is no obvious feature representation for the state-action
evaluation function. We describe our approach to tackle the micromanagement
scenarios with deep neural network controllers from raw state features given by
the game engine. In addition, we present a heuristic reinforcement learning
algorithm which combines direct exploration in the policy space and
backpropagation. This algorithm allows for the collection of traces for
learning using deterministic policies, which appears much more efficient than,
for example, {\epsilon}-greedy exploration. Experiments show that with this
algorithm, we successfully learn non-trivial strategies for scenarios with
armies of up to 15 agents, where both Q-learning and REINFORCE struggle.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new system to visualize depth-dependent patterns and images on
solid objects with complex geometry using multiple projectors. The system,
despite consisting of conventional passive LCD projectors, is able to project
different images and patterns depending on the spatial location of the object.
The technique is based on the simple principle that multiple patterns projected
from multiple projectors interfere constructively with each other when their
patterns are projected on the same object. Previous techniques based on the
same principle can only achieve 1) low resolution volume colorization or 2)
high resolution images but only on a limited number of flat planes. In this
paper, we discretize a 3D object into a number of 3D points so that high
resolution images can be projected onto the complex shapes. We also propose a
dynamic ranges expansion technique as well as an efficient optimization
procedure based on epipolar constraints.
  Such technique can be used to the extend projection mapping to have spatial
dependency, which is desirable for practical applications. We also demonstrate
the system potential as a visual instructor for object placement and
assembling. Experiments prove the effectiveness of our method.

 <dc:title>Knowledge management and measurement in Public Sector Organizations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Knowledge Management (KM) is a strategic component that enables development,
growth and continuous improvement of Public Sector Organizations (PSO). This
thesis is bounded to this specific context. Indeed, we critically and
comprehensively study the factors that characterize KM strategies and those
that foster its development and success in PSO, then finally we propose metrics
to measure and evaluate, in order to continuous and systematically improve KM
practices in PSO. Main problems are related to the lack of academic literature
that explains the elements that KM address in the given context. In addition,
it is identified as a problem the lack of criteria for measuring and evaluating
KM in PSO, from a different viewpoint than business perspective. The
contribution of this thesis is that it provides valuable elements for an
academic debate on the previous factors, strategies and metrics to promote KM
initiatives in PSO. To achieve the research objective of this thesis we
performed a comprehensive systematic literature review in order to discover
what the KM critical success factors are, and also we integrated and proposed
some metrics to evaluate and assess the performance of KM in PSO. We conducted
an in-depth study among different Public Sector Organizations in order to learn
what are the critical success factors that must be first considered before
implement KM initiatives. based on this. Finally, based on this methodological
proposal and as a result of this research, we were able to analyze and explain
the critical success factors, we identified some strategies to encourage the
success of KM and integrated a proposal of metrics, from different approaches,
for KM in PSO.

 <dc:description>  Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to reduce the dimension of
data by selecting a few orthonormal vectors that explain most of the variance
structure of the data. L1 PCA uses the L1 norm to measure error, whereas the
conventional PCA uses the L2 norm. For the L1 PCA problem minimizing the
fitting error of the reconstructed data, we propose an exact reweighted and an
approximate algorithm based on iteratively reweighted least squares. We provide
convergence analyses, and compare their performance against benchmark
algorithms in the literature. The computational experiment shows that the
proposed algorithms consistently perform best.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce new types of approximate palindromes called
single-arm-gapped palindromes (shortly SAGPs). A SAGP contains a gap in either
its left or right arm. We propose several algorithms to compute SAGPs with
longest arms occurring in a given string. We also perform some preliminary
experiments to show practical performances of the proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  We study the interaction of the programming construct &quot;new&quot;, which generates
statically scoped names, with communication via messages on channels. This
interaction is crucial in security protocols, which are the main motivating
examples for our work, it also appears in other programming-language contexts.
  We define the applied pi calculus, a simple, general extension of the pi
calculus in which values can be formed from names via the application of
built-in functions, subject to equations, and be sent as messages. (In
contrast, the pure pi calculus lacks built-in functions, its only messages are
atomic names.) We develop semantics and proof techniques for this extended
language and apply them in reasoning about security protocols.
  This paper essentially subsumes the conference paper that introduced the
applied pi calculus in 2001. It fills gaps, incorporates improvements, and
further explains and studies the applied pi calculus. Since 2001, the applied
pi calculus has been the basis for much further work, described in many
research publications and sometimes embodied in useful software, such as the
tool ProVerif, which relies on the applied pi calculus to support the
specification and automatic analysis of security protocols. Although this paper
does not aim to be a complete review of the subject, it benefits from that
further work and provides better foundations for some of it. In particular, the
applied pi calculus has evolved through its implementation in ProVerif, and the
present definition reflects that evolution.

 <dc:description>  A graph $G$ covers a graph $H$ if there exists a locally bijective
homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. We deal with regular covers where this
homomorphism is prescribed by the action of a semiregular subgroup of
$\textrm{Aut}(G)$. We study computational aspects of regular covers that have
not been addressed before. The decision problem RegularCover asks for given
graphs $G$ and $H$ whether $G$ regularly covers $H$. When $|H|=1$, this problem
becomes Cayley graph recognition for which the complexity is still unresolved.
Another special case arises for $|G| = |H|$ when it becomes the graph
isomorphism problem.
  Our main result is an involved FPT algorithm solving RegularCover for planar
inputs $G$ in time $O^*(2^{e(H)/2})$ where $e(H)$ denotes the number of edges
of $H$. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming and employs theoretical
results proved in a related structural paper. Further, when $G$ is 3-connected,
$H$ is 2-connected or the ratio $|G|/|H|$ is an odd integer, we can solve the
problem RegularCover in polynomial time. In comparison, B\'ilka et al. (2011)
proved that testing general graph covers is NP-complete for planar inputs $G$
when $H$ is a small fixed graph such as $K_4$ or $K_5$.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Certainty-Equivalence Control With Regulation-Triggered
  Finite-Time Least-Squares Identification, Part I: Design</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For general nonlinear control systems we present a novel approach to adaptive
control, which employs a certainty equivalence (indirect) control law and an
identifier with event-triggered updates of the plant parameter estimates, where
the triggers are based on the size of the plant's state and the updates are
conducted using a non-recursive least-squares estimation over certain finite
time intervals, with updates employing delayed measurements of the state. With
a suitable non-restrictive parameter-observability assumption, our adaptive
controller guarantees global stability, regulation of the plant state, and our
identifier achieves parameter convergence, in finite time, even in the absence
of persistent excitation, for all initial conditions other than those where the
initial plant state is zero. The robustness of our event-triggered adaptive
control scheme to vanishing and non-vanishing disturbances is verified in
simulations with the assistance of a dead zone-like modification of the update
law. The major distinctions of our approach from supervisory adaptive schemes
is that our approach is indirect and our triggering is related to the control
objective (the regulation error). The major distinction from the classical
indirect Lyapunov adaptive schemes based on tuning related to the regulation
error is that our approach does not involve a complex redesign of the
controller to compensate for the detrimental effects of rapid tuning on the
transients by incorporating the update law into the control law. Instead, our
approach allows for the first time to use a simple certainty equivalence
adaptive controller for general nonlinear systems. All proofs are given in a
companion paper.

 <dc:description>  We present the stability analysis for the new regulation-triggered approach
to adaptive control introduced in a companion paper. Due to the fact that the
closed-loop system is hybrid, our proofs have essential differences from the
conventional adaptive control proofs, where the Lyapunov analysis either
encompasses the complete closed-loop state or is done in multiple steps through
comparison or Gronwall-Bellman lemmas. In addition, we present a convenient
algorithm for checking our parameter-observability assumption, which involves
repeated Lie derivatives of appropriate vector fields and can be applied to the
class of nonlinear control systems for which at most one unknown parameter
appears in each differential equation.

 <dc:description>  Recent statistics show that in 2015 more than 140 millions new malware
samples have been found. Among these, a large portion is due to ransomware, the
class of malware whose specific goal is to render the victim's system unusable,
in particular by encrypting important files, and then ask the user to pay a
ransom to revert the damage. Several ransomware include sophisticated packing
techniques, and are hence difficult to statically analyse. We present EldeRan,
a machine learning approach for dynamically analysing and classifying
ransomware. EldeRan monitors a set of actions performed by applications in
their first phases of installation checking for characteristics signs of
ransomware. Our tests over a dataset of 582 ransomware belonging to 11
families, and with 942 goodware applications, show that EldeRan achieves an
area under the ROC curve of 0.995. Furthermore, EldeRan works without requiring
that an entire ransomware family is available beforehand. These results suggest
that dynamic analysis can support ransomware detection, since ransomware
samples exhibit a set of characteristic features at run-time that are common
across families, and that helps the early detection of new variants. We also
outline some limitations of dynamic analysis for ransomware and propose
possible solutions.

 <dc:description>  Recently deep neural networks based on tanh activation function have shown
their impressive power in image denoising. In this letter, we try to use
rectifier function instead of tanh and propose a dual-pathway rectifier neural
network by combining two rectifier neurons with reversed input and output

and compare it to some typical activation functions for image denoising under
the same network architecture. The experimental results show that our model
achieves superior performances faster especially when the noise is small.

 <dc:description>  Layered manufacturing inherently suffers from staircase defects along
surfaces that are gently slopped with respect to the build direction. Reducing
the slice thickness improves the situation but never resolves it completely as
flat layers remain a poor approximation of the true surface in these regions.
In addition, reducing the slice thickness largely increases the print time. In
this work we focus on a simple yet effective technique to improve the print
accuracy for layered manufacturing by filament deposition. Our method works
with standard three-axis 3D filament printers (e.g. the typical, widely
available 3D printers), using standard extrusion nozzles. It better reproduces
the geometry of sloped surfaces without increasing the print time. Our key idea
is to perform a local anti-aliasing, working at a sub-layer accuracy to produce
slightly curved deposition paths and reduce approximation errors. This is
inspired by Computer Graphics anti-aliasing techniques which consider sub-pixel
precision to treat aliasing effects. We show that the necessary deviation in
height compared to standard slicing is bounded by half the layer thickness.
Therefore, the height changes remain small and plastic deposition remains
reliable. We further split and order paths to minimize defects due to the
extruder nozzle shape, avoiding any change to the existing hardware. We apply
and analyze our approach on 3D printed examples, showing that our technique
greatly improves surface accuracy and silhouette quality while keeping the
print time nearly identical.

 <dc:title>Directed Graph-based Wireless EEG Sensor Channel Selection Approach for
  Cognitive Task Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors have been successfully applied in
many medical and computer brain interface classifications. A common
characteristic of wireless EEG sensors is that they are low powered devices,
and hence an efficient usage of sensor energy resources is critical for any
practical application. One way of minimizing energy consumption by the EEG
sensors is by reducing the number of EEG channels participating in the
classification process. For the purpose of classifying EEG signals, we propose
a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based channel selection algorithm. To achieve
this objective, the EEG sensor channels are first realized in a complete
undirected graph, where each channel is represented by a node. An edge between
any two nodes indicates the collaboration between these nodes in identifying
the system state; and the significance of this collaboration is quantified by a
weight assigned to the edge. The complete graph is then reduced into a directed
acyclic graph that encodes the knowledge of the non-increasing order of the
channel ranking for each cognitive task. The channel selection algorithm
utilizes this directed graph to find a maximum path such that the total weight
of this path satisfies a predefined threshold. It has been demonstrated
experimentally that channel utilization has been reduced by 50% in the worst
case scenario for a three-state system and an EEG sensor with 14 channels; and
the best classification accuracy obtained is 81%.

Protocol (OCSP), a protocol widely used in PKI environments for managing
digital certificates' credibility in real time. The flaws significantly reduce
the security capabilities of the protocol, and can be exploited by a malicious
third party to generate forged signed certificate statuses and, in the worst

 <dc:description>  Crowdsourcing environments have shown promise in solving diverse tasks in
limited cost and time. This type of business model involves both the expert and
non-expert workers. Interestingly, the success of such models depends on the
volume of the total number of workers. But, the survival of the fittest
controls the stability of these workers. Here, we show that the crowd workers
who fail to win jobs successively loose interest and might dropout over time.
Therefore, dropout prediction in such environments is a promising task. In this
paper, we establish that it is possible to predict the dropouts in a
crowdsourcing market from the success rate based on the arrival pattern of
workers.

 <dc:title>New Steps on the Exact Learning of CNF</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hermo, Montserrat</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ozaki, Ana</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A major problem in computational learning theory is whether the class of
formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is efficiently learnable. Although it
is known that this class cannot be polynomially learned using either membership
or equivalence queries alone, it is open whether CNF can be polynomially
learned using both types of queries. One of the most important results
concerning a restriction of the class CNF is that propositional Horn formulas
are polynomial time learnable in Angluin's exact learning model with membership
and equivalence queries. In this work we push this boundary and show that the
class of multivalued dependency formulas (MVDF) is polynomially learnable from
interpretations. We then provide a notion of reduction between learning
problems in Angluin's model, showing that a transformation of the algorithm
suffices to efficiently learn multivalued database dependencies from data
relations. We also show via reductions that our main result extends well known
previous results and allows us to find alternative solutions for them.

 <dc:description>  Learning the spatial-temporal representation of motion information is crucial
to human action recognition. Nevertheless, most of the existing features or
descriptors cannot capture motion information effectively, especially for
long-term motion. To address this problem, this paper proposes a long-term
motion descriptor called sequential Deep Trajectory Descriptor (sDTD).
Specifically, we project dense trajectories into two-dimensional planes, and
subsequently a CNN-RNN network is employed to learn an effective representation
for long-term motion. Unlike the popular two-stream ConvNets, the sDTD stream
is introduced into a three-stream framework so as to identify actions from a
video sequence. Consequently, this three-stream framework can simultaneously
capture static spatial features, short-term motion and long-term motion in the
video. Extensive experiments were conducted on three challenging datasets: KTH,
HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the KTH and UCF101 datasets, and is comparable
to the state-of-the-art methods on the HMDB51 dataset.

 <dc:title>Style-Transfer via Texture-Synthesis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Elad, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Milanfar, Peyman</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Style-transfer is a process of migrating a style from a given image to the
content of another, synthesizing a new image which is an artistic mixture of
the two. Recent work on this problem adopting Convolutional Neural-networks
(CNN) ignited a renewed interest in this field, due to the very impressive
results obtained. There exists an alternative path towards handling the
style-transfer task, via generalization of texture-synthesis algorithms. This
approach has been proposed over the years, but its results are typically less
impressive compared to the CNN ones.
  In this work we propose a novel style-transfer algorithm that extends the
texture-synthesis work of Kwatra et. al. (2005), while aiming to get stylized
images that get closer in quality to the CNN ones. We modify Kwatra's algorithm
in several key ways in order to achieve the desired transfer, with emphasis on
a consistent way for keeping the content intact in selected regions, while
producing hallucinated and rich style in others. The results obtained are
visually pleasing and diverse, shown to be competitive with the recent CNN
style-transfer algorithms. The proposed algorithm is fast and flexible, being
able to process any pair of content + style images.

 <dc:description>  Trajectory analysis is essential in many applications. In this paper, we
address the problem of representing motion trajectories in a highly informative
way, and consequently utilize it for analyzing trajectories. Our approach first
leverages the complete information from given trajectories to construct a
thermal transfer field which provides a context-rich way to describe the global
motion pattern in a scene. Then, a 3D tube is derived which depicts an input
trajectory by integrating its surrounding motion patterns contained in the
thermal transfer field. The 3D tube effectively: 1) maintains the movement
information of a trajectory, 2) embeds the complete contextual motion pattern
around a trajectory, 3) visualizes information about a trajectory in a clear
and unified way. We further introduce a droplet-based process. It derives a
droplet vector from a 3D tube, so as to characterize the high-dimensional 3D
tube information in a simple but effective way. Finally, we apply our
tube-and-droplet representation to trajectory analysis applications including
trajectory clustering, trajectory classification &amp; abnormality detection, and
3D action recognition. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art
algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  This paper gives a concise introduction into the basic theory of
{\omega}-automata (as of March 2014). The starting point are the different
types of recurrence conditions, modes of operation (deterministic,
nondeterministic, alternating automata), and directions (forward or backward
automata). The main focus is on fundamental automata constructions, for
instance, for boolean operations, determinization, disambiguation, and removing
alternation. It also covers some algebraic aspects such as congruences for
{\omega}-automata (and {\omega}-languages), basic structure theory (loops), and
applications in mathematical logic. This paper may eventually become a chapter
in a handbook of automata theory.

 <dc:title>Quantifying the informativeness for biomedical literature summarization:

 <dc:description>  Objective: Automatic text summarization tools can help users in the
biomedical domain to access information efficiently from a large volume of
scientific literature and other sources of text documents. In this paper, we
propose a summarization method that combines itemset mining and domain
knowledge to construct a concept-based model and to extract the main subtopics
from an input document. Our summarizer quantifies the informativeness of each
sentence using the support values of itemsets appearing in the sentence.
Methods: To address the concept-level analysis of text, our method initially
maps the original document to biomedical concepts using the UMLS. Then, it
discovers the essential subtopics of the text using a data mining technique,
namely itemset mining, and constructs the summarization model. The employed
itemset mining algorithm extracts a set of frequent itemsets containing
correlated and recurrent concepts of the input document. The summarizer selects
the most related and informative sentences and generates the final summary.
Results: We evaluate the performance of our itemset-based summarizer using the
Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics, performing a
set of experiments. The results show that the itemset-based summarizer performs
better than the compared methods. The itemset-based summarizer achieves the
best scores for all the assessed ROUGE metrics . Conclusion: Compared to the
statistical, similarity, and word frequency methods, the proposed method
demonstrates that the summarization model obtained from the concept extraction
and itemset mining provides the summarizer with an effective metric for
measuring the informative content of sentences. This can lead to an improvement
in the performance of biomedical literature summarization.

 <dc:description>  A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a universal approximator of dynamical
systems, whose performance often depends on sensitive hyperparameters. Tuning
of such hyperparameters may be difficult and, typically, based on a
trial-and-error approach. In this work, we adopt a graph-based framework to
interpret and characterize the internal RNN dynamics. Through this insight, we
are able to design a principled unsupervised method to derive configurations
with maximized performances, in terms of prediction error and memory capacity.
In particular, we propose to model time series of neurons activations with the
recently introduced horizontal visibility graphs, whose topological properties
reflect important dynamical features of the underlying dynamic system.
Successively, each graph becomes a layer of a larger structure, called
multiplex. We show that topological properties of such a multiplex reflect
important features of RNN dynamics and are used to guide the tuning procedure.
To validate the proposed method, we consider a class of RNNs called echo state
networks. We perform experiments and discuss results on several benchmarks and
real-world dataset of call data records.

 <dc:title>Guided Policy Search with Delayed Sensor Measurements</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schenck, Connor</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Guided policy search is a method for reinforcement learning that trains a
general policy for accomplishing a given task by guiding the learning of the
policy with multiple guiding distributions. Guided policy search relies on
learning an underlying dynamical model of the environment and then, at each
iteration of the algorithm, using that model to gradually improve the policy.
This model, though, often makes the assumption that the environment dynamics
are markovian, e.g., depend only on the current state and control signal. In
this paper we apply guided policy search to a problem with non-markovian
dynamics. Specifically, we apply it to the problem of pouring a precise amount
of liquid from a cup into a bowl, where many of the sensor measurements
experience non-trivial amounts of delay. We show that, with relatively simple
state augmentation, guided policy search can be extended to non-markovian
dynamical systems, where the non-markovianess is caused by delayed sensor
readings.

 <dc:title>Using Spatial Pooler of Hierarchical Temporal Memory to classify noisy

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper examines the performance of a Spatial Pooler (SP) of a
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) in the task of noisy object recognition. To
address this challenge, a dedicated custom-designed system based on the SP,
histogram calculation module and SVM classifier was implemented. In addition to
implementing their own version of HTM, the authors also designed a profiler
which is capable of tracing all of the key parameters of the system. This was
necessary, since an analysis and monitoring of the system performance turned
out to be extremely difficult using conventional testing and debugging tools.
The system was initially trained on artificially prepared videos without noise
and then tested with a set of noisy video streams. This approach was intended
to mimic a real life scenario where an agent or a system trained to deal with
ideal objects faces a task of classifying distorted and noisy ones in its
regular working conditions. The authors conducted a series of experiments for
various macro parameters of HTM SP, as well as for different levels of video
reduction ratios. The experiments allowed them to evaluate the performance of
two different system setups (i.e. 'Multiple HTMs' and 'Single HTM') under
various noise conditions with 32--frame video files. Results of all the tests
were compared to SVM baseline setup. It was determined that the system
featuring SP is capable of achieving approximately 12 times the noise reduction
for a video signal with with distorted bits accounting for 13\% of the total.
Furthermore, the system featuring SP performed better also in the experiments
without a noise component and achieved a max F1 score of 0.96. The experiments
also revealed that a rise of column and synapse number of SP has a substantial
impact on the performance of the system. Consequently, the highest F1 score
values were obtained for 256 and 4096 synapses and columns respectively.

 <dc:description>  Edge-labeled graphs are widely used to describe relationships between
entities in a database. Given a query subgraph that represents an example of
what the user is searching for, we study the problem of efficiently searching
for similar subgraphs in a large data graph, where the similarity is defined in
terms of the well-known graph edit distance. We call these queries
&quot;error-tolerant exemplar queries&quot; since matches are allowed despite small
variations in the graph structure and the labels. The problem in its general
case is computationally intractable, but efficient solutions are reachable for
labeled graphs under well-behaved distribution of the labels, commonly found in
knowledge graphs. We propose two efficient exact algorithms, based on a
filtering-and-verification framework, for finding subgraphs in a large data
graph that are isomorphic to a query graph under some edit operations. Our
filtering scheme, which uses the neighbourhood structure around a node and the
presence or absence of paths, significantly reduces the number of candidates
that are passed to the verification stage. Moreover, we analyze the costs of
our algorithms and the conditions under which one algorithm is expected to
outperform the other. Our analysis identifies some of the variables that affect
the cost, including the number and the selectivity of query edge labels and the
degree of nodes in the data graph, and characterizes their relationships. We
empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our filtering schemes and queries,
the efficiency of our algorithms and the reliability of our cost models on real
datasets.

 <dc:title>Uncertainty in Monotone Co-Design Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Censi, Andrea</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work contributes to a compositional theory of &quot;co-design&quot; that allows to
optimally design a robotic platform. In this framework, the user describes each
subsystem as a monotone relation between &quot;functionality&quot; provided and
&quot;resources&quot; required. These models can be easily composed to express the
co-design constraints among different subsystems. The user then queries the
model, to obtain the design with minimal resources usage, subject to a lower
bound on the provided functionality. This paper concerns the introduction of
uncertainty in the framework. Uncertainty has two roles: first, it allows to
deal with limited knowledge of the models; second, it also can be used to
generate consistent relaxations of a problem, as the computation requirements
can be lowered, should the user accept some uncertainty in the answer.

 <dc:title>On Some Universally Good Fractional Repetition Codes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Data storage in Distributed Storage Systems (DSSs) is a multidimensional
optimization problem. Using network coding, one wants to provide reliability,
scalability, security, reduced storage overhead, reduced bandwidth for repair
and minimal disk I/O etc. in such systems. Regenerating codes have been used to
optimize some of these parameters, where a file can be reconstructed by
contacting any k nodes in the system and in case of node failure it can be
repaired by using any d nodes in the system. This was further generalized to
Fractional repetition (FR) codes (a smart replication of encoded packets) on n
nodes which also provides optimized disk I/O and where a node failure can be
repaired by contacting some specific set of nodes in the system. Several
constructions of FR codes using graphs and combinatorial designs are known. In
particular, some constructions of codes for heterogeneous DSSs are given using
partial regular graph (where number of packets on each node is different) and
ring construction. In this work, we show that the codes constructed using the
partial regular graph are universally good code. Further, we found several
universally good codes using ring construction and t-construction.

 <dc:title>Assembly Sequence Planning for Motion Planning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a planner to find an optimal assembly sequence to
assemble several objects. The input to the planner is the mesh models of the
objects, the relative poses between the objects in the assembly, and the final
pose of the assembly. The output is an optimal assembly sequence, namely (1) in
which order should one assemble the objects, (2) from which directions should
the objects be dropped, and (3) candidate grasps of each object. The proposed
planner finds the optimal solution by automatically permuting, evaluating, and
searching the possible assembly sequences considering stability, graspability,
and assemblability qualities. It is expected to guide robots to do assembly
using translational motion. The output provides initial and goal configurations
to motion planning algorithms. It is ready to be used by robots and is
demonstrated using several simulations and real-world executions.

 <dc:title>Message Authentication and Secret Key Agreement in VANETs via Angle of

 <dc:description>  In the scope of VANETs, nature of exchanged safety/warning messages renders
itself highly location dependent as it is usually for incident reporting. Thus,
vehicles are required to periodically exchange beacon messages that include
speed, time and GPS location information. In this paper paper, we present a
physical layer assisted message authentication scheme that uses Angle of
Arrival (AoA) estimation to verify the message originator location based on the
claimed location information. Within the considered vehicular communication
settings, fundamental limits of AoA estimation are developed in terms of its
Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) and existence of efficient estimator. The problem of
deciding whether the received signal is originated from the claimed GPS
location is formulated as a two sided hypotheses testing problem whose solution
is given by Wald test statics. Moreover, we use correct decision, $P_D$, and
false alarm, $P_F$, probabilities as a quantitative performance measure. The
observation posterior likelihood function is shown to satisfy regularity
conditions necessary for asymptotic normality of the ML-AoA estimator. Thus, we
give $P_D$ and $P_F$ in a closed form.
  We extend the potential of physical layer contribution in security to provide
physical layer assisted secret key agreement (SKA) protocol. A public key (PK)
based SKA in which communicating vehicles are required to validate their
respective physical location. We show that the risk of the Man in the Middle
attack, which is common in PK-SKA protocols without a trusted third party, is
waived up to the literal meaning of the word &quot;middle&quot;.

 <dc:description>  Suppose that $D=(V,E)$ is a strongly connected digraph. Let $u,v\in V(D)$.
The maximum distance $md (u,v)$ is defined as
$md(u,v)$=max\{$\overrightarrow{d}(u,v), \overrightarrow{d}(v,u)$\} where
$\overrightarrow{d}(u,v)$ denote the length of a shortest directed $u-v$ path
in $D$. This is a metric. The boundary, contour, eccentric and peripheral sets
of a strong digraph $D$ are defined with respect to this metric. The main aim
of this paper is to identify the above said metrically defined sets of a large
strong digraph $D$ in terms of its prime factor decomposition with respect to
cartesian product.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the &quot;Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network&quot; model (EBGAN)
which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low
energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other
regions. Similar to the probabilistic GANs, a generator is seen as being
trained to produce contrastive samples with minimal energies, while the
discriminator is trained to assign high energies to these generated samples.
Viewing the discriminator as an energy function allows to use a wide variety of
architectures and loss functionals in addition to the usual binary classifier
with logistic output. Among them, we show one instantiation of EBGAN framework
as using an auto-encoder architecture, with the energy being the reconstruction
error, in place of the discriminator. We show that this form of EBGAN exhibits
more stable behavior than regular GANs during training. We also show that a
single-scale architecture can be trained to generate high-resolution images.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a real-time classification scheme to cope with
noisy Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements utilized in indoor
positioning systems. RSSI values are often converted to distances for position
estimation. However due to multipathing and shadowing effects, finding a unique
sensor model using both parametric and non-parametric methods is highly
challenging. We learn decision regions using the Gaussian Processes
classification to accept measurements that are consistent with the operating
sensor model. The proposed approach can perform online, does not rely on a
particular sensor model or parameters, and is robust to sensor failures. The
experimental results achieved using hardware show that available positioning
algorithms can benefit from incorporating the classifier into their measurement
model as a meta-sensor modeling technique.

3. We describe the ob- servation of smaller graphs and basic structure of our

 <dc:title>Learning Semantic Part-Based Models from Google Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Modolo, Davide</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a technique to train semantic part-based models of object classes
from Google Images. Our models encompass the appearance of parts and their
spatial arrangement on the object, specific to each viewpoint. We learn these
rich models by collecting training instances for both parts and objects, and
automatically connecting the two levels. Our framework works incrementally, by
learning from easy examples first, and then gradually adapting to harder ones.
A key benefit of this approach is that it requires no manual part location
annotations. We evaluate our models on the challenging PASCAL-Part dataset [1]
and show how their performance increases at every step of the learning, with
the final models more than doubling the performance of directly training from
images retrieved by querying for part names (from 12.9 to 27.2 AP). Moreover,
we show that our part models can help object detection performance by enriching
the R-CNN detector with parts.

 <dc:title>Exact Dimensionality Reduction for Partial Line Spectra Estimation
  Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Da Costa, Maxime Ferreira</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Dai, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Line spectral estimation theory aims to estimate the off-the-grid spectral
components of a time signal with optimal precision. Recent results have shown
that it is possible to recover signals having sparse line spectra from few
temporal observations via the use of convex programming. However, the
computational cost of such approaches remains the major flaw to their
application to practical systems. This work investigates the recovery of
spectrally sparse signal from low-dimensional partial measurements. It is shown
in the first part of this paper that, under a light assumption on the
sub-sampling matrix, the partial line spectral estimation problems can be
relaxed into a low-dimensional semidefinite program. The proof technique relies
on a novel extension of the Gram parametrization to subspaces of trigonometric
polynomials.
  The second part of this work focuses on the analysis of two particular
sub-sampling patterns: multirate sampling and random selection sampling. It is
shown that those sampling patterns guarantee perfect recovery of the line
spectra, and that the reconstruction can be achieved in a poly-logarithmic time
with respect to the full observation case. Moreover, the sub-Nyquist recovery
capabilities of such sampling patterns are highlighted. The atomic soft
thresholding method is adapted in the presented framework to estimate sparse
spectra in noisy environments, and a scalable algorithm for its resolution is
proposed.

 <dc:description>  We provide a survey on relational models. Relational models describe complete
networked {domains by taking into account global dependencies in the data}.
Relational models can lead to more accurate predictions if compared to
non-relational machine learning approaches. Relational models typically are
based on probabilistic graphical models, e.g., Bayesian networks, Markov
networks, or latent variable models. Relational models have applications in
social networks analysis, the modeling of knowledge graphs, bioinformatics,
recommendation systems, natural language processing, medical decision support,
and linked data.

 <dc:title>Honey: A dataflow programming language for the processing, featurization
  and analysis of multivariate, asynchronous and non-uniformly sampled scalar
  symbolic time sequences</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guillame-Bert, Mathieu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce HONEY; a new specialized programming language designed to
facilitate the processing of multivariate, asynchronous and non-uniformly
sampled symbolic and scalar time sequences. When compiled, a Honey program is
transformed into a static process flow diagram, which is then executed by a
virtual machine. Honey's most notable features are: (1) Honey introduces a new,
efficient and non-prone to error paradigm for defining recursive process flow
diagrams from text input with the mindset of imperative programming. Honey's
specialized, high level and concise syntax allows fast and easy writing,
reading and maintenance of complex processing of large scalar symbolic time
sequence datasets. (2) Honey guarantees programs will be executed similarly on
static or real-time streaming datasets. (3) Honey's IDE includes an interactive
visualization tool which allows for an interactive exploration of the
intermediate and final outputs. This combination enables fast incremental
prototyping, debugging, monitoring and maintenance of complex programs. (4) In
case of large datasets (larger than the available memory), Honey programs can
be executed to process input greedily. (5) The graphical structure of a
compiled program provides several desirable properties, including distributed
and/or paralleled execution, memory optimization, and program structure
visualization. (6) Honey contains a large library of both common and novel
operators developed through various research projects. An open source C++
implementation of Honey as well as the Honey IDE and the interactive data
visualizer are publicly available.

 <dc:title>Divide and...conquer? On the limits of algorithmic approaches to

 <dc:description>  In computer science, divide and conquer (D&amp;C) is an algorithm design paradigm
based on multi-branched recursion. A D&amp;C algorithm works by recursively and
monotonically breaking down a problem into sub problems of the same (or a
related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The
solutions to the sub problems are then combined to give a solution to the
original problem. The present work identifies D&amp;C algorithms assumed within
contemporary syntactic theory, and discusses the limits of their applicability
in the realms of the syntax semantics and syntax morphophonology interfaces. We
will propose that D&amp;C algorithms, while valid for some processes, fall short on
flexibility given a mixed approach to the structure of linguistic phrase
markers. Arguments in favour of a computationally mixed approach to linguistic
structure will be presented as an alternative that offers advantages to uniform
D&amp;C approaches.

 <dc:description>  The problem of primary control of high-voltage direct current transmission
systems is addressed in this paper, which contains four main contributions.
First, to propose a new nonlinear, more realistic, model for the system
suitable for primary control design, which takes into account nonlinearities
introduced by conventional inner controllers. Second, to determine necessary
conditions - dependent on some free controller tuning parameters - for the
existence of equilibria. Third, to formulate additional (necessary) conditions
for these equilibria to satisfy the power sharing constraints. Fourth, to
establish conditions for stability of a given equilibrium point. The usefulness
of the theoretical results is illustrated via numerical calculations on a
four-terminal example.

 <dc:title>A LSE and Sparse Message Passing-Based Channel Estimation for mmWave

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation algorithm based on the
Least Square Estimation (LSE) and Sparse Message Passing algorithm (SMP), which
is of special interest for Millimeter Wave (mmWave) systems, since this
algorithm can leverage the inherent sparseness of the mmWave channel. Our
proposed algorithm will iteratively detect exact the location and the value of
non-zero entries of sparse channel vector without its prior knowledge of
distribution. The SMP is used to detect exact the location of non-zero entries
of the channel vector, while the LSE is used for estimating its value at each
iteration. Then, the analysis of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of our
proposed algorithm is given. Numerical experiments show that our proposed
algorithm has much better performance than the existing sparse estimators (e.g.
LASSO), especially when mmWave systems have massive antennas at both the
transmitters and receivers. In addition, we also find that our proposed
algorithm converges to the CRLB of the genie-aided estimation of sparse
channels in just a few turbo iterations.

 <dc:title>A centralized reinforcement learning method for multi-agent job
  scheduling in Grid</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Moradi, Milad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the main challenges in Grid systems is designing an adaptive,
scalable, and model-independent method for job scheduling to achieve a
desirable degree of load balancing and system efficiency. Centralized job
scheduling methods have some drawbacks, such as single point of failure and
lack of scalability. Moreover, decentralized methods require a coordination
mechanism with limited communications. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent
approach to job scheduling in Grid, named Centralized Learning Distributed
Scheduling (CLDS), by utilizing the reinforcement learning framework. The CLDS
is a model free approach that uses the information of jobs and their completion
time to estimate the efficiency of resources. In this method, there are a
learner agent and several scheduler agents that perform the task of learning
and job scheduling with the use of a coordination strategy that maintains the
communication cost at a limited level. We evaluated the efficiency of the CLDS
method by designing and performing a set of experiments on a simulated Grid
system under different system scales and loads. The results show that the CLDS
can effectively balance the load of system even in large scale and heavy loaded
Grids, while maintains its adaptive performance and scalability.

 <dc:title>Effect of Wideband Beam Squint on Codebook Design in Phased-Array

 <dc:description>  Analog beamforming with phased arrays is a promising technique for 5G
wireless communication at millimeter wave frequencies. Using a discrete
codebook consisting of multiple analog beams, each beam focuses on a certain
range of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase
shifts across frequency due to practical hardware considerations. However, for
sufficiently large bandwidth, the gain provided by the phased array is actually
frequency dependent, which is an effect called beam squint, and this effect
occurs even if the radiation pattern of the antenna elements is frequency
independent. This paper examines the nature of beam squint for a uniform linear
array (ULA) and analyzes its impact on codebook design as a function of the
number of antennas and system bandwidth normalized by the carrier frequency.
The criterion for codebook design is to guarantee that each beam's minimum gain
for a range of angles and for all frequencies in the wideband system exceeds a
target threshold, for example 3 dB below the array's maximum gain. Analysis and
numerical examples suggest that a denser codebook is required to compensate for
beam squint. For example, 54% more beams are needed compared to a codebook
design that ignores beam squint for a ULA with 32 antennas operating at a
carrier frequency of 73 GHz and bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. Furthermore, beam squint
with this design criterion limits the bandwidth or the number of antennas of
the array if the other one is fixed.

 <dc:title>Distributed algorithms for solving convex inequalities</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a distributed subgradient-based algorithm is proposed for
continuous-time multi-agent systems to search a feasible solution to convex
inequalities. The algorithm involves each agent achieving a state constrained
by its own inequalities while exchanging local information with other agents
under a time-varying directed communication graph. With the validity of a mild
connectivity condition associated with the communication graph, it is shown
that all agents will reach agreement asymptotically and the consensus state is
in the solution set of the inequalities. Furthermore, the method is also
extended to solving the distributed optimization problem of minimizing the sum
of local objective functions subject to convex inequalities. A simulation
example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical
results.

 <dc:description>  We study the relationship between online Gaussian process (GP) regression and
kernel least mean squares (KLMS) algorithms. While the latter have no capacity
of storing the entire posterior distribution during online learning, we
discover that their operation corresponds to the assumption of a fixed
posterior covariance that follows a simple parametric model. Interestingly,
several well-known KLMS algorithms correspond to specific cases of this model.
The probabilistic perspective allows us to understand how each of them handles
uncertainty, which could explain some of their performance differences.

 <dc:description>  One to Many communications are expected to be among the killer applications
for the currently discussed 5G standard. The usage of coding mechanisms is
impacting broadcasting standard quality, as coding is involved at several
levels of the stack, and more specifically at the application layer where
Rateless, LDPC, Reed Solomon codes and network coding schemes have been
extensively studied, optimized and standardized in the past. Beyond reusing,
extending or adapting existing application layer packet coding mechanisms based
on previous schemes and designed for the foregoing LTE or other broadcasting
standards; our purpose is to investigate the use of Generalized Reed Muller
codes and the value of their locality property in their progressive decoding
for Broadcast/Multicast communication schemes with real time video delivery.
Our results are meant to bring insight into the use of locally decodable codes
in Broadcasting.

 <dc:description>  We consider a downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) system
employing regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. We derive the asymptotic
signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) as both the number of antennas and
the number of users go to infinity at a fixed ratio. Focusing on the symmetric
uncorrelated channels, we show that the SLNR is asymptotically equal to
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) which allows us to optimize the
user loading for spectral efficiency. The results show that the optimal user
loading varies depending on the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but is
equal to one in both the low or high SNR regimes.

 <dc:description>  Artificial objects often subjectively look eerie when their appearance to
some extent resembles a human, which is known as the uncanny valley phenomenon.
From a cognitive psychology perspective, several explanations of the phenomenon
have been put forth, two of which are object categorization and realism
inconsistency. Recently, MacDorman and Chattopadhyay (2016) reported
experimental data as evidence in support of the latter. In our estimation,
however, their results are still consistent with categorization-based stranger
avoidance. In this Discussions paper, we try to describe why
categorization-based stranger avoidance remains a viable explanation, despite
the evidence of MacDorman and Chattopadhyay, and how it offers a more inclusive

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a simple end-to-end model for speech recognition,
combining a convolutional network based acoustic model and a graph decoding. It
is trained to output letters, with transcribed speech, without the need for
force alignment of phonemes. We introduce an automatic segmentation criterion
for training from sequence annotation without alignment that is on par with CTC
while being simpler. We show competitive results in word error rate on the
Librispeech corpus with MFCC features, and promising results from raw waveform.

 <dc:description>  The words separation problem, originally formulated by Goralcik and Koubek
(1986), is stated as follows. Let $Sep(n)$ be the minimum number such that for
any two words of length $\le n$ there is a deterministic finite automaton with
$Sep(n)$ states, accepting exactly one of them. The problem is to find the
asymptotics of the function $Sep$. This problem is inverse to finding the
asymptotics of the length of the shortest identity in full transformation
semigroups $T_k$. The known lower bound on $Sep$ stems from the unary identity
in $T_k$. We find the first series of identities in $T_k$ which are shorter
than the corresponding unary identity for infinitely many values of $k$, and
thus slightly improve the lower bound on $Sep(n)$. Then we present some short
positive identities in symmetric groups, improving the lower bound on
separating words by permutational automata by a multiplicative constant.
Finally, we present the results of computer search for short identities for
small $k$.

 <dc:description>  We present a computational analysis of three language varieties: native,
advanced non-native, and translation. Our goal is to investigate the
similarities and differences between non-native language productions and
translations, contrasting both with native language. Using a collection of
computational methods we establish three main results: (1) the three types of
texts are easily distinguishable; (2) non-native language and translations are
closer to each other than each of them is to native language; and (3) some of
these characteristics depend on the source or native language, while others do
not, reflecting, perhaps, unified principles that similarly affect translations
and non-native language.

 <dc:description>  Translated texts are distinctively different from original ones, to the
extent that supervised text classification methods can distinguish between them
with high accuracy. These differences were proven useful for statistical
machine translation. However, it has been suggested that the accuracy of
translation detection deteriorates when the classifier is evaluated outside the
domain it was trained on. We show that this is indeed the case, in a variety of
evaluation scenarios. We then show that unsupervised classification is highly
accurate on this task. We suggest a method for determining the correct labels
of the clustering outcomes, and then use the labels for voting, improving the
accuracy even further. Moreover, we suggest a simple method for clustering in
the challenging case of mixed-domain datasets, in spite of the dominance of
domain-related features over translation-related ones. The result is an
effective, fully-unsupervised method for distinguishing between original and
translated texts that can be applied to new domains with reasonable accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Network models of language have provided a way of linking cognitive processes
to the structure and connectivity of language. However, one shortcoming of
current approaches is focusing on only one type of linguistic relationship at a
time, missing the complex multi-relational nature of language. In this work, we
overcome this limitation by modelling the mental lexicon of English-speaking
toddlers as a multiplex lexical network, i.e. a multi-layered network where
N=529 words/nodes are connected according to four types of relationships: (i)
free associations, (ii) feature sharing, (iii) co-occurrence, and (iv)
phonological similarity. We provide analysis of the topology of the resulting
multiplex and then proceed to evaluate single layers as well as the full
multiplex structure on their ability to predict empirically observed age of
acquisition data of English speaking toddlers. We find that the emerging
multiplex network topology is an important proxy of the cognitive processes of
acquisition, capable of capturing emergent lexicon structure. In fact, we show
that the multiplex topology is fundamentally more powerful than individual
layers in predicting the ordering with which words are acquired. Furthermore,
multiplex analysis allows for a quantification of distinct phases of lexical
acquisition in early learners: while initially all the multiplex layers
contribute to word learning, after about month 23 free associations take the
lead in driving word acquisition.

 <dc:description>  In medical research, economics, and the social sciences data frequently
appear as subsets of a set of objects. Over the past century a number of
descriptive statistics have been developed to construct network structure from
such data. However, these measures lack a generating mechanism that links the
inferred network structure to the observed groups. To address this issue, we
propose a model-based approach called the Hub Model which assumes that every
observed group has a leader and that the leader has brought together the other
members of the group. The performance of Hub Models is demonstrated by
simulation studies. We apply this model to infer the relationships among
Senators serving in the 110th United States Congress, the characters in a
famous 18th century Chinese novel, and the distribution of flora in North
America.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new binaural beamforming technique which can be
seen as a relaxation of the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV)
framework. The proposed method can achieve simultaneous noise reduction and
exact binaural cue preservation of the target source, similar to the binaural
minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) method. However, unlike BMVDR,
the proposed method is also able to preserve the binaural cues of multiple
interferers to a certain predefined accuracy. Specifically, it is able to
control the trade-off between noise reduction and binaural cue preservation of
the interferers by using a separate trade-off parameter per interferer.
Moreover, we provide a robust way of selecting these trade-off parameters in
such a way that the preservation accuracy for the binaural cues of the
interferers is always better than the corresponding ones of the BMVDR. The
relaxation of the constraints in the proposed method achieves approximate
binaural cue preservation of more interferers than other previously presented
LCMV-based binaural beamforming methods that use strict equality constraints.

 <dc:description>  Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a powerful tool for sublinear-time
approximate nearest neighbor search, and a variety of hashing schemes have been
proposed for different dissimilarity measures. However, hash codes
significantly depend on the dissimilarity, which prohibits users from adjusting
the dissimilarity at query time. In this paper, we propose {multiple purpose
LSH (mp-LSH) which shares the hash codes for different dissimilarities. mp-LSH
supports L2, cosine, and inner product dissimilarities, and their corresponding
weighted sums, where the weights can be adjusted at query time. It also allows
us to modify the importance of pre-defined groups of features. Thus, mp-LSH
enables us, for example, to retrieve similar items to a query with the user
preference taken into account, to find a similar material to a query with some
properties (stability, utility, etc.) optimized, and to turn on or off a part
of multi-modal information (brightness, color, audio, text, etc.) in
image/video retrieval. We theoretically and empirically analyze the performance
of three variants of mp-LSH, and demonstrate their usefulness on real-world
data sets.

 <dc:description>  Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to play a vital role in
future healthcare technologies by providing an alternative way of communication
and control. More specifically, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)
based BCIs have the advantage of higher accuracy and higher information
transfer rate (ITR). In order to fully exploit the capabilities of such
devices, it is necessary to understand the features of SSVEP and design the
system considering its biological characteristics. This paper introduces
bio-inspired filter banks (BIFB) for a novel SSVEP frequency detection method.
It is known that SSVEP response to a flickering visual stimulus is frequency
selective and gets weaker as the frequency of the stimuli increases. In the
proposed approach, the gain and bandwidth of the filters are designed and tuned
based on these characteristics while also incorporating harmonic SSVEP
responses. This method not only improves the accuracy but also increases the
available number of commands by allowing the use of stimuli frequencies elicit
weak SSVEP responses. The BIFB method achieved reliable performance when tested
on datasets available online and compared with two well-known SSVEP frequency
detection methods, power spectral density analysis (PSDA) and canonical
correlation analysis (CCA). The results show the potential of bio-inspired
design which will be extended to include further SSVEP characteristic (e.g.
time-domain waveform) for future SSVEP based BCIs.

 <dc:description>  Chern-Simons topological field theories TFTs are the only TFTs that have
already found application in the description of some exotic strongly-correlated
electron systems and the corresponding concept of topological quantum
computing. Here, we show that TFTs of another type, specifically the
gauge-field-less Witten-type TFTs known as topological sigma models, describe
the recently proposed digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) - engineered
dynamical systems with point attractors being the solutions of the
corresponding logic circuit that solves a specific task. This result derives
from the recent finding that any stochastic differential equation possesses a
topological supersymmetry, and the realization that the solution search by a
DMM proceeds via an instantonic phase. Certain TFT correlators in DMMs then
reveal the presence of a transient long-range order both in space and time,
associated with the effective breakdown of the topological supersymmetry by
instantons. The ensuing non-locality and the low dimensionality of instantons
are the physical reasons why DMMs can solve complex problems efficiently,
despite their non-quantum character. We exemplify these results with the
solution of prime factorization.

 <dc:description>  Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is the most popular iterative
algorithm for solving zero-sum imperfect-information games. Regret-Based
Pruning (RBP) is an improvement that allows poorly-performing actions to be
temporarily pruned, thus speeding up CFR. We introduce Total RBP, a new form of
RBP that reduces the space requirements of CFR as actions are pruned. We prove
that in zero-sum games it asymptotically prunes any action that is not part of
a best response to some Nash equilibrium. This leads to provably faster
convergence and lower space requirements. Experiments show that Total RBP
results in an order of magnitude reduction in space, and the reduction factor
increases with game size.

 <dc:description>  We consider the non-square matrix sensing problem, under restricted isometry
property (RIP) assumptions. We focus on the non-convex formulation, where any
rank-$r$ matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is represented as $UV^\top$,
where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times r}$. In
this paper, we complement recent findings on the non-convex geometry of the
analogous PSD setting [5], and show that matrix factorization does not
introduce any spurious local minima, under RIP.

 <dc:description>  The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a
principled general framework for planning under uncertainty, but solving POMDPs
optimally is computationally intractable, due to the &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot;
and the &quot;curse of history&quot;. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the
Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT), a sparse approximation
of the standard belief tree, for online planning under uncertainty. A DESPOT
focuses online planning on a set of randomly sampled scenarios and compactly
captures the &quot;execution&quot; of all policies under these scenarios. We show that
the best policy obtained from a DESPOT is near-optimal, with a regret bound
that depends on the representation size of the optimal policy. Leveraging this
result, we give an anytime online planning algorithm, which searches a DESPOT
for a policy that optimizes a regularized objective function. Regularization
balances the estimated value of a policy under the sampled scenarios and the
policy size, thus avoiding overfitting. The algorithm demonstrates strong
experimental results, compared with some of the best online POMDP algorithms
available. It has also been incorporated into an autonomous driving system for
real-time vehicle control. The source code for the algorithm is available
online.

 <dc:description>  Iterative algorithms for differential privacy run for a fixed number of
iterations, where each iteration learns some information from data and produces
an intermediate output. However, the algorithm only releases the output of the
last iteration, and from which the accuracy of algorithm is judged. In this
paper, we propose a post-processing algorithm that seeks to improve the
accuracy by incorporating the knowledge on the data contained in intermediate
outputs.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate resource allocation for multicarrier
communication systems employing a full-duplex base station for serving multiple
half-duplex downlink and uplink users simultaneously. We study the joint power
and subcarrier allocation design for the maximization of the weighted sum
throughput of the system. The algorithm design is formulated as a mixed
combinatorial non-convex optimization problem and obtaining the globally
optimal solution may require prohibitively high computational complexity.
Therefore, a low computational complexity suboptimal iterative algorithm
exploiting successive convex approximation is proposed to obtain a locally
optimal solution. Simulation results confirm that the proposed suboptimal
algorithm obtains a substantial improvement in system throughput compared to
various existing baseline schemes.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we aim to obtain the optimal tradeoff between the average delay
and the average power consumption in a communication system. In our system, the
arrivals occur at each timeslot according to a Bernoulli arrival process and
are buffered at the transmitter. The transmitter determines the scheduling
policy of how many packets to transmit under an average power constraint. The
power is assumed to be an increasing and convex function of the number of
packets transmitted in each timeslot to capture the realism in communication
systems. We also consider a finite buffer and allow the scheduling decision to
depend on the buffer occupancy. This problem is modelled as a Constrained
Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We first prove that the optimal policy of the
(Lagrangian) relaxation of the CMDP is deterministic and threshold-based. We
then show that the optimal delay-power tradeoff curve is convex and piecewise
linear, where each of the vertices are obtained by the optimal solution to the
relaxed problem. This allows us to show the optimal policies of the CMDP are
threshold-based, and hence can be implemented by a proposed efficient
algorithm. The theoretical results and the algorithm are validated by Linear
Programming and simulations.

 <dc:description>  We develop and analyze a procedure for gradient-based optimization that we
refer to as stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG). As a member
of the SVRG family of algorithms, SCSG makes use of gradient estimates at two
scales, with the number of updates at the faster scale being governed by a
geometric random variable. Unlike most existing algorithms in this family, both
the computation cost and the communication cost of SCSG do not necessarily
scale linearly with the sample size $n$; indeed, these costs are independent of
$n$ when the target accuracy is low. An experimental evaluation on real
datasets confirms the effectiveness of SCSG.

 <dc:title>Recovering the History of Informed Consent for Data Science and Internet
  Industry Research Ethics</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Respect for persons is a cornerstone value for any conception of research
ethics--though how to best realize respect in practice is an ongoing question.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, &quot;informed consent&quot; emerged as a
particular way to operationalize respect in medical and behavioral research
contexts. Today, informed consent has been challenged by increasingly advanced
networked information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the massive
amounts of data they produce--challenges that have led many researchers and
private companies to abandon informed consent as untenable or infeasible
online.
  Against any easy dismissal, we aim to recover insights from the history of
informed consent as it developed from the late 19th century to today. With a
particular focus on the United States policy context, we show how informed
consent is not a fixed or monolithic concept that should be abandoned in view
of new data-intensive and technological practices, but rather it is a mechanism
that has always been fluid--it has constantly evolved alongside the specific
contexts and practices it is intended to regulate. Building on this insight, we
articulate some specific challenges and lessons from the history of informed
consent that stand to benefit current discussions of informed consent and
research ethics in the context of data science and Internet industry research.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel approach for automatic segmentation and classification
of skin lesions is proposed. Initially, skin images are filtered to remove
unwanted hairs and noise and then the segmentation process is carried out to
extract lesion areas. For segmentation, a region growing method is applied by
automatic initialization of seed points. The segmentation performance is
measured with different well known measures and the results are appreciable.
Subsequently, the extracted lesion areas are represented by color and texture
features. SVM and k-NN classifiers are used along with their fusion for the
classification using the extracted features. The performance of the system is
tested on our own dataset of 726 samples from 141 images consisting of 5
different classes of diseases. The results are very promising with 46.71% and
34% of F-measure using SVM and k-NN classifier respectively and with 61% of
F-measure for fusion of SVM and k-NN.

 <dc:title>Paraunitary Matrices, Entropy, Algebraic Condition Number and Fourier

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Fourier Transform is one of the most important linear transformations
used in science and engineering. Cooley and Tukey's Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) from 1964 is a method for computing this transformation in time $O(n\log
n)$. From a lower bound perspective, relatively little is known. Ailon shows in
2013 an $\Omega(n\log n)$ bound for computing the normalized Fourier Transform
assuming only unitary operations on two coordinates are allowed at each step,
and no extra memory is allowed. In 2014, Ailon then improved the result to show
that, in a $\kappa$-well conditioned computation, Fourier computation can be
sped up by no more than $O(\kappa)$. The main conjecture is that Ailon's result
can be exponentially improved, in the sense that $\kappa$-well condition cannot
admit $\omega(\log \kappa)$ speedup.
  The main result here is that `algebraic' $\kappa$-well condition admits no
more than $O(\sqrt \kappa)$ speedup. The definition of algebraic condition
number is obtained by formally viewing multiplication by constants, as
performed by the algorithm, as multiplication by indeterminates, giving rise to
computation over polynomials. The algebraic condition number is related to the
degree of these polynomials. Using the maximum modulus theorem from complex
analysis, we show that algebraic condition number upper bounds standard
condition number, and equals it in certain cases. Algebraic condition number is
an interesting measure of numerical computation stability in its own right.
Moreover, we believe that the approach of algebraic condition number has a good
chance of establishing an algebraic version of the main conjecture.

 <dc:title>Semi-Supervised Sparse Representation Based Classification for Face

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of face recognition when there is only few,
or even only a single, labeled examples of the face that we wish to recognize.
Moreover, these examples are typically corrupted by nuisance variables, both
linear (i.e., additive nuisance variables such as bad lighting, wearing of
glasses) and non-linear (i.e., non-additive pixel-wise nuisance variables such
as expression changes). The small number of labeled examples means that it is
hard to remove these nuisance variables between the training and testing faces
to obtain good recognition performance. To address the problem we propose a
method called Semi-Supervised Sparse Representation based Classification
(S$^3$RC). This is based on recent work on sparsity where faces are represented
in terms of two dictionaries: a gallery dictionary consisting of one or more
examples of each person, and a variation dictionary representing linear
nuisance variables (e.g., different lighting conditions, different glasses).
The main idea is that (i) we use the variation dictionary to characterize the
linear nuisance variables via the sparsity framework, then (ii) prototype face
images are estimated as a gallery dictionary via a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM), with mixed labeled and unlabeled samples in a semi-supervised manner, to
deal with the non-linear nuisance variations between labeled and unlabeled
samples. We have done experiments with insufficient labeled samples, even when
there is only a single labeled sample per person. Our results on the AR,
Multi-PIE, CAS-PEAL, and LFW databases demonstrate that the proposed method is
able to deliver significantly improved performance over existing methods.

 <dc:description>  The application of psychophysiology in human-computer interaction is a
growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of
physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Respiration is unique among physiological signals in that it can be
consciously controlled which has to be taken into account when designing
applications. Respiration is tightly connected to other physiological signals,
especially cardiovascular activity, and often analyzed in conjunction with
other signals. When analyzed separately, an increase in the rate of respiration
can be seen as an increase in metabolic demand which indicates activate states
such as engagement and attention. We present a short review on the application
of respiration in human-computer interaction.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid
familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on
everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more
common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
  This paper is an extract from a comprehensive review of the entire field of
ambulatory psychophysiology, including 12 similar chapters, plus application

 <dc:description>  Natural language understanding (NLU) is a core component of a spoken dialogue
system. Recently recurrent neural networks (RNN) obtained strong results on NLU
due to their superior ability of preserving sequential information over time.
Traditionally, the NLU module tags semantic slots for utterances considering
their flat structures, as the underlying RNN structure is a linear chain.
However, natural language exhibits linguistic properties that provide rich,
structured information for better understanding. This paper introduces a novel
model, knowledge-guided structural attention networks (K-SAN), a generalization
of RNN to additionally incorporate non-flat network topologies guided by prior
knowledge. There are two characteristics: 1) important substructures can be
captured from small training data, allowing the model to generalize to
previously unseen test data; 2) the model automatically figures out the salient
substructures that are essential to predict the semantic tags of the given
sentences, so that the understanding performance can be improved. The
experiments on the benchmark Air Travel Information System (ATIS) data show
that the proposed K-SAN architecture can effectively extract salient knowledge
from substructures with an attention mechanism, and outperform the performance
of the state-of-the-art neural network based frameworks.

 <dc:description>  Heat-Diffusion (HD) routing is our recently-developed queue-aware routing
policy for multi-hop wireless networks inspired by Thermodynamics. In the prior
theoretical studies, we have shown that HD routing guarantees throughput
optimality, minimizes a quadratic routing cost, minimizes queue congestion on
the network, and provides a trade-off between routing cost and queueing delay
that is Pareto-Optimal. While striking, these guarantees are based on idealized
assumptions (including global synchronization, centralized control, and
infinite buffers) and heretofore have only been evaluated through simplified
numerical simulations. We present here the first practical decentralized
Heat-Diffusion Collection Protocol (HDCP) for wireless sensor networks and
detail its implementation on Contiki OS. We present a thorough evaluation of
HDCP based on real testbed experiments, including a comparative analysis of its
performance with respect to the state of the art Collection Tree Protocol (CTP)
and Backpressure Collection Protocol (BCP) for wireless sensor networks. We
find that HDCP has a significantly higher throughput region and greater
resilience to interference compared to CTP. However, we also find that the best
performance of HDCP is comparable to the best performance of BCP, due to the
similarity in their neighbor rankings, which we verify through a Kendall's-Tau
test.

 <dc:description>  We present a neural network that can act as an equivalent to a Non-Negative
Matrix Factorization (NMF), and further show how it can be used to perform
supervised source separation. Due to the extensibility of this approach we show
how we can achieve better source separation performance as compared to

be used for further improvements.

 <dc:description>  Group sparsity has shown great potential in various low-level vision tasks
(e.g, image denoising, deblurring and inpainting). In this paper, we propose a
new prior model for image denoising via group sparsity residual constraint
(GSRC). To enhance the performance of group sparse-based image denoising, the
concept of group sparsity residual is proposed, and thus, the problem of image
denoising is translated into one that reduces the group sparsity residual. To
reduce the residual, we first obtain some good estimation of the group sparse
coefficients of the original image by the first-pass estimation of noisy image,
and then centralize the group sparse coefficients of noisy image to the
estimation. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method not
only outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising methods such as BM3D and WNNM,
but results in a faster speed.

 <dc:title>Predicting the elliptic curve congruential generator</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Number Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $p$ be a prime and let $\mathbf{E}$ be an elliptic curve defined over the
finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ of $p$ elements. For a point
$G\in\mathbf{E}(\mathbb{F}_p)$ the elliptic curve congruential generator (with
respect to the first coordinate) is a sequence $(x_n)$ defined by the relation
$x_n=x(W_n)=x(W_{n-1}\oplus G)=x(nG\oplus W_0)$, $n=1,2,\dots$, where $\oplus$
denotes the group operation in $\mathbf{E}$ and $W_0$ is an initial point. In
this paper, we show that if some consecutive elements of the sequence $(x_n)$
are given as integers, then one can compute in polynomial time an elliptic
curve congruential generator (where the curve possibly defined over the
rationals or over a residue ring) such that the generated sequence is identical
to $(x_n)$ in the revealed segment. It turns out that in practice, all the
secret parameters, and thus the whole sequence $(x_n)$, can be computed from
eight consecutive elements, even if the prime and the elliptic curve are
private.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to generate large amounts of
heterogeneous data from diverse sources including physical sensors, user
devices, and social media platforms. Over the last few years, significant
attention has been focused on personal data, particularly data generated by
smart wearable and smart home devices. Making personal data available for
access and trade is expected to become a part of the data driven digital
economy. In this position paper, we review the research challenges in building
personal Databoxes that hold personal data and enable data access by other
parties, and potentially thus sharing of data with other parties. These
Databoxes are expected to become a core part of future data marketplaces.

 <dc:description>  The adaptive gradient online learning method known as AdaGrad has seen
widespread use in the machine learning community in stochastic and adversarial
online learning problems and more recently in deep learning methods. The
method's full-matrix incarnation offers much better theoretical guarantees and
potentially better empirical performance than its diagonal version; however,
this version is computationally prohibitive and so the simpler diagonal version
often is used in practice. We introduce a new method, CompAdaGrad, that
navigates the space between these two schemes and show that this method can
yield results much better than diagonal AdaGrad while avoiding the (effectively
intractable) $O(n^3)$ computational complexity of full-matrix AdaGrad for
dimension $n$. CompAdaGrad essentially performs full-matrix regularization in a
low-dimensional subspace while performing diagonal regularization in the
complementary subspace. We derive CompAdaGrad's updates for composite mirror
descent in case of the squared $\ell_2$ norm and the $\ell_1$ norm, demonstrate
that its complexity per iteration is linear in the dimension, and establish
guarantees for the method independent of the choice of composite regularizer.
Finally, we show preliminary results on several datasets.

 <dc:description>  Accurate estimation of spatial gait characteristics is critical to assess
motor impairments resulting from neurological or musculoskeletal disease.
Currently, however, methodological constraints limit clinical applicability of
state-of-the-art double integration approaches to gait patterns with a clear
zero-velocity phase. We describe a novel approach to stride length estimation
that uses deep convolutional neural networks to map stride-specific inertial
sensor data to the resulting stride length. The model is trained on a publicly
available and clinically relevant benchmark dataset consisting of 1220 strides
from 101 geriatric patients. Evaluation is done in a 10-fold cross validation
and for three different stride definitions. Even though best results are
achieved with strides defined from mid-stance to mid-stance with average
accuracy and precision of 0.01 $\pm$ 5.37 cm, performance does not strongly
depend on stride definition. The achieved precision outperforms
state-of-the-art methods evaluated on this benchmark dataset by 3.0 cm (36%).
Due to the independence of stride definition, the proposed method is not
subject to the methodological constrains that limit applicability of
state-of-the-art double integration methods. Furthermore, precision on the
benchmark dataset could be improved. With more precise mobile stride length
estimation, new insights to the progression of neurological disease or early
indications might be gained. Due to the independence of stride definition,
previously uncharted diseases in terms of mobile gait analysis can now be
investigated by re-training and applying the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Cross-app collaboration via inter-component communication is a fundamental
mechanism on Android. Although it brings the benefits such as functionality
reuse and data sharing, a threat called component hijacking is also introduced.
By hijacking a vulnerable component in victim apps, an attack app can escalate
its privilege for originally prohibited operations. Many prior studies have
been performed to understand and mitigate this issue, but component hijacking
remains a serious open problem in the Android ecosystem due to no effective
defense deployed in the wild. In this paper, we present our vision on
practically defending against component hijacking in Android apps. First, we
argue that to fundamentally prevent component hijacking, we need to switch from
the previous mindset (i.e., performing system-level control or repackaging
vulnerable apps after they are already released) to a more proactive version
that aims to help security-inexperienced developers make secure components in
the first place. To this end, we propose to embed into apps a secure component
library (SecComp), which performs in-app mandatory access control on behalf of
app components. An important factor for SecComp to be effective is that we find
it is possible to devise a set of practical in-app policies to stop component
hijacking. Furthermore, we allow developers design custom policies, beyond our
by-default generic policies, to support more fine-grained access control. We
have overcome challenges to implement a preliminary SecComp prototype, which
stops component hijacking with very low performance overhead. We hope the
future research that fully implements our vision can eventually help real-world
apps get rid of component hijacking.

 <dc:description>  Measurement of stride-related, biomechanical parameters is the common
rationale for objective gait impairment scoring. State-of-the-art double
integration approaches to extract these parameters from inertial sensor data
are, however, limited in their clinical applicability due to the underlying
assumptions. To overcome this, we present a method to translate the abstract
information provided by wearable sensors to context-related expert features
based on deep convolutional neural networks. Regarding mobile gait analysis,
this enables integration-free and data-driven extraction of a set of 8
spatio-temporal stride parameters. To this end, two modelling approaches are
compared: A combined network estimating all parameters of interest and an
ensemble approach that spawns less complex networks for each parameter
individually. The ensemble approach is outperforming the combined modelling in
the current application. On a clinically relevant and publicly available
benchmark dataset, we estimate stride length, width and medio-lateral change in
foot angle up to ${-0.15\pm6.09}$ cm, ${-0.09\pm4.22}$ cm and ${0.13 \pm
3.78^\circ}$ respectively. Stride, swing and stance time as well as heel and
toe contact times are estimated up to ${\pm 0.07}$, ${\pm0.05}$, ${\pm 0.07}$,
${\pm0.07}$ and ${\pm0.12}$ s respectively. This is comparable to and in parts
outperforming or defining state-of-the-art. Our results further indicate that
the proposed change in methodology could substitute assumption-driven
double-integration methods and enable mobile assessment of spatio-temporal
stride parameters in clinically critical situations as e.g. in the case of
spastic gait impairments.

 <dc:description>  Process mining is a research field focused on the analysis of event data with
the aim of extracting insights in processes. Applying process mining techniques
on data from smart home environments has the potential to provide valuable
insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living
solutions. Finding the right event labels to enable application of process
mining techniques is however far from trivial, as simply using the triggering
sensor as the label for sensor events results in uninformative models that
allow for too much behavior (overgeneralizing). Refinements of sensor level
event labels suggested by domain experts have shown to enable discovery of more
precise and insightful process models. However, there exist no automated
approach to generate refinements of event labels in the context of process
mining. In this paper we propose a framework for automated generation of label
refinements based on the time attribute of events. We show on a case study with
real life smart home event data that behaviorally more specific, and therefore
more insightful, process models can be found by using automatically generated
refined labels in process discovery.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the performance of extremum estimators from the
perspective of generalization ability (GA): the ability of a model to predict
outcomes in new samples from the same population. By adapting the classical
concentration inequalities, we derive upper bounds on the empirical
out-of-sample prediction errors as a function of the in-sample errors,
in-sample data size, heaviness in the tails of the error distribution, and
model complexity. We show that the error bounds may be used for tuning key
estimation hyper-parameters, such as the number of folds $K$ in
cross-validation. We also show how $K$ affects the bias-variance trade-off for
cross-validation. We demonstrate that the $\mathcal{L}_2$-norm difference
between penalized and the corresponding un-penalized regression estimates is
directly explained by the GA of the estimates and the GA of empirical moment
conditions. Lastly, we prove that all penalized regression estimates are
$L_2$-consistent for both the $n \geqslant p$ and the $n &lt; p$ cases.
Simulations are used to demonstrate key results.
  Keywords: generalization ability, upper bound of generalization error,
penalized regression, cross-validation, bias-variance trade-off,
$\mathcal{L}_2$ difference between penalized and unpenalized regression, lasso,
high-dimensional data.

 <dc:description>  In 2010 Schernhammer and Gramlich showed that quasi-decreasingness of a DCTRS
R is equivalent to \mu-termination of its context-sensitive unraveling Ucs(R)
on original terms. While the direction that quasi-decreasingness of R implies
\mu-termination of Ucs(R) on original terms is shown directly; the converse -
facilitating the use of context-sensitive termination tools like MU-TERM and
VMTL - employs the additional notion of context-sensitive quasi-reductivity of
R. In the following, we give a direct proof of the fact that \mu-termination of
Ucs(R) on original terms implies quasi-decreasingness of R. Moreover, we report
our experimental findings on DCTRSs from the confluence problems database
(Cops), extending the experiments of Schernhammer and Gramlich.

 <dc:title>A Meaning-oriented Approach to Semantic Data Modeling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Xuhui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Semantic information is often represented as the entities and the
relationships among them with conventional semantic models. This approach is
straightforward but is not suitable for many posteriori requests in semantic
data modeling. In this paper, we propose a meaning-oriented approach to
modeling semantic data and establish a graph-based semantic data model. In this
approach we use the meanings, i.e., the subjective views of the entities and
relationships, to describe the semantic information, and use the semantic
graphs containing the meaning nodes and the meta-meaning relations to specify
the taxonomy and the compound construction of the semantic concepts. We
demonstrate how this meaning-oriented approach can address many important
semantic representation issues, including dynamic specialization and natural
join.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate an approach that uses low-level analysis and the
execution-cache-memory (ECM) performance model in combination with tuning of
hardware parameters to lower energy requirements of memory-bound applications.
The ECM model is extended appropriately to deal with software optimizations
such as non-temporal stores. Using incremental steps and the ECM model, we
analytically quantify the impact of various single-core optimizations and
pinpoint microarchitectural improvements that are relevant to energy
consumption. Using a 2D Jacobi solver as example that can serve as a blueprint
for other memory-bound applications, we evaluate our approach on the four most
recent Intel Xeon E5 processors (Sandy Bridge-EP, Ivy Bridge-EP, Haswell-EP,
and Broadwell-EP). We find that chip energy consumption can be reduced in the
range of 2.0-2.4$\times$ on the examined processors.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of downlink channel estimation for millimeter wave
(mmWave) MIMO-OFDM systems, where both the base station (BS) and the mobile
station (MS) employ large antenna arrays for directional precoding/beamforming.
Hybrid analog and digital beamforming structures are employed in order to offer
a compromise between hardware complexity and system performance. Different from
most existing studies that are concerned with narrowband channels, we consider
estimation of wideband mmWave channels with frequency selectivity, which is
more appropriate for mmWave MIMO-OFDM systems. By exploiting the sparse
scattering nature of mmWave channels, we propose a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition-based method for channel parameter estimation (including angles
of arrival/departure, time delays, and fading coefficients). In our proposed
method, the received signal at the BS is expressed as a third-order tensor. We
show that the tensor has the form of a low-rank CP decomposition, and the
channel parameters can be estimated from the associated factor matrices. Our
analysis reveals that the uniqueness of the CP decomposition can be guaranteed
even when the size of the tensor is small. Hence the proposed method has the
potential to achieve substantial training overhead reduction. We also develop
Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) results for channel parameters, and compare our proposed
method with a compressed sensing-based method. Simulation results show that the
proposed method attains mean square errors that are very close to their
associated CRBs, and presents a clear advantage over the compressed
sensing-based method in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational
complexity.

 <dc:title>Modelling Creativity: Identifying Key Components through a Corpus-Based

 <dc:description>  Creativity is a complex, multi-faceted concept encompassing a variety of
related aspects, abilities, properties and behaviours. If we wish to study
creativity scientifically, then a tractable and well-articulated model of
creativity is required. Such a model would be of great value to researchers
investigating the nature of creativity and in particular, those concerned with
the evaluation of creative practice. This paper describes a unique approach to
developing a suitable model of how creative behaviour emerges that is based on
the words people use to describe the concept. Using techniques from the field
of statistical natural language processing, we identify a collection of
fourteen key components of creativity through an analysis of a corpus of
academic papers on the topic. Words are identified which appear significantly
often in connection with discussions of the concept. Using a measure of lexical
similarity to help cluster these words, a number of distinct themes emerge,
which collectively contribute to a comprehensive and multi-perspective model of
creativity. The components provide an ontology of creativity: a set of building
blocks which can be used to model creative practice in a variety of domains.
The components have been employed in two case studies to evaluate the
creativity of computational systems and have proven useful in articulating
achievements of this work and directions for further research.

 <dc:description>  Domain specific languages (DSL) have been used in a variety of fields to
express complex scientific problems in a concise manner and provide automated
performance optimization for a range of computational architectures. As such
DSLs provide a powerful mechanism to speed up scientific Python computation
that goes beyond traditional vectorization and pre-compilation approaches,
while allowing domain scientists to build applications within the comforts of
the Python software ecosystem. In this paper we present Devito, a new finite
difference DSL that provides optimized stencil computation from high-level
problem specifications based on symbolic Python expressions. We demonstrate
Devito's symbolic API and performance advantages over traditional Python
acceleration methods before highlighting its use in the scientific context of
seismic inversion problems.

 <dc:description>  In forthcoming years, the Internet of Things (IoT) will connect billions of
smart devices generating and uploading a deluge of data to the cloud. If
successfully extracted, the knowledge buried in the data can significantly
improve the quality of life and foster economic growth. However, a critical
bottleneck for realising the efficient IoT is the pressure it puts on the
existing communication infrastructures, requiring transfer of enormous data
volumes. Aiming at addressing this problem, we propose a novel architecture
dubbed Condense, which integrates the IoT-communication infrastructure into
data analysis. This is achieved via the generic concept of network function
computation: Instead of merely transferring data from the IoT sources to the
cloud, the communication infrastructure should actively participate in the data
analysis by carefully designed en-route processing. We define the Condense
architecture, its basic layers, and the interactions among its constituent
modules. Further, from the implementation side, we describe how Condense can be
integrated into the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Machine Type
Communications (MTC) architecture, as well as the prospects of making it a
practically viable technology in a short time frame, relying on Network
Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). Finally,
from the theoretical side, we survey the relevant literature on computing
&quot;atomic&quot; functions in both analog and digital domains, as well as on function
decomposition over networks, highlighting challenges, insights, and future
directions for exploiting these techniques within practical 3GPP MTC
architecture.

 <dc:description>  An increasing number of human activities are studied using data produced by
individuals' ICT devices. In particular, when ICT data contain spatial
information, they represent an invaluable source for analyzing urban dynamics.
However, there have been relatively few contributions investigating the
robustness of this type of results against fluctuations of data
characteristics. Here, we present a stability analysis of higher-level
information extracted from mobile phone data passively produced during an
entire year by 9 million individuals in Senegal. We focus on two
information-retrieval tasks: (a) the identification of land use in the region
of Dakar from the temporal rhythms of the communication activity; (b) the
identification of home and work locations of anonymized individuals, which
enable to construct Origin-Destination (OD) matrices of commuting flows. Our
analysis reveal that the uncertainty of results highly depends on the sample
size, the scale and the period of the year at which the data were gathered.
Nevertheless, the spatial distributions of land use computed for different
samples are remarkably robust: on average, we observe more than 75% of shared
surface area between the different spatial partitions when considering activity
of at least 100,000 users whatever the scale. The OD matrix is less stable and
depends on the scale with a share of at least 75% of commuters in common when
considering all types of flows constructed from the home-work locations of
100,000 users. For both tasks, better results can be obtained at larger levels
of aggregation or by considering more users. These results confirm that ICT
data are very useful sources for the spatial analysis of urban systems, but
that their reliability should in general be tested more thoroughly.

 <dc:title>Morphological Constraints for Phrase Pivot Statistical Machine

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The lack of parallel data for many language pairs is an important challenge
to statistical machine translation (SMT). One common solution is to pivot
through a third language for which there exist parallel corpora with the source
and target languages. Although pivoting is a robust technique, it introduces
some low quality translations especially when a poor morphology language is
used as the pivot between rich morphology languages. In this paper, we examine
the use of synchronous morphology constraint features to improve the quality of
phrase pivot SMT. We compare hand-crafted constraints to those learned from
limited parallel data between source and target languages. The learned
morphology constraints are based on projected align- ments between the source
and target phrases in the pivot phrase table. We show positive results on
Hebrew-Arabic SMT (pivoting on English). We get 1.5 BLEU points over a phrase
pivot baseline and 0.8 BLEU points over a system combination baseline with a
direct model built from parallel data.

 <dc:title>Libraries' Metadata as Data in the Era of the Semantic Web: Modeling a
  Repository of Master Theses and PhD Dissertations for the Web of Data</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Peponakis, Manolis</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This study argues that metadata of library catalogs can stand autonomously,
providing valuable information detached from the resources they point to and,
therefore, could be used as data in the context of the Semantic Web. We present
an analysis of this perception followed by an implementation proposal for a
Master's thesis and PhD dissertation repository. The analysis builds on the
flexibility of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and takes into account
the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and Functional
Requirements for Authority Data (FRAD) in order to reveal the latent academic
network by linking its entities to a meaningful and computationally processable
set. Current library catalogs retrieve documents to find answers, whereas in
our approach catalogs can provide answers that could not be found in any
specific document.

 <dc:description>  Machine-to-machine services are witnessing an unprecedented diffusion, which
is expected to result in an ever-increasing data traffic load. In this context,
satellite technology is playing a pivotal role, since it enables a widespread
provisioning of machine-to-machine services. In particular, oil industry,
maritime communications, as well as remote monitoring are sectors where the use
of satellite communications is expected to dramatically explode within the next
few years. In the light of this sudden increase of machine-to-machine data
transported over satellite, a more thorough understanding of machine-to-machine
service implementation over satellite is required, especially focusing on the
interaction between transport and MAC layers of the protocol stack. Starting
from these observations, this paper thoroughly analyses the interaction between
TCP and the Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha access scheme defined
in the DVB-RCS2 standard, assuming the use of an MQTT-like protocol to
distribute machine-to-machine services. A novel TCP model is developed and
validated through extensive simulation campaigns, which also shed important
lights on the design choices enabling the efficient transport of
machine-to-machine data via satellite.

 <dc:description>  Machine-learning algorithms have shown outstanding image recognition or
classification performance for computer vision applications. However, the
compute and energy requirement for implementing such classifier models for
large-scale problems is quite high. In this paper, we propose Feature Driven
Selective Classification (FALCON) inspired by the biological visual attention
mechanism in the brain to optimize the energy-efficiency of machine-learning
classifiers. We use the consensus in the characteristic features
(color/texture) across images in a dataset to decompose the original
classification problem and construct a tree of classifiers (nodes) with a
generic-to-specific transition in the classification hierarchy. The initial
nodes of the tree separate the instances based on feature information and
selectively enable the latter nodes to perform object specific classification.
The proposed methodology allows selective activation of only those branches and
nodes of the classification tree that are relevant to the input while keeping
the remaining nodes idle. Additionally, we propose a programmable and scalable
Neuromorphic Engine (NeuE) that utilizes arrays of specialized neural
computational elements to execute the FALCON based classifier models for
diverse datasets. The structure of FALCON facilitates the reuse of nodes while
scaling up from small classification problems to larger ones thus allowing us
to construct classifier implementations that are significantly more efficient.
We evaluate our approach for a 12-object classification task on the Caltech101
dataset and 10-object task on CIFAR-10 dataset by constructing FALCON models on
the NeuE platform in 45nm technology. Our results demonstrate significant
improvement in energy-efficiency and training time for minimal loss in output
quality.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a method for estimation of the acoustic intensity, the
energy density and the associated sound field diffuseness around the origin,
when the sound field is weighted with a spatial filter. The method permits
energetic DOA estimation and sound field characterization focused in a specific
angular region determined by the beam pattern of the spatial filter. The
formulation of the estimators is presented and their behavior is analyzed for
the fundamental cases useful in parametric sound field models of a single plane
wave, a uniform diffuse field and a mixture of the two.

 <dc:description>  Memtranstor that correlates charge and magnetic flux via nonlinear
magnetoelectric effects has a great potential in developing next-generation
nonvolatile devices. In addition to multi-level nonvolatile memory, we
demonstrate here that nonvolatile logic gates such as NOR and NAND can be
implemented in a single memtranstor made of the Ni/PMN-PT/Ni heterostructure.
After applying two sequent voltage pulses (X1, X2) as the logic inputs on the
memtranstor, the output magnetoelectric voltage can be positive high (logic
&quot;1&quot;), positive low (logic &quot;0&quot;), or negative (logic &quot;0&quot;), depending on the
levels of X1 and X2. The underlying physical mechanism is related to the
complete or partial reversal of ferroelectric polarization controlled by
inputting selective voltage pulses, which determines the magnitude and sign of
the magnetoelectric voltage coefficient. The combined functions of both memory
and logic could enable the memtranstor as a promising candidate for future
computing systems beyond von Neumann architecture.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an edge detection and recovery framework based on open active
contour models (snakelets). This is motivated by the noisy or broken edges
output by standard edge detection algorithms, like Canny. The idea is to
utilize the local continuity and smoothness cues provided by strong edges and
grow them to recover the missing edges. This way, the strong edges are used to
recover weak or missing edges by considering the local edge structures, instead
of blindly linking them if gradient magnitudes are above some threshold. We
initialize short snakelets on the gradient magnitudes or binary edges
automatically and then deform and grow them under the influence of gradient
vector flow. The output snakelets are able to recover most of the breaks or
weak edges, and they provide a smooth edge representation of the image; they
can also be used for higher level analysis, like contour segmentation.

 <dc:description>  This paper derives lower bounds for the mean square errors of parameter
estimators in the case of Poisson distributed data subjected to multiple abrupt
changes. Since both change locations (discrete parameters) and parameters of
the Poisson distribution (continuous parameters) are unknown, it is appropriate
to consider a mixed Cramer-Rao/Weiss-Weinstein bound for which we derive
closed-form expressions and illustrate its tightness by numerical simulations.

 <dc:title>Multi-Label Learning with Provable Guarantee</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dasgupta, Sayantan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Here we study the problem of learning labels for large text corpora where
each text can be assigned a variable number of labels. The problem might seem
trivial when the label dimensionality is small and can be easily solved using a
series of one-vs-all classifiers. However, as the label dimensionality
increases to several thousand, the parameter space becomes extremely large, and
it is no longer possible to use the one-vs-all technique. Here we propose a
model based on the factorization of higher order moments of the words in the
corpora, as well as the cross moment between the labels and the words for
multi-label prediction. Our model provides guaranteed convergence bounds on the
estimated parameters. Further, our model takes only three passes through the
training dataset to extract the parameters, resulting in a highly scalable
algorithm that can train on GB's of data consisting of millions of documents
with hundreds of thousands of labels using a nominal resource of a single
processor with 16GB RAM. Our model achieves 10x-15x order of speed-up on
large-scale datasets while producing competitive performance in comparison with
existing benchmark algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel motion planning algorithm for transferring a liquid body
from a source to a target container. Our approach uses a receding-horizon
optimization strategy that takes into account fluid constraints and avoids
collisions. In order to efficiently handle the high-dimensional configuration
space of a liquid body, we use system identification to learn its dynamics
characteristics using a neural network. We generate the training dataset using
stochastic optimization in a transfer-problem-specific search space. The
runtime feedback motion planner is used for real-time planning and we observe
high success rate in our simulated 2D and 3D fluid transfer benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Managed multi-context systems (mMCSs) allow for the integration of
heterogeneous knowledge sources in a modular and very general way. They were,
however, mainly designed for static scenarios and are therefore not well-suited
for dynamic environments in which continuous reasoning over such heterogeneous
knowledge with constantly arriving streams of data is necessary. In this paper,
we introduce reactive multi-context systems (rMCSs), a framework for reactive
reasoning in the presence of heterogeneous knowledge sources and data streams.
We show that rMCSs are indeed well-suited for this purpose by illustrating how
several typical problems arising in the context of stream reasoning can be
handled using them, by showing how inconsistencies possibly occurring in the
integration of multiple knowledge sources can be handled, and by arguing that
the potential non-determinism of rMCSs can be avoided if needed using an
alternative, more skeptical well-founded semantics instead with beneficial
computational properties. We also investigate the computational complexity of
various reasoning problems related to rMCSs. Finally, we discuss related work,
and show that rMCSs do not only generalize mMCSs to dynamic settings, but also
capture/extend relevant approaches w.r.t. dynamics in knowledge representation
and stream reasoning.

dependencies and their labels. Unlike typical approaches to parsing, the model
doesn't require part-of-speech (POS) tagging of the sentences. With proper
regularization and additional supervision achieved with multitask learning we

 <dc:title>Cooperative Phoneotypes: Exploring Phone-based Behavioral Markers of

 <dc:description>  Cooperation is a fundamental human concept studied across multiple social and
biological disciplines. Traditional methods for eliciting an individual's
propensity to cooperate have included surveys and laboratory experiments and
multiple such studies have connected an individual's cooperation level with her
social behavior. We describe a novel approach to model an individual's
cooperation level based on her phoneotype i.e. a composite of an individual's
traits as observable via a mobile phone. This phone sensing-based method can
potentially complement surveys, thus providing a cheaper, faster, automated
method for generating insights into cooperation levels of users. Based on a
10-week field study involving 54 participants, we report that: (1) multiple
phone-based signals were significantly associated with participant's
cooperation attitudes; and (2) combining phone-based signals yielded a
predictive model with AUCROC of 0.945 that performed significantly better than
a comparable demography-based model at predicting individual cooperation
propensities. The results pave the way for individuals and organizations to
identify more cooperative peers in personal, social, and commerce related
settings.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we are interested in learning the underlying graph structure
behind training data. Solving this basic problem is essential to carry out any
graph signal processing or machine learning task. To realize this, we assume
that the data is smooth with respect to the graph topology, and we parameterize
the graph topology using an edge sampling function. That is, the graph
Laplacian is expressed in terms of a sparse edge selection vector, which
provides an explicit handle to control the sparsity level of the graph. We
solve the sparse graph learning problem given some training data in both the
noiseless and noisy settings. Given the true smooth data, the posed sparse
graph learning problem can be solved optimally and is based on simple rank
ordering. Given the noisy data, we show that the joint sparse graph learning
and denoising problem can be simplified to designing only the sparse edge
selection vector, which can be solved using convex optimization.

 <dc:description>  Search engines for equations now exist, which return results matching the
query's mathematical meaning or structural presentation. Operating over
scientific papers, online encyclopedias, and math discussion forums, their
content includes physics, math, and other sciences. They enable physicists to
avoid jargon and more easily target mathematical content within and across
disciplines. As a natural extension of keyword-based search, they open up a new
world for discovering both exact and approximate mathematical solutions;
physical systems' analogues and alternative models; and physics' patterns.
  This review presents the existing math-aware search engines, discusses
methods for maximizing their search success, and overviews their math-matching
capabilities. Proposed applications to physics are also given, to contribute
towards developers' and physicists' exploration of the newly available search
horizons.

 <dc:description>  Partially ordered nondeterminsitic finite automata (poNFAs) are NFAs whose
transition relation induces a partial order on states, that is, for which
cycles occur only in the form of self-loops on a single state. A poNFA is
universal if it accepts all words over its input alphabet. Deciding
universality is PSPACE-complete for poNFAs, and we show that this remains true
even when restricting to a fixed alphabet. This is nontrivial since standard
encodings of alphabet symbols in, e.g., binary can turn self-loops into longer
cycles. A lower coNP-complete complexity bound can be obtained if we require
that all self-loops in the poNFA are deterministic, in the sense that the
symbol read in the loop cannot occur in any other transition from that state.
We find that such restricted poNFAs (rpoNFAs) characterise the class of
$\mathcal{R}$-trivial languages, and we establish the complexity of deciding if
the language of an NFA is $\mathcal{R}$-trivial. Nevertheless, the limitation
to fixed alphabets turns out to be essential even in the restricted case:
deciding universality of rpoNFAs with unbounded alphabets is PSPACE-complete.
Based on a close relation between universality and the problems of inclusion
and equivalence, we also obtain the complexity results for these two problems.
Finaly, we show that the languages of rpoNFAs are definable by deterministic
(one-unambiguous) regular expressions, which makes them interesting in schema
languages for XML data.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, a very simple no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA)
model for JPEG compressed images is proposed. The proposed metric called median
of unique gradients (MUG) is based on the very simple facts of unique gradient
magnitudes of JPEG compressed images. MUG is a parameterless metric and does
not need training. Unlike other NR-IQAs, MUG is independent to block size and
cropping. A more stable index called MUG+ is also introduced. The experimental
results on six benchmark datasets of natural images and a benchmark dataset of
synthetic images show that MUG is comparable to the state-of-the-art indices in
literature. In addition, its performance remains unchanged for the case of the
cropped images in which block boundaries are not known. The MATLAB source code
of the proposed metrics is available at
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74505502/MUG.m and
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74505502/MUGplus.m.

 <dc:title>Opinion dynamics in social networks with stubborn agents: an issue-based

 <dc:description>  Classic models on opinion dynamics usually focus on a group of agents forming
their opinions interactively over single issue. Yet generally consensus can not
be achieved over single issue when agents are not completely open to
interpersonal influence. In this paper, opinion consensus in social networks
with stubborn agents is considered over issue sequences. The social network
with stubborn agents is described by the Friedkin-Johnsen (F-J) model where
agents are stubborn to their initial opinions. Firstly, we propose some
sufficient and necessary conditions both in terms of network topology and
system matrix for convergence of the F-J model over single issue. Secondly,
opinion consensus of the F-J model is investigated over issue sequences. Our
analysis establishes connections between the interpersonal influence network
and the network describing the relationship of agents' initial opinions for
successive issues. Taking advantage of these connections, we derive the
sufficient and necessary condition for the F-J model to achieve opinion
consensus over issue sequences. Finally, we consider a more general scenario
where each agent has bounded confidence in forming its initial opinion for
every issue. By analyzing the evolution of agents' ultimate opinions for each
issue over issue sequences, we prove that the connectivity of the
state-dependent network is preserved in this setting. Then the conditions for
agents to achieve opinion consensus over issue sequences are proposed.
Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our
theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  In networked control systems, the advent of event-triggering strategies in
the sampling process has resulted in the usage reduction of network capacities,
such as communication bandwidth. However, the aperiodic nature of sampling
periods generated by event-triggering strategies has hindered the
schedulability of such networks. In this study, we propose a framework to
construct a timed safety automaton that captures the sampling behavior of
perturbed LTI systems with an $\mathcal{L}_2$-based triggering mechanisms
proposed in the Literature. In this framework, the state-space is partitioned
into a finite number of convex polyhedral cones, each cone representing a
discrete mode in the abstracted automaton. Adopting techniques from stability
analysis of retarded systems accompanied with a polytopic embedding of time,
LMI conditions to characterize the sampling interval associated with each
region are derived. Then, using reachability analysis, the transitions in the
abstracted automaton are derived.

 <dc:description>  Information diffusion in networks has received a lot of recent attention.
Most previous work addresses the influence maximization problem of selecting an
appropriate set of seed nodes to initiate the diffusion process so that the
largest number of nodes is reached. Since the seed selection problem is NP
hard, most solutions are sub-optimal. Furthermore, there may be settings in
which the seed nodes are predetermined. Thus, a natural question that arise is:
given a set of seed nodes, can we select a small set of nodes such that if we
improve their reaction to the diffusion process, the largest increase in
diffusion spread is achieved? We call this problem, the boost set selection
problem. In this paper, we formalize this problem, study its complexity and
propose appropriate algorithms. We also evaluate the effect of boosting in a
number of real networks and report the increase of influence spread achieved
for different seed sets, time limits in the diffusion process and other
diffusion parameters.

 <dc:description>  We suggest there is a need for a fresh perspective on the design and
development of workflow systems and argue for a building blocks approach. We
outline a description of this approach and define the properties of software
building blocks. We discuss RADICAL-Cybertools as one implementation of the
building blocks concept, showing how they have been designed and developed in
accordance with this approach. Four case studies are presented, covering a
dozen science problems. We discuss how RADICAL-Cybertools have been used to
develop new workflow systems capabilities and integrated to enhance existing
ones, illustrating the applicability and potential of software building blocks.
In doing so, we have begun an investigation of an alternative approach to
thinking about the design and implementation of workflow systems.

 <dc:description>  Through sequence-based classification, this paper tries to accurately predict
the DNA binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) in an unannotated cellular
context. Related methods in the literature fail to perform such predictions
accurately, since they do not consider sample distribution shift of sequence
segments from an annotated (source) context to an unannotated (target) context.
We, therefore, propose a method called &quot;Transfer String Kernel&quot; (TSK) that
achieves improved prediction of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) using
knowledge transfer via cross-context sample adaptation. TSK maps sequence
segments to a high-dimensional feature space using a discriminative mismatch
string kernel framework. In this high-dimensional space, labeled examples of
the source context are re-weighted so that the revised sample distribution
matches the target context more closely. We have experimentally verified TSK
for TFBS identifications on fourteen different TFs under a cross-organism
setting. We find that TSK consistently outperforms the state-of the-art TFBS
tools, especially when working with TFs whose binding sequences are not
conserved across contexts. We also demonstrate the generalizability of TSK by
showing its cutting-edge performance on a different set of cross-context tasks
for the MHC peptide binding predictions.

 <dc:description>  Proponents of deploying LTE in the 5 GHz band for providing additional
cellular network capacity have claimed that LTE would be a better neighbour to
Wi-Fi in the unlicensed band, than Wi-Fi is to itself. On the other side of the
debate, the Wi-Fi community has objected that LTE would be highly detrimental
to Wi-Fi network performance. However, there is a lack of transparent and
systematic engineering evidence supporting the contradicting claims of the two
camps, which is essential for ascertaining whether regulatory intervention is
in fact required to protect the Wi-Fi incumbent from the new LTE entrant. To
this end, we present a comprehensive coexistence study of Wi-Fi and
LTE-in-unlicensed, surveying a large parameter space of coexistence mechanisms
and a range of representative network densities and deployment scenarios. Our
results show that, typically, harmonious coexistence between Wi-Fi and LTE is
ensured by the large number of 5 GHz channels. For the worst-case scenario of
forced co-channel operation, LTE is sometimes a better neighbour to Wi-Fi -
when effective node density is low - but sometimes worse - when density is
high. We find that distributed interference coordination is only necessary to
prevent a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; in regimes where interference is very
likely. We also show that in practice it does not make a difference to the
incumbent what kind of coexistence mechanism is added to LTE-in-unlicensed, as
long as one is in place. We therefore conclude that LTE is neither friend nor
foe to Wi-Fi in the unlicensed bands in general. We submit that the systematic
engineering analysis exemplified by our case study is a best-practice approach
for supporting evidence-based rulemaking by the regulator.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio
waveforms. The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the
predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones;
nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of
thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it
yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as
significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative
systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the
characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch
between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model
music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical
fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model,
returning promising results for phoneme recognition.

 <dc:title>Hyperspectral Unmixing with Endmember Variability using Partial
  Membership Latent Dirichlet Allocation</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Zare, Alina</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The application of Partial Membership Latent Dirichlet Allocation(PM-LDA) for
hyperspectral endmember estimation and spectral unmixing is presented. PM-LDA
provides a model for a hyperspectral image analysis that accounts for spectral
variability and incorporates spatial information through the use of
superpixel-based 'documents.' In our application of PM-LDA, we employ the
Normal Compositional Model in which endmembers are represented as Normal
distributions to account for spectral variability and proportion vectors are
modeled as random variables governed by a Dirichlet distribution. The use of
the Dirichlet distribution enforces positivity and sum-to-one constraints on
the proportion values. Algorithm results on real hyperspectral data indicate
that PM-LDA produces endmember distributions that represent the ground truth
classes and their associated variability.

 <dc:title>DOA estimation in structured phase-noisy environments: technical report</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we focus on the problem of estimating the directions of arrival
(DOA) of a set of incident plane waves. Unlike many previous works, which
assume that the received observations are only affected by additive noise, we
consider the setup where some phase noise also corrupts the data (as for
example observed in atmospheric sound propagation or underwater acoustics). We
propose a new methodology to solve this problem in a Bayesian framework by
resorting to a variational mean-field approximation. Our simulation results
illustrate the benefits of carefully accounting for the phase noise in the DOA
estimation process.

 <dc:description>  Extracting information from large graphs has become an important statistical
problem since network data is now common in various fields. In this minicourse
we will investigate the most natural statistical questions for three canonical
probabilistic models of networks: (i) community detection in the stochastic
block model, (ii) finding the embedding of a random geometric graph, and (iii)
finding the original vertex in a preferential attachment tree. Along the way we
will cover many interesting topics in probability theory such as P\'olya urns,
large deviation theory, concentration of measure in high dimension, entropic
central limit theorems, and more.

 <dc:description>  Recent seminal works on human mobility have shown that individuals constantly
exploit a small set of repeatedly visited locations. A concurrent literature
has emphasized the explorative nature of human behavior, showing that the
number of visited places grows steadily over time. How to reconcile these
seemingly contradicting facts remains an open question. Here, we analyze
high-resolution multi-year traces of $\sim$40,000 individuals from 4 datasets
and show that this tension vanishes when the long-term evolution of mobility
patterns is considered. We reveal that mobility patterns evolve significantly
yet smoothly, and that the number of familiar locations an individual visits at
any point is a conserved quantity with a typical size of $\sim$25 locations. We
use this finding to improve state-of-the-art modeling of human mobility.
Furthermore, shifting the attention from aggregated quantities to individual
behavior we show that the size of an individual's set of preferred locations
correlates with the number of her social interactions. This result suggests a
connection between the conserved quantity we identify, which as we show can not
be understood purely on the basis of time constraints, and the `Dunbar number'
describing a cognitive upper limit to an individual's number of social
relations. We anticipate that our work will sparkle further research linking
the study of Human Mobility and the Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences.

 <dc:description>  We describe Microsoft's conversational speech recognition system, in which we
combine recent developments in neural-network-based acoustic and language
modeling to advance the state of the art on the Switchboard recognition task.
Inspired by machine learning ensemble techniques, the system uses a range of
convolutional and recurrent neural networks. I-vector modeling and lattice-free
MMI training provide significant gains for all acoustic model architectures.
Language model rescoring with multiple forward and backward running RNNLMs, and
word posterior-based system combination provide a 20% boost. The best single
system uses a ResNet architecture acoustic model with RNNLM rescoring, and
achieves a word error rate of 6.9% on the NIST 2000 Switchboard task. The
combined system has an error rate of 6.2%, representing an improvement over
previously reported results on this benchmark task.

 <dc:description>  Deep Matching (DM) is a popular high-quality method for quasi-dense image
matching. Despite its name, however, the original DM formulation does not yield
a deep neural network that can be trained end-to-end via backpropagation. In
this paper, we remove this limitation by rewriting the complete DM algorithm as
a convolutional neural network. This results in a novel deep architecture for
image matching that involves a number of new layer types and that, similar to
recent networks for image segmentation, has a U-topology. We demonstrate the
utility of the approach by improving the performance of DM by learning it
end-to-end on an image matching task.

 <dc:title>A Multi-Scale Cascade Fully Convolutional Network Face Detector</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Face detection is challenging as faces in images could be present at
arbitrary locations and in different scales. We propose a three-stage cascade
structure based on fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs). It first
proposes the approximate locations where the faces may be, then aims to find
the accurate location by zooming on to the faces. Each level of the FCN cascade
is a multi-scale fully-convolutional network, which generates scores at
different locations and in different scales. A score map is generated after
each FCN stage. Probable regions of face are selected and fed to the next
stage. The number of proposals is decreased after each level, and the areas of
regions are decreased to more precisely fit the face. Compared to passing
proposals directly between stages, passing probable regions can decrease the
number of proposals and reduce the cases where first stage doesn't propose good
bounding boxes. We show that by using FCN and score map, the FCN cascade face
detector can achieve strong performance on public datasets.

 <dc:title>Single-Peakedness and Total Unimodularity: Efficiently Solve Voting
  Problems Without Even Trying</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Peters, Dominik</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many NP-hard winner determination problems admit polynomial-time algorithms
when restricting inputs to be single-peaked. Commonly, such algorithms employ
dynamic programming along the underlying axis. We introduce a new technique:
carefully chosen integer linear programming (IP) formulations for certain
voting problems admit an LP relaxation which is totally unimodular if
preferences are single-peaked, and which thus admits an integral optimal
solution. This technique gives fast algorithms for finding optimal committees
under the PAV and Chamberlin-Courant voting rules under single-peaked
preferences, as well as for certain OWA-based rules. Under single-crossing
preferences, Young scores can also be calculated. An advantage of this
technique is that no special-purpose algorithm needs to be used to exploit
structure in the input preferences: any standard IP solver will terminate in
the first iteration if the input is single-peaked, and will continue to work
otherwise.

 <dc:description>  Causal inference from observational data is a subject of active research and
development in statistics and computer science. Many toolkits have been
developed for this purpose that depends on statistical software. However, these
toolkits do not scale to large datasets. In this paper we describe a suite of
techniques for expressing causal inference tasks from observational data in
SQL. This suite supports the state-of-the-art methods for causal inference and
run at scale within a database engine. In addition, we introduce several
optimization techniques that significantly speedup causal inference, both in
the online and offline setting. We evaluate the quality and performance of our
techniques by experiments of real datasets.

 <dc:description>  In a recent paper, &quot;Why does deep and cheap learning work so well?&quot;, Lin and
Tegmark claim to show that the mapping between deep belief networks and the
variational renormalization group derived in [arXiv:1410.3831] is invalid, and
present a &quot;counterexample&quot; that claims to show that this mapping does not hold.
In this comment, we show that these claims are incorrect and stem from a
misunderstanding of the variational RG procedure proposed by Kadanoff. We also
explain why the &quot;counterexample&quot; of Lin and Tegmark is compatible with the
mapping proposed in [arXiv:1410.3831].

 <dc:description>  We present a computable algorithm that assigns probabilities to every logical
statement in a given formal language, and refines those probabilities over
time. For instance, if the language is Peano arithmetic, it assigns
probabilities to all arithmetical statements, including claims about the twin
prime conjecture, the outputs of long-running computations, and its own
probabilities. We show that our algorithm, an instance of what we call a
logical inductor, satisfies a number of intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it
learns to predict patterns of truth and falsehood in logical statements, often
long before having the resources to evaluate the statements, so long as the
patterns can be written down in polynomial time; (2) it learns to use
appropriate statistical summaries to predict sequences of statements whose
truth values appear pseudorandom; and (3) it learns to have accurate beliefs
about its own current beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard paradoxes
of self-reference. For example, if a given computer program only ever produces
outputs in a certain range, a logical inductor learns this fact in a timely
manner; and if late digits in the decimal expansion of $\pi$ are difficult to
predict, then a logical inductor learns to assign $\approx 10\%$ probability to
&quot;the $n$th digit of $\pi$ is a 7&quot; for large $n$. Logical inductors also learn
to trust their future beliefs more than their current beliefs, and their
beliefs are coherent in the limit (whenever $\phi \implies \psi$,
$\mathbb{P}_\infty(\phi) \le \mathbb{P}_\infty(\psi)$, and so on); and logical

 <dc:description>  In an era of ubiquitous large-scale streaming data, the availability of data
far exceeds the capacity of expert human analysts. In many settings, such data
is either discarded or stored unprocessed in datacenters. This paper proposes a
method of online data thinning, in which large-scale streaming datasets are
winnowed to preserve unique, anomalous, or salient elements for timely expert
analysis. At the heart of this proposed approach is an online anomaly detection
method based on dynamic, low-rank Gaussian mixture models. Specifically, the
high-dimensional covariances matrices associated with the Gaussian components
are associated with low-rank models. According to this model, most observations
lie near a union of subspaces. The low-rank modeling mitigates the curse of
dimensionality associated with anomaly detection for high-dimensional data, and
recent advances in subspace clustering and subspace tracking allow the proposed
method to adapt to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the proposed method
allows subsampling, is robust to missing data, and uses a mini-batch online
optimization approach. The resulting algorithms are scalable, efficient, and
are capable of operating in real time. Experiments on wide-area motion imagery
and e-mail databases illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  To tackle the exponentiality associated with NP-hard problems, two paradigms
have been proposed. First, Branch &amp; Bound, like Dynamic Programming, achieve
efficient exact inference but requires extensive information and analysis about
the problem at hand. Second, meta-heuristics are easier to implement but
comparatively inefficient. As a result, a number of problems have been left
unoptimized and plain greedy solutions are used. We introduce a theoretical
framework and propose a powerful yet simple search method called Dilemma First
Search (DFS). DFS exploits the decision heuristic needed for the greedy
solution for further optimization. DFS is useful when it is hard to design
efficient exact inference. We evaluate DFS on two problems: First, the Knapsack
problem, for which efficient algorithms exist, serves as a toy example. Second,
Decision Tree inference, where state-of-the-art algorithms rely on the greedy
or randomness-based solutions. We further show that decision trees benefit from
optimizations that are performed in a fraction of the iterations required by a
random-based search.

 <dc:description>  It is known that any linear code allows for a decoding strategy that treats
errors and erasures separately over an error-erasure channel. In particular, a
carefully designed parity-check matrix makes efficient erasure correction
possible through iterative decoding while instantly providing the necessary
parity-check equations for independent error correction on demand. The
separating redundancy of a given linear code is the number of parity-check
equations in a smallest parity-check matrix that has the required property for
this error-erasure separation. In a sense, it is a parameter of a linear code
that represents the minimum overhead for efficiently separating erasures from
errors. While several bounds on separating redundancy are known, there still
remains a wide gap between upper and lower bounds except for a few limited
cases. In this paper, using probabilistic combinatorics and design theory, we
improve both upper and lower bounds on separating redundancy.

 <dc:description>  Realistic image manipulation is challenging because it requires modifying the
image appearance in a user-controlled way, while preserving the realism of the
result. Unless the user has considerable artistic skill, it is easy to &quot;fall
off&quot; the manifold of natural images while editing. In this paper, we propose to
learn the natural image manifold directly from data using a generative
adversarial neural network. We then define a class of image editing operations,
and constrain their output to lie on that learned manifold at all times. The
model automatically adjusts the output keeping all edits as realistic as
possible. All our manipulations are expressed in terms of constrained
optimization and are applied in near-real time. We evaluate our algorithm on
the task of realistic photo manipulation of shape and color. The presented
method can further be used for changing one image to look like the other, as
well as generating novel imagery from scratch based on user's scribbles.

 <dc:description>  Autoscaling system can reconfigure cloud-based applications and services,
through various cloud software configurations and hardware provisioning, to
adapt to the changing environment at runtime. Such a behaviour offers the
foundation to achieve elasticity in modern cloud computing paradigm. Given the
importance of autoscaling in cloud, computational intelligence has been widely
applied for engineering autoscaling system, leading to self-aware,
self-adaptive and more dependable runtime scaling. In this paper, we present
the brief background and history for autoscaling in the cloud, as well as their
associations with self-awareness and self-adaptivity of a system. Subsequently,
we conduct detailed survey and taxonomy of the key related work and identify
the gaps in this area of research.

 <dc:description>  Future multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless communications systems will
use beamforming as a first-step towards realizing the capacity requirements
necessitated by the exponential increase in data demands. The focus of this
work is on beam alignment for time-division duplexing (TDD) systems, for which
we propose a number of novel algorithms. These algorithms seek to obtain good
estimates of the optimal beamformer/combiner pair (which are the dominant
singular vectors of the channel matrix). They are motivated by the power
method, an iterative algorithm to determine eigenvalues and eigenvectors
through repeated matrix multiplication. In contrast to the basic power method
which considers only the most recent iteration and assumes noiseless links, the
proposed techniques consider information from all the previous iterations of
the algorithm and combine them in different ways. The first technique
(Sequential Least-Squares method) sequentially constructs a least-squares
estimate of the channel matrix, which is then used to calculate the
beamformer/combiner pair estimate. The second technique (Summed Power method)
aims to mitigate the effect of noise by using a linear combination of the
previously tried beams to calculate the next beam, providing improved
performance in the low-SNR regime (typical for mmWave systems) with minimal
complexity/feedback overhead. A third technique (Least-Squares Initialized
Summed Power method) combines the good performance of the first technique at
the high-SNR regime with the low-complexity advantage of the second technique
by priming the summed power method with initial estimates from the sequential
method.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel Connectionist Text Proposal Network (CTPN) that accurately
localizes text lines in natural image. The CTPN detects a text line in a
sequence of fine-scale text proposals directly in convolutional feature maps.
We develop a vertical anchor mechanism that jointly predicts location and
text/non-text score of each fixed-width proposal, considerably improving
localization accuracy. The sequential proposals are naturally connected by a
recurrent neural network, which is seamlessly incorporated into the
convolutional network, resulting in an end-to-end trainable model. This allows
the CTPN to explore rich context information of image, making it powerful to
detect extremely ambiguous text. The CTPN works reliably on multi-scale and
multi- language text without further post-processing, departing from previous
bottom-up methods requiring multi-step post-processing. It achieves 0.88 and
0.61 F-measure on the ICDAR 2013 and 2015 benchmarks, surpass- ing recent
results [8, 35] by a large margin. The CTPN is computationally efficient with
0:14s/image, by using the very deep VGG16 model [27]. Online demo is available
at: http://textdet.com/.

 <dc:title>Less is More: Minimizing Code Reorganization using XTREE</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Context: Developers use bad code smells to guide code reorganization. Yet
developers, text books, tools, and researchers disagree on which bad smells are
important. Objective: To evaluate the likelihood that a code reorganization to
address bad code smells will yield improvement in the defect-proneness of the
code. Method: We introduce XTREE, a tool that analyzes a historical log of
defects seen previously in the code and generates a set of useful code changes.
Any bad smell that requires changes outside of that set can be deprioritized
(since there is no historical evidence that the bad smell causes any problems).
Evaluation: We evaluate XTREE's recommendations for bad smell improvement
against recommendations from previous work (Shatnawi, Alves, and Borges) using
multiple data sets of code metrics and defect counts. Results: Code modules
that are changed in response to XTREE's recommendations contain significantly
fewer defects than recommendations from previous studies. Further, XTREE
endorses changes to very few code metrics, and the bad smell recommendations
(learned from previous studies) are not universal to all software projects.
Conclusion: Before undertaking a code reorganization based on a bad smell
report, use a tool like XTREE to check and ignore any such operations that are
useless; i.e. ones which lack evidence in the historical record that it is
useful to make that change. Note that this use case applies to both manual code
reorganizations proposed by developers as well as those conducted by automatic
methods. This recommendation assumes that there is an historical record. If
none exists, then the results of this paper could be used as a guide.

 <dc:description>  Personal Health Records (PHR) emerge as an alternative to integrate patient's
health information to give a global view of patients' status. However,
integration is not a trivial feature when dealing with a variety electronic
health systems from healthcare centers. Access to PHR sensitive information
must comply with privacy policies defined by the patient. Architecture PHR
design should be in accordance to these, and take advantage of nowadays
technology. Cloud computing is a current technology that provides scalability,
ubiquity, and elasticity features. This paper presents a scoping review related
to PHR systems that achieve three characteristics: integrated, reliable and
cloud-based. We found 101 articles that addressed those characteristics. We
identified four main research topics: proposal/developed systems, PHR
recommendations for development, system integration and standards, and security
and privacy. Integration is tackled with HL7 CDA standard. Information
reliability is based in ABE security-privacy mechanism. Cloud-based technology
access is achieved via SOA.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of object recognition in 3D using an ensemble of
attribute-based classifiers. We propose two new concepts to improve
classification in practical situations, and show their implementation in an
approach implemented for recognition from point-cloud data. First, the viewing
conditions can have a strong influence on classification performance. We study
the impact of the distance between the camera and the object and propose an
approach to fuse multiple attribute classifiers, which incorporates distance
into the decision making. Second, lack of representative training samples often
makes it difficult to learn the optimal threshold value for best positive and
negative detection rate. We address this issue, by setting in our attribute
classifiers instead of just one threshold value, two threshold values to
distinguish a positive, a negative and an uncertainty class, and we prove the
theoretical correctness of this approach. Empirical studies demonstrate the
effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed concepts.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the problem of robot movement adaptation under
various environmental constraints interactively. Motion primitives are
generally adopted to generate target motion from demonstrations. However, their
generalization capability is weak while facing novel environments.
Additionally, traditional motion generation methods do not consider the
versatile constraints from various users, tasks, and environments. In this
work, we propose a co-active learning framework for learning to adapt robot
end-effector's movement for manipulation tasks. It is designed to adapt the
original imitation trajectories, which are learned from demonstrations, to
novel situations with various constraints. The framework also considers user's
feedback towards the adapted trajectories, and it learns to adapt movement
through human-in-the-loop interactions. The implemented system generalizes
trained motion primitives to various situations with different constraints
considering user preferences. Experiments on a humanoid platform validate the
effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This thesis focuses on the wireless security in the physical layer with
beamforming technique. One of the emerging areas is the security enhancement in
the physical layer, which exploits the intrinsic properties of the wireless
medium. Beamforming, which has been proved to have many advantages, can also be
applied to enhance the wireless security.
  One of the most common threats, i.e., passive eavesdropping, is addressed in
this thesis. To reduce the risk of leaking information to the eavesdroppers,
the physical region where the transmission is exposed to eavesdropping has been
studied. In this thesis, the exposure region based beamforming technique is
proposed to combat the threat from the randomly located eavesdroppers in a
fading channel. In this system model, the large-scale path loss and a general
Rician fading channel model are considered. The exposure region is established
to describe the secrecy performance of the system, based on which the
probability that the secrecy outage event occurs is defined to evaluate the
security level of the exposure region.
  The antenna array is one of the most important factors that affect the
secrecy performance of the exposure region based beamforming technique. The
potential of using different array geometry and array configuration to improve
security is explored. In this thesis, two common arrays, i.e., linear and
circular arrays, are considered.Analytic expressions for general array geometry
and for the linear and circular arrays are derived. Based on the empirical
results, numerical optimization algorithms are developed to exploit the array
configuration to enhance the system security level. In addition, experiments
are carried out to study the performance of the beamformer with linear and
circular arrays. Especially, the impact of the mutual coupling on the security
performance is investigated.

 <dc:title>Joint Extraction of Events and Entities within a Document Context</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Events and entities are closely related; entities are often actors or
participants in events and events without entities are uncommon. The
interpretation of events and entities is highly contextually dependent.
Existing work in information extraction typically models events separately from
entities, and performs inference at the sentence level, ignoring the rest of
the document. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models the
dependencies among variables of events, entities, and their relations, and
performs joint inference of these variables across a document. The goal is to
enable access to document-level contextual information and facilitate
context-aware predictions. We demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for event extraction as well as a
strong baseline for entity extraction.

 <dc:title>Compiling Process Networks to Interaction Nets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mackie, Ian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Kahn process networks are a model of computation based on a collection of
sequential, deterministic processes that communicate by sending messages
through unbounded channels. They are well suited for modelling stream-based
computations, but are in no way restricted to this application. Interaction
nets are graph rewriting systems that have many interesting properties for
implementation. In this paper we show how to encode process networks using
interaction nets, where we model both networks and messages in the same
framework.

 <dc:description>  An algorithm is in-place, or runs in-situ, when it does not need any
additional memory to execute beyond a small constant amount. There are many
algorithms that are efficient because of this feature, therefore it is an
important aspect of an algorithm. In most programming languages, it is not
obvious when an algorithm can run in-place, and moreover it is often not clear
that the implementation respects that idea. In this paper we study interaction
nets as a formalism where we can see directly, visually, that an algorithm is
in-place, and moreover the implementation will respect that it is in-place. Not
all algorithms can run in-place however. We can nevertheless still use the same
language, but now we can annotate parts of the algorithm that can run in-place.
We suggest an annotation for rules, and give an algorithm to find this
automatically through analysis of the interaction rules.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study termination of term graph rewriting, where we restrict
our attention to acyclic term graphs. Motivated by earlier work by Plump we aim
at a definition of the notion of simplification order for acyclic term graphs.
For this we adapt the homeomorphic embedding relation to term graphs. In
contrast to earlier extensions, our notion is inspired by morphisms. Based on
this, we establish a variant of Kruskal's Tree Theorem formulated for acyclic
term graphs. In proof, we rely on the new notion of embedding and follow
Nash-Williams' minimal bad sequence argument. Finally, we propose a variant of
the lexicographic path order for acyclic term graphs.

 <dc:description>  GP 2 is a non-deterministic programming language for computing by graph
transformation. One of the design goals for GP 2 is syntactic and semantic
simplicity, to facilitate formal reasoning about programs. In this paper, we
demonstrate with four case studies how programmers can prove termination and
partial correctness of their solutions. We argue that GP 2's graph
transformation rules, together with induction on the length of program
executions, provide a convenient framework for program verification.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new interaction net implementation of optimal reduction for
the pure untyped lambda calculus. Unlike others, our implementation allows to
reach normal form regardless of the interaction net reduction strategy using
the approach of so-called token-passing nets and a non-deterministic extension
for interaction nets. Another new feature is the read-back mechanism
implemented without leaving the formalism of interaction nets.

weights of existing edges.
  We apply this method in the construction of matchbound certificates for

 <dc:description>  A common feature across many science and engineering applications is the
amount and diversity of data and computation that must be integrated to yield
insights. Data sets are growing larger and becoming distributed; and their
location, availability and properties are often time-dependent. Collectively,
these characteristics give rise to dynamic distributed data-intensive
applications. While &quot;static&quot; data applications have received significant
attention, the characteristics, requirements, and software systems for the
analysis of large volumes of dynamic, distributed data, and data-intensive
applications have received relatively less attention. This paper surveys
several representative dynamic distributed data-intensive application
scenarios, provides a common conceptual framework to understand them, and
examines the infrastructure used in support of applications.

 <dc:description>  Classical stochastic processes can be generated by quantum simulators instead
of the more standard classical ones, such as hidden Markov models. One reason
for using quantum simulators is that they generally require less memory than
their classical counterparts. Here, we examine this quantum advantage for
strongly coupled spin systems---the Dyson-like one-dimensional Ising spin chain
with variable interaction length. We find that the advantage scales with both
interaction range and temperature, growing without bound as interaction
increases. Thus, quantum systems can very efficiently simulate strongly coupled
classical systems.

 <dc:title>Towards Energy-Efficient Communication Management in the Distributed

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the distributed control of networked cyber-physical
systems when a much more energy-efficient distributed communication management
strategy is proposed to solve the well-studied consensus problem. In contrast
to the existing potential-based network topology control method, the proposed
topology control method is based on the variation of communication ranges such
that each agent can control its ad hoc communication range. The proposed
network topology control technique can not only guarantee network connectivity
but also reduce the communication energy. We apply the new network topology
control technique, based on variable communication ranges, in a well-studied
consensus problem, where the communication range for each agent is designed
locally along with a new bounded control algorithm. Theoretical analysis is
then provided to show that the proposed network topology control technique can
guarantee consensus with bounded communication energy consumption. Finally,
simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed
energy-efficient distributed topology control technique.

 <dc:description>  Object skeletons are useful for object representation and object detection.
They are complementary to the object contour, and provide extra information,
such as how object scale (thickness) varies among object parts. But object
skeleton extraction from natural images is very challenging, because it
requires the extractor to be able to capture both local and non-local image
context in order to determine the scale of each skeleton pixel. In this paper,
we present a novel fully convolutional network with multiple scale-associated
side outputs to address this problem. By observing the relationship between the
receptive field sizes of the different layers in the network and the skeleton
scales they can capture, we introduce two scale-associated side outputs to each
stage of the network. The network is trained by multi-task learning, where one
task is skeleton localization to classify whether a pixel is a skeleton pixel
or not, and the other is skeleton scale prediction to regress the scale of each
skeleton pixel. Supervision is imposed at different stages by guiding the
scale-associated side outputs toward the groundtruth skeletons at the
appropriate scales. The responses of the multiple scale-associated side outputs
are then fused in a scale-specific way to detect skeleton pixels using multiple
scales effectively. Our method achieves promising results on two skeleton
extraction datasets, and significantly outperforms other competitors.
Additionally, the usefulness of the obtained skeletons and scales (thickness)
are verified on two object detection applications: Foreground object
segmentation and object proposal detection.

 <dc:description>  Text simplification (TS) aims to reduce the lexical and structural complexity
of a text, while still retaining the semantic meaning. Current automatic TS
techniques are limited to either lexical-level applications or manually
defining a large amount of rules. Since deep neural networks are powerful
models that have achieved excellent performance over many difficult tasks, in
this paper, we propose to use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder
model for sentence level TS, which makes minimal assumptions about word
sequence. We conduct preliminary experiments to find that the model is able to
learn operation rules such as reversing, sorting and replacing from sequence
pairs, which shows that the model may potentially discover and apply rules such
as modifying sentence structure, substituting words, and removing words for TS.

 <dc:description>  We consider a class of pursuit-evasion problems where an evader enters a
directed acyclic graph and attempts to reach one of the terminal nodes. A
pursuer enters the graph at a later time and attempts to capture the evader
before it reaches a terminal node. The pursuer can only obtain information
about the evader's path via sensors located at each node in the graph; the
sensor measurements are either green or red (indicating whether or not the
evader has passed through that node). We first show that it is NP-hard to
determine whether the pursuer can enter with some nonzero delay and still be
guaranteed to capture the evader, even for the simplest case when the
underlying graph is a tree. This also implies that it is NP-hard to determine
the largest delay at which the pursuer can enter and still have a guaranteed
capture policy. We further show that it is NP-hard to approximate (within any
constant factor) the largest delay at which the pursuer can enter. Finally, we
provide an algorithm to compute the maximum pursuer delay for a class of
node-sweeping policies on tree networks and show that this algorithm runs in
linear-time for bounded-degree trees.

 <dc:title>A Greedy Algorithm to Cluster Specialists</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Several recent deep neural networks experiments leverage the
generalist-specialist paradigm for classification. However, no formal study
compared the performance of different clustering algorithms for class
assignment. In this paper we perform such a study, suggest slight modifications
to the clustering procedures, and propose a novel algorithm designed to
optimize the performance of of the specialist-generalist classification system.
Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets allow us to investigate
situations for varying number of classes on similar data. We find that our
\emph{greedy pairs} clustering algorithm consistently outperforms other
alternatives, while the choice of the confusion matrix has little impact on the
final performance.

that the common subsequence is required to consist of at least $k$ length
substrings. First, we show an $O(mn)$ time algorithm for the problem which
gives a better worst-case running time than existing algorithms, where $m$ and
$n$ are lengths of the input strings. Furthermore, we mainly consider the LCS
in at least $k$ length order-isomorphic substrings problem. We show that the
problem can also be solved in $O(mn)$ worst-case time by an easy-to-implement
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Recommender systems often use latent features to explain the behaviors of
users and capture the properties of items. As users interact with different
items over time, user and item features can influence each other, evolve and
co-evolve over time. The compatibility of user and item's feature further
influence the future interaction between users and items. Recently, point
process based models have been proposed in the literature aiming to capture the
temporally evolving nature of these latent features. However, these models
often make strong parametric assumptions about the evolution process of the
user and item latent features, which may not reflect the reality, and has
limited power in expressing the complex and nonlinear dynamics underlying these
processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep coevolutionary
network model (DeepCoevolve), for learning user and item features based on
their interaction graph. DeepCoevolve use recurrent neural network (RNN) over
evolving networks to define the intensity function in point processes, which
allows the model to capture complex mutual influence between users and items,
and the feature evolution over time. We also develop an efficient procedure for
training the model parameters, and show that the learned models lead to
significant improvements in recommendation and activity prediction compared to
previous state-of-the-arts parametric models.

 <dc:description>  Learning based methods have shown very promising results for the task of
depth estimation in single images. However, most existing approaches treat
depth prediction as a supervised regression problem and as a result, require
vast quantities of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just
recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a challenging
problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing approaches, replacing the
use of explicit depth data during training with easier-to-obtain binocular
stereo footage.
  We propose a novel training objective that enables our convolutional neural
network to learn to perform single image depth estimation, despite the absence
of ground truth depth data. Exploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we
generate disparity images by training our network with an image reconstruction
loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone results in poor
quality depth images. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel training
loss that enforces consistency between the disparities produced relative to
both the left and right images, leading to improved performance and robustness
compared to existing approaches. Our method produces state of the art results
for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI driving dataset, even outperforming
supervised methods that have been trained with ground truth depth.

 <dc:description>  We present a theoretically grounded approach to train deep neural networks,
including recurrent networks, subject to class-dependent label noise. We
propose two procedures for loss correction that are agnostic to both
application domain and network architecture. They simply amount to at most a
matrix inversion and multiplication, provided that we know the probability of
each class being corrupted into another. We further show how one can estimate
these probabilities, adapting a recent technique for noise estimation to the
multi-class setting, and thus providing an end-to-end framework. Extensive
experiments on MNIST, IMDB, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and a large scale dataset of
clothing images employing a diversity of architectures --- stacking dense,
convolutional, pooling, dropout, batch normalization, word embedding, LSTM and
residual layers --- demonstrate the noise robustness of our proposals.
Incidentally, we also prove that, when ReLU is the only non-linearity, the loss
curvature is immune to class-dependent label noise.

 <dc:description>  The virtuality continuum describes the degrees of positive virtuality under
the umbrella term mixed reality. Besides adding virtual information within a
mixed environment, diminished reality aims at reducing real world information.
Mann defined the term mediated reality (MR), which also considered diminished
reality, but without the possibility to describe different degrees of fusion
between a mixed and a diminished reality. That is why this work defines the new
term blending entropy that captures the relations between a mixed and a
diminished reality. The blending entropy is based on the information density of
the mediated reality and the actual area the user has to comprehend, which is
named perceptual frustum. We describe the blending entropy's twodimensional
dependencies and detail important points in the blending entropy's space.

 <dc:title>Power Allocation and Effective Capacity of AF Successive Relays</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lari, Mohammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the relay based telecommunications with $K$ relays between the source and
destination, $K+1$ time or frequency slots are required for a single frame
transmission. However, without the relays, only one time or frequency slot is
used for a single frame transmission. Therefore, despite the benefits of
relaying systems, this type of communications is not efficient from the
spectral efficiency viewpoint. One solution to reduce this issue might be the
full-duplex (FD) relays. An old technique which is reconsidered recently to
improve the spectral efficiency of telecommunication systems. However, FD
relays have a certain complexity, so, some similar techniques such as
successive relays with nearly the same performance but less complexity is taken
into account now. In successive relaying systems, two relays between the source
and destination are employed which receive the transmitted frames from the
source and relay it to the destination successively. This structure generally
acts like an FD relays. In this paper, the effective capacity performance of an
amplify and forward (AF) successive relaying systems with power allocation
strategy at the relays are studied perfectly. However, while the inter-rely
interference (IRI) between two successive relays has to be managed well, the
power allocation and the effective capacity is derived under different
assumptions about the IRI. In this way, we assume weak or strong, short or
long-term constraints on the IRI. Then we extract the optimal transmitted power
at the relay to maximize the effective capacity under these constraints.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study diffusion social learning over weakly-connected
graphs. We show that the asymmetric flow of information hinders the learning
abilities of certain agents regardless of their local observations. Under some
circumstances that we clarify in this work, a scenario of total influence (or
&quot;mind-control&quot;) arises where a set of influential agents ends up shaping the
beliefs of non-influential agents. We derive useful closed-form expressions
that characterize this influence, and which can be used to motivate design
problems to control it. We provide simulation examples to illustrate the
results.

 <dc:description>  The revelation principle is a fundamental theorem in many economics fields.
In this paper, we construct a simple labor model to show that a social choice
function which can be implemented costly in Bayesian Nash equilibrium may not
be truthfully implementable. The key point is the strategy cost property given
in Section 4: In the direct mechanism, each agent only reports a type and will
not pay the strategy cost which would be paid by himself when playing
strategies in the original indirect mechanism. As a result, the revelation
principle may not hold when agents' strategies are costly in the indirect
mechanism.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel proximity and load-aware resource allocation for
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is proposed. The proposed approach
exploits the spatio-temporal traffic patterns, in terms of load and vehicles'
physical proximity, to minimize the total network cost which captures the
tradeoffs between load (i.e., service delay) and successful transmissions while
satisfying vehicles's quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To solve the
optimization problem under slowly varying channel information, it is decoupled
the problem into two interrelated subproblems. First, a dynamic clustering
mechanism is proposed to group vehicles in zones based on their traffic
patterns and proximity information. Second, a matching game is proposed to
allocate resources for each V2V pair within each zone. The problem is cast as
many-to-one matching game in which V2V pairs and resource blocks (RBs) rank one
another in order to minimize their service delay. The proposed game is shown to
belong to the class of matching games with externalities. To solve this game, a
distributed algorithm is proposed using which V2V pairs and RBs interact to
reach a stable matching. Simulation results for a Manhattan model shown that
the proposed scheme yields a higher percentage of V2V pairs satisfying QoS as
well as significant gain in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) as compared to a state-of-art resource allocation baseline.

 <dc:description>  A map $\varphi:K\to R^2$ of a graph $K$ is approximable by embeddings, if for
each $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there is an $\varepsilon$-close to $\varphi$ embedding
$f:K\to R^2$. Analogous notions were studied in computer science under the
names of cluster planarity and weak simplicity. In this survey we present
criteria for approximability by embeddings (P. Minc, 1997, M. Skopenkov, 2003)
and their algorithmic corollaries. We introduce the van Kampen (or
Hanani-Tutte) obstruction for approximability by embeddings and discuss its
completeness. We discuss analogous problems of moving graphs in the plane apart
(cf. S. Spiez and H. Torunczyk, 1991) and finding closest embeddings (H.
Edelsbrunner). We present higher dimensional van Kampen obstruction, its
completeness result and algorithmic corollary (D. Repovs and A. Skopenkov,
1998).

 <dc:title>Large-scale multiscale particle models in inhomogeneous domains:
  modelling and implementation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Richardson, Omar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this thesis, we develop multiscale models for particle simulations in
population dynamics. These models are characterised by prescribing particle
motion on two spatial scales: microscopic and macroscopic. At the microscopic
level, each particle has its own mass, position and velocity, while at the
macroscopic level the particles are interpolated to a continuum quantity whose
evolution is governed by a system of transport equations. This way, one can
prescribe various types of interactions on a global scale, whilst still
maintaining high simulation speed for a large number of particles. In addition,
the interplay between particle motion and interaction is well tuned in both
regions of low and high densities.
  We analyse links between models on these two scales and prove that under
certain conditions, a system of interacting particles converges to a nonlinear
coupled system of transport equations. We use this as a motivation to derive a
model defined on both modelling scales and prescribe the intercommunication
between them. Simulation takes place in inhomogeneous domains with arbitrary
conditions at inflow and outflow boundaries. We realise this by modelling
obstacles, sources and sinks. Integrating these aspects into the simulation
requires a route planning algorithm for the particles. Several algorithms are
considered and evaluated on accuracy, robustness and efficiency.
  All aspects mentioned above are combined in a novel open source prototyping
simulation framework called Mercurial. This computational framework allows the
design of geometries and is built for high performance when large numbers of
particles are involved. Mercurial supports various types of inhomogeneities and
global systems of equations.
  We apply our framework to simulate scenarios in crowd dynamics. We compare
our results with test cases from literature to assess the quality of the
simulations.

 <dc:title>Hacking of the AES with Boolean Functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dubois, Michel</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the major issues of cryptography is the cryptanalysis of cipher
algorithms. Cryptanalysis is the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of
encrypted information, without access to the secret information that is
normally required. Some mechanisms for breaking codes include differential
cryptanalysis, advanced statistics and brute-force.
  Recent works also attempt to use algebraic tools to reduce the cryptanalysis
of a block cipher algorithm to the resolution of a system of quadratic
equations describing the ciphering structure.
  In our study, we will also use algebraic tools but in a new way: by using
Boolean functions and their properties. A Boolean function is a function from
$F_2^n\to F_2$ with $n&gt;1$, characterized by its truth table. The arguments of
Boolean functions are binary words of length $n$. Any Boolean function can be
represented, uniquely, by its algebraic normal form which is an equation which
only contains additions modulo 2 - the XOR function - and multiplications
modulo 2 - the AND function.
  Our aim is to describe the AES algorithm as a set of Boolean functions then
calculate their algebraic normal forms by using the M\&quot;obius transforms. After,
we use a specific representation for these equations to facilitate their
analysis and particularly to try a combinatorial analysis. Through this
approach we obtain a new kind of equations system. This equations system is
more easily implementable and could open new ways to cryptanalysis.

 <dc:description>  Initially developed for the min-knapsack problem, the knapsack cover
inequalities are used in the current best relaxations for numerous
combinatorial optimization problems of covering type. In spite of their
widespread use, these inequalities yield linear programming (LP) relaxations of
exponential size, over which it is not known how to optimize exactly in
polynomial time. In this paper we address this issue and obtain LP relaxations
of quasi-polynomial size that are at least as strong as that given by the
knapsack cover inequalities.
  For the min-knapsack cover problem, our main result can be stated formally as
follows: for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, there is a $(1/\varepsilon)^{O(1)}n^{O(\log
n)}$-size LP relaxation with an integrality gap of at most $2+\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the number of items. Prior to this work, there was no known
relaxation of subexponential size with a constant upper bound on the
integrality gap.
  Our construction is inspired by a connection between extended formulations
and monotone circuit complexity via Karchmer-Wigderson games. In particular,
our LP is based on $O(\log^2 n)$-depth monotone circuits with fan-in~$2$ for
evaluating weighted threshold functions with $n$ inputs, as constructed by
Beimel and Weinreb. We believe that a further understanding of this connection
may lead to more positive results complementing the numerous lower bounds
recently proved for extended formulations.

 <dc:description>  Data analyses in the life sciences are moving from tools run on a personal
computer to services run on large computing platforms. This creates a need to
package tools and dependencies for easy installation, configuration and
deployment on distributed platforms. In addition, for secure execution there is
a need for process isolation on a shared platform. Existing virtual machine and
container technologies are often more complex than traditional Unix utilities,
like chroot, and often require root privileges in order to set up or use. This
is especially challenging on HPC systems where users typically do not have root
access. We therefore present nsroot, a lightweight Linux namespaces based
process isolation tool. It allows restricting the runtime environment of data
analysis tools that may not have been designed with security as a top priority,
in order to reduce the risk and consequences of security breaches, without
requiring any special privileges. The codebase of nsroot is small, and it
provides a command line interface similar to chroot. It can be used on all
Linux kernels that implement user namespaces. In addition, we propose combining
nsroot with the AppImage format for secure execution of packaged applications.
nsroot is open sourced and available at: https://github.com/uit-no/nsroot

After mapping the social structure and introducing indicators of socioeconomic
status, demographic features, and purchasing habits of individuals we show that
typical consumption patterns are strongly correlated with identified
socioeconomic classes leading to patterns of stratification in the social
structure. In addition we measure correlations between merchant categories and
introduce a correlation network, which emerges with a meaningful community
structure. We detect multivariate relations between merchant categories and
show correlations in purchasing habits of individuals. Our work provides novel
and detailed insight into the relations between social and consuming behaviour
with potential applications in recommendation system design.

 <dc:description>  Recent trends in robot arm control have seen a shift towards end-to-end
solutions, using deep reinforcement learning to learn a controller directly
from raw sensor data, rather than relying on a hand-crafted, modular pipeline.
However, the high dimensionality of the state space often means that it is
impractical to generate sufficient training data with real-world experiments.
As an alternative solution, we propose to learn a robot controller in
simulation, with the potential of then transferring this to a real robot.
Building upon the recent success of deep Q-networks, we present an approach
which uses 3D simulations to train a 7-DOF robotic arm in a control task
without any prior knowledge. The controller accepts images of the environment
as its only input, and outputs motor actions for the task of locating and
grasping a cube, over a range of initial configurations. To encourage efficient
learning, a structured reward function is designed with intermediate rewards.
We also present preliminary results in direct transfer of policies over to a
real robot, without any further training.

 <dc:description>  In underlay heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the distance between a macro
base station (MBS) and a macro user (MU) is crucial for a small-cell based
station (SBS) to control the interference to the MU and achieve the
coexistence. To obtain the distance between the MBS and the MU, the SBS needs a
backhaul link from the macro system, such that the macro system is able to
transmit the information of the distance to the SBS through the backhaul link.
However, there may not exist any backhaul link from the macro system to the SBS
in practical situations. Thus, it is challenging for the SBS to obtain the
distance. To deal with this issue, we propose a median based (MB) estimator for
the SBS to obtain the distance between the MBS and the MU without any backhaul
link. Numerical results show that the estimation error of the MB estimator can
be as small as $4\%$.

 <dc:title>Graph Aggregation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Graph aggregation is the process of computing a single output graph that
constitutes a good compromise between several input graphs, each provided by a
different source. One needs to perform graph aggregation in a wide variety of
situations, e.g., when applying a voting rule (graphs as preference orders),
when consolidating conflicting views regarding the relationships between
arguments in a debate (graphs as abstract argumentation frameworks), or when
computing a consensus between several alternative clusterings of a given
dataset (graphs as equivalence relations). In this paper, we introduce a formal
framework for graph aggregation grounded in social choice theory. Our focus is
on understanding which properties shared by the individual input graphs will
transfer to the output graph returned by a given aggregation rule. We consider
both common properties of graphs, such as transitivity and reflexivity, and
arbitrary properties expressible in certain fragments of modal logic. Our
results establish several connections between the types of properties preserved
under aggregation and the choice-theoretic axioms satisfied by the rules used.
The most important of these results is a powerful impossibility theorem that
generalises Arrow's seminal result for the aggregation of preference orders to
a large collection of different types of graphs.

At the same time, it is still subject of ongoing research. In this paper, we

 <dc:description>  We formulate and analyze a graphical model selection method for inferring the
conditional independence graph of a high-dimensional nonstationary Gaussian
random process (time series) from a finite-length observation. The observed
process samples are assumed uncorrelated over time and having a time-varying
marginal distribution. The selection method is based on testing conditional
variances obtained for small subsets of process components. This allows to cope
with the high-dimensional regime, where the sample size can be (drastically)
smaller than the process dimension. We characterize the required sample size
such that the proposed selection method is successful with high probability.

 <dc:description>  Pose estimation, tracking, and action recognition of articulated objects from
depth images are important and challenging problems, which are normally
considered separately. In this paper, a unified paradigm based on Lie group
theory is proposed, which enables us to collectively address these related
problems. Our approach is also applicable to a wide range of articulated
objects. Empirically it is evaluated on lab animals including mouse and fish,
as well as on human hand. On these applications, it is shown to deliver
competitive results compared to the state-of-the-arts, and non-trivial
baselines including convolutional neural networks and regression forest
methods.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural network (RNN) based character-level language models (CLMs)
are extremely useful for modeling out-of-vocabulary words by nature. However,
their performance is generally much worse than the word-level language models
(WLMs), since CLMs need to consider longer history of tokens to properly
predict the next one. We address this problem by proposing hierarchical RNN
architectures, which consist of multiple modules with different timescales.
Despite the multi-timescale structures, the input and output layers operate
with the character-level clock, which allows the existing RNN CLM training
approaches to be directly applicable without any modifications. Our CLM models
show better perplexity than Kneser-Ney (KN) 5-gram WLMs on the One Billion Word
Benchmark with only 2% of parameters. Also, we present real-time
character-level end-to-end speech recognition examples on the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) corpus, where replacing traditional mono-clock RNN CLMs with the
proposed models results in better recognition accuracies even though the number
of parameters are reduced to 30%.

 <dc:description>  In 2013, Boneh and Zhandry introduced the notion of indistinguishability
(IND) in chosen plaintext (CPA) and chosen ciphertext (CCA) attacks by a
quantum adversary which is given superposition access to an oracle for
encryption and decryption queries but is restricted to classical queries in the
challenge phase. In this paper we define IND-CPA and IND-CCA notions for
symmetric encryption schemes where the adversary has full quantum superposition
access to the oracle, and give constructions that achieve these security
notions. Our results are formulated in the concrete security framework.

 <dc:title>A Fast Proximal Gradient Algorithm for Decentralized Composite

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a fast decentralized algorithm for solving a consensus
optimization problem defined in a directed networked multi-agent system, where
the local objective functions have the smooth+nonsmooth composite form, and are
possibly nonconvex. Examples of such problems include decentralized compressed
sensing and constrained quadratic programming problems, as well as many
decentralized regularization problems. We extend the existing algorithms
PG-EXTRA and ExtraPush to a new algorithm PG-ExtraPush for composite consensus
optimization over a directed network. This algorithm takes advantage of the
proximity operator like in PG-EXTRA to deal with the nonsmooth term, and
employs the push-sum protocol like in ExtraPush to tackle the bias introduced
by the directed network. With a proper step size, we show that PG-ExtraPush
converges to an optimal solution at a linear rate under some regular
assumptions. We conduct a series of numerical experiments to show the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Specifically, with a proper step size,
PG-ExtraPush performs linear rates in most of cases, even in some nonconvex
cases, and is significantly faster than Subgradient-Push, even if the latter
uses a hand-optimized step size. The established theoretical results are also
verified by the numerical results.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchical feature learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNN)
has recently shown significant potential in various computer vision tasks.
While allowing high-quality discriminative feature learning, the downside of
CNNs is the lack of explicit structure in features, which often leads to
overfitting, absence of reconstruction from partial observations and limited
generative abilities. Explicit structure is inherent in hierarchical
compositional models, however, these lack the ability to optimize a
well-defined cost function. We propose a novel analytic model of a basic unit
in a layered hierarchical model with both explicit compositional structure and
a well-defined discriminative cost function. Our experiments on two datasets
show that the proposed compositional model performs on a par with standard CNNs
on discriminative tasks, while, due to explicit modeling of the structure in
the feature units, affording a straight-forward visualization of parts and
faster inference due to separability of the units. Actions

 <dc:title>Quantitative identification of technological discontinuities using

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to develop and test metrics to quantitatively
identify technological discontinuities in a knowledge network. We developed
five metrics based on innovation theories and tested the metrics by a
simulation model-based knowledge network and hypothetically designed
discontinuity. The designed discontinuity is modeled as a node which combines
two different knowledge streams and whose knowledge is dominantly persistent in
the knowledge network. The performances of the proposed metrics were evaluated
by how well the metrics can distinguish the designed discontinuity from other
nodes on the knowledge network. The simulation results show that the
persistence times # of converging main paths provides the best performance in
identifying the designed discontinuity: the designed discontinuity was
identified as one of the top 3 patents with 96~99% probability by Metric 5 and
it is, according to the size of a domain, 12~34% better than the performance of
the second best metric. Beyond the simulation analysis, we tested the metrics
using a patent set representative of the Magnetic information storage domain.
The three representative patents associated with a well-known breakthrough
technology in the domain, the giant magneto-resistance (GMR) spin valve sensor,
were selected based on the qualitative studies, and the metrics were tested by
how well the metrics identify the selected patents as top-ranked patents. The
empirical results fully support the simulation results and therefore the
persistence times # of converging main paths is recommended for identifying
technological discontinuities for any technology.

 <dc:title>A Unified Gender-Aware Age Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Human age estimation has attracted increasing researches due to its wide
applicability in such as security monitoring and advertisement recommendation.
Although a variety of methods have been proposed, most of them focus only on
the age-specific facial appearance. However, biological researches have shown
that not only gender but also the aging difference between the male and the
female inevitably affect the age estimation. To our knowledge, so far there
have been two methods that have concerned the gender factor. The first is a
sequential method which first classifies the gender and then performs age
estimation respectively for classified male and female. Although it promotes
age estimation performance because of its consideration on the gender semantic
difference, an accumulation risk of estimation errors is unavoidable. To
overcome drawbacks of the sequential strategy, the second is to regress the age
appended with the gender by concatenating their labels as two dimensional
output using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Although leading to promotion of age
estimation performance, such a concatenation not only likely confuses the
semantics between the gender and age, but also ignores the aging discrepancy
between the male and the female. In order to overcome their shortcomings, in
this paper we propose a unified framework to perform gender-aware age
estimation. The proposed method considers and utilizes not only the semantic
relationship between the gender and the age, but also the aging discrepancy
between the male and the female. Finally, experimental results demonstrate not
only the superiority of our method in performance, but also its good
interpretability in revealing the aging discrepancy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output wireless powered
communication network (MIMO-WPCN), where multiple users harvest energy from a
dedicated power station in order to be able to transmit their information
signals to an information receiving station. Employing a practical non-linear
energy harvesting (EH) model, we propose a joint time allocation and power
control scheme, which takes into account the uncertainty regarding the channel
state information (CSI) and provides robustness against imperfect CSI
knowledge. In particular, we formulate two non-convex optimization problems for
different objectives, namely system sum throughput maximization and
maximization of the minimum individual throughput across all wireless powered
users. To overcome the non-convexity, we apply several transformations along
with a one-dimensional search to obtain an efficient resource allocation
algorithm. Numerical results reveal that a significant performance gain can be
achieved when the resource allocation is designed based on the adopted
non-linear EH model instead of the conventional linear EH model. Besides,
unlike a non-robust baseline scheme designed for perfect CSI, the proposed
resource allocation schemes are shown to be robust against imperfect CSI
knowledge.

 <dc:description>  PDDL+ planning has its semantics rooted in hybrid automata (HA) and recent
work has shown that it can be modeled as a network of HAs. Addressing the
complexity of nonlinear PDDL+ planning as HAs requires both space and time
efficient reasoning. Unfortunately, existing solvers either do not address
nonlinear dynamics or do not natively support networks of automata.
  We present a new algorithm, called HNSolve, which guides the variable
selection of the dReal Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver while
reasoning about network encodings of nonlinear PDDL+ planning as HAs. HNSolve
tightly integrates with dReal by solving a discrete abstraction of the HA
network. HNSolve finds composite runs on the HA network that ignore continuous
variables, but respect mode jumps and synchronization labels. HNSolve
admissibly detects dead-ends in the discrete abstraction, and posts conflict
clauses that prune the SMT solver's search. We evaluate the benefits of our
HNSolve algorithm on PDDL+ benchmark problems and demonstrate its performance
with respect to prior work.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we model the salient object detection problem under a
probabilistic framework encoding the boundary connectivity saliency cue and
smoothness constraints in an optimization problem. We show that this problem
has a closed form global optimum which estimates the salient object. We further
show that along with the probabilistic framework, the proposed method also
enjoys a wide range of interpretations, i.e. graph cut, diffusion maps and
one-class classification. With an analysis according to these interpretations,
we also find that our proposed method provides approximations to the global
optimum to another criterion that integrates local/global contrast and large
area saliency cues. The proposed approach achieves mostly leading performance
compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms over a large set of salient object
detection datasets including around 17k images for several evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed method is
favorable/comparable to many state-of-the-art techniques.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers how to separate text and/or graphics from smooth
background in screen content and mixed content images and proposes an algorithm
to perform this segmentation task. The proposed methods make use of the fact
that the background in each block is usually smoothly varying and can be
modeled well by a linear combination of a few smoothly varying basis functions,
while the foreground text and graphics create sharp discontinuity. This
algorithm separates the background and foreground pixels by trying to fit pixel
values in the block into a smooth function using a robust regression method.
The inlier pixels that can be well represented with the smooth model will be
considered as background, while remaining outlier pixels will be considered
foreground. We have also created a dataset of screen content images extracted
from HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding with their ground
truth segmentation result which can be used for this task. The proposed
algorithm has been tested on the dataset mentioned above and is shown to have
superior performance over other methods, such as the hierarchical k-means
clustering algorithm, shape primitive extraction and coding, and the least

 <dc:description>  Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) refers to applications
using vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications at a
carrier frequency of 5.9 GHz to increase road traffic safety and road traffic
efficiency in Europe (a.k.a. connected vehicle technology in the US). This
article will shed some light on the current status of C-ITS in Europe and what
is left before deployment can commence in 2019 as announced by C2C-CC. Even
though there is an immense activity for the launch of C-ITS in Europe, the
automotive industry is also planning for the future.

 <dc:description>  Robust face representation is imperative to highly accurate face recognition.
In this work, we propose an open source face recognition method with deep
representation named as VIPLFaceNet, which is a 10-layer deep convolutional
neural network with 7 convolutional layers and 3 fully-connected layers.
Compared with the well-known AlexNet, our VIPLFaceNet takes only 20% training
time and 60% testing time, but achieves 40\% drop in error rate on the
real-world face recognition benchmark LFW. Our VIPLFaceNet achieves 98.60% mean
accuracy on LFW using one single network. An open-source C++ SDK based on
VIPLFaceNet is released under BSD license. The SDK takes about 150ms to process
one face image in a single thread on an i7 desktop CPU. VIPLFaceNet provides a
state-of-the-art start point for both academic and industrial face recognition
applications.

 <dc:description>  Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exploits the anisotropic diffusion
of water molecules in the brain to enable the estimation of the brain's
anatomical fiber tracts at a relatively high resolution. In particular,
tractographic methods can be used to generate whole-brain anatomical
connectivity matrix where each element provides an estimate of the connectivity
strength between the corresponding voxels. Structural brain networks are built
using the connectivity information and a predefined brain parcellation, where
the nodes of the network represent the brain regions and the edge weights
capture the connectivity strengths between the corresponding brain regions.
This paper introduces a number of novel scalable methods to generate and
analyze structural brain networks with a varying number of nodes. In
particular, we introduce a new parallel algorithm to quickly generate large
scale connectivity-based parcellations for which voxels in a region possess
highly similar connectivity patterns to the rest of the regions. We show that
the corresponding regional structural consistency is always superior to
randomly generated parcellations over a wide range of parcellation sizes.
Corresponding brain networks with a varying number of nodes are analyzed using
standard graph-theorectic measures, as well as, new measures derived from
spectral graph theory. Our results indicate increasingly more statistical power
of brain networks with larger numbers of nodes and the relatively unique shape
of the spectral profile of large brain networks relative to other well-known
networks.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were recently shown to provide
state-of-the-art results for object category viewpoint estimation. However
different ways of formulating this problem have been proposed and the competing
approaches have been explored with very different design choices. This paper
presents a comparison of these approaches in a unified setting as well as a
detailed analysis of the key factors that impact performance. Followingly, we
present a new joint training method with the detection task and demonstrate its
benefit. We also highlight the superiority of classification approaches over
regression approaches, quantify the benefits of deeper architectures and
extended training data, and demonstrate that synthetic data is beneficial even
when using ImageNet training data. By combining all these elements, we
demonstrate an improvement of approximately 5% mAVP over previous
state-of-the-art results on the Pascal3D+ dataset. In particular for their most
challenging 24 view classification task we improve the results from 31.1% to
36.1% mAVP.

 <dc:description>  Development of large computerized systems requires both combinational and
sequential circuits. Registers and counters are two important examples of
sequential circuits, which are widely used in practical applications like CPUs.
The basic element of sequential logic is Flip-Flop, which stores an input value
and returns two outputs (Q and Q_bar). This paper presents an innovative
ternary D Flip-Flap-Flop, which offers circuit designers to customize their
design by eliminating one of the outputs if it is not required. This unique
feature of the new design leads to considerable power reduction in comparison
with the previously presented structures. The proposed design is simulated and
tested by HSPICE and 45 nm CMOS technology.

 <dc:description>  Information theoretic measures (e.g. the Kullback Liebler divergence and
Shannon mutual information) have been used for exploring possibly nonlinear
multivariate dependencies in high dimension. If these dependencies are assumed
to follow a Markov factor graph model, this exploration process is called
structure discovery. For discrete-valued samples, estimates of the information
divergence over the parametric class of multinomial models lead to structure
discovery methods whose mean squared error achieves parametric convergence
rates as the sample size grows. However, a naive application of this method to
continuous nonparametric multivariate models converges much more slowly. In
this paper we introduce a new method for nonparametric structure discovery that
uses weighted ensemble divergence estimators that achieve parametric
convergence rates and obey an asymptotic central limit theorem that facilitates
hypothesis testing and other types of statistical validation.

 <dc:description>  Animals live in groups to defend against predation and to obtain food.
However, for some animals --- especially ones that spend long periods of time
feeding --- there are costs if a group chooses to move on before their
nutritional needs are satisfied. If the conflict between feeding and keeping up
with a group becomes too large, it may be advantageous to some animals to split
into subgroups of animals with similar nutritional needs. We model the costs
and benefits of splitting by a herd of cows using a cost function (CF) that
quantifies individual variation in hunger, desire to lie down, and predation
risk. We model the costs associated with hunger and lying desire as the
standard deviations of individuals within a group, and we model predation risk
as an inverse exponential function of group size. We minimize the cost function
over all plausible groups that can arise from a given herd and study the
dynamics of group splitting. We explore our model using two examples: (1) we
consider group switching and group fission in a herd of relatively homogeneous
cows; and (2) we examine a herd with an equal number of adult males (larger
animals) and adult females (smaller animals).

 <dc:description>  We apply a novel spectral graph technique, that of locally-biased
semi-supervised eigenvectors, to study the diversity of galaxies. This
technique permits us to characterize empirically the natural variations in
observed spectra data, and we illustrate how this approach can be used in an
exploratory manner to highlight both large-scale global as well as small-scale
local structure in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. We use this method in
a way that simultaneously takes into account the measurements of spectral lines
as well as the continuum shape. Unlike Principal Component Analysis, this
method does not assume that the Euclidean distance between galaxy spectra is a
good global measure of similarity between all spectra, but instead it only
assumes that local difference information between similar spectra is reliable.
Moreover, unlike other nonlinear dimensionality methods, this method can be
used to characterize very finely both small-scale local as well as large-scale
global properties of realistic noisy data. The power of the method is
demonstrated on the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample by illustrating that the derived
embeddings of spectra carry an unprecedented amount of information. By using a
straightforward global or unsupervised variant, we observe that the main
features correlate strongly with star formation rate and that they clearly
separate active galactic nuclei. Computed parameters of the method can be used
to describe line strengths and their interdependencies. By using a
locally-biased or semi-supervised variant, we are able to focus on typical
variations around specific objects of astronomical interest. We present several
examples illustrating that this approach can enable new discoveries in the data
as well as a detailed understanding of very fine local structure that would
otherwise be overwhelmed by large-scale noise and global trends in the data.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of fairly dividing a two-dimensional heterogeneous
resource among several agents with different preferences. Potential
applications include dividing land-estates among heirs, museum space among
presenters or space in print and electronic media among advertisers. Classic
cake-cutting procedures either consider a one-dimensional resource, or allocate
each agent a collection of disconnected pieces. In practice, however, the
two-dimensional shape of the allotted piece is of crucial importance in many
applications. For example, when building houses or designing advertisements, in
order to be useful, the allotments should be squares or rectangles with bounded
aspect-ratio. We thus introduce the problem of fair two-dimensional division
wherein the allocated piece must have a pre-specified geometric shape. We
present constructive cake-cutting procedures that satisfy the two most
prominent fairness criteria, namely envy-freeness and proportionality. In
scenarios where proportionality cannot be achieved due to the geometric
constraints, our procedures provide a partially-proportional division,
guaranteeing that the fraction allocated to each agent be at least a certain
positive constant. We prove that in many natural scenarios the envy-freeness
requirement is compatible with the best attainable partial-proportionality.

 <dc:title>A Holistic Approach for Predicting Links in Coevolving Multilayer

 <dc:description>  Networks extracted from social media platforms frequently include multiple
types of links that dynamically change over time; these links can be used to
represent dyadic interactions such as economic transactions, communications,
and shared activities. Organizing this data into a dynamic multiplex network,
where each layer is composed of a single edge type linking the same underlying
vertices, can reveal interesting cross-layer interaction patterns. In
coevolving networks, links in one layer result in an increased probability of
other types of links forming between the same node pair. Hence we believe that
a holistic approach in which all the layers are simultaneously considered can
outperform a factored approach in which link prediction is performed separately
in each layer. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework, MLP (Multilayer
Link Prediction), in which link existence likelihoods for the target layer are
learned from the other network layers. These likelihoods are used to reweight
the output of a single layer link prediction method that uses rank aggregation
to combine a set of topological metrics. Our experiments show that our
reweighting procedure outperforms other methods for fusing information across
network layers.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we provide a solution for posturing the anthropomorphic
Robonaut-2 hand and arm for grasping based on visual information. A mapping
from visual features extracted from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to
grasp points is learned. We demonstrate that a CNN pre-trained for image
classification can be applied to a grasping task based on a small set of
grasping examples. Our approach takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of
the CNN by identifying features that capture the hierarchical support relations
between filters in different CNN layers and locating their 3D positions by
tracing activations backwards in the CNN. When this backward trace terminates
in the RGB-D image, important manipulable structures are thereby localized.
These features that reside in different layers of the CNN are then associated
with controllers that engage different kinematic subchains in the hand/arm
system for grasping. A grasping dataset is collected using demonstrated
hand/object relationships for Robonaut-2 to evaluate the proposed approach in
terms of the precision of the resulting preshape postures. We demonstrate that
this approach outperforms baseline approaches in cluttered scenarios on the
grasping dataset and a point cloud based approach on a grasping task using
Robonaut-2.

 <dc:description>  Although temporal persistence, or permanence, is a well understood
requirement for optimal biometric features, there is no general agreement on
how to assess temporal persistence. We suggest that the best way to assess
temporal persistence is to perform a test-retest study, and assess test-retest
reliability. For ratio-scale features that are normally distributed, this is
best done using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). For 10 distinct
data sets (8 eye-movement related, and 2 gait related), we calculated the
test-retest reliability ('Temporal persistence') of each feature, and compared
biometric performance of high-ICC features to lower ICC features, and to the
set of all features. We demonstrate that using a subset of only high-ICC
features produced superior Rank-1-Identification Rate (Rank-1-IR) performance
in 9 of 10 databases (p = 0.01, one-tailed). For Equal Error Rate (EER), using
a subset of only high-ICC features produced superior performance in 8 of 10
databases (p = 0.055, one-tailed). In general, then, prescreening potential
biometric features, and choosing only highly reliable features will yield
better performance than lower ICC features or than the set of all features
combined. We hypothesize that this would likely be the case for any biometric
modality where the features can be expressed as quantitative values on an
interval or ratio scale, assuming an adequate number of relatively independent
features.

 <dc:description>  Inductive Matrix Completion (IMC) is an important class of matrix completion
problems that allows direct inclusion of available features to enhance
estimation capabilities. These models have found applications in personalized
recommendation systems, multilabel learning, dictionary learning, etc. This
paper examines a general class of noisy matrix completion tasks where the
underlying matrix is following an IMC model i.e., it is formed by a mixing
matrix (a priori unknown) sandwiched between two known feature matrices. The
mixing matrix here is assumed to be well approximated by the product of two
sparse matrices---referred here to as &quot;sparse factor models.&quot; We leverage the
main theorem of Soni:2016:NMC and extend it to provide theoretical error bounds
for the sparsity-regularized maximum likelihood estimators for the class of
problems discussed in this paper. The main result is general in the sense that
it can be used to derive error bounds for various noise models. In this paper,
we instantiate our main result for the case of Gaussian noise and provide
corresponding error bounds in terms of squared loss.

 <dc:description>  An important result from psycholinguistics (Griffiths &amp; Kalish, 2005) states
that no language can be learned iteratively by rational agents in a
self-sustaining manner. We show how to modify the learning process slightly in
order to achieve self-sustainability. Our work is in two parts. First, we
characterize iterated learnability in geometric terms and show how a slight,
steady increase in the lengths of the training sessions ensures
self-sustainability for any discrete language class. In the second part, we
tackle the nondiscrete case and investigate self-sustainability for iterated
linear regression. We discuss the implications of our findings to issues of
non-equilibrium dynamics in natural algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Efforts at understanding the computational processes in the brain have met
with limited success, despite their importance and potential uses in building
intelligent machines. We propose a simple new model which draws on recent
findings in Neuroscience and the Applied Mathematics of interacting Dynamical
Systems. The Feynman Machine is a Universal Computer for Dynamical Systems,
analogous to the Turing Machine for symbolic computing, but with several
important differences. We demonstrate that networks and hierarchies of simple
interacting Dynamical Systems, each adaptively learning to forecast its
evolution, are capable of automatically building sensorimotor models of the
external and internal world. We identify such networks in mammalian neocortex,
and show how existing theories of cortical computation combine with our model
to explain the power and flexibility of mammalian intelligence. These findings
lead directly to new architectures for machine intelligence. A suite of
software implementations has been built based on these principles, and applied
to a number of spatiotemporal learning tasks.

 <dc:description>  The attention mechanism is an important part of the neural machine
translation (NMT) where it was reported to produce richer source representation
compared to fixed-length encoding sequence-to-sequence models. Recently, the
effectiveness of attention has also been explored in the context of image
captioning. In this work, we assess the feasibility of a multimodal attention
mechanism that simultaneously focus over an image and its natural language
description for generating a description in another language. We train several
variants of our proposed attention mechanism on the Multi30k multilingual image
captioning dataset. We show that a dedicated attention for each modality
achieves up to 1.6 points in BLEU and METEOR compared to a textual NMT
baseline.

 <dc:description>  Accuracy, descriptor size, and the time required for extraction and matching
are all important factors when selecting local image descriptors. To optimize
over all these requirements, this paper presents a CUDA port for the recent
Learned Arrangement of Three Patches (LATCH) binary descriptors to the GPU
platform. The design of LATCH makes it well suited for GPU processing. Owing to
its small size and binary nature, the GPU can further be used to efficiently
match LATCH features. Taken together, this leads to breakneck descriptor
extraction and matching speeds. We evaluate the trade off between these speeds
and the quality of results in a feature matching intensive application. To this
end, we use our proposed CUDA LATCH (CLATCH) to recover structure from motion
(SfM), comparing 3D reconstructions and speed using different representations.
Our results show that CLATCH provides high quality 3D reconstructions at
fractions of the time required by other representations, with little, if any,
loss of reconstruction quality.

 <dc:title>A Generic Bet-and-run Strategy for Speeding Up Traveling Salesperson and

 <dc:description>  A common strategy for improving optimization algorithms is to restart the
algorithm when it is believed to be trapped in an inferior part of the search
space. However, while specific restart strategies have been developed for
specific problems (and specific algorithms), restarts are typically not
regarded as a general tool to speed up an optimization algorithm. In fact, many
optimization algorithms do not employ restarts at all.
  Recently, &quot;bet-and-run&quot; was introduced in the context of mixed-integer
programming, where first a number of short runs with randomized initial
conditions is made, and then the most promising run of these is continued. In
this article, we consider two classical NP-complete combinatorial optimization
problems, traveling salesperson and minimum vertex cover, and study the
effectiveness of different bet-and-run strategies. In particular, our restart
strategies do not take any problem knowledge into account, nor are tailored to
the optimization algorithm. Therefore, they can be used off-the-shelf. We
observe that state-of-the-art solvers for these problems can benefit
significantly from restarts on standard benchmark instances.

based on individual agents and firms, works. Thus, it aims to be an usage
manual for those wishing to use SEAL or SEAL's results. As a reference work,
theoretical and research studies are only cited. SEAL is thought as a Lab that
enables the simulation of the economy with spatially bounded
microeconomic-based computational agents. Part of the novelty of SEAL comes
from the possibility of simulating the economy in space and the instantiation
of different public offices, i.e. government institutions, with embedded
markets and actual data. SEAL is designed for Public Policy analysis,
specifically those related to Public Finance, Taxes and Real Estate.

 <dc:description>  Due to hybridization events in evolution, studying two different genes of a
set of species may yield two related but different phylogenetic trees for the
set of species. In this case, we want to measure the dissimilarity of the two
trees. The rooted subtree prune and regraft (rSPR) distance of the two trees
has been used for this purpose. The problem of computing the rSPR distance of
two given trees has many applications but is unfortunately NP-hard. The
previously best approximation algorithm for rSPR distance achieves a ratio of
2.5 and it was open whether a better approximation algorithm for rSPR distance
exists. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting
a cubic-time approximation algorithm for rSPR distance that achieves a ratio of
2. Our algorithm is based on the new notion of key and a number of new
structural lemmas. The algorithm is fairly simple and the proof of its
correctness is intuitively understandable albeit complicated.

 <dc:description>  We revisit the problem of designing optimal, individually rational matching
mechanisms (in a general sense, allowing for cycles in directed graphs), where
each player --- who is associated with a subset of vertices --- matches as many
of his own vertices when he opts into the matching mechanism as when he opts
out. We offer a new perspective on this problem by considering an arbitrary
graph, but assuming that vertices are associated with players at random. Our
main result asserts that, under certain conditions, any fixed optimal matching
is likely to be individually rational up to lower-order terms. We also show
that a simple and practical mechanism is (fully) individually rational, and
likely to be optimal up to lower-order terms. We discuss the implications of
our results for market design in general, and kidney exchange in particular.

 <dc:description>  The arrival of small-scale distributed energy generation in the future smart
grid has led to the emergence of so-called prosumers, who can both consume as
well as produce energy. By using local generation from renewable energy
resources, the stress on power generation and supply system can be
significantly reduced during high demand periods. However, this also creates a
significant challenge for conventional power plants that suddenly need to ramp
up quickly when the renewable energy drops off. In this paper, we propose an
energy consumption scheduling problem for prosumers to minimize the peak ramp
of the system. The optimal schedule of prosumers can be obtained by solving the
centralized optimization problem. However, due to the privacy concerns and the
distributed topology of the power system, the centralized design is difficult
to implement in practice. Therefore, we propose the distributed algorithms to
efficiently solve the centralized problem using the alternating direction
method of multiplier (ADMM), in which each prosumer independently schedules its
energy consumption profile. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence
performance of the proposed algorithms as well as the capability of our model
in reducing the peak ramp of the system.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) systems are designed and developed either as
standalone applications from the ground-up or with the help of IoT middleware
platforms. They are designed to support different kinds of scenarios, such as
smart homes and smart cities. Thus far, privacy concerns have not been
explicitly considered by IoT applications and middleware platforms. This is
partly due to the lack of systematic methods for designing privacy that can
guide the software development process in IoT. In this paper, we propose a set

privacy capabilities and gaps of existing IoT applications as well as

platforms, namely OpenIoT and Eclipse SmartHome, to demonstrate how our
framework can be used in this way.

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted substantial research interest,
especially in the context of performing monitoring and surveillance tasks.
However, it is challenging to strike compelling trade-offs amongst the various
conflicting optimization criteria, such as the network's energy dissipation,
packet-loss rate, coverage and lifetime. This paper provides a tutorial and
survey of recent research and development efforts addressing this issue by
using the technique of multi-objective optimization (MOO). First, we provide an
overview of the main optimization objectives used in WSNs. Then, we elaborate
on various prevalent approaches conceived for MOO, such as the family of
mathematical programming based scalarization methods, the family of
heuristics/metaheuristics based optimization algorithms, and a variety of other
advanced optimization techniques. Furthermore, we summarize a range of recent
studies of MOO in the context of WSNs, which are intended to provide useful
guidelines for researchers to understand the referenced literature. Finally, we
discuss a range of open problems to be tackled by future research.

 <dc:description>  This is a review of Susan Greenfield's 2015 book 'Mind Change: How Digital
Technologies Are Leaving Their Mark On Our Brains'. Greenfield is a
neuroscientist and a member of the UK House of Lords, who argues that digital
technologies are changing the human environment &quot;in an unprecedented way,&quot; and
that by adapting to this environment, &quot;the brain may also be changing in an
unprecedented way.&quot; The book and its author have created a surprising amount of
controversy. I discuss both Greenfield's book and a prominent critique by Bell
et al. (2015). The exchange points to some flaws in Greenfield's argument and
represents an interesting debate about the public role of scientists, but it
does not undermine the value of the book as a springboard for discussions about
possible policies and future research.

 <dc:title>Single-image RGB Photometric Stereo With Spatially-varying Albedo</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a single-shot system to recover surface geometry of objects with
spatially-varying albedos, from images captured under a calibrated RGB
photometric stereo setup---with three light directions multiplexed across
different color channels in the observed RGB image. Since the problem is
ill-posed point-wise, we assume that the albedo map can be modeled as
piece-wise constant with a restricted number of distinct albedo values. We show
that under ideal conditions, the shape of a non-degenerate local constant
albedo surface patch can theoretically be recovered exactly. Moreover, we
present a practical and efficient algorithm that uses this model to robustly
recover shape from real images. Our method first reasons about shape locally in
a dense set of patches in the observed image, producing shape distributions for
every patch. These local distributions are then combined to produce a single
consistent surface normal map. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach
through experiments on both synthetic renderings as well as real captured
images.

group, and $R={\rm GR}(p^2,m)$ be a Galois ring of characteristic $p^2$ and

$R[D_{2n}]$ are called left dihedral codes over $R$ of length $2n$, and
abbreviated as left $D_{2n}$-codes over $R$. Let ${\rm gcd}(n,p)=1$ in this

direct sum of concatenated codes with inner codes ${\cal A}_i$ and outer codes
$C_i$, where ${\cal A}_i$ is a cyclic code over $R$ of length $n$ and $C_i$ is
a skew cyclic code of length $2$ over an extension Galois ring or principal
ideal ring of $R$, and a generator matrix and basic parameters for each outer

obtained, the dual code for each left $D_{2n}$-code is determined and all
self-dual left $D_{2n}$-codes and self-orthogonal left $D_{2n}$-codes over $R$
are presented, respectively.

 <dc:title>Partial Solvers for Parity Games: Effective Polynomial-Time Composition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ah-Fat, Patrick</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Partial methods play an important role in formal methods and beyond. Recently
such methods were developed for parity games, where polynomial-time partial
solvers decide the winners of a subset of nodes. We investigate here how
effective polynomial-time partial solvers can be by studying interactions of
partial solvers based on generic composition patterns that preserve
polynomial-time computability. We show that use of such composition patterns
discovers new partial solvers - including those that merge node sets that have
the same but unknown winner - by studying games that composed partial solvers
can neither solve nor simplify. We experimentally validate that this
data-driven approach to refinement leads to polynomial-time partial solvers
that can solve all standard benchmarks of structured games. For one of these
polynomial-time partial solvers not even a sole random game from a few billion
random games of varying configuration was found that it won't solve completely.

 <dc:description>  Relation-changing modal logics are extensions of the basic modal logic that
allow changes to the accessibility relation of a model during the evaluation of
a formula. In particular, they are equipped with dynamic modalities that are
able to delete, add, and swap edges in the model, both locally and globally. We
provide translations from these logics to hybrid logic along with an
implementation. In general, these logics are undecidable, but we use our
translations to identify decidable fragments. We also compare the expressive
power of relation-changing modal logics with hybrid logics.

 <dc:description>  Parity games are two-player infinite-duration games on graphs that play a
crucial role in various fields of theoretical computer science. Finding
efficient algorithms to solve these games in practice is widely acknowledged as
a core problem in formal verification, as it leads to efficient solutions of
the model-checking and satisfiability problems of expressive temporal logics,
e.g., the modal muCalculus. Their solution can be reduced to the problem of
identifying sets of positions of the game, called dominions, in each of which a
player can force a win by remaining in the set forever. Recently, a novel
technique to compute dominions, called priority promotion, has been proposed,
which is based on the notions of quasi dominion, a relaxed form of dominion,
and dominion space. The underlying framework is general enough to accommodate
different instantiations of the solution procedure, whose correctness is
ensured by the nature of the space itself. In this paper we propose a new such
instantiation, called delayed promotion, that tries to reduce the possible
exponential behaviours exhibited by the original method in the worst case. The
resulting procedure not only often outperforms the original priority promotion
approach, but so far no exponential worst case is known.

 <dc:description>  Topological fixpoint logics are a family of logics that admits topological
models and where the fixpoint operators are defined with respect to the
topological interpretations. Here we consider a topological fixpoint logic for
relational structures based on Stone spaces, where the fixpoint operators are
interpreted via clopen sets. We develop a game-theoretic semantics for this
logic. First we introduce games characterising clopen fixpoints of monotone
operators on Stone spaces. These fixpoint games allow us to characterise the
semantics for our topological fixpoint logic using a two-player graph game.
Adequacy of this game is the main result of our paper. Finally, we define
bisimulations for the topological structures under consideration and use our
game semantics to prove that the truth of a formula of our topological fixpoint
logic is bisimulation-invariant.

 <dc:description>  We study the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in concurrent games
played on graphs. While existence is guaranteed with safety objectives for each
player, Nash equilibria need not exist when players are given arbitrary
terminal-reward objectives, and their existence is undecidable with qualitative
reachability objectives (and only three players). However, these results rely
on the fact that the players can enforce infinite plays while trying to improve
their payoffs. In this paper, we introduce a relaxed notion of equilibria,
where deviations are imprecise. We prove that contrary to Nash equilibria, such
(stationary) equilibria always exist, and we develop a PSPACE algorithm to
compute one.

 <dc:description>  In the plethora of fragments of Halpern and Shoham's modal logic of time
intervals (HS), the logic AB of Allen's relations Meets and Started-by is at a
central position. Statements that may be true at certain intervals, but at no
sub-interval of them, such as accomplishments, as well as metric constraints
about the length of intervals, that force, for instance, an interval to be at
least (resp., at most, exactly) k points long, can be expressed in AB.
Moreover, over the linear order of the natural numbers N, it subsumes the
(point-based) logic LTL, as it can easily encode the next and until modalities.
Finally, it is expressive enough to capture the {\omega}-regular languages,
that is, for each {\omega}-regular expression R there exists an AB formula
{\phi} such that the language defined by R coincides with the set of models of
{\phi} over N. It has been shown that the satisfiability problem for AB over N
is EXPSPACE-complete. Here we prove that, under the homogeneity assumption, its
model checking problem is {\Delta}^p_2 = P^NP-complete (for the sake of
comparison, the model checking problem for full HS is EXPSPACE-hard, and the
only known decision procedure is nonelementary). Moreover, we show that the
modality for the Allen relation Met-by can be added to AB at no extra cost
(AA'B is P^NP-complete as well).

 <dc:description>  Modal logic is a paradigm for several useful and applicable formal systems in
computer science. It generally retains the low complexity of classical
propositional logic, but notable exceptions exist in the domains of
description, temporal, and spatial logic, where the most expressive formalisms
have a very high complexity or are even undecidable. In search of
computationally well-behaved fragments, clausal forms and other
sub-propositional restrictions of temporal and description logics have been
recently studied. This renewed interest on sub-propositional logics, which
mainly focus on the complexity of the various fragments, raise natural
questions on their the relative expressive power, which we try to answer here
for the basic multi-modal logic Kn. We consider the Horn and the Krom
restrictions, as well as the combined restriction (known as the core fragment)
of modal logic, and, orthogonally, the fragments that emerge by disallowing
boxes or diamonds from positive literals. We study the problem in a very
general setting, to ease transferring our results to other meaningful cases.

 <dc:title>Alternation Is Strict For Higher-Order Modal Fixpoint Logic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bruse, Florian</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  We study the expressive power of Alternating Parity Krivine Automata (APKA),
which provide operational semantics to Higher-Order Modal Fixpoint Logic (HFL).
APKA consist of ordinary parity automata extended by a variation of the Krivine
Abstract Machine. We show that the number and parity of priorities available to
an APKA form a proper hierarchy of expressive power as in the modal
mu-calculus. This also induces a strict alternation hierarchy on HFL. The proof
follows Arnold's (1999) encoding of runs into trees and subsequent use of the
Banach Fixpoint Theorem.

 <dc:description>  We study the axiomatisability of the iteration-free fragment of Propositional
Dynamic Logic with Intersection and Tests. The combination of program
composition, intersection and tests makes its proof-theory rather difficult. We
develop a normal form for formulae which minimises the interaction between
these operators, as well as a refined canonical model construction. From these
we derive an axiom system and a proof of its strong completeness.

 <dc:title>Weighted Linear Dynamic Logic</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a weighted linear dynamic logic (weighted LDL for short) and
show the expressive equivalence of its formulas to weighted rational
expressions. This adds a new characterization for recognizable series to the
fundamental Sch\&quot;utzenberger theorem. Surprisingly, the equivalence does not
require any restriction to our weighted LDL. Our results hold over arbitrary
(resp. totally complete) semirings for finite (resp. infinite) words. As a
consequence, the equivalence problem for weighted LDL formulas over fields is
decidable in doubly exponential time. In contrast to classical logics, we show
that our weighted LDL is expressively incomparable to weighted LTL for finite
words. We determine a fragment of the weighted LTL such that series over finite
and infinite words definable by LTL formulas in this fragment are definable
also by weighted LDL formulas.

 <dc:description>  Temporal logic is a very powerful formalism deeply investigated and used in
formal system design and verification. Its application usually reduces to
solving specific decision problems such as model checking and satisfiability.
In these kind of problems, the solution often requires detecting some specific
properties over cycles. For instance, this happens when using classic
techniques based on automata, game-theory, SCC decomposition, and the like.
Surprisingly, no temporal logics have been considered so far with the explicit
ability of talking about cycles.
  In this paper we introduce Cycle-CTL*, an extension of the classical
branching-time temporal logic CTL* along with cycle quantifications in order to
predicate over cycles. This logic turns out to be very expressive. Indeed, we
prove that it strictly extends CTL* and is orthogonal to mu-calculus. We also
give an evidence of its usefulness by providing few examples involving
non-regular properties.
  We investigate the model checking problem for Cycle-CTL* and show that it is
PSPACE-Complete as for CTL*. We also study the satisfiability problem for the
existential-cycle fragment of the logic and show that it is solvable in
2ExpTime. This result makes use of an automata-theoretic approach along with
novel ad-hoc definitions of bisimulation and tree-like unwinding.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an underapproximation for context-free languages by filtering out
runs of the underlying pushdown automaton depending on how the stack height
evolves over time. In particular, we assign to each run a number quantifying
the oscillating behavior of the stack along the run. We study languages
accepted by pushdown automata restricted to k-oscillating runs. We relate
oscillation on pushdown automata with a counterpart restriction on context-free
grammars. We also provide a way to filter all but the k-oscillating runs from a
given PDA by annotating stack symbols with information about the oscillation.
Finally, we study closure properties of the defined class of languages and the
complexity of the k-emptiness problem asking, given a pushdown automaton P and
k &gt;= 0, whether P has a k-oscillating run. We show that, when k is not part of
the input, the k-emptiness problem is NLOGSPACE-complete.

of view. First we introduce alternating dependency quantified boolean formulae
(ADQBF) which generalize both quantified and dependency quantified boolean
formulae. We show that the truth evaluation for ADQBF is
AEXPTIME(poly)-complete. We also identify fragments for which the problem is
complete for the levels of the exponential hierarchy. Second we study
propositional team-based logics. We show that DQBF formulae correspond
naturally to quantified propositional dependence logic and present a general
NEXPTIME upper bound for quantified propositional logic with a large class of
generalized dependence atoms. Moreover we show AEXPTIME(poly)-completeness for
extensions of propositional team logic with generalized dependence atoms.

B\&quot;uchi automata in which the choices made by Spoiler can be buffered by
Duplicator in several buffers before she executes them on her structure. We
show that the simulation games are useful to approximate the inclusion of trace
closures of languages accepted by finite-state automata, which is known to be
undecidable. We study the decidability and complexity and show that the game
with bounded buffers can be decided in polynomial time, whereas the game with
one unbounded and one bounded buffer is highly undecidable. We also show some
sufficient conditions on the automata for Duplicator to win the game (with
unbounded buffers).

 <dc:title>A Semi-Potential for Finite and Infinite Sequential Games (Extended
  Abstract)</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a dynamical approach to sequential games. By restricting the
convertibility relation over strategy profiles, we obtain a semi-potential (in
the sense of Kukushkin), and we show that in finite games the corresponding
restriction of better-response dynamics will converge to a Nash equilibrium in
quadratic time. Convergence happens on a per-player basis, and even in the
presence of players with cyclic preferences, the players with acyclic
preferences will stabilize. Thus, we obtain a candidate notion for rationality
in the presence of irrational agents. Moreover, the restriction of
convertibility can be justified by a conservative updating of beliefs about the
other players strategies.
  For infinite sequential games we can retain convergence to a Nash equilibrium
(in some sense), if the preferences are given by continuous payoff functions;
or obtain a transfinite convergence if the outcome sets of the game are
Delta^0_2 sets.

 <dc:description>  Different theorem provers tend to produce proof objects in different formats
and this is especially the case for modal logics, where several deductive
formalisms (and provers based on them) have been presented. This work falls
within the general project of establishing a common specification language in
order to certify proofs given in a wide range of deductive formalisms. In
particular, by using a translation from the modal language into a first-order
polarized language and a checker whose small kernel is based on a classical
focused sequent calculus, we are able to certify modal proofs given in labeled
sequent calculi, prefixed tableaux and free-variable prefixed tableaux. We
describe the general method for the logic K, present its implementation in a
prolog-like language, provide some examples and discuss how to extend the
approach to other normal modal logics

 <dc:description>  We introduce p-equivalence by asymptotic probabilities, which is a weak
almost-equivalence based on zero-one laws in finite model theory. In this
paper, we consider the computational complexities of p-equivalence problems for
regular languages and provide the following details. First, we give an
robustness of p-equivalence and a logical characterization for p-equivalence.
The characterization is useful to generate some algorithms for p-equivalence
problems by coupling with standard results from descriptive complexity. Second,
we give the computational complexities for the p-equivalence problems by the
logical characterization. The computational complexities are the same as for
the (fully) equivalence problems. Finally, we apply the proofs for
p-equivalence to some generalized equivalences.

 <dc:title>A New Rule for LTL Tableaux</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reynolds, Mark</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Propositional linear time temporal logic (LTL) is the standard temporal logic
for computing applications and many reasoning techniques and tools have been
developed for it. Tableaux for deciding satisfiability have existed since the
1980s. However, the tableaux for this logic do not look like traditional
tree-shaped tableau systems and their processing is often quite complicated.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel style of tableau rule which supports a
new simple traditional-style tree-shaped tableau for LTL. We prove that it is
sound and complete. As well as being simple to understand, to introduce to
students and to use, it is also simple to implement and is competitive against
state of the art systems. It is particularly suitable for parallel
implementations.

 <dc:description>  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nowadays serves as an important modality for
diagnostic and therapeutic guidance in clinics. However, the {\it slow
acquisition} process, the dynamic deformation of organs, as well as the need
for {\it real-time} reconstruction, pose major challenges toward obtaining
artifact-free images. To cope with these challenges, the present paper
advocates a novel subspace learning framework that permeates benefits from
parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition of tensors (multiway data) to low-rank
modeling of temporal sequence of images. Treating images as multiway data
arrays, the novel method preserves spatial structures and unravels the latent
correlations across various dimensions by means of the tensor subspace.
Leveraging the spatio-temporal correlation of images, Tykhonov regularization
is adopted as a rank surrogate for a least-squares optimization program.
Alteranating majorization minimization is adopted to develop online algorithms
that recursively procure the reconstruction upon arrival of a new undersampled
$k$-space frame. The developed algorithms are {\it provably convergent} and
highly {\it parallelizable} with lightweight FFT tasks per iteration. To
further accelerate the acquisition process, randomized subsampling policies are
devised that leverage intermediate estimates of the tensor subspace, offered by
the online scheme, to {\it randomly} acquire {\it informative} $k$-space
samples. In a nutshell, the novel approach enables tracking motion dynamics
under low acquisition rates `on the fly.' GPU-based tests with real {\it in
vivo} MRI datasets of cardiac cine images corroborate the merits of the novel
approach relative to state-of-the-art alternatives.

 <dc:title>A joint-optimization NSAF algorithm based on the first-order Markov

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, the normalized subband adaptive filter (NSAF) algorithm has
attracted much attention for handling the colored input signals. Based on the
first-order Markov model of the optimal tap-weight vector, this paper provides
a convergence analysis of the standard NSAF. Following the analysis, both the
step size and the regularization parameter in the NSAF are jointly optimized in
such a way that minimizes the mean square deviation. The resulting
joint-optimization step size and regularization parameter (JOSR-NSAF) algorithm
achieves a good tradeoff between fast convergence rate and low steady-state
error. Simulation results in the context of acoustic echo cancellation
demonstrate good features of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:title>Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks with A Mathematical Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kuo, C. -C. Jay</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work attempts to address two fundamental questions about the structure
of the convolutional neural networks (CNN): 1) why a non-linear activation
function is essential at the filter output of every convolutional layer? 2)
what is the advantage of the two-layer cascade system over the one-layer
system? A mathematical model called the &quot;REctified-COrrelations on a Sphere&quot;
(RECOS) is proposed to answer these two questions. After the CNN training
process, the converged filter weights define a set of anchor vectors in the
RECOS model. Anchor vectors represent the frequently occurring patterns (or the
spectral components). The necessity of rectification is explained using the
RECOS model. Then, the behavior of a two-layer RECOS system is analyzed and
compared with its one-layer counterpart. The LeNet-5 and the MNIST dataset are
used to illustrate discussion points. Finally, the RECOS model is generalized
to a multi-layer system with the AlexNet as an example.
  Keywords: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Nonlinear Activation, RECOS
Model, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), MNIST Dataset.

 <dc:title>Design of a High-Performance High-Pass Generalized Integrator Based
  Single-Phase PLL</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kulkarni, Abhijit</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>John, Vinod</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Grid-interactive power converters are normally synchronized to the grid using
phase-locked loops (PLLs). The performance of the PLLs is affected by the
non-ideal conditions in the sensed grid voltage such as harmonics, frequency
deviations and dc offsets in single-phase systems. In this paper, a
single-phase PLL is presented to mitigate the effects of these non-idealities.
This PLL is based on the popular second order generalized integrator (SOGI)
structure. The SOGI structure is modified to eliminate of the effects of input
dc offsets. The resulting SOGI structure has a high-pass filtering property.
Hence, this PLL is termed as high-pass generalized integrator based PLL
(HGI-PLL). It has fixed parameters which reduces the implementation complexity
and aids in the implementation in low-end digital controllers. The HGI-PLL is
shown to have least resource utilization among the SOGI based PLLs with dc
cancelling capability. Systematic design methods are evolved leading to the
design that limits the unit vector THD to within 1% for given non-ideal input
conditions in terms of frequency deviation and harmonic distortion. The
proposed designs achieve the fastest transient response. The performance of
this PLL has been verified experimentally. The results are found to agree with
the theoretical prediction.

 <dc:title>Joint Gender Classification and Age Estimation by Nearly Orthogonalizing
  Their Semantic Spaces</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tian, Qing</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Songcan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In human face-based biometrics, gender classification and age estimation are
two typical learning tasks. Although a variety of approaches have been proposed
to handle them, just a few of them are solved jointly, even so, these joint
methods do not yet specifically concern the semantic difference between human
gender and age, which is intuitively helpful for joint learning, consequently
leaving us a room of further improving the performance. To this end, in this
work we firstly propose a general learning framework for jointly estimating
human gender and age by specially attempting to formulate such semantic
relationships as a form of near-orthogonality regularization and then
incorporate it into the objective of the joint learning framework. In order to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we exemplify it by
respectively taking the widely used binary-class SVM for gender classification,
and two threshold-based ordinal regression methods (i.e., the discriminant
learning for ordinal regression and support vector ordinal regression) for age
estimation, and crucially coupling both through the proposed semantic
formulation. Moreover, we develop its kernelized nonlinear counterpart by
deriving a representer theorem for the joint learning strategy. Finally,
through extensive experiments on three aging datasets FG-NET, Morph Album I and
Morph Album II, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed joint learning strategy.

 <dc:description>  Despite the ubiquity of transportation data, methods to infer the state
parameters of a network either ignore sensitivity of route decisions, require
route enumeration for parameterizing descriptive models of route selection, or
require complex bilevel models of route assignment behavior. These limitations
prevent modelers from fully exploiting ubiquitous data in monitoring
transportation networks. Inverse optimization methods that capture network
route choice behavior can address this gap, but they are designed to take
observations of the same model to learn the parameters of that model, which is
statistically inefficient (e.g. requires estimating population route and link
flows). New inverse optimization models and supporting algorithms are proposed
to learn the parameters of heterogeneous travelers' route behavior to infer
shared network state parameters (e.g. link capacity dual prices). The inferred
values are consistent with observations of each agent's optimization behavior.
We prove that the method can obtain unique dual prices for a network shared by
these agents in polynomial time. Four experiments are conducted. The first one,
conducted on a 4-node network, verifies the methodology to obtain heterogeneous
link cost parameters even when multinomial or mixed logit models would not be
meaningfully estimated. The second is a parameter recovery test on the
Nguyen-Dupuis network that shows that unique latent link capacity dual prices
can be inferred using the proposed method. The third test on the same network
demonstrates how a monitoring system in an online learning environment can be
designed using this method. The last test demonstrates this learning on real
data obtained from a freeway network in Queens, New York, using only real-time
Google Maps queries.

 <dc:description>  We develop a privatised stochastic variational inference method for Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The iterative nature of stochastic variational
inference presents challenges: multiple iterations are required to obtain
accurate posterior distributions, yet each iteration increases the amount of
noise that must be added to achieve a reasonable degree of privacy. We propose
a practical algorithm that overcomes this challenge by combining: (1) A relaxed
notion of the differential privacy, called concentrated differential privacy,
which provides high probability bounds for cumulative privacy loss, which is
well suited for iterative algorithms, rather than focusing on single-query
loss; and (2) Privacy amplification resulting from subsampling of large-scale
data. Focusing on conjugate exponential family models, in our private
variational inference, all the posterior distributions will be privatised by
simply perturbing expected sufficient statistics. Using Wikipedia data, we
illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for large-scale data.

 <dc:description>  Two-way communication is a key feature in a smart grid. It is enabled by
either powerline communication or wireless communication technologies.
Utilizing both technologies can potentially enhance communication reliability,
and many diversity combining schemes have been proposed. In this paper, we
propose a flexible real-time testbed to evaluate diversity combining schemes
over physical channels. The testbed provides essential parts of physical layers
on which both powerline and wireless communications operate. The contributions
of this paper are 1) design and implementation of a real-time testbed for
diversity of simultaneous powerline and wireless communications, 2) release of
the setup information and complete source code for the testbed, and 3)
performance evaluation of maximal ratio combining (MRC) on the testbed. As
initial results, we show that performance of MRC from measurements obtained on
the testbed over physical channels is very close to that in simulations in
various test cases under a controlled laboratory environment.

 <dc:description>  The necessity of maintaining a robust antiterrorist task force has become
imperative in recent times with resurgence of rogue element in the society. A
well equipped combat force warrants the safety and security of citizens and the
integrity of the sovereign state. In this paper we propose a novel
teleoperating robot which can play a major role in combat, rescue and
reconnaissance missions by substantially reducing loss of human soldiers in
such hostile environments. The proposed robotic solution consists of an
unmanned ground vehicle equipped with an IP camera visual system broadcasting
real-time video data to a remote cloud server. With the advancement in machine
learning algorithms in the field of computer vision, we incorporate state of
the art deep convolutional neural networks to identify and predict individuals
with malevolent intent. The classification is performed on every frame of the
video stream by the trained network in the cloud server. The predicted output
of the network is overlaid on the video stream with specific colour marks and
prediction percentage. Finally the data is resized into half-side by side
format and streamed to the head mount display worn by the human controller
which facilitates first person view of the scenario. The ground vehicle is also
coupled with an unmanned aerial vehicle for aerial surveillance. The proposed
scheme is an assistive system and the final decision evidently lies with the
human handler.

 <dc:description>  The third edition of the &quot;international - Traveling Workshop on Interactions
between Sparse models and Technology&quot; (iTWIST) took place in Aalborg, the 4th
largest city in Denmark situated beautifully in the northern part of the
country, from the 24th to 26th of August 2016. The workshop venue was at the
Aalborg University campus. One implicit objective of this biennial workshop is

 <dc:description>  Geographic routing is a routing paradigm, which uses geographic coordinates
of network nodes to determine routes. Greedy routing, the simplest form of
geographic routing forwards a packet to the closest neighbor towards the
destination. A greedy embedding is a embedding of a graph on a geometric space
such that greedy routing always guarantees delivery. A Schnyder drawing is a
classical way to draw a planar graph. In this manuscript, we show that every
Schnyder drawing is a greedy embedding, based on a generalized definition of
greedy routing.

 <dc:description>  We consider the model checking problem of infinite state systems given in the
form of parameterized discrete timed networks with multiple clocks. We show
that this problem is decidable with respect to specifications given by B- or
S-automata. Such specifications are very expressive (they strictly subsume
omega-regular specifications), and easily express complex liveness and safety
properties. Our results are obtained by modeling the passage of time using
symmetric broadcast, and by solving the model checking problem of parameterized
systems of un-timed processes communicating using k-wise rendezvous and
symmetric broadcast. Our decidability proof makes use of automata theory,
rational linear programming, and geometric reasoning for solving certain
reachability questions in vector addition systems; we believe these proof
techniques will be useful in solving related problems.

 <dc:title>A Scaling Analysis of a Star Network with Logarithmic Weights</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The paper investigates the properties of a class of resource allocation
algorithms for communication networks: if a node of this network has $x$
requests to transmit, then it receives a fraction of the capacity proportional
to $\log(1{+}L)$, the logarithm of its current load $L$. A stochastic model of
such an algorithm is investigated in the case of the star network, in which $J$
nodes can transmit simultaneously, but interfere with a central node $0$ in
such a way that node $0$ cannot transmit while one of the other nodes does. One
studies the impact of the log policy on these $J+1$ interacting communication
nodes. A fluid scaling analysis of the network is derived with the scaling
parameter $N$ being the norm of the initial state. It is shown that the
asymptotic fluid behaviour of the system is a consequence of the evolution of
the state of the network on a specific time scale $(N^t,\, t{\in}(0,1))$. The
main result is that, on this time scale and under appropriate conditions, the
state of a node with index $j\geq 1$ is of the order of $N^{a_j(t)}$, with
$0{\leq}a_j(t){&lt;}1$, where $t\mapsto a_j(t)$ is a piecewise linear function.
Convergence results on the fluid time scale and a stability property are
derived as a consequence of this study.

 <dc:description>  The attention mechanisim is appealing for neural machine translation, since
it is able to dynam- ically encode a source sentence by generating a alignment
between a target word and source words. Unfortunately, it has been proved to be
worse than conventional alignment models in aligment accuracy. In this paper,
we analyze and explain this issue from the point view of re- ordering, and
propose a supervised attention which is learned with guidance from conventional
alignment models. Experiments on two Chinese-to-English translation tasks show
that the super- vised attention mechanism yields better alignments leading to
substantial gains over the standard attention based NMT.

 <dc:title>Optimal Representations for Adaptive Streaming in Interactive Multi-View
  Video Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Toni, Laura</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Frossard, Pascal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Interactive multi-view video streaming (IMVS) services permit to remotely
immerse within a 3D scene. This is possible by transmitting a set of reference
camera views (anchor views), which are used by the clients to freely navigate
in the scene and possibly synthesize additional viewpoints of interest. From a
networking perspective, the big challenge in IMVS systems is to deliver to each
client the best set of anchor views that maximizes the navigation quality,
minimizes the view-switching delay and yet satisfies the network constraints.
Integrating adaptive streaming solutions in free-viewpoint systems offers a
promising solution to deploy IMVS in large and heterogeneous scenarios, as long
as the multi-view video representations on the server are properly selected. We
therefore propose to optimize the multi-view data at the server by minimizing
the overall resource requirements, yet offering a good navigation quality to
the different users. We propose a video representation set optimization for
multiview adaptive streaming systems and we show that it is NP-hard. We
therefore introduce the concept of multi-view navigation segment that permits
to cast the video representation set selection as an integer linear programming
problem with a bounded computational complexity. We then show that the proposed
solution reduces the computational complexity while preserving optimality in
most of the 3D scenes. We then provide simulation results for different classes
of users and show the gain offered by an optimal multi-view video
representation selection compared to recommended representation sets (e.g.,
Netflix and Apple ones) or to a baseline representation selection algorithm
where the encoding parameters are decided a priori for all the views.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a generic plug-and-play controller that ensures
fair and efficient operation of IEEE~802.11 infrastructure wireless local area
networks with multiple co-channel access points, without any change to
hardware/firmware of the network devices. Our controller addresses performance
issues of TCP transfers in multi-AP WLANs, by overlaying a coarse time-slicing
scheduler on top of a cascaded fair queuing scheduler. The time slices and
queue weights, used in our controller, are obtained from the solution of a
constrained utility optimization formulation. A study of the impact of coarse
time-slicing on TCP is also presented in this paper. We present an improved
algorithm for adaptation of the service rate of the fair queuing scheduler and
provide experimental results to illustrate its efficacy. We also present the
changes that need to be incorporated to the proposed approach, to handle
short-lived and interactive TCP flows. Finally, we report the results of
experiments performed on a real testbed, demonstrating the efficacy of our
controller.

 <dc:description>  We present the Waterfilling circuit selection method, which we designed in
order to mitigate the risks of a successful end-to-end traffic correlation
attack. Waterfilling proceeds by balancing the Tor network load as evenly as
possible on endpoints of user paths. We simulate the use of Waterfilling thanks
to the TorPS and Shadow tools. Applying several security metrics, we show that
the adoption of Waterfilling considerably increases the number of nodes that an
adversary needs to control in order to be able to mount a successful attack,
while somewhat decreasing the minimum amount of bandwidth required to do so.
Moreover, we evaluate Waterfilling into Shadow and show that it does not impact
significantly the performance of the network. Furthermore, Waterfilling reduces
the benefits that an attacker could obtain by hacking into a top bandwidth Tor
relay, hence limiting the risks raised by such relays.

 <dc:description>  Higher-level cognition depends on the ability to learn models of the world.
We can characterize this at the computational level as a structure-learning
problem with the goal of best identifying the prevailing causal relationships
among a set of relata. However, the computational cost of performing exact
Bayesian inference over causal models grows rapidly as the number of relata
increases. This implies that the cognitive processes underlying causal learning
must be substantially approximate. A powerful class of approximations that
focuses on the sequential absorption of successive inputs is captured by the
Neurath's ship metaphor in philosophy of science, where theory change is cast
as a stochastic and gradual process shaped as much by people's limited
willingness to abandon their current theory when considering alternatives as by
the ground truth they hope to approach. Inspired by this metaphor and by
algorithms for approximating Bayesian inference in machine learning, we propose
an algorithmic-level model of causal structure learning under which learners
represent only a single global hypothesis that they update locally as they
gather evidence. We propose a related scheme for understanding how, under these
limitations, learners choose informative interventions that manipulate the
causal system to help elucidate its workings. We find support for our approach
in the analysis of four experiments.

 <dc:description>  Statistical characteristics of network traffic have attracted a significant
amount of research for automated network intrusion detection, some of which
looked at applications of natural statistical laws such as Zipf's law,
Benford's law and the Pareto distribution. In this paper, we present the
application of Benford's law to a new network flow metric &quot;flow size
difference&quot;, which have not been studied before by other researchers, to build
an unsupervised flow-based intrusion detection system (IDS). The method was
inspired by our observation on a large number of TCP flow datasets where normal
flows tend to follow Benford's law closely but malicious flows tend to deviate
significantly from it. The proposed IDS is unsupervised, so it can be easily
deployed without any training. It has two simple operational parameters with a
clear semantic meaning, allowing the IDS operator to set and adapt their values
intuitively to adjust the overall performance of the IDS. We tested the
proposed IDS on two (one closed and one public) datasets, and proved its
efficiency in terms of AUC (area under the ROC curve). Our work showed the
&quot;flow size difference&quot; has a great potential to improve the performance of any
flow-based network IDSs.

 <dc:description>  We present a communication solution tailored specifically for DC microgrids
(MGs) that exploits: (i) the communication potential residing in power
electronic converters interfacing distributed generators to powerlines and (ii)
the multiple access nature of the communication channel presented by
powerlines. The communication is achieved by modulating the parameters of the
primary control loop implemented by the converters, fostering execution of the
upper layer control applications. We present the proposed solution in the
context of the distributed optimal economic dispatch, where the generators
periodically transmit information about their local generation capacity, and,
simultaneously, using the properties of the multiple access channel, detect the
aggregate generation capacity of the remote peers, with an aim of distributed
computation of the optimal dispatch policy. We evaluate the potential of the
proposed solution and illustrate its inherent trade-offs.

 <dc:title>Structured Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium in Infinite Horizon Dynamic
  Games with Asymmetric Information</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sinha, Abhinav</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Anastasopoulos, Achilleas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In dynamic games with asymmetric information structure, the widely used
concept of equilibrium is perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE). This is expressed
as a strategy and belief pair that simultaneously satisfy sequential
rationality and belief consistency. Unlike symmetric information dynamic games,
where subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) is the natural equilibrium concept, to
date there does not exist a universal algorithm that decouples the
interdependence of strategies and beliefs over time in calculating PBE. In this
paper we find a subset of PBE for an infinite horizon discounted reward
asymmetric information dynamic game. We refer to it as Structured PBE or SPBE;
in SPBE, any agents' strategy depends on the public history only through a
common public belief and on private history only through the respective agents'
latest private information (his private type). The public belief acts as a
summary of all the relevant past information and it's dimension does not
increase with time. The motivation for this comes the common information
approach proposed in Nayyar et al. (2013) for solving decentralized team
(non-strategic) resource allocation problems with asymmetric information. We
calculate SPBE by solving a single-shot fixed-point equation and a
corresponding forward recursive algorithm. We demonstrate our methodology by
means of a public goods example.

 <dc:description>  We explore the use of liveness for interactive program verification for a
simple concurrent object language. Our experimental IDE integrates two
(formally dual) kinds of continuous testing into the development environment:
compatibility-checking, which verifies an object's use of other objects, and
compliance-checking, which verifies an object's claim to refine the behaviour
of another object. Source code errors highlighted by the IDE are not static
type errors but the reflection back to the source of runtime errors that occur
in some execution of the system. We demonstrate our approach, and discuss

 <dc:description>  The authors and Fischer recently proved that any hereditary property of
two-dimensional matrices (where the row and column order is not ignored) over a
finite alphabet is testable with a constant number of queries, by establishing
the following (ordered) matrix removal lemma: For any finite alphabet $\Sigma$,
any hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$ of matrices over $\Sigma$, and any
$\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists $f_{\mathcal{P}}(\epsilon)$ such that for any
matrix $M$ over $\Sigma$ that is $\epsilon$-far from satisfying $\mathcal{P}$,
most of the $f_{\mathcal{P}}(\epsilon) \times f_{\mathcal{P}}(\epsilon)$
submatrices of $M$ do not satisfy $\mathcal{P}$. Here being $\epsilon$-far from
$\mathcal{P}$ means that one needs to modify at least an $\epsilon$-fraction of
the entries of $M$ to make it satisfy $\mathcal{P}$.
  However, in the above general removal lemma, $f_{\mathcal{P}}(\epsilon)$
grows very fast as a function of $\epsilon^{-1}$, even when $\mathcal{P}$ is
characterized by a single forbidden submatrix. In this work we establish much
more efficient removal lemmas for several special cases of the above problem.
In particular, we show the following: For any fixed $s \times t$ binary matrix
$A$ and any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ there exists $\delta &gt; 0$ polynomial in $\epsilon$,
such that for any binary matrix $M$ in which less than a $\delta$-fraction of
the $s \times t$ submatrices are equal to $A$, there exists a set of less than
an $\epsilon$-fraction of the entries of $M$ that intersects every $A$-copy in
$M$.
  We generalize the work of Alon, Fischer and Newman [SICOMP'07] and make
progress towards proving one of their conjectures. The proofs combine their
efficient conditional regularity lemma for matrices with additional
combinatorial and probabilistic ideas.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for music
tagging. CRNNs take advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local
feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for temporal summarisation of
the extracted features. We compare CRNN with three CNN structures that have
been used for music tagging while controlling the number of parameters with
respect to their performance and training time per sample. Overall, we found
that CRNNs show a strong performance with respect to the number of parameter
and training time, indicating the effectiveness of its hybrid structure in
music feature extraction and feature summarisation.

 <dc:title>Neural Machine Transliteration: Preliminary Results</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jadidinejad, Amir H.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Machine transliteration is the process of automatically transforming the
script of a word from a source language to a target language, while preserving
pronunciation. Sequence to sequence learning has recently emerged as a new
paradigm in supervised learning. In this paper a character-based
encoder-decoder model has been proposed that consists of two Recurrent Neural
Networks. The encoder is a Bidirectional recurrent neural network that encodes
a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the
decoder generates the target sequence using an attention-based recurrent neural
network. The encoder, the decoder and the attention mechanism are jointly
trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a
source sequence. Our experiments on different datasets show that the proposed
encoder-decoder model is able to achieve significantly higher transliteration
quality over traditional statistical models.

 <dc:description>  Let P and Q be two polynomials in K[x, y] with degree at most d, where K is a

present an algorithm to compute R mod x^k in O~(kd) arithmetic operations in K,
where the O~ notation indicates that we omit polylogarithmic factors. This is
an improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms that require to compute R in
O~(d^3) operations before computing its first k coefficients.

 <dc:title>Document Filtering for Long-tail Entities</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Filtering relevant documents with respect to entities is an essential task in
the context of knowledge base construction and maintenance. It entails
processing a time-ordered stream of documents that might be relevant to an
entity in order to select only those that contain vital information.
State-of-the-art approaches to document filtering for popular entities are
entity-dependent: they rely on and are also trained on the specifics of
differentiating features for each specific entity. Moreover, these approaches
tend to use so-called extrinsic information such as Wikipedia page views and
related entities which is typically only available only for popular head
entities. Entity-dependent approaches based on such signals are therefore
ill-suited as filtering methods for long-tail entities. In this paper we
propose a document filtering method for long-tail entities that is
entity-independent and thus also generalizes to unseen or rarely seen entities.
It is based on intrinsic features, i.e., features that are derived from the
documents in which the entities are mentioned. We propose a set of features
that capture informativeness, entity-saliency, and timeliness. In particular,
we introduce features based on entity aspect similarities, relation patterns,
and temporal expressions and combine these with standard features for document
filtering. Experiments following the TREC KBA 2014 setup on a publicly
available dataset show that our model is able to improve the filtering
performance for long-tail entities over several baselines. Results of applying
the model to unseen entities are promising, indicating that the model is able
to learn the general characteristics of a vital document. The overall
performance across all entities---i.e., not just long-tail entities---improves
upon the state-of-the-art without depending on any entity-specific training
data.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, there has been a huge increase in the number of bots online,
varying from Web crawlers for search engines, to chatbots for online customer
service, spambots on social media, and content-editing bots in online
collaboration communities. The online world has turned into an ecosystem of
bots. However, our knowledge of how these automated agents are interacting with
each other is rather poor. Bots are predictable automatons that do not have the
capacity for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and sociality and it is
hence natural to expect interactions between bots to be relatively predictable
and uneventful. In this article, we analyze the interactions between bots that
edit articles on Wikipedia. We track the extent to which bots undid each
other's edits over the period 2001-2010, model how pairs of bots interact over
time, and identify different types of interaction trajectories. We find that,
although Wikipedia bots are intended to support the encyclopedia, they often
undo each other's edits and these sterile &quot;fights&quot; may sometimes continue for
years. Unlike humans on Wikipedia, bots' interactions tend to occur over longer
periods of time and to be more reciprocated. Yet, just like humans, bots in
different cultural environments may behave differently. Our research suggests
that even relatively &quot;dumb&quot; bots may give rise to complex interactions, and
this carries important implications for Artificial Intelligence research.
Understanding what affects bot-bot interactions is crucial for managing social
media well, providing adequate cyber-security, and designing well functioning
autonomous vehicles.

 <dc:description>  We propose the concept of a system algebra with a parallel composition
operation and an interface connection operation, and formalize
composition-order invariance, which postulates that the order of composing and
connecting systems is irrelevant, a generalized form of associativity.
Composition-order invariance explicitly captures a common property that is
implicit in any context where one can draw a figure (hiding the drawing order)
of several connected systems, which appears in many scientific contexts. This
abstract algebra captures settings where one is interested in the behavior of a
composed system in an environment and wants to abstract away anything internal
not relevant for the behavior. This may include physical systems, electronic
circuits, or interacting distributed systems.
  One specific such setting, of special interest in computer science, are
functional system algebras, which capture, in the most general sense, any type
of system that takes inputs and produces outputs depending on the inputs, and
where the output of a system can be the input to another system. The behavior
of such a system is uniquely determined by the function mapping inputs to
outputs. We consider several instantiations of this very general concept. In
particular, we show that Kahn networks form a functional system algebra and
prove their composition-order invariance.
  Moreover, we define a functional system algebra of causal systems,
characterized by the property that inputs can only influence future outputs,
where an abstract partial order relation captures the notion of &quot;later&quot;. This
system algebra is also shown to be composition-order invariant and appropriate
instantiations thereof allow to model and analyze systems that depend on time.

 <dc:description>  TristouNet is a neural network architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory
recurrent networks, meant to project speech sequences into a fixed-dimensional
euclidean space. Thanks to the triplet loss paradigm used for training, the
resulting sequence embeddings can be compared directly with the euclidean

TristouNet brings significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art

 <dc:description>  We propose an approximate strategy to efficiently train neural network based
language models over very large vocabularies. Our approach, called adaptive
softmax, circumvents the linear dependency on the vocabulary size by exploiting
the unbalanced word distribution to form clusters that explicitly minimize the
expectation of computation time. Our approach further reduces the computational
time by exploiting the specificities of modern architectures and matrix-matrix
vector operations, making it particularly suited for graphical processing
units. Our experiments carried out on standard benchmarks, such as EuroParl and
One Billion Word, show that our approach brings a large gain in efficiency over
standard approximations while achieving an accuracy close to that of the full
softmax. The code of our method is available at
https://github.com/facebookresearch/adaptive-softmax.

 <dc:description>  We propose Very Simple Classifier (VSC) a novel method designed to
incorporate the concepts of subsampling and locality in the definition of
features to be used as the input of a perceptron. The rationale is that
locality theoretically guarantees a bound on the generalization error. Each
feature in VSC is a max-margin classifier built on randomly-selected pairs of
samples. The locality in VSC is achieved by multiplying the value of the
feature by a confidence measure that can be characterized in terms of the
Chebichev inequality. The output of the layer is then fed in a output layer of
neurons. The weights of the output layer are then determined by a regularized
pseudoinverse. Extensive comparison of VSC against 9 competitors in the task of
binary classification is carried out. Results on 22 benchmark datasets with
fixed parameters show that VSC is competitive with the Multi Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and outperforms the other competitors. An exploration of the parameter
space shows VSC can outperform MLP.

our approach is comparable to the oracle ceiling, and even outperforms it in

 <dc:title>The bumpy road towards iPhone 5c NAND mirroring</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Skorobogatov, Sergei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is a short summary of a real world mirroring attack on the Apple
iPhone 5c passcode retry counter under iOS 9. This was achieved by desoldering
the NAND Flash chip of a sample phone in order to physically access its
connection to the SoC and partially reverse engineering its proprietary bus
protocol. The process does not require any expensive and sophisticated
equipment. All needed parts are low cost and were obtained from local
electronics distributors. By using the described and successful hardware
mirroring process it was possible to bypass the limit on passcode retry
attempts. This is the first public demonstration of the working prototype and
the real hardware mirroring process for iPhone 5c. Although the process can be
improved, it is still a successful proof-of-concept project. Knowledge of the
possibility of mirroring will definitely help in designing systems with better
protection. Also some reliability issues related to the NAND memory allocation
in iPhone 5c are revealed. Some future research directions are outlined in this
paper and several possible countermeasures are suggested. We show that claims
that iPhone 5c NAND mirroring was infeasible were ill-advised.

 <dc:description>  We aim to localize objects in images using image-level supervision only.
Previous approaches to this problem mainly focus on discriminative object
regions and often fail to locate precise object boundaries. We address this
problem by introducing two types of context-aware guidance models, additive and
contrastive models, that leverage their surrounding context regions to improve
localization. The additive model encourages the predicted object region to be
supported by its surrounding context region. The contrastive model encourages
the predicted object region to be outstanding from its surrounding context
region. Our approach benefits from the recent success of convolutional neural
networks for object recognition and extends Fast R-CNN to weakly supervised
object localization. Extensive experimental evaluation on the PASCAL VOC 2007
and 2012 benchmarks shows hat our context-aware approach significantly improves
weakly supervised localization and detection.

 <dc:description>  Reconstruction of the tridimensional geometry of a visual scene using the
binocular disparity information is an important issue in computer vision and
mobile robotics, which can be formulated as a Bayesian inference problem.
However, computation of the full disparity distribution with an advanced
Bayesian model is usually an intractable problem, and proves computationally
challenging even with a simple model. In this paper, we show how probabilistic
hardware using distributed memory and alternate representation of data as
stochastic bitstreams can solve that problem with high performance and energy
efficiency. We put forward a way to express discrete probability distributions
using stochastic data representations and perform Bayesian fusion using those
representations, and show how that approach can be applied to diparity
computation. We evaluate the system using a simulated stochastic implementation
and discuss possible hardware implementations of such architectures and their
potential for sensorimotor processing and robotics.

 <dc:description>  In this work we study a model of tax evasion. We considered a fixed
population divided in three compartments, namely honest tax payers, tax evaders
and a third class between the mentioned two, which we call
\textit{susceptibles} to become evaders. The transitions among those
compartments are ruled by probabilities, similarly to a model of epidemic
spreading. These probabilities model social interactions among the individuals,
as well as the government's fiscalization. We simulate the model on
fully-connected graphs, as well as on scale-free and random complex networks.
For the fully-connected and random graph cases we observe that the emergence of
tax evaders in the population is associated with an active-absorbing
nonequilibrium phase transition, that is absent in scale-free networks.

 <dc:title>A Tighter Relation between Sensitivity and Certificate Complexity</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The sensitivity conjecture which claims that the sensitivity complexity is
polynomially related to block sensitivity complexity, is one of the most
important and challenging problem in decision tree complexity theory. Despite
of a lot of efforts, the best known upper bound of block sensitivity, as well
as the certificate complexity, are still exponential in terms of sensitivity:
$bs(f)\leq C(f)\leq\max\{2^{s(f)-1}(s(f)-\frac{1}{3}),s(f)\}$. In this paper,
we give a better upper bound of $bs(f)\leq C(f)\leq(\frac{8}{9} +
o(1))s(f)2^{s(f) - 1}$. The proof is based on a deep investigation on the
structure of the sensitivity graph. We also provide a tighter relationship
between $C_0(f)$ and $s_0(f)$ for functions with $s_1(f)=2$.

 <dc:title>A Linear Time Parameterized Algorithm for Directed Feedback Vertex Set</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) problem, the input is a directed
graph $D$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and an integer $k$. The objective is
to determine whether there exists a set of at most $k$ vertices intersecting
every directed cycle of $D$. Whether or not DFVS admits a fixed parameter
tractable (FPT) algorithm was considered the most important open problem in
parameterized complexity until Chen, Liu, Lu, O'Sullivan and Razgon [JACM 2008]
answered the question in the affirmative. They gave an algorithm for the
problem with running time $O(k!4^kk^4nm)$. Since then, no faster algorithm for
the problem has been found. In this paper, we give an algorithm for DFVS with
running time $O(k!4^kk^5(n+m))$. Our algorithm is the first algorithm for DFVS
with linear dependence on input size. Furthermore, the asymptotic dependence of
the running time of our algorithm on the parameter $k$ matches up to a factor
$k$ the algorithm of Chen, Liu, Lu, O'Sullivan and Razgon.
  On the way to designing our algorithm for DFVS, we give a general methodology
to shave off a factor of $n$ from iterative-compression based algorithms for a
few other well-studied covering problems in parameterized complexity. We
demonstrate the applicability of this technique by speeding up by a factor of
$n$, the current best FPT algorithms for Multicut [STOC 2011, SICOMP 2014] and
Directed Subset Feedback Vertex Set [ICALP 2012, TALG 2014].

 <dc:title>Time-Variant Graph Classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Haishuai</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Graphs are commonly used to represent objects, such as images and text, for
pattern classification. In a dynamic world, an object may continuously evolve
over time, and so does the graph extracted from the underlying object. These
changes in graph structure with respect to the temporal order present a new
representation of the graph, in which an object corresponds to a set of
time-variant graphs. In this paper, we formulate a novel time-variant graph
classification task and propose a new graph feature, called a graph-shapelet
pattern, for learning and classifying time-variant graphs. Graph-shapelet
patterns are compact and discriminative graph transformation subsequences. A
graph-shapelet pattern can be regarded as a graphical extension of a shapelet
-- a class of discriminative features designed for vector-based temporal data
classification. To discover graph-shapelet patterns, we propose to convert a
time-variant graph sequence into time-series data and use the discovered
shapelets to find graph transformation subsequences as graph-shapelet patterns.
By converting each graph-shapelet pattern into a unique tokenized graph
transformation sequence, we can measure the similarity between two
graph-shapelet patterns and therefore classify time-variant graphs. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of
the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:title>Combining Texture and Shape Cues for Object Recognition With Minimal

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach to object classification and detection which
requires minimal supervision and which combines visual texture cues and shape
information learned from freely available unlabeled web search results. The
explosion of visual data on the web can potentially make visual examples of
almost any object easily accessible via web search. Previous unsupervised
methods have utilized either large scale sources of texture cues from the web,
or shape information from data such as crowdsourced CAD models. We propose a
two-stream deep learning framework that combines these cues, with one stream
learning visual texture cues from image search data, and the other stream
learning rich shape information from 3D CAD models. To perform classification
or detection for a novel image, the predictions of the two streams are combined
using a late fusion scheme. We present experiments and visualizations for both
tasks on the standard benchmark PASCAL VOC 2007 to demonstrate that texture and
shape provide complementary information in our model. Our method outperforms
previous web image based models, 3D CAD model based approaches, and weakly
supervised models.

 <dc:description>  The problem of computing modulo prime-power sums is investigated in
distributed source coding as well as computation over Multiple-Access Channel
(MAC). We build upon group codes and present a new class of codes called Quasi
Group Codes (QGC). A QGC is a subset of a group code. These codes are not
closed under the group addition. We investigate some properties of QGC's, and
provide a packing and a covering bound. Next, we use these bounds to derived
achievable rates for distributed source coding as well as computation over MAC.
We show that strict improvements over the previously known schemes can be
obtained using QGC's.

 <dc:description>  LTL synthesis -- the construction of a function to satisfy a logical
specification formulated in Linear Temporal Logic -- is a 2EXPTIME-complete
problem with relevant applications in controller synthesis and a myriad of
artificial intelligence applications. In this research note we consider De
Giacomo and Vardi's variant of the synthesis problem for LTL formulas
interpreted over finite rather than infinite traces. Rather surprisingly, given
the existing claims on complexity, we establish that LTL synthesis is
EXPTIME-complete for the finite interpretation, and not 2EXPTIME-complete as
previously reported. Our result coincides nicely with the planning perspective
where non-deterministic planning with full observability is EXPTIME-complete
and partial observability increases the complexity to 2EXPTIME-complete; a
recent related result for LTL synthesis shows that in the finite case with
partial observability, the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete.

 <dc:description>  Previous studies have shown that Twitter users have biases to tweet from
certain locations, locational bias, and during certain hours, temporal bias. We
used three years of geolocated Twitter Data to quantify these biases and test
our central hypothesis that Twitter users biases are consistent across US
cities. Our results suggest that temporal and locational bias of Twitter users
are inconsistent between three US metropolitan cities. We derive conclusions
about the role of the complexity of the underlying data producing process on
its consistency and argue for the potential research avenue for Geospatial Data
Science to test and quantify these inconsistencies in the class of organically
evolved Big Data.

 <dc:description>  The combination of tomographic imaging and deep learning, or machine learning
in general, promises to empower not only image analysis but also image
reconstruction. The latter aspect is considered in this perspective article
with an emphasis on medical imaging to develop a new generation of image
reconstruction theories and techniques. This direction might lead to
intelligent utilization of domain knowledge from big data, innovative
approaches for image reconstruction, and superior performance in clinical and
preclinical applications. To realize the full impact of machine learning on
medical imaging, major challenges must be addressed.

 <dc:title>Super-resolution community detection for layer-aggregated multilayer
  networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Applied network science often involves preprocessing network data before
applying a network-analysis method, and there is typically a theoretical
disconnect between these steps. For example, it is common to aggregate
time-varying network data into windows prior to analysis, and the tradeoffs of
this preprocessing are not well understood. Focusing on the problem of
detecting small communities in multilayer networks, we study the effects of
layer aggregation by developing random-matrix theory for modularity matrices
associated with layer-aggregated networks with $N$ nodes and $L$ layers, which
are drawn from an ensemble of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. We study phase
transitions in which eigenvectors localize onto communities (allowing their
detection) and which occur for a given community provided its size surpasses a
detectability limit $K^*$. When layers are aggregated via a summation, we
obtain $K^*\varpropto \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{NL}/T)$, where $T$ is the number of
layers across which the community persists. Interestingly, if $T$ is allowed to
vary with $L$ then summation-based layer aggregation enhances small-community
detection even if the community persists across a vanishing fraction of layers,
provided that $T/L$ decays more slowly than $ \mathcal{O}(L^{-1/2})$. Moreover,
we find that thresholding the summation can in some cases cause $K^*$ to decay
exponentially, decreasing by orders of magnitude in a phenomenon we call
super-resolution community detection. That is, layer aggregation with
thresholding is a nonlinear data filter enabling detection of communities that
are otherwise too small to detect. Importantly, different thresholds generally
enhance the detectability of communities having different properties,
illustrating that community detection can be obscured if one analyzes network
data using a single threshold.

 <dc:title>Warped Convolutions: Efficient Invariance to Spatial Transformations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extremely efficient, since they
exploit the inherent translation-invariance of natural images. However,
translation is just one of a myriad of useful spatial transformations. Can the
same efficiency be attained when considering other spatial invariances? Such
generalized convolutions have been considered in the past, but at a high
computational cost. We present a construction that is simple and exact, yet has
the same computational complexity that standard convolutions enjoy. It consists
of a constant image warp followed by a simple convolution, which are standard
blocks in deep learning toolboxes. With a carefully crafted warp, the resulting
architecture can be made invariant to one of a wide range of spatial
transformations. We show encouraging results in realistic scenarios, including
the estimation of vehicle poses in the Google Earth dataset (rotation and
scale), and face poses in Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (3D rotations
under perspective).

 <dc:description>  Fast and robust three-dimensional reconstruction of facial geometric
structure from a single image is a challenging task with numerous applications.
Here, we introduce a learning-based approach for reconstructing a
three-dimensional face from a single image. Recent face recovery methods rely
on accurate localization of key characteristic points. In contrast, the
proposed approach is based on a Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN) which
extracts the face geometry directly from its image. Although such deep
architectures outperform other models in complex computer vision problems,
training them properly requires a large dataset of annotated examples. In the
case of three-dimensional faces, currently, there are no large volume data
sets, while acquiring such big-data is a tedious task. As an alternative, we
propose to generate random, yet nearly photo-realistic, facial images for which
the geometric form is known. The suggested model successfully recovers facial
shapes from real images, even for faces with extreme expressions and under
various lighting conditions.

 <dc:description>  In the field of gait recognition from motion capture data, designing
human-interpretable gait features is a common practice of many fellow
researchers. To refrain from ad-hoc schemes and to find maximally
discriminative features we may need to explore beyond the limits of human
interpretability. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art with a machine
learning approach for extracting robust gait features directly from raw joint
coordinates. The features are learned by a modification of Linear Discriminant
Analysis with Maximum Margin Criterion so that the identities are maximally
separated and, in combination with an appropriate classifier, used for gait
recognition. Experiments on the CMU MoCap database show that this method
outperforms eight other relevant methods in terms of the distribution of
biometric templates in respective feature spaces expressed in four class
separability coefficients. Additional experiments indicate that this method is
a leading concept for rank-based classifier systems.

 <dc:description>  Compared with automatic speech recognition (ASR), the human auditory system
is more adept at handling noise-adverse situations, including environmental
noise and channel distortion. To mimic this adeptness, auditory models have
been widely incorporated in ASR systems to improve their robustness. This paper
proposes a novel auditory model which incorporates psychoacoustics and
otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) into ASR. In particular, we successfully implement
the frequency-dependent property of psychoacoustic models and effectively
improve resulting system performance. We also present a novel double-transform
spectrum-analysis technique, which can qualitatively predict ASR performance
for different noise types. Detailed theoretical analysis is provided to show
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experiments are carried out on the
AURORA2 database and show that the word recognition rate using our proposed
feature extraction method is significantly increased over the baseline. Given
models trained with clean speech, our proposed method achieves up to 85.39%
word recognition accuracy on noisy data.

 <dc:description>  Bayesian methods for machine learning have been widely investigated, yielding
principled methods for incorporating prior information into inference
algorithms. In this survey, we provide an in-depth review of the role of
Bayesian methods for the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. The major
incentives for incorporating Bayesian reasoning in RL are: 1) it provides an
elegant approach to action-selection (exploration/exploitation) as a function
of the uncertainty in learning; and 2) it provides a machinery to incorporate
prior knowledge into the algorithms. We first discuss models and methods for
Bayesian inference in the simple single-step Bandit model. We then review the
extensive recent literature on Bayesian methods for model-based RL, where prior
information can be expressed on the parameters of the Markov model. We also
present Bayesian methods for model-free RL, where priors are expressed over the
value function or policy class. The objective of the paper is to provide a
comprehensive survey on Bayesian RL algorithms and their theoretical and
empirical properties.

 <dc:title>Unrestricted State Complexity of Binary Operations on Regular and Ideal

 <dc:creator>Brzozowski, Janusz</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the state complexity of binary operations on regular languages over
different alphabets. It is known that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are languages of
state complexities $m$ and $n$, respectively, and restricted to the same
alphabet, the state complexity of any binary boolean operation on $L'_m$ and
$L_n$ is $mn$, and that of product (concatenation) is $m 2^n - 2^{n-1}$. In
contrast to this, we show that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are over different
alphabets, the state complexity of union and symmetric difference is
$(m+1)(n+1)$, that of difference is $mn+m$, that of intersection is $mn$, and
that of product is $m2^n+2^{n-1}$. We also study unrestricted complexity of
binary operations in the classes of regular right, left, and two-sided ideals,
and derive tight upper bounds. The bounds for product of the unrestricted cases
(with the bounds for the restricted cases in parentheses) are as follows: right
ideals $m+2^{n-2}+2^{n-1}$ ($m+2^{n-2}$); left ideals $mn+m+n$ ($m+n-1$);
two-sided ideals $m+2n$ ($m+n-1$). The state complexities of boolean operations
on all three types of ideals are the same as those of arbitrary regular
languages, whereas that is not the case if the alphabets of the arguments are
the same. Finally, we update the known results about most complex regular,
right-ideal, left-ideal, and two-sided-ideal languages to include the
unrestricted cases.

 <dc:description>  We consider the computational complexity of finding a legal black pebbling of
a DAG $G=(V,E)$ with minimum cumulative cost. A black pebbling is a sequence
$P_0,\ldots, P_t \subseteq V$ of sets of nodes which must satisfy the following
properties: $P_0 = \emptyset$ (we start off with no pebbles on $G$),
$\mathsf{sinks}(G) \subseteq \bigcup_{j \leq t} P_j$ (every sink node was
pebbled at some point) and $\mathsf{parents}\big(P_{i+1}\backslash P_i\big)
\subseteq P_i$ (we can only place a new pebble on a node $v$ if all of $v$'s
parents had a pebble during the last round). The cumulative cost of a pebbling
$P_0,P_1,\ldots, P_t \subseteq V$ is $\mathsf{cc}(P) = | P_1| + \ldots + |
P_t|$. The cumulative pebbling cost is an especially important security metric
for data-independent memory hard functions, an important primitive for password
hashing. Thus, an efficient (approximation) algorithm would be an invaluable
tool for the cryptanalysis of password hash functions as it would provide an
automated tool to establish tight bounds on the amortized space-time cost of
computing the function. We show that such a tool is unlikely to exist. In
particular, we prove the following results. (1) It is
$\texttt{NP}\mbox{-}\texttt{Hard}$ to find a pebbling minimizing cumulative
cost. (2) The natural linear program relaxation for the problem has integrality
gap $\tilde{O}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in $G$. We conjecture that
the problem is hard to approximate. (3) We show that a related problem, find
the minimum size subset $S\subseteq V$ such that $\textsf{depth}(G-S) \leq d$,
is also $\texttt{NP}\mbox{-}\texttt{Hard}$. In fact, under the unique games
conjecture there is no $(2-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We have created a large diverse set of cars from overhead images, which are
useful for training a deep learner to binary classify, detect and count them.
The dataset and all related material will be made publically available. The set
contains contextual matter to aid in identification of difficult targets. We
demonstrate classification and detection on this dataset using a neural network
we call ResCeption. This network combines residual learning with
Inception-style layers and is used to count cars in one look. This is a new way
to count objects rather than by localization or density estimation. It is
fairly accurate, fast and easy to implement. Additionally, the counting method
is not car or scene specific. It would be easy to train this method to count
other kinds of objects and counting over new scenes requires no extra set up or
assumptions about object locations.

 <dc:description>  We introduce several techniques for sampling and visualizing the latent
spaces of generative models. Replacing linear interpolation with spherical
linear interpolation prevents diverging from a model's prior distribution and
produces sharper samples. J-Diagrams and MINE grids are introduced as
visualizations of manifolds created by analogies and nearest neighbors. We
demonstrate two new techniques for deriving attribute vectors: bias-corrected
vectors with data replication and synthetic vectors with data augmentation.
Binary classification using attribute vectors is presented as a technique
supporting quantitative analysis of the latent space. Most techniques are
intended to be independent of model type and examples are shown on both
Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.

 <dc:description>  Sorting is one of the oldest computing problems and is still very important
in the age of big data. Various algorithms and implementation techniques have
been proposed. In this study, we focus on comparison based, internal sorting
algorithms. We created 12 data types of various sizes for experiments and
tested extensively various implementations in a single setting. Using some
effective techniques, we discovered that quicksort is adaptive to nearly sorted
inputs and is still the best overall sorting algorithm. We also identified
which techniques are effective in timsort, one of the most popular and
efficient sorting method based on natural mergesort, and created our version of
mergesort, which runs faster than timsort on nearly sorted instances. Our
implementations of quicksort and mergesort are different from other
implementations reported in all textbooks or research articles, faster than any
version of the C library qsort functions, not only for randomly generated data,
but also for various types of nearly sorted data. This experiment can help the
user to choose the best sorting algorithm for the hard sorting job at hand.
This work provides a platform for anyone to test their own sorting algorithm
against the best in the field.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new parallel framework for fast computation of inverse and
forward dynamics of articulated robots based on prefix sums (scans). We
re-investigate the well-known recursive Newton-Euler formulation of robot
dynamics and show that the forward-backward propagation process for robot
inverse dynamics is equivalent to two scan operations on certain semigroups. We
show that the state-of-the-art forward dynamics algorithms may almost
completely be cast into a sequence of scan operations, with unscannable parts
clearly identified. This suggests a serial-parallel hybrid approach for systems
with a moderate number of links. We implement our scan based algorithms on
Nvidia CUDA platform with performance compared with multithreading CPU-based
recursive algorithms; a significant level of acceleration is demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  Optimal transport is a powerful framework for computing distances between
probability distributions. We unify the two main approaches to optimal
transport, namely Monge-Kantorovitch and Sinkhorn-Cuturi, into what we define
as Tsallis regularized optimal transport (\trot). \trot~interpolates a rich
family of distortions from Wasserstein to Kullback-Leibler, encompassing as
well Pearson, Neyman and Hellinger divergences, to name a few. We show that
metric properties known for Sinkhorn-Cuturi generalize to \trot, and provide
efficient algorithms for finding the optimal transportation plan with formal
convergence proofs. We also present the first application of optimal transport
to the problem of ecological inference, that is, the reconstruction of joint
distributions from their marginals, a problem of large interest in the social
sciences. \trot~provides a convenient framework for ecological inference by
allowing to compute the joint distribution --- that is, the optimal
transportation plan itself --- when side information is available, which is
\textit{e.g.} typically what census represents in political science.
Experiments on data from the 2012 US presidential elections display the
potential of \trot~in delivering a faithful reconstruction of the joint
distribution of ethnic groups and voter preferences.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicular communica tion systems have the potential
to improve traffic efficiency and safety. Lack of secure communication links,
however, may lead to a formidable set of abuses and attacks. To secure
communication links, a physical layer precoding technique for mmWave vehicular
communication systems is proposed in this paper. The proposed technique
exploits the large dimensional antenna arrays available at mmWave systems to
produce direction dependent transmission. This results in coherent transmission
to the legitimate receiver and artificial noise that jams eavesdroppers with
sensitive receivers. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the validity
and effectiveness of the proposed technique and show that the proposed
technique provides high secrecy throughput when compared to conventional array
and switched array transmission techniques.

 <dc:description>  Inference on time series data is a common requirement in many scientific
disciplines and internet of things (IoT) applications, yet there are few
resources available to domain scientists to easily, robustly, and repeatably
build such complex inference workflows: traditional statistical models of time
series are often too rigid to explain complex time domain behavior, while
popular machine learning packages require already-featurized dataset inputs.
Moreover, the software engineering tasks required to instantiate the
computational platform are daunting. cesium is an end-to-end time series
analysis framework, consisting of a Python library as well as a web front-end
interface, that allows researchers to featurize raw data and apply modern
machine learning techniques in a simple, reproducible, and extensible way.
Users can apply out-of-the-box feature engineering workflows as well as save
and replay their own analyses. Any steps taken in the front end can also be
exported to a Jupyter notebook, so users can iterate between possible models
within the front end and then fine-tune their analysis using the additional
capabilities of the back-end library. The open-source packages make us of many
use modern Python toolkits, including xarray, dask, Celery, Flask, and
scikit-learn.

 <dc:description>  Relational learning deals with data that are characterized by relational
structures. An important task is collective classification, which is to jointly
classify networked objects. While it holds a great promise to produce a better
accuracy than non-collective classifiers, collective classification is
computational challenging and has not leveraged on the recent breakthroughs of
deep learning. We present Column Network (CLN), a novel deep learning model for
collective classification in multi-relational domains. CLN has many desirable
theoretical properties: (i) it encodes multi-relations between any two
instances; (ii) it is deep and compact, allowing complex functions to be
approximated at the network level with a small set of free parameters; (iii)
local and relational features are learned simultaneously; (iv) long-range,
higher-order dependencies between instances are supported naturally; and (v)
crucially, learning and inference are efficient, linear in the size of the
network and the number of relations. We evaluate CLN on multiple real-world
applications: (a) delay prediction in software projects, (b) PubMed Diabetes
publication classification and (c) film genre classification. In all
applications, CLN demonstrates a higher accuracy than state-of-the-art rivals.

 <dc:description>  We study various versions of the problem of scheduling platoons of autonomous
vehicles through an unregulated intersection, where an algorithm must schedule
which platoons should wait so that others can go through, so as to minimize the
maximum delay for any vehicle. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for
constructing such schedules for a $k$-way merge intersection, for constant $k$,
and for a crossing intersection involving two-way traffic. We also show that
the more general problem of scheduling autonomous platoons through an
intersection that includes both a $k$-way merge, for non-constant $k$, and a
crossing of two-way traffic is NP-complete.

 <dc:title>Function-Based Access Control (FBAC): From Access Control Matrix to
  Access Control Tensor</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Desmedt, Yvo</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Security researchers have stated that the core concept behind current
implementations of access control predates the Internet. These assertions are
made to pinpoint that there is a foundational gap in this field, and one should
consider revisiting the concepts from the ground up. Moreover, Insider threats,
which are an increasing threat vector against organizations are also associated
with the failure of access control. Access control models derived from access
control matrix encompass three sets of entities, Subjects, Objects and
Operations. Typically, objects are considered to be files and operations are
regarded as Read, Write, and Execute. This implies an `open sesame' approach
when granting access to data, i.e. once access is granted, there is no
restriction on command executions. Inspired by Functional Encryption, we
propose applying access authorizations at a much finer granularity, but instead
of an ad-hoc or computationally hard cryptographic approach, we postulate a
foundational transformation to access control. From an abstract viewpoint, we
suggest storing access authorizations as a three-dimensional tensor, which we
call Access Control Tensor (ACT). In Function-based Access Control (FBAC),
applications do not give blind folded execution right and can only invoke
commands that have been authorized for data segments. In other words, one might
be authorized to use a certain command on one object, while being forbidden to
use exactly the same command on another object. The theoretical foundations of
FBAC are presented along with Policy, Enforcement and Implementation (PEI)
requirements of it. A critical analysis of the advantages of deploying FBAC,
how it will result in developing a new generation of applications, and
compatibility with existing models and systems is also included. Finally, a
proof of concept implementation of FBAC is presented.

 <dc:description>  Integrating optical circuit switches in data-centers is an on-going research
challenge. In recent years, state-of-the-art solutions introduce hybrid
packet/circuit architectures for different optical circuit switch technologies,
control techniques, and traffic rerouting methods. These solutions are based on
separated packet and circuit planes which do not have the ability to utilize an
optical circuit with flows that do not arrive from or delivered to switches
directly connected to the circuit's end-points. Moreover, current SDN-based
elephant flow rerouting methods require a forwarding rule for each flow, which
raise scalability issues. In this paper, we present C-Share -- a practical,
scalable SDN-based circuit sharing solution for data center networks. C-Share
inherently enable elephant flows to share optical circuits by exploiting a flat
upper tier network topology. C-Share is based on a scalable and decoupled
SDN-based elephant flow rerouting method comprised of elephant flow detection,
tagging and identification, which is utilized by using a prevalent network
sampling method (e.g., sFlow). C-Share requires only a single OpenFlow rule for
each optical circuit, and therefore significantly reduces the required OpenFlow
rule entry footprint and setup rule rate. It also mitigates the OpenFlow
outbound latency for subsequent elephant flows. We implement a proof-of-concept
system for C-Share based on Mininet, and test the scalability of C-Share by
using an event driven simulation. Our results show a consistent increase in the
mice/elephant flow separation in the network which, in turn, improves both
network throughput and flow completion time.

 <dc:title>Distributed power allocation for D2D communications

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The implementation of device-to-device (D2D) underlaying or overlaying
pre-existing cellular networks has received much attention due to the potential
of enhancing the total cell throughput, reducing power consumption and
increasing the instantaneous data rate. In this paper we propose a distributed
power allocation scheme for D2D OFDMA communications and, in particular, we
consider the two operating modes amenable to a distributed implementation:
dedicated and reuse modes. The proposed schemes address the problem of
maximizing the users' sum rate subject to power constraints, which is known to
be nonconvex and, as such, extremely difficult to be solved exactly. We propose
here a fresh approach to this well-known problem, capitalizing on the fact that
the power allocation problem can be modeled as a potential game. Exploiting the
potential games property of converging under better response dynamics, we
propose two fully distributed iterative algorithms, one for each operation mode
considered, where each user updates sequentially and autonomously its power
allocation. Numerical results, computed for several different user scenarios,
show that the proposed methods, which converge to one of the local maxima of
the objective function, exhibit performance close to the maximum achievable
optimum and outperform other schemes presented in the literature.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses channel estimation and data equalization on
frequency-selective 1-bit quantized Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO)
systems. No joint processing or Channel State Information is assumed at the
transmitter, and therefore our findings are also applicable to the uplink of
Multi-User MIMO systems. System models for both Orthogonal Division Frequency
Multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier schemes are developed. A Cram\'er-Rao
Lower Bound for the estimation problems is derived. The two nonlinear
algorithms Expectation Maximization (EM) and Generalized Approximate Message
Passing (GAMP) are adapted to the problems, and a linear method based on the
Bussgang theorem is proposed. In the OFDM case, the linear method enables
subcarrier-wise estimation, greatly reducing computational complexity.
Simulations are carried out to compare the algorithms with different settings.
The results turn out to be close to the Cram\'er-Rao bound in the low Signal to
Noise Ratio (SNR) region. The OFDM setting is more suitable for the nonlinear
algorithms, and that the linear methods incur a performance loss with respect
to the nonlinear approaches. In the relevant low and medium SNR regions, the
loss amounts to 2-3 dB and might well be justified in exchange for the reduced
computational effort, especially in Massive MIMO settings.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces matrix product state (MPS) decomposition as a new and
systematic method to compress multidimensional data represented by higher-order
tensors. It solves two major bottlenecks in tensor compression: computation and
compression quality. Regardless of tensor order, MPS compresses tensors to
matrices of moderate dimension which can be used for classification. Mainly
based on a successive sequence of singular value decompositions (SVD), MPS is
quite simple to implement and arrives at the global optimal matrix, bypassing
local alternating optimization, which is not only computationally expensive but
cannot yield the global solution. Benchmark results show that MPS can achieve
better classification performance with favorable computation cost compared to
other tensor compression methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the dyadic effect introduced in complex networks
when nodes are distinguished by a binary characteristic. Under these
circumstances two independent parameters, namely dyadicity and heterophilicity,
are able to measure how much the assigned characteristic affects the network
topology. All possible configurations can be represented in a phase diagram
lying in a two-dimensional space that represents the feasible region of the
dyadic effect, which is bound by two upper bounds on dyadicity and
heterophilicity. Using some network's structural arguments, we are able to
improve such upper bounds and introduce two new lower bounds, providing a
reduction of the feasible region of the dyadic effect as well as constraining
dyadicity and heterophilicity within a specific range. Some computational
experiences show the bounds' effectiveness and their usefulness with regards to
different classes of networks.

 <dc:title>A Multi-Service Oriented Multiple-Access Scheme For M2M Support in
  Future LTE</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel multiple-access technique to overcome the shortcomings of
the current proposals for the future releases of Long-Term Evolution (LTE). We
provide a unified radio access system that efficiently and flexibly integrates
both traditional cellular services and machine-to-machine (M2M) connections
arising from Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The proposed solution,
referred to as multi-service oriented multiple access (MOMA), is based on a)
establishing separate classes of users using relevant criteria that go beyond
the simple handheld-IoT device split, b) service-dependent hierarchical
spreading of the data signals and c) a mix of multiuser and single-user
detection schemes at the receiver. Signal spreading in MOMA allows to handle
densely connected devices with different quality-of-service (QoS) profiles and
at the same time its flexible receiver structure allows to allocate the
receiver computational resources to the connections that need it most. This
yields a scalable and efficient use of the available radio resources and a
better service integration. While providing significant advantages for key
future communications scenarios, MOMA can be incorporated into LTE with a
limited impact on the protocol structure and the signaling overhead.

 <dc:description>  The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a connection and message
oriented transport protocol. It supports multiple uni-directional streams in
each direction allowing user message sequence preservation within each stream.
This minimizes the re-sequencing delay at the receiver side in case of message
loss. The base protocol, although being optimized for small messages, supports
arbitrary large user messages by using fragmentation and reassembly at the cost
of adding delays at the sender side. To overcome this limitation, a protocol
extension called User Message Interleaving is currently being specified by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This paper describes the new extension,
its integration and validation in the context of the INET framework.

 <dc:description>  Switching connectivity over multiple wireless interfaces of a mobile node is
essential when performing handover between heterogeneous networks. In such a
communication scenario, session continuity as experienced by the user can be
enhanced if soft handover is enabled through the concept of make-before-break.
However, some of the available networking protocols need to be modified to
support this feature. This work gives an insight into the supplementary modules
we implemented and the modification conducted in MIPv6 model of OMNeT++ to
facilitate soft handover and data offloading for mobile nodes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been recently introduced as a new
communication paradigm in computer networks. By separating the control plane
from the data plane and entrusting packet forwarding to straightforward
switches, SDN makes it possible to deploy and run networks which are more
flexible to manage and easier to configure. This paper describes a set of
extensions for the INET framework, which allow researchers and network
designers to simulate SDN architectures and evaluate their performance and
security at design time. Together with performance evaluation and design
optimization of SDN networks, our extensions enable the simulation of SDN-based
anomaly detection and mitigation techniques, as well as the quantitative
evaluation of cyber-physical attacks and their impact on the network and
application. This work is an ongoing research activity, and we plan to propose
it for an official contribution to the INET framework.

 <dc:description>  A publicly available dataset for federated search reflecting a real web
environment has long been absent, making it difficult for researchers to test
the validity of their federated search algorithms for the web setting. We
present several experiments and analyses on resource selection on the web using
a recently released test collection containing the results from more than a
hundred real search engines, ranging from large general web search engines such
as Google, Bing and Yahoo to small domain-specific engines. First, we
experiment with estimating the size of uncooperative search engines on the web
using query based sampling and propose a new method using the ClueWeb09
dataset. We find the size estimates to be highly effective in resource
selection. Second, we show that an optimized federated search system based on
smaller web search engines can be an alternative to a system using large web
search engines. Third, we provide an empirical comparison of several popular
resource selection methods and find that these methods are not readily suitable
for resource selection on the web. Challenges include the sparse resource
descriptions and extremely skewed sizes of collections.

 <dc:description>  Many success stories involving deep neural networks are instances of
supervised learning, where available labels power gradient-based learning
methods. Creating such labels, however, can be expensive and thus there is
increasing interest in weak labels which only provide coarse information, with
uncertainty regarding time, location or value. Using such labels often leads to
considerable challenges for the learning process. Current methods for
weak-label training often employ standard supervised approaches that
additionally reassign or prune labels during the learning process. The
information gain, however, is often limited as only the importance of labels
where the network already yields reasonable results is boosted. We propose
treating weak-label training as an unsupervised problem and use the labels to
guide the representation learning to induce structure. To this end, we propose
two autoencoder extensions: class activity penalties and structured dropout. We
demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in the context of score-informed
source separation of music.

 <dc:description>  We advocate the Loop-of-stencil-reduce pattern as a means of simplifying the
implementation of data-parallel programs on heterogeneous multi-core platforms.
Loop-of-stencil-reduce is general enough to subsume map, reduce, map-reduce,
stencil, stencil-reduce, and, crucially, their usage in a loop in both
data-parallel and streaming applications, or a combination of both. The pattern
makes it possible to deploy a single stencil computation kernel on different
GPUs. We discuss the implementation of Loop-of-stencil-reduce in FastFlow, a
framework for the implementation of applications based on the parallel
patterns. Experiments are presented to illustrate the use of
Loop-of-stencil-reduce in developing data-parallel kernels running on
heterogeneous systems.

 <dc:description>  As the complexity of current data flow systems and according infrastructure
networks increases, the security of data transition through such platforms
becomes more important. Thus, different areas of steganography turn to one of
the most challengeable topics of current researches. In this paper a novel
method is presented to hide an image into the host image and Hardware/Software
design is proposed to implement our stagenography system on FPGA- DE2 70 Altera
board. The size of the secret image is quadrant of the host image. Host image
works as a cipher key to completely distort and encrypt the secret image using
XOR operand. Each pixel of the secret image is composed of 8 bits (4 bit-pair)
in which each bit-pair is distorted by XORing it with two LSB bits of the host
image and putting the results in the location of two LSB bits of host image.
The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared
to the most recently proposed algorithms by considering that the obtained
information entropy for encrypt image is approximately equal to 8.

 <dc:subject>65F50</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Runtime characteristics of sparse matrix computations and related processes
may be often improved by reducing memory footprints of involved matrices. Such
a reduction can be usually achieved when matrices are processed in a block-wise
manner. The presented study analysed memory footprints of 563 representative
benchmark sparse matrices with respect to their partitioning into
uniformly-sized blocks. Different block sizes and different ways of storing
blocks in memory were considered and statistically evaluated. Memory footprints
of partitioned matrices were additionally compared with lower bounds and with
the CSR storage format. The average measured memory savings against CSR in case
of single and double precision were 42.3 and 28.7 percents, the corresponding
worst-case savings 25.5 and 17.1 percents. Moreover, memory footprints of
partitioned matrices were in average 5 times closer to their lower bounds than
CSR. Based on the obtained results, generic suggestions for efficient
partitioning and storage of sparse matrices in a computer memory are provided.

 <dc:description>  The Minimum Eccentricity Shortest Path (MESP) Problem consists in determining
a shortest path (a path whose length is the distance between its extremities)
of minimum eccentricity in a graph. It was introduced by Dragan and Leitert [9]
who described a linear-time algorithm which is an 8-approximation of the
problem. In this paper, we study deeper the double-BFS procedure used in that
algorithm and extend it to obtain a linear-time 3-approximation algorithm. We
moreover study the link between the MESP problem and the notion of laminarity,
introduced by V{\&quot;o}lkel et al [12], corresponding to its restriction to a
diameter (i.e. a shortest path of maximum length), and show tight bounds
between MESP and laminarity parameters.

 <dc:title>When to make a step? Tackling the timing problem in multi-contact
  locomotion by TOPP-MPC</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Caron, St&#xe9;phane</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a model predictive controller (MPC) for multi-contact locomotion
where predictive optimizations are realized by time-optimal path
parameterization (TOPP). A key feature of this solution is that, contrary to
existing planners where step timings are provided as inputs, here the timing
between contact switches is computed as output of a fast nonlinear
optimization. This is particularly appealing to multi-contact locomotion, where
proper timings depend on terrain topology and suitable heuristics are unknown.
We show how to formulate legged locomotion as a TOPP problem and demonstrate
the behavior of the resulting TOPP-MPC controller in simulations with a model
of the HRP-4 humanoid robot.

 <dc:description>  The study of MDS self-dual codes has attracted lots of attention in recent
years.
  There are many papers on determining existence of $q-$ary MDS self-dual codes
for various lengths.
  There are not existence of $q-$ary MDS self-dual codes of some lengths, even
these lengths $&lt; q$.
  We generalize MDS Euclidean self-dual codes to near MDS Euclidean self-dual
codes and near MDS isodual codes.
  And we obtain many new near MDS isodual codes from extended negacyclic duadic
codes and we obtain many new MDS Euclidean self-dual codes from MDS Euclidean
self-dual codes.
  We generalize MDS Hermitian self-dual codes to near MDS Hermitian self-dual
codes.
  We obtain near MDS Hermitian self-dual codes from extended negacyclic duadic
codes and from MDS Hermitian self-dual codes.

 <dc:description>  Simulation is widely adopted in the study of modern computer networks. In
this context, OMNeT++ provides a set of very effective tools that span from the
definition of the network, to the automation of simulation execution and quick
result representation. However, as network models become more and more complex
to cope with the evolution of network systems, the amount of simulation
factors, the number of simulated nodes and the size of results grow
consequently, leading to simulations with larger scale. In this work, we
perform a critical analysis of the tools provided by OMNeT++ in case of such
large-scale simulations. We then propose a unified and flexible software
architecture to support simulation automation.

 <dc:description>  Wi-Fi Direct is a popular wireless technology which is integrated in most of
today's smartphones and tablets. This technology allows a set of devices to
dynamically negotiate and select a group owner which plays the role access
point. This important feature is the strength of Wi-Fi Direct and makes it more
and more widely used in telecommunications networks. In this paper, we present
the implementation of Wi-Fi Direct in the INET framework of OMNeT++. We have
implemented the main procedures of Wi-Fi Direct such as discovery, negotiation
and group formation. The implementation has been validated by two test
scenarios which show the conformity of the implementation to the protocol
specification.

 <dc:description>  We show that clustered planarity with overlapping clusters as introduced by
Didimo et al. can be solved in polynomial time if each cluster induces a
connected subgraph. It can be solved in linear time if the set of clusters is
the union of two partitions of the vertex set such that, for each cluster, both
the cluster and its complement, induce connected subgraphs. Clustered planarity
with overlapping clusters is NP-complete, even if restricted to instances where
the underlying graph is 2-connected, the set of clusters is the union of two
partitions and each cluster contains at most two connected components while
their complements contain at most three connected components.

 <dc:description>  -In this work, we revisit fast dimension reduction approaches, as with random
projections and random sampling. Our goal is to summarize the data to decrease
computational costs and memory footprint of subsequent analysis. Such dimension
reduction can be very efficient when the signals of interest have a strong
structure, such as with images. We focus on this setting and investigate
feature clustering schemes for data reductions that capture this structure. An
impediment to fast dimension reduction is that good clustering comes with large
algorithmic costs. We address it by contributing a linear-time agglomerative
clustering scheme, Recursive Nearest Agglomeration (ReNA). Unlike existing fast
agglomerative schemes, it avoids the creation of giant clusters. We empirically
validate that it approximates the data as well as traditional
variance-minimizing clustering schemes that have a quadratic complexity. In
addition, we analyze signal approximation with feature clustering and show that
it can remove noise, improving subsequent analysis steps. As a consequence,
data reduction by clustering features with ReNA yields very fast and accurate
models, enabling to process large datasets on budget. Our theoretical analysis
is backed by extensive experiments on publicly-available data that illustrate
the computation efficiency and the denoising properties of the resulting
dimension reduction scheme.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Holt and McMillan [Bionformatics 2014, ACM-BCB 2014] have proposed
a simple and elegant algorithm to merge the Burrows-Wheeler transforms of a
family of strings. In this paper we show that the H&amp;M algorithm can be improved
so that, in addition to merging the BWTs, it can also merge the Longest Common
Prefix (LCP) arrays. The new algorithm, called Gap because of how it operates,
has the same asymptotic cost as the H&amp;M algorithm and requires additional space
only for storing the LCP values.

 <dc:description>  We present a new approach for neural machine translation (NMT) using the
morphological and grammatical decomposition of the words (factors) in the
output side of the neural network. This architecture addresses two main
problems occurring in MT, namely dealing with a large target language
vocabulary and the out of vocabulary (OOV) words. By the means of factors, we
are able to handle larger vocabulary and reduce the training time (for systems
with equivalent target language vocabulary size). In addition, we can produce
new words that are not in the vocabulary. We use a morphological analyser to
get a factored representation of each word (lemmas, Part of Speech tag, tense,
person, gender and number). We have extended the NMT approach with attention
mechanism in order to have two different outputs, one for the lemmas and the
other for the rest of the factors. The final translation is built using some
\textit{a priori} linguistic information. We compare our extension with a
word-based NMT system. The experiments, performed on the IWSLT'15 dataset
translating from English to French, show that while the performance do not
always increase, the system can manage a much larger vocabulary and
consistently reduce the OOV rate. We observe up to 2% BLEU point improvement in
a simulated out of domain translation setup.

 <dc:description>  We propose a decentralized Maximum Likelihood solution for estimating the
stochastic renewable power generation and demand in single bus Direct Current
(DC) MicroGrids (MGs), with high penetration of droop controlled power
electronic converters. The solution relies on the fact that the primary control
parameters are set in accordance with the local power generation status of the
generators. Therefore, the steady state voltage is inherently dependent on the
generation capacities and the load, through a non-linear parametric model,
which can be estimated. To have a well conditioned estimation problem, our
solution avoids the use of an external communication interface and utilizes
controlled voltage disturbances to perform distributed training. Using this
tool, we develop an efficient, decentralized Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)
and formulate the sufficient condition for the existence of the globally
optimal solution. The numerical results illustrate the promising performance of
our MLE algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this article we propose a method to refine the clustering results obtained
with the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique, imposing consistency
constraints on the final labeling of the data. The research community focused
its effort on the initialization and on the optimization part of this method,
without paying attention to the final cluster assignments. We propose a game
theoretic framework in which each object to be clustered is represented as a
player, which has to choose its cluster membership. The information obtained
with NMF is used to initialize the strategy space of the players and a weighted
graph is used to model the interactions among the players. These interactions
allow the players to choose a cluster which is coherent with the clusters
chosen by similar players, a property which is not guaranteed by NMF, since it
produces a soft clustering of the data. The results on common benchmarks show
that our model is able to improve the performances of many NMF formulations.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the structure of the state space of chess by means of transition
path sampling Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the typical number of moves
required to transpose a given configuration of chess pieces into another, we
conclude that the state space consists of several pockets between which
transitions are rare. Skilled players explore an even smaller subset of
positions that populate some of these pockets only very sparsely. These results
suggest that the usual measures to estimate both, the size of the state space
and the size of the tree of legal moves, are not unique indicators of the
complexity of the game, but that topological considerations are equally
important.

 <dc:description>  The main aim of our study was to analyse the effects of a virtual environment
on social conformity, with particular attention to the effects of different
types of task and psychological variables on social influence, on one side, and
to the neural correlates related to conformity, measured by means of an Emotiv
EPOC device on the other. For our purpose, we replicated the famous Asch's
visual task and created two new tasks of increasing ambiguity, assessed through
the calculation of the item's entropy. We also administered five scales in
order to assess different psychological traits. From the experiment, conducted
on 181 university students, emerged that conformity grows according to the
ambiguity of the task, but normative influence is significantly weaker in
virtual environments, if compared to face-to-face experiments. The analysed
psycho-logical traits, however, result not to be relatable to conformity, and
they only affect the subjects' response times. From the ERP (Event-related
potentials) analysis, we detected N200 and P300 components comparing the plots
of conformist and non-conformist subjects, alongside with the detection of
their Late Positive Potential, Readiness Potential, and Error-Related
Negativity, which appear consistently different for the two typologies.

 <dc:description>  Detecting small obstacles on the road ahead is a critical part of the driving
task which has to be mastered by fully autonomous cars. In this paper, we
present a method based on stereo vision to reliably detect such obstacles from
a moving vehicle. The proposed algorithm performs statistical hypothesis tests
in disparity space directly on stereo image data, assessing freespace and
obstacle hypotheses on independent local patches. This detection approach does
not depend on a global road model and handles both static and moving obstacles.
For evaluation, we employ a novel lost-cargo image sequence dataset comprising
more than two thousand frames with pixelwise annotations of obstacle and
free-space and provide a thorough comparison to several stereo-based baseline
methods. The dataset will be made available to the community to foster further
research on this important topic. The proposed approach outperforms all
considered baselines in our evaluations on both pixel and object level and runs
at frame rates of up to 20 Hz on 2 mega-pixel stereo imagery. Small obstacles
down to the height of 5 cm can successfully be detected at 20 m distance at low
false positive rates.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we provide two introductory analyses of CAPs, based exclusively
on the analysis of documents found on the Internet. The first analysis allowed
us to investigate the world of CAPs, in particular for what concerned their
status (dead or alive), the scope of those platforms and the typology of users.
In order to develop a more accurate model of CAPs, and to understand more
deeply the motivation of the users and the type of expected payoff, we analysed
those CAPs from the above list that are still alive and we used two models
developed for what concerned the virtual community and the collective
intelligence.

 <dc:description>  Reputation systems are currently used, often with success, to ensure the
functioning of online services as well as of e-commerce sites. Despite the
relationship between reputation and material cooperative behaviours is quite
supported, less obvious appears the relationship with informative behaviours,
which are crucial for the transmission of reputational information and
therefore for the maintenance of cooperation among individuals. The purpose of
this study was to verify how reputation affects cooperation dynamics in virtual
environment, within a social dilemma situation (i.e., where there are
incentives to act selfishly). The results confirm that reputation can activate
prosocial conducts, however it highlights also the limitations and distortions
that reputation can create.

 <dc:description>  X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction from sparse number of views is
becoming a powerful way to reduce either the radiation dose or the acquisition
time in CT systems but still requires a huge computational time. This paper
introduces an approximate Bayesian inference framework for CT reconstruction
based on a family of denoising approximate message passing (DCT-AMP) algorithms
able to improve both the convergence speed and the reconstruction quality.
Approximate Message Passing for Compressed Sensing has been extensively
analysed for random linear measurements but there are still not clear solutions
on how AMP should be modified and how it performs with real world problems. In
particular to overcome the convergence issues of DCT-AMP with structured
measurement matrices, we propose a disjoint preconditioned version of the
algorithm tailored for both the geometric system model and the noise model. In
addition the Bayesian DCT-AMP formulation allows to measure how the current
estimate is close to the prediction by analysing the state evolution. This work
aims to provide a proof of concept to demonstrate that approximate Bayesian
reconstruction algorithms can be tailored for ill conditioned, underdetermined
real problems such CT imaging. Experiments with simulated and real CT baggage
scans confirm that the performance of the proposed algorithms are comparable
and can even outperform traditional statistical X-ray CT reconstruction
optimization solvers.

 <dc:description>  The main intreest of this study was to investigate the phenomenon of
collective intelligence in an anonymous virtual environment developed for this
purpose. In particular, we were interested in studiyng how dividing a fixed
community in different group size, which, in different phases of the
experiment, works to solve tasks of different complexity, influences the social
problem solving process. The experiments, which have involved 216 university
students, showed that the cooperative behaviour is stronger in small groups
facing complex tasks: the cooperation probability negatively correlated with
both the group size and easiness of task. Individuals seem to activate a
collective intelligence heuristics when the problem is too complex. Some
psychosocial variables were considered in order to check how they affect the
cooperative behaviour of participants, but they do not seem to have a
significant impact on individual cooperation probability, supporting the idea
that a partial de-individualization operates in virtual environments.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address a class of distributed optimization problems in the
presence of inter-agent communication delays based on passivity. We first focus
on unconstrained distributed optimization and provide a passivity-based
perspective for distributed optimization algorithms. This perspective allows us
to handle communication delays while using scattering transformation. Moreover,
we extend the results to constrained distributed optimization, where it is
shown that the problem is solved by just adding one more feedback loop of a
passive system to the solution of the unconstrained ones. We also show that
delays can be incorporated in the same way as the unconstrained problems.
Finally, the algorithm is applied to a visual human localization problem using
a pedestrian detection algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this briefing report, we introduce a new concept (war algorithms) that
elevates algorithmically-derived choices and decisions to a, and perhaps the,
central concern regarding technical autonomy in war. We thereby aim to shed
light on and recast the discussion regarding autonomous weapon systems. We
define war algorithm as any algorithm that is expressed in computer code, that
is effectuated through a constructed system, and that is capable of operating
in relation to armed conflict. In introducing this concept, our foundational
technological concern is the capability of a constructed system, without
further human intervention, to help make and effectuate a decision or choice of
a war algorithm. Distilled, the two core ingredients are an algorithm expressed
in computer code and a suitably capable constructed system. Through that lens,
we link international law and related accountability architectures to relevant
technologies. We sketch a three-part (non-exhaustive) approach that highlights
traditional and unconventional accountability avenues. We focus largely on
international law because it is the only normative regime that purports, in key
respects but with important caveats, to be both universal and uniform. By not
limiting our inquiry only to weapon systems, we take an expansive view, showing
how the broad concept of war algorithms might be susceptible to regulation, and
how those algorithms might already fit within the existing regulatory system
established by international law.

 <dc:title>Maximal Repetition and Zero Entropy Rate</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Maximal repetition of a string is the maximal length of a repeated substring.
This paper investigates maximal repetition of strings drawn from stochastic
processes. Strengthening previous results, two new bounds for the almost sure
growth rate of maximal repetition are identified: an upper bound in terms of
conditional R\'enyi entropy of order $\gamma&gt;1$ given a sufficiently long past
and a lower bound in terms of unconditional Shannon entropy ($\gamma=1$). Both
the upper and the lower bound can be proved using an inequality for the
distribution of recurrence time. We also supply an alternative proof of the
lower bound which makes use of an inequality for the expectation of subword
complexity. In particular, it is shown that a power-law logarithmic growth of
maximal repetition with respect to the string length, recently observed for
texts in natural language, may hold only if the conditional R\'enyi entropy
rate given a sufficiently long past equals zero. According to this observation,
natural language cannot be faithfully modeled by a typical hidden Markov
process, which is a class of basic language models used in computational
linguistics.

 <dc:description>  In the absence of reliable and accurate GPS, visual odometry (VO) has emerged
as an effective means of estimating the egomotion of robotic vehicles. Like any
dead-reckoning technique, VO suffers from unbounded accumulation of drift error
over time, but this accumulation can be limited by incorporating absolute
orientation information from, for example, a sun sensor. In this paper, we
leverage recent work on visual outdoor illumination estimation to show that
estimation error in a stereo VO pipeline can be reduced by inferring the sun
position from the same image stream used to compute VO, thereby gaining the
benefits of sun sensing without requiring a dedicated sun sensor or the sun to
be visible to the camera. We compare sun estimation methods based on
hand-crafted visual cues and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
demonstrate our approach on a combined 7.8 km of urban driving from the popular
KITTI dataset, achieving up to a 43% reduction in translational average root
mean squared error (ARMSE) and a 59% reduction in final translational drift
error compared to pure VO alone.

 <dc:description>  Android is the most widely used smartphone OS with 82.8% market share in
2015. It is therefore the most widely targeted system by malware authors.
Researchers rely on dynamic analysis to extract malware behaviors and often use
emulators to do so. However, using emulators lead to new issues. Malware may
detect emulation and as a result it does not execute the payload to prevent the
analysis. Dealing with virtual device evasion is a never-ending war and comes
with a non-negligible computation cost. To overcome this state of affairs, we
propose a system that does not use virtual devices for analysing malware
behavior. Glassbox is a functional prototype for the dynamic analysis of
malware applications. It executes applications on real devices in a monitored
and controlled environment. It is a fully automated system that installs, tests
and extracts features from the application for further analysis. We present the
architecture of the platform and we compare it with existing Android dynamic
analysis platforms. Lastly, we evaluate the capacity of Glassbox to trigger
application behaviors by measuring the average coverage of basic blocks on the
AndroCoverage dataset. We show that it executes on average 13.52% more basic
blocks than the Monkey program.

 <dc:description>  Preference orderings are orderings of a set of items according to the
preferences (of judges). Such orderings arise in a variety of domains,
including group decision making, consumer marketing, voting and machine
learning. Measuring the mutual information and extracting the common patterns
in a set of preference orderings are key to these areas. In this paper we deal
with the representation of sets of preference orderings, the quantification of
the degree to which judges agree on their ordering of the items (i.e. the
concordance), and the efficient, meaningful description of such sets.
  We propose to represent the orderings in a subsequence-based feature space
and present a new algorithm to calculate the size of the set of all common
subsequences - the basis of a quantification of concordance, not only for pairs
of orderings but also for sets of orderings. The new algorithm is fast and
storage efficient with a time complexity of only $O(Nn^2)$ for the orderings of
$n$ items by $N$ judges and a space complexity of only $O(\min\{Nn,n^2\})$.
  Also, we propose to represent the set of all $N$ orderings through a smallest
set of covering preferences and present an algorithm to construct this smallest
covering set.

 <dc:description>  We run experiments showing that algorithm clarans (Ng et al., 2005) finds
better K-medoids solutions than the Voronoi iteration algorithm. This finding,
along with the similarity between the Voronoi iteration algorithm and Lloyd's
K-means algorithm, suggests that clarans may be an effective K-means
initializer. We show that this is the case, with clarans outperforming other
seeding algorithms on 23/23 datasets with a mean decrease over K-means++ of 30%
for initialization mse and 3% or final mse. We describe how the complexity and
runtime of clarans can be improved, making it a viable initialization scheme
for large datasets.

 <dc:description>  We propose a theoretical framework to study the eigenvalue spectra of the
controllability Gramian of systems with random state matrices, such as
networked systems with a random graph structure. Using random matrix theory, we
provide expressions for the moments of the eigenvalue distribution of the
controllability Gramian. These moments can then be used to derive useful
properties of the eigenvalue distribution of the Gramian (in some cases, even
closed-form expressions for the distribution). We illustrate this framework by
considering system matrices derived from common random graph and matrix
ensembles, such as the Wigner ensemble, the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE),
and random regular graphs. Subsequently, we illustrate how the eigenvalue
distribution of the Gramian can be used to draw conclusions about the energy
required to control random system.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the Robotarium -- a remotely accessible, multi-robot
research facility. The impetus behind the Robotarium is that multi-robot
testbeds constitute an integral and essential part of the multi-robot research
cycle, yet they are expensive, complex, and time-consuming to develop, operate,
and maintain. These resource constraints, in turn, limit access for large
groups of researchers and students, which is what the Robotarium is remedying
by providing users with remote access to a state-of-the-art multi-robot test
facility. This paper details the design and operation of the Robotarium and
discusses the considerations one must take when making complex hardware
remotely accessible. In particular, safety must be built into the system
already at the design phase without overly constraining what coordinated
control programs users can upload and execute, which calls for minimally
invasive safety routines with provable performance guarantees.

 <dc:description>  Due to the enormous variety of application scenarios and ubiquity,Internet of
Things (IoT) brought a new perspective of applications for the current and
future Internet. The Wireless Sensor Networks provide key devices for
developing the IoT communication paradigm, such as the sensors collecting
various kind of information and the routing and MAC protocols. However, this
type of network has strong power consumption and transmission capacity
restrictions (low speed wireless links and subject to interference). In this
context, it is necessary to develop solutions that enable a more efficient
communication based on the optimized utilization of the network resources. This
papers aims to present a multi-objective routing algorithm, named Routing-Aware
of path Length, Link quality, and traffic Load (RALL), that seeks to balance
three objectives: to minimize bottlenecks, to minimize path length, and to
avoid links with low quality. RALL results in good performance when taking into
consideration delivery rate, overhead, delay, and power consumption.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a novel dataset for a critical aspect of autonomous
driving, the joint attention that must occur between drivers and of
pedestrians, cyclists or other drivers. This dataset is produced with the
intention of demonstrating the behavioral variability of traffic participants.
We also show how visual complexity of the behaviors and scene understanding is
affected by various factors such as different weather conditions, geographical
locations, traffic and demographics of the people involved. The ground truth
data conveys information regarding the location of participants (bounding
boxes), the physical conditions (e.g. lighting and speed) and the behavior of
the parties involved.

 <dc:description>  microMVP is an affordable, portable, and open source micro-scale mobile robot
platform designed for robotics research and education. As a complete and unique
multi-vehicle platform enabled by 3D printing and the maker culture, microMVP
can be easily reproduced and requires little maintenance: a set of six micro
vehicles, each measuring $8\times 5\times 6$ cubic centimeters and weighing
under $100$ grams, and the accompanying tracking platform can be fully
assembled in under two hours, all from readily available components. In this
paper, we describe microMVP's hardware and software architecture, and the
design thoughts that go into the making of the platform. The capabilities of
microMVP APIs are then demonstrated with several single- and multi-robot path
and motion planning algorithms. microMVP supports all common operation systems.

 <dc:title>On Unbounded Delays in Asynchronous Parallel Fixed-Point Algorithms</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The need for scalable numerical solutions has motivated the development of
asynchronous parallel algorithms, where a set of nodes run in parallel with
little or no synchronization, thus computing with delayed information. This
paper studies the convergence of the asynchronous parallel algorithm ARock
under potentially unbounded delays.
  ARock is a general asynchronous algorithm that has many applications. It
parallelizes fixed-point iterations by letting a set of nodes randomly choose
solution coordinates and update them in an asynchronous parallel fashion. ARock
takes some recent asynchronous coordinate descent algorithms as special cases
and gives rise to new asynchronous operator-splitting algorithms. Existing
analysis of ARock assumes the delays to be bounded, and uses this bound to set
a step size that is important to both convergence and efficiency. Other work,
though allowing unbounded delays, imposes strict conditions on the underlying
fixed-point operator, resulting in limited applications.
  In this paper, convergence is established under unbounded delays, which can
be either stochastic or deterministic. The proposed step sizes are more
practical and generally larger than those in the existing work. The step size
adapts to the delay distribution or the current delay being experienced in the
system. New Lyapunov functions, which are the key to analyzing asynchronous
algorithms, are generated to obtain our results. A set of applicable
optimization algorithms with large-scale applications are given, including
machine learning and scientific computing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Gradient descent optimization algorithms, while increasingly popular, are
often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their
strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the
reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms
that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look
at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the
most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and
distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing
gradient descent.

 <dc:title>Perceptual Quality Prediction on Authentically Distorted Images Using a
  Bag of Features Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghadiyaram, Deepti</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bovik, Alan C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Current top-performing blind perceptual image quality prediction models are
generally trained on legacy databases of human quality opinion scores on
synthetically distorted images. Therefore they learn image features that
effectively predict human visual quality judgments of inauthentic, and usually
isolated (single) distortions. However, real-world images usually contain
complex, composite mixtures of multiple distortions. We study the perceptually
relevant natural scene statistics of such authentically distorted images, in
different color spaces and transform domains. We propose a bag of feature-maps
approach which avoids assumptions about the type of distortion(s) contained in
an image, focusing instead on capturing consistencies, or departures therefrom,
of the statistics of real world images. Using a large database of authentically
distorted images, human opinions of them, and bags of features computed on
them, we train a regressor to conduct image quality prediction. We demonstrate
the competence of the features towards improving automatic perceptual quality
prediction by testing a learned algorithm using them on a benchmark legacy
database as well as on a newly introduced distortion-realistic resource called
the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database. We extensively evaluate
the perceptual quality prediction model and algorithm and show that it is able
to achieve good quality prediction power that is better than other leading
models.

 <dc:description>  Transport-based techniques for signal and data analysis have received
increased attention recently. Given their abilities to provide accurate
generative models for signal intensities and other data distributions, they
have been used in a variety of applications including content-based retrieval,
cancer detection, image super-resolution, and statistical machine learning, to
name a few, and shown to produce state of the art in several applications.
Moreover, the geometric characteristics of transport-related metrics have
inspired new kinds of algorithms for interpreting the meaning of data
distributions. Here we provide an overview of the mathematical underpinnings of
mass transport-related methods, including numerical implementation, as well as
a review, with demonstrations, of several applications.

 <dc:description>  This work investigates style and topic aspects of language in online
communities: looking at both utility as an identifier of the community and
correlation with community reception of content. Style is characterized using a
hybrid word and part-of-speech tag n-gram language model, while topic is
represented using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experiments with several Reddit
forums show that style is a better indicator of community identity than topic,
even for communities organized around specific topics. Further, there is a
positive correlation between the community reception to a contribution and the
style similarity to that community, but not so for topic similarity.

 <dc:description>  As OS-level virtualization technology usually imposes little overhead on
virtual machine start-up and running, it provides an excellent choice for
building intrusion/fault tolerant applications that require redundancy and
frequent invocation. When developing Windows OS-level virtual machine, however,
people will inevitably face the challenge of confining Windows Inter-Process
Communications (IPC). As IPC on Windows platform is more complex than UNIX
style OS and most of the programs on Windows are not open-source, it is
difficult to discover all of the performed IPCs and confine them. In this
paper, we propose three general principles to confine IPC on Windows OS and a
novel IPC confinement mechanism based on the principles. With the mechanism,
for the first time from the literature, we successfully virtualized RPC System
Service (RPCSS) and Internet Information Server (IIS) on Feather-weight Virtual
Machine (FVM). Experimental results demonstrate that multiple IIS web server
instances can simultaneously run on single Windows OS with much less
performance overhead than other popular VM technology, offering a good basis
for constructing dependable system.

 <dc:title>Mechanism Design with Exchangeable Allocations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate mechanism design without payments when agents have different
types of preferences. Contrary to most settings in the literature where agents
have the same preference, e.g. in the facility location games all agents would
like to stay close to (or away from) the facility, we demonstrate the
limitation of mechanism design without payments when agents have different
preferences by introducing exchanging phases. We consider two types of
exchanging phases. The first model is called central exchanges where the
exchanges are performed by a central authority. The other model is called
individual exchanges where agents exchange their outcomes by themselves. By
using facility location games as an example, we provide a truthful mechanism
that optimizes social welfare in central exchanges. We also provide a
universally truthful randomized mechanism that achieves at least a half of the
optimal social welfare in individual exchanges.

 <dc:description>  OS-level virtualization incurs smaller start-up and run-time overhead than
HAL-based virtualization and thus forms an important building block for
developing fault-tolerant and intrusion-tolerant applications. A complete
implementation of OS-level virtualization on the Windows platform requires
virtualization of Windows services, such as system services like the Remote
Procedure Call Server Service (RPCSS), because they are essentially extensions
of the kernel. As Windows system services work very differently from their
counterparts on UNIX-style OS, i.e., daemons, and many of their implementation
details are proprietary, virtualizing Windows system services turned out to be
the most challenging technical barrier for OS-level virtualization for the
Windows platform. In this paper, we describe a general technique to virtualize
Windows services, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to
successfully virtualize a set of important Windows system services and ordinary
services on different versions of Windows OS, including RPCSS, DcomLaunch, IIS
service group, Tlntsvr, MySQL, Apache2.2, CiSvc, ImapiService, etc.

 <dc:title>Coherence Pursuit: Fast, Simple, and Robust Principal Component Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a remarkably simple, yet powerful, algorithm termed
Coherence Pursuit (CoP) to robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA). As
inliers lie in a low dimensional subspace and are mostly correlated, an inlier
is likely to have strong mutual coherence with a large number of data points.
By contrast, outliers either do not admit low dimensional structures or form
small clusters. In either case, an outlier is unlikely to bear strong
resemblance to a large number of data points. Given that, CoP sets an outlier
apart from an inlier by comparing their coherence with the rest of the data
points. The mutual coherences are computed by forming the Gram matrix of the
normalized data points. Subsequently, the sought subspace is recovered from the
span of the subset of the data points that exhibit strong coherence with the
rest of the data. As CoP only involves one simple matrix multiplication, it is
significantly faster than the state-of-the-art robust PCA algorithms. We derive
analytical performance guarantees for CoP under different models for the
distributions of inliers and outliers in both noise-free and noisy settings.
CoP is the first robust PCA algorithm that is simultaneously non-iterative,
provably robust to both unstructured and structured outliers, and can tolerate
a large number of unstructured outliers.

 <dc:description>  Bibliometric indicators such as journal impact factors, h-indices, and total
citation counts are algorithmic artifacts that can be used in research
evaluation and management. These artifacts have no meaning by themselves, but
receive their meaning from attributions in institutional practices. We
distinguish four main stakeholders in these practices: (1) producers of
bibliometric data and indicators; (2) bibliometricians who develop and test
indicators; (3) research managers who apply the indicators; and (4) the
scientists being evaluated with potentially competing career interests. These
different positions may lead to different and sometimes conflicting
perspectives on the meaning and value of the indicators. The indicators can
thus be considered as boundary objects which are socially constructed in
translations among these perspectives. This paper proposes an analytical
clarification by listing an informed set of (sometimes unsolved) problems in
bibliometrics which can also shed light on the tension between simple but
invalid indicators that are widely used (e.g., the h-index) and more
sophisticated indicators that are not used or cannot be used in evaluation
practices because they are not transparent for users, cannot be calculated, or
are difficult to interpret.

 <dc:description>  Localization in a global map is critical to success in many autonomous robot
missions. This is particularly challenging for multi-robot operations in
unknown and adverse environments. Here, we are concerned with providing a small
unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) the ability to localize itself within a 2.5D
aerial map generated from imagery captured by a low-flying unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV). We consider the scenario where GPS is unavailable and
appearance-based scene changes may have occurred between the UAV's flight and
the start of the UGV's mission. We present a GPS-free solution to this
localization problem that is robust to appearance shifts by exploiting
high-level, semantic representations of image and depth data. Using data
gathered at an urban test site, we empirically demonstrate that our technique
yields results within five meters of a GPS-based approach.

 <dc:description>  Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image
super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one
central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture
details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of
optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice
of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the
mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak
signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and
are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity
expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a
generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our
knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic
natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a
perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content
loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold
using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the
super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use
a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in
pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic
textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive
mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual
quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of
the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any
state-of-the-art method.

 <dc:description>  Parallel finite element algorithms based on object-oriented concepts are
presented. Moreover, the design and implementation of a data structure proposed
are utilized in realizing a parallel geometric multigrid method. The
ParFEMapper and the ParFECommunicator are the key components of the data
structure in the proposed parallel scheme. These classes are constructed based
on the type of finite elements (continuous or nonconforming or discontinuous)
used. The proposed solver is compared with the open source direct solvers,
MUMPS and PasTiX. Further, the performance of the parallel multigrid solver is
analyzed up to 1080 processors. The solver shows a very good speedup up to 960
processors and the problem size has to be increased in order to maintain the
good speedup when the number of processors are increased further. As a result,
the parallel solver is able to handle large scale problems on massively
parallel supercomputers. The proposed parallel finite element algorithms and
multigrid solver are implemented in our in-house package ParMooN.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we tackle the direct and inverse problems for the Remote-Field
Eddy-Current (RFEC) technology. The direct problem is the sensor model, where
given the geometry the measurements are obtained. Conversely, the inverse
problem is where the geometry needs to be estimated given the field
measurements. These problems are particularly important in the field of
Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) because they allow assessing the quality of the
structure monitored. We solve the direct problem in a parametric fashion using
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operation (LASSO). The proposed inverse
model uses the parameters from the direct model to recover the thickness using
least squares producing the optimal solution given the direct model. This study
is restricted to the 2D axisymmetric scenario. Both, direct and inverse models,
are validated using a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) environment with realistic
pipe profiles.

 <dc:title>Visible Light-Based Human Visual System Conceptual Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Prangnell, Lee</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There is a widely held belief in the digital image and video processing
community, which is as follows: the Human Visual System (HVS) is more sensitive
to luminance (often confused with brightness) than photon energies (often
confused with chromaticity and chrominance). Passages similar to the following
occur with high frequency in the peer reviewed literature and academic text
books: &quot;the HVS is much more sensitive to brightness than colour&quot; or &quot;the HVS
is much more sensitive to luma than chroma&quot;. In this discussion paper, a
Visible Light-Based Human Visual System (VL-HVS) conceptual model is discussed.
The objectives of VL-HVS are as follows: 1. To facilitate a deeper theoretical
reflection of the fundamental relationship between visible light, the
manifestation of colour perception derived from visible light and the
physiology of the perception of colour. That is, in terms of the physics of
visible light, photobiology and the human subjective interpretation of visible
light, it is appropriate to provide comprehensive background information in
relation to the natural interactions between visible light, the retinal
photoreceptors and the subsequent cortical processing of such. 2. To provide a
more wholesome account with respect to colour information in digital image and
video processing applications. 3. To recontextualise colour data in the RGB and
YCbCr colour spaces, such that novel techniques in digital image and video
processing, including quantisation and artifact reduction techniques, may be
developed based on both luma and chroma information (not luma data only).

 <dc:description>  The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants are algorithms
of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch
regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say $32$-$512$ data points, is
sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in
practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality
of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the
cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present
numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to
converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is
well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast,
small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our
experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise
in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help
large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.

 <dc:description>  To provide constraints on their inversion, ocean sound speed profiles (SSPs)
often are modeled using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). However, this
regularization, which uses the leading order EOFs with a minimum-energy
constraint on their coefficients, often yields low resolution SSP estimates. In
this paper, it is shown that dictionary learning, a form of unsupervised
machine learning, can improve SSP resolution by generating a dictionary of
shape functions for sparse processing (e.g. compressive sensing) that optimally
compress SSPs; both minimizing the reconstruction error and the number of
coefficients. These learned dictionaries (LDs) are not constrained to be
orthogonal and thus, fit the given signals such that each signal example is
approximated using few LD entries. Here, LDs describing SSP observations from
the HF-97 experiment and the South China Sea are generated using the K-SVD
algorithm. These LDs better explain SSP variability and require fewer
coefficients than EOFs, describing much of the variability with one
coefficient. Thus, LDs improve the resolution of SSP estimates with negligible
computational burden.

 <dc:description>  5G networks are expected to be highly energy efficient, with a 10 times lower
consumption than today's systems. An effective way to achieve such a goal is to
act on the backhaul network by controlling the nodes operational state and the
allocation of traffic flows. To this end, in this paper we formulate
energy-efficient flow routing on the backhaul network as an optimization
problem. In light of its complexity, which impairs the solution in large-scale
scenarios, we then propose a heuristic approach. Our scheme, named EMMA, aims
to both turn off idle nodes and concentrate traffic on the smallest possible
set of links, which in its turn increases the number of idle nodes. We
implement EMMA on top of ONOS and derive experimental results by emulating the
network through Mininet. Our results show that EMMA provides excellent energy
saving performance, which closely approaches the optimum. In larger network
scenarios, the gain in energy consumption that EMMA provides with respect to
the simple benchmark where all nodes are active, is extremely high, reaching
almost 1 under medium-low traffic load.

 <dc:description>  Random Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of Neural Networks (NNs) that can
also be seen as a specific type of queuing network. They have been successfully
used in several domains during the last 25 years, as queuing networks to
analyze the performance of resource sharing in many engineering areas, as
learning tools and in combinatorial optimization, where they are seen as neural
systems, and also as models of neurological aspects of living beings. In this
article we focus on their learning capabilities, and more specifically, we
present a practical guide for using the RNN to solve supervised learning
problems. We give a general description of these models using almost
indistinctly the terminology of Queuing Theory and the neural one. We present
the standard learning procedures used by RNNs, adapted from similar
well-established improvements in the standard NN field. We describe in
particular a set of learning algorithms covering techniques based on the use of
first order and, then, of second order derivatives. We also discuss some issues
related to these objects and present new perspectives about their use in
supervised learning problems. The tutorial describes their most relevant
applications, and also provides a large bibliography.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we predict the likelihood of a player making a shot in
basketball from multiagent trajectories. Previous approaches to similar
problems center on hand-crafting features to capture domain specific knowledge.
Although intuitive, recent work in deep learning has shown this approach is
prone to missing important predictive features. To circumvent this issue, we
present a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach where we initially
represent the multiagent behavior as an image. To encode the adversarial nature
of basketball, we use a multi-channel image which we then feed into a CNN.
Additionally, to capture the temporal aspect of the trajectories we &quot;fade&quot; the
player trajectories. We find that this approach is superior to a traditional
FFN model. By using gradient ascent to create images using an already trained
CNN, we discover what features the CNN filters learn. Last, we find that a
combined CNN+FFN is the best performing network with an error rate of 39%.

 <dc:description>  Microtask crowdsourcing is increasingly critical to the creation of extremely
large datasets. As a result, crowd workers spend weeks or months repeating the
exact same tasks, making it necessary to understand their behavior over these
long periods of time. We utilize three large, longitudinal datasets of nine
million annotations collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk to examine claims
that workers fatigue or satisfice over these long periods, producing lower
quality work. We find that, contrary to these claims, workers are extremely
stable in their quality over the entire period. To understand whether workers
set their quality based on the task's requirements for acceptance, we then
perform an experiment where we vary the required quality for a large
crowdsourcing task. Workers did not adjust their quality based on the
acceptance threshold: workers who were above the threshold continued working at
their usual quality level, and workers below the threshold self-selected
themselves out of the task. Capitalizing on this consistency, we demonstrate
that it is possible to predict workers' long-term quality using just a glimpse
of their quality on the first five tasks.

 <dc:description>  Graphs are powerful abstractions for capturing complex relationships in
diverse application settings. An active area of research focuses on theoretical
models that define the generative mechanism of a graph. Yet given the
complexity and inherent noise in real datasets, it is still very challenging to
identify the best model for a given observed graph. We discuss a framework for
graph model selection that leverages a long list of graph topological
properties and a random forest classifier to learn and classify different graph
instances. We fully characterize the discriminative power of our approach as we
sweep through the parameter space of two generative models, the Erdos-Renyi and
the stochastic block model. We show that our approach gets very close to known
theoretical bounds and we provide insight on which topological features play a
critical discriminating role.

 <dc:description>  Understanding physical phenomena is a key competence that enables humans and
animals to act and interact under uncertain perception in previously unseen
environments containing novel objects and their configurations. Developmental
psychology has shown that such skills are acquired by infants from observations
at a very early stage.
  In this paper, we contrast a more traditional approach of taking a
model-based route with explicit 3D representations and physical simulation by
an {\em end-to-end} approach that directly predicts stability from appearance.
We ask the question if and to what extent and quality such a skill can directly
be acquired in a data-driven way---bypassing the need for an explicit
simulation at run-time.
  We present a learning-based approach based on simulated data that predicts
stability of towers comprised of wooden blocks under different conditions and
quantities related to the potential fall of the towers. We first evaluate the
approach on synthetic data and compared the results to human judgments on the
same stimuli. Further, we extend this approach to reason about future states of
such towers that in turn enables successful stacking.

 <dc:title>Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction beyond the Sentence Boundary</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Quirk, Chris</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The growing demand for structured knowledge has led to great interest in
relation extraction, especially in cases with limited supervision. However,
existing distance supervision approaches only extract relations expressed in
single sentences. In general, cross-sentence relation extraction is
under-explored, even in the supervised-learning setting. In this paper, we
propose the first approach for applying distant supervision to cross- sentence
relation extraction. At the core of our approach is a graph representation that
can incorporate both standard dependencies and discourse relations, thus
providing a unifying way to model relations within and across sentences. We
extract features from multiple paths in this graph, increasing accuracy and
robustness when confronted with linguistic variation and analysis error.
Experiments on an important extraction task for precision medicine show that
our approach can learn an accurate cross-sentence extractor, using only a small
existing knowledge base and unlabeled text from biomedical research articles.
Compared to the existing distant supervision paradigm, our approach extracted
twice as many relations at similar precision, thus demonstrating the prevalence
of cross-sentence relations and the promise of our approach.

 <dc:title>NPCs as People, Too: The Extreme AI Personality Engine</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  PK Dick once asked &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; In video games, a
similar question could be asked of non-player characters: Do NPCs have dreams?
Can they live and change as humans do? Can NPCs have personalities, and can
these develop through interactions with players, other NPCs, and the world
around them? Despite advances in personality AI for games, most NPCs are still
undeveloped and undeveloping, reacting with flat affect and predictable
routines that make them far less than human--in fact, they become little more
than bits of the scenery that give out parcels of information. This need not be
the case. Extreme AI, a psychology-based personality engine, creates adaptive
NPC personalities. Originally developed as part of the thesis &quot;NPCs as People:
Using Databases and Behaviour Trees to Give Non-Player Characters Personality,&quot;
Extreme AI is now a fully functioning personality engine using all thirty
facets of the Five Factor model of personality and an AI system that is live
throughout gameplay. This paper discusses the research leading to Extreme AI;
develops the ideas found in that thesis; discusses the development of other
personality engines; and provides examples of Extreme AI's use in two game
demos.

 <dc:description>  An accurate approximate formula of the die-out probability in a SIS epidemic
process on a network is proposed. The formula contains only three essential
parameters: the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network, the
effective infection rate of the virus, and the initial number of infected nodes
in the network. The die-out probability formula is compared with the exact
die-out probability in complete graphs, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, and a
power-law graph. Furthermore, as an example, the formula is applied to the
$N$-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation, to explicitly incorporate the
die-out.

 <dc:title>Are Delayed Issues Harder to Resolve? Revisiting Cost-to-Fix of Defects

 <dc:description>  Many practitioners and academics believe in a delayed issue effect (DIE);
i.e. the longer an issue lingers in the system, the more effort it requires to
resolve. This belief is often used to justify major investments in new
development processes that promise to retire more issues sooner.
  This paper tests for the delayed issue effect in 171 software projects
conducted around the world in the period from 2006--2014. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the largest study yet published on this effect. We found no
evidence for the delayed issue effect; i.e. the effort to resolve issues in a
later phase was not consistently or substantially greater than when issues were
resolved soon after their introduction.
  This paper documents the above study and explores reasons for this mismatch
between this common rule of thumb and empirical data. In summary, DIE is not
some constant across all projects. Rather, DIE might be an historical relic
that occurs intermittently only in certain kinds of projects. This is a
significant result since it predicts that new development processes that
promise to faster retire more issues will not have a guaranteed return on
investment (depending on the context where applied), and that a long-held truth
in software engineering should not be considered a global truism.

 <dc:description>  The design of mobile autonomous robots is challenging due to the limited
on-board resources such as processing power and energy. A promising approach is
to generate intelligent schedules that reduce the resource consumption while
maintaining best performance, or more interestingly, to trade off reduced
resource consumption for a slightly lower but still acceptable level of
performance. In this paper, we provide a framework to aid designers in
exploring such resource-performance trade-offs and finding schedules for mobile
robots, guided by questions such as &quot;what is the minimum resource budget
required to achieve a given level of performance?&quot; The framework is based on a
quantitative multi-objective verification technique which, for a collection of
possibly conflicting objectives, produces the Pareto front that contains all
the optimal trade-offs that are achievable. The designer then selects a
specific Pareto point based on the resource constraints and desired performance
level, and a correct-by-construction schedule that meets those constraints is
automatically generated. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on
several robotic scenarios in both simulations and experiments with encouraging
results.

 <dc:description>  Wireless-powered communications will entail short packets due to naturally
small payloads, low latency requirements and/or insufficient energy resources
to support longer transmissions. In this paper, a wireless-powered
communication system is investigated where an energy harvesting transmitter,
charged by a power beacon via wireless energy transfer, attempts to communicate
with a receiver over a noisy channel. Leveraging the framework of finite-length
information theory, the system performance is analyzed using metrics such as
the energy supply probability at the transmitter, and the achievable rate at
the receiver. The analysis yields useful insights into the system behavior in
terms of key parameters such as the harvest blocklength, the transmit
blocklength, the average harvested power and the transmit power. Closed-form
expressions are derived for the asymptotically optimal transmit power.
Numerical results suggest that power control is essential for improving the
achievable rate of the system in the finite blocklength regime.

 <dc:description>  Given a set ${\cal AL}$ of community detection algorithms and a graph $G$ as
inputs, we propose two ensemble methods $\mathtt{EnDisCO}$ and $\mathtt{MeDOC}$
that (respectively) identify disjoint and overlapping communities in $G$.
$\mathtt{EnDisCO}$ transforms a graph into a latent feature space by leveraging
multiple base solutions and discovers disjoint community structure.
$\mathtt{MeDOC}$ groups similar base communities into a meta-community and
detects both disjoint and overlapping community structures. Experiments are
conducted at different scales on both synthetically generated networks as well
as on several real-world networks for which the underlying ground-truth
community structure is available. Our extensive experiments show that both
algorithms outperform state-of-the-art non-ensemble algorithms by a significant
margin. Moreover, we compare $\mathtt{EnDisCO}$ and $\mathtt{MeDOC}$ with a
recent ensemble method for disjoint community detection and show that our
approaches achieve superior performance. To the best of our knowledge,
$\mathtt{MeDOC}$ is the first ensemble approach for overlapping community
detection.

 <dc:description>  Analyses of text corpora over time can reveal trends in beliefs, interest,
and sentiment about a topic. We focus on views expressed about artificial
intelligence (AI) in the New York Times over a 30-year period. General
interest, awareness, and discussion about AI has waxed and waned since the
field was founded in 1956. We present a set of measures that captures levels of
engagement, measures of pessimism and optimism, the prevalence of specific
hopes and concerns, and topics that are linked to discussions about AI over
decades. We find that discussion of AI has increased sharply since 2009, and
that these discussions have been consistently more optimistic than pessimistic.
However, when we examine specific concerns, we find that worries of loss of
control of AI, ethical concerns for AI, and the negative impact of AI on work
have grown in recent years. We also find that hopes for AI in healthcare and
education have increased over time.

 <dc:description>  We state a new problem of \emph{itinerant routing} in elastic optical
networks, which we define as the establishment and reconfiguration of an
\emph{itinerant connection}. In an itinerant connection, one of the connection
end nodes is allowed to change. Itinerant routing could also be considered a
form of connection restoration, where a connection has to be restored to a
different end node. With the introduction of new mobile-network architectures,
the progressing integration of wireless and optical networks, the continuing
growth of wireless high-bitrate services, and the eventual deployment of
elastic optical networks, there is a need to support this itinerant routing in
the elastic optical networks. We present and discuss two major use cases of the
itinerant routing, and propose a \emph{novel reconfiguration algorithm}. Our
algorithm does not deteriorate the network performance, and requires half as
many new links to configure as the shortest-path reconfiguration algorithm. The
performance evaluation was carried out with 46800 simulation runs using
randomly-generated realistic transport networks.

 <dc:title>An Iterative Transfer Learning Based Ensemble Technique for Automatic

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Automatic short answer grading (ASAG) techniques are designed to
automatically assess short answers to questions in natural language, having a
length of a few words to a few sentences. Supervised ASAG techniques have been
demonstrated to be effective but suffer from a couple of key practical
limitations. They are greatly reliant on instructor provided model answers and
need labeled training data in the form of graded student answers for every
assessment task. To overcome these, in this paper, we introduce an ASAG
technique with two novel features. We propose an iterative technique on an
ensemble of (a) a text classifier of student answers and (b) a classifier using
numeric features derived from various similarity measures with respect to model
answers. Second, we employ canonical correlation analysis based transfer
learning on a common feature representation to build the classifier ensemble
for questions having no labelled data. The proposed technique handsomely beats
all winning supervised entries on the SCIENTSBANK dataset from the Student
Response Analysis task of SemEval 2013. Additionally, we demonstrate
generalizability and benefits of the proposed technique through evaluation on
multiple ASAG datasets from different subject topics and standards.

 <dc:title>Design of an Optoelectronic State Machine with integrated BDD based
  Optical logic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Coggins, Macauley</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper I demonstrate a novel design for an optoelectronic State
Machine which replaces input/output forming logic found in conventional state
machines with BDD based optical logic while still using solid state memory in
the form of flip-flops in order to store states. This type of logic makes use
of waveguides and ring resonators to create binary switches. These switches in
turn can be used to create combinational logic which can be used as
input/output forming logic for a state machine. Replacing conventional
combinational logic with BDD based optical logic allows for a faster range of
state machines that can certainly outperform conventional state machines as
propagation delays within the logic described are in the order of picoseconds
as opposed to nanoseconds in digital logic.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a temporal Steiner network problem in which a graph, as well as
changes to its edges and/or vertices over a set of discrete times, are given as
input; the goal is to find a minimal subgraph satisfying a set of $k$
time-sensitive connectivity demands. We show that this problem, $k$-Temporal
Steiner Network ($k$-TSN), is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of $k -
\epsilon$, for every fixed $k \geq 2$ and $\epsilon &gt; 0$. This bound is tight,
as certified by a trivial approximation algorithm. Conceptually this
demonstrates, in contrast to known results for traditional Steiner problems,
that a time dimension adds considerable complexity even when the problem is
offline.
  We also discuss special cases of $k$-TSN in which the graph changes satisfy a
monotonicity property. We show approximation-preserving reductions from
monotonic $k$-TSN to well-studied problems such as Priority Steiner Tree and
Directed Steiner Tree, implying improved approximation algorithms.
  Lastly, $k$-TSN and its variants arise naturally in computational biology; to
facilitate such applications, we devise an integer linear program for $k$-TSN
based on network flows.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a resistive switching memristor cell for

Building on the same principle we implement a half adder and a 4-bit CLA (Carry

 <dc:description>  Non-linear neuron models overcomes the limitations of linear binary models of
neurons that have the inability to compute linearly non-separable functions
such as XOR. While several biologically plausible models based on dendrite
thresholds are reported in the previous studies, the hardware implementation of
such non-linear neuron models remain as an open problem. In this paper, we
propose a circuit design for implementing logical dendrite non-linearity
response of dendrite spike and saturation types. The proposed dendrite cells
are used to build XOR circuit and intensity detection circuit that consists of
different combinations of dendrite cells with saturating and spiking responses.
The dendrite cells are designed using a set of memristors, Zener diodes, and
CMOS NOT gates. The circuits are designed, analyzed and verified on circuit
boards.

 <dc:title>Indicators as judgment devices: Citizen bibliometrics in biomedicine and

 <dc:creator>Hammarfelt, Bjorn</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The number of publications has been a fundamental merit in the competition
for academic positions since the late 18th century. Today, the simple counting
of publications has been supplemented with a whole range of bibliometric
measures, which supposedly not only measures the volume of research but also
its impact. In this study, we investigate how bibliometrics are used for
evaluating the impact and quality of publications in two specific settings:
biomedicine and economics. Our study exposes the extent and type of metrics
used in external evaluations of candidates for academic positions at Swedish
universities. Moreover, we show how different bibliometric indicators, both
explicitly and implicitly, are employed to value and rank candidates. Our
findings contribute to a further understanding of bibliometric indicators as
judgment devices that are employed in evaluating individuals and their
published works within specific fields. We also show how expertise in using
bibliometrics for evaluative purposes is negotiated at the interface between
domain knowledge and skills in using indicators. In line with these results we
propose that the use of metrics in this context is best described as a form of
citizen bibliometrics - an underspecified term which we build upon in the
paper.

 <dc:description>  We present a neural encoder-decoder model to convert images into
presentational markup based on a scalable coarse-to-fine attention mechanism.
Our method is evaluated in the context of image-to-LaTeX generation, and we
introduce a new dataset of real-world rendered mathematical expressions paired
with LaTeX markup. We show that unlike neural OCR techniques using CTC-based
models, attention-based approaches can tackle this non-standard OCR task. Our
approach outperforms classical mathematical OCR systems by a large margin on
in-domain rendered data, and, with pretraining, also performs well on
out-of-domain handwritten data. To reduce the inference complexity associated
with the attention-based approaches, we introduce a new coarse-to-fine
attention layer that selects a support region before applying attention.

 <dc:description>  Uncertainty is a major difficulty in endowing robots with autonomy. Robots
often fail due to unexpected events. In robot contact tasks are often design to
empirically look for force thresholds to define state transitions in a Markov
chain or finite state machines. Such design is prone to failure in unstructured
environments, when due to external disturbances or erroneous models, such
thresholds are met, and lead to state transitions that are false-positives. The
focus of this paper is to perform high-level state estimation of robot
behaviors and task output for robot contact tasks. Our approach encodes raw
low-level 3D cartesian trajectories and converts them into a high level (HL)
action grammars. Cartesian trajectories can be segmented and encoded in a way
that their dynamic properties, or &quot;texture&quot; are preserved. Once an action
grammar is generated, a classifier is trained to detect current behaviors and
ultimately the task output. The system executed HL state estimation for task
output verification with an accuracy of 86%, and behavior monitoring with an
average accuracy of: 72%. The significance of the work is the transformation of
difficult-to-use raw low-level data to HL data that enables robust behavior and
task monitoring. Monitoring is useful for failure correction or other
deliberation in high-level planning, programming by demonstration, and
human-robot interaction to name a few.

 <dc:description>  Robotic failure is all too common in unstructured robot tasks. Despite well
designed controllers, robots often fail due to unexpected events. How do robots
measure unexpected events? Many do not. Most robots are driven by the
senseplan- act paradigm, however more recently robots are working with a
sense-plan-act-verify paradigm. In this work we present a principled
methodology to bootstrap robot introspection for contact tasks. In effect, we
are trying to answer the question, what did the robot do? To this end, we
hypothesize that all noisy wrench data inherently contains patterns that can be
effectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is generated by
meaningfully segmenting the data and then encoding it. When the wrench
information represents a sequence of sub-tasks, we can think of the vocabulary
forming sets of words or sentences, such that each subtask is uniquely
represented by a word set. Such sets can be classified using statistical or
machine learning techniques. We use SVMs and Mondrian Forests to classify
contacts tasks both in simulation and in real robots for one and dual arm
scenarios showing the general robustness of the approach. The contribution of
our work is the presentation of a simple but generalizable semantic scheme that
enables a robot to understand its high level state. This verification mechanism
can provide feedback for high-level planners or reasoning systems that use
semantic descriptors as well. The code, data, and other supporting
documentation can be found at:

 <dc:title>Finding Disjoint Paths on Edge-Colored Graphs: More Tractability Results</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dondi, Riccardo</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sikora, Florian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of finding the maximum number of vertex-disjoint uni-color paths
in an edge-colored graph (called MaxCDP) has been recently introduced in
literature, motivated by applications in social network analysis. In this paper
we investigate how the complexity of the problem depends on graph parameters
(namely the number of vertices to remove to make the graph a collection of
disjoint paths and the size of the vertex cover of the graph), which makes
sense since graphs in social networks are not random and have structure. The
problem was known to be hard to approximate in polynomial time and not
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) for the natural parameter. Here, we show that
it is still hard to approximate, even in FPT-time. Finally, we introduce a new
variant of the problem, called MaxCDDP, whose goal is to find the maximum
number of vertex-disjoint and color-disjoint uni-color paths. We extend some of
the results of MaxCDP to this new variant, and we prove that unlike MaxCDP,
MaxCDDP is already hard on graphs at distance two from disjoint paths.

 <dc:description>  Authcoin is an alternative approach to the commonly used public key
infrastructures such as central authorities and the PGP web of trust. It
combines a challenge response-based validation and authentication process for
domains, certificates, email accounts and public keys with the advantages of a
block chain-based storage system. As a result, Authcoin does not suffer from
the downsides of existing solutions and is much more resilient to sybil
attacks.

 <dc:title>On Covering Codes and Upper Bounds for the Dimension of Simple Games</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Olsen, Martin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Consider a situation with $n$ agents or players where some of the players
form a coalition with a certain collective objective. Simple games are used to
model systems that can decide whether coalitions are successful (winning) or
not (losing). A simple game can be viewed as a monotone boolean function. The
dimension of a simple game is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that the
simple game can be expressed as the intersection of $d$ threshold functions
where each threshold function uses a threshold and $n$ weights. Taylor and
Zwicker have shown that $d$ is bounded from above by the number of maximal
losing coalitions. We present two new upper bounds both containing the
Taylor/Zwicker-bound as a special case. The Taylor/Zwicker-bound imply an upper
bound of ${n \choose n/2}$. We improve this upper bound significantly by
showing constructively that $d$ is bounded from above by the cardinality of any
binary covering code with length $n$ and covering radius $1$. This result
supplements a recent result where Olsen et al. showed how to construct simple
games with dimension $|C|$ for any binary constant weight SECDED code $C$ with
length $n$. Our result represents a major step in the attempt to close the
dimensionality gap for simple games.

 <dc:description>  We introduce exploration potential, a quantity that measures how much a
reinforcement learning agent has explored its environment class. In contrast to
information gain, exploration potential takes the problem's reward structure
into account. This leads to an exploration criterion that is both necessary and
sufficient for asymptotic optimality (learning to act optimally across the
entire environment class). Our experiments in multi-armed bandits use
exploration potential to illustrate how different algorithms make the tradeoff
between exploration and exploitation.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a set of state access patterns suitable for managing state in
embarrassingly parallel computations on streams. The state access patterns are
useful to model typical stream parallel applications. We present a
classification of the patterns according to the extent and way in which the
state is modified. We define precisely the state access patterns and discuss
possible implementation schemas, performances and possibilities to manage
adaptivity (parallelism degree) in the patterns. We present experimental
results relative to an implementations on top of the structured parallel
programming framework FastFlow that demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency
of the proposed access patterns.

 <dc:title>Explaining the emergence of echo chambers on social media: the role of
  ideology and extremism</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bright, Jonathan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The emergence of politically driven divisions in online discussion networks
has attracted a wealth of literature, but also one which has thus far been
largely limited to single country studies. Hence whilst there is good evidence
that these networks do divide and fragment into what are often described as
&quot;echo chambers&quot;, we know little about the factors which might explain this
division or make networks more or less fragmented, as studies have been limited
to a small number of political groupings with limited possibilities for
systematic comparison.
  This paper seeks to remedy this deficit, by providing a systematic large
scale study of fragmentation on Twitter which considers discussion networks
surrounding 90 different political parties in 23 different countries. It shows
that political party groupings which are further apart in ideological terms
interact less, and that individuals and parties which sit at the extreme ends
of the ideological scale are particularly likely to form echo chambers. Indeed,
exchanges between centrist parties who sit on different sides of the left-right
divide are more likely than communication between centrist and extremist
parties who are, notionally, from the same ideological wing. In light of the
results, theory about exposure to different ideological viewpoints online is
discussed and enhanced.

 <dc:description>  We consider optimal channel shortener design for reduced-state soft-output
Viterbi equalizer (RS-SOVE) in single-carrier (SC) systems. To use RS-SOVE,
three receiver filters need to be designed: a prefilter, a target response and
a feedback filter. The collection of these three filters are commonly referred
to as the \lq\lq{}channel shortener\rq\rq{}. Conventionally, the channel
shortener is designed to transform an intersymbol interference (ISI) channel
into an equivalent minimum-phase equivalent form. In this paper, we design the
channel shortener to maximize a mutual information lower bound (MILB) based on
a mismatched detection model. By taking the decision-feedback quality in the
RS-SOVE into consideration, the prefilter and feedback filter are found in
closed forms, while the target response is optimized via a gradient-ascending
approach with the gradient explicitly derived. The information theoretical
properties of the proposed channel shortener are analyzed. Moreover, we show
through numerical results that, the proposed channel shortener design achieves
superior detection performance compared to previous channel shortener designs
at medium and high code-rates.

 <dc:title>A Formal Algebra for OLAP</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kuijpers, Bart</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Vaisman, Alejandro</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) comprises tools and algorithms that allow
querying multidimensional databases. It is based on the multidimensional model,
where data can be seen as a cube, where each cell contains one or more measures
can be aggregated along dimensions. Despite the extensive corpus of work in the
field, a standard language for OLAP is still needed, since there is no
well-defined, accepted semantics, for many of the usual OLAP operations. In
this paper, we address this problem, and present a set of operations for
manipulating a data cube. We clearly define the semantics of these operations,
and prove that they can be composed, yielding a language powerful enough to
express complex OLAP queries. We express these operations as a sequence of
atomic transformations over a fixed multidimensional matrix, whose cells
contain a sequence of measures. Each atomic transformation produces a new
measure. When a sequence of transformations defines an OLAP operation, a flag
is produced indicating which cells must be considered as input for the next
operation. In this way, an elegant algebra is defined. Our main contribution,
with respect to other similar efforts in the field is that, for the first time,
a formal proof of the correctness of the operations is given, thus providing a
clear semantics for them. We believe the present work will serve as a basis to
build more solid practical tools for data analysis.

 <dc:description>  When factorizing binary matrices, we often have to make a choice between
using expensive combinatorial methods that retain the discrete nature of the
data and using continuous methods that can be more efficient but destroy the
discrete structure. Alternatively, we can first compute a continuous
factorization and subsequently apply a rounding procedure to obtain a discrete
representation. But what will we gain by rounding? Will this yield lower
reconstruction errors? Is it easy to find a low-rank matrix that rounds to a
given binary matrix? Does it matter which threshold we use for rounding? Does
it matter if we allow for only non-negative factorizations? In this paper, we
approach these and further questions by presenting and studying the concept of
rounding rank. We show that rounding rank is related to linear classification,
dimensionality reduction, and nested matrices. We also report on an extensive
experimental study that compares different algorithms for finding good
factorizations under the rounding rank model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we extend the relation between convolutional codes and linear
systems over finite fields to certain commutative rings through first order
representations . We introduce the definition of rings with representations as
those for which these representations always exist, and we show that finite
products of finite fields belong to this class. We develop the
input/state/output representations for convolutional codes over these rings,
and we show how to use them to construct observable convolutional codes as in
the classical case.

 <dc:description>  A Bayesian agent acting in a multi-agent environment learns to predict the
other agents' policies if its prior assigns positive probability to them (in
other words, its prior contains a \emph{grain of truth}). Finding a reasonably
large class of policies that contains the Bayes-optimal policies with respect
to this class is known as the \emph{grain of truth problem}. Only small classes
are known to have a grain of truth and the literature contains several related
impossibility results. In this paper we present a formal and general solution
to the full grain of truth problem: we construct a class of policies that
contains all computable policies as well as Bayes-optimal policies for every
lower semicomputable prior over the class. When the environment is unknown,
Bayes-optimal agents may fail to act optimally even asymptotically. However,
agents based on Thompson sampling converge to play {\epsilon}-Nash equilibria
in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. While these results
are purely theoretical, we show that they can be computationally approximated
arbitrarily closely.

Despite its global impact, there still remain a number of open questions
related to better understanding of tourists and their habits. In this work we
analyze the largest data set of travel receipts considered thus far, and focus
on exploring and modeling booking behavior of online customers. We extract
useful, actionable insights into the booking behavior, and tackle the task of
predicting the booking time. The presented results can be directly used to
improve booking experience of customers and optimize targeting campaigns of

 <dc:description>  Hybrid multiple-antenna transceivers, which combine large-dimensional analog
pre/postprocessing with lower-dimensional digital processing, are the most
promising approach for reducing the hardware cost and training overhead in
massive MIMO systems. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the various
incarnations of such structures that have been proposed in the literature. We
provide a taxonomy in terms of the required channel state information (CSI),
namely whether the processing adapts to the instantaneous or the average
(second-order) CSI; while the former provides somewhat better signal-to-noise
and interference ratio (SNIR), the latter has much lower overhead for CSI
acquisition. We furthermore distinguish hardware structures of different
complexities. Finally, we point out the special design aspects for operation at
millimeter-wave frequencies.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new way of formalizing the intensional identity type based on
the notion of computational paths which will be taken to be proofs of
propositional equality, and thus terms of the identity type. Our approach
results in an elimination rule different than the one given by Martin-L\&quot;of in
his intensional identity type. In order to show the validity and power of our
approach, we formulate and prove the basic concepts, lemmas and theorems of
Homotopy Type Theory using computational paths. We also show that these proves
and formulations resulted, as a side effect, in the improvement, by means of
the addition of new rules, of a term rewrite system known as LND_{EQ}-TRS,
originally proposed by de Oliveira (1995).

 <dc:title>Block Compressed Sensing Based Distributed Device Detection for M2M

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we utilize the framework of compressed sensing (CS) for
distributed device detection and resource allocation in large-scale
machine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks. The devices deployed in the
network are partitioned into clusters according to some pre-defined criteria.
Moreover, the devices in each cluster are assigned a unique signature of a
particular design that can be used to indicate their active status to the
network. The proposed scheme in this work mainly consists of two essential
steps: (i) The base station (BS) detects the active clusters and the number of
active devices in each cluster using a novel block sketching algorithm, and
then assigns a certain amount of resources accordingly. (ii) Each active device
detects its ranking among all the active devices in its cluster using an
enhanced greedy algorithm and accesses the corresponding resource for
transmission based on the ranking. By exploiting the correlation in the device
behaviors and the sparsity in the activation pattern of the M2M devices, the
device detection problem is thus tackled as a CS support recovery procedure for
a particular binary block-sparse signal $x\in\mathbb{B}^N$ -- with block
sparsity $K_B$ and in-block sparsity $K_I$ over block size $d$. Theoretical
analysis shows that the activation pattern of the M2M devices can be reliably
reconstructed within an acquisition time of $\mathcal{O}(\max\{K_B\log N,
K_BK_I\log d\})$, which achieves a better scaling and less computational
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N(K_I^2+\log N))$ compared with standard CS
algorithms. Moreover, extensive simulations confirm the robustness of the
proposed scheme in the detection process, especially in terms of higher
detection probability and reduced access delay when compared with conventional
schemes like LTE random access (RA) procedure and classic cluster-based access
approaches.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Growing interest in modeling large, complex networks has spurred significant
research into generative graph models. Kronecker-style models (SKG and R-MAT)
are often used due to their scalability and ability to mimic key properties of
real-world networks. Although a few papers theoretically establish these
models' behavior for specific parameters, many claims used to justify their use
are supported only empirically. In this work, we prove several results using
asymptotic analysis which illustrate that empirical studies may not fully
capture the true behavior of the models.
  Paramount to the widespread adoption of Kronecker-style models was the
introduction of a linear-time edge-sampling variant (R-MAT), which existing
literature typically treats as interchangeable with SKG. We prove that although
several R-MAT formulations are asymptotically equivalent, their behavior
diverges from that of SKG. Further, we show these results are observable even
at relatively small graph sizes. Second, we consider a case where asymptotic
analysis reveals unexpected behavior within a given model.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates secrecy rate optimization for a multicasting network,
in which a transmitter broadcasts the same information to multiple legitimate
users in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In order to improve the
achievable secrecy rates, private jammers are employed to generate interference
to confuse the eavesdroppers. These private jammers charge the legitimate
transmitter for their jamming services based on the amount of interference
received at the eavesdroppers. Therefore, this secrecy rate maximization
problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game, in which the private jammers and
the transmitter are the leaders and the follower of the game, respectively. A
fixed interference price scenario is considered first, in which a closed-form
solution is derived for the optimal amount of interference generated by the
jammers to maximize the revenue of the legitimate transmitter. Based on this
solution, the Stackelberg equilibrium of the proposed game, at which both
legitimate transmitter and the private jammers achieve their maximum revenues,
is then derived. Simulation results are also provided to validate these
theoretical derivations.

 <dc:title>Online Learning for Offloading and Autoscaling in Renewable-Powered
  Mobile Edge Computing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Xu, Jie</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mobile edge computing (a.k.a. fog computing) has recently emerged to enable
\emph{in-situ} processing of delay-sensitive applications at the edge of mobile
networks. Providing grid power supply in support of mobile edge computing,
however, is costly and even infeasible (in certain rugged or under-developed
areas), thus mandating on-site renewable energy as a major or even sole power
supply in increasingly many scenarios. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and
unpredictability of renewable energy make it very challenging to deliver a high
quality of service to users in renewable-powered mobile edge computing systems.
In this paper, we address the challenge of incorporating renewables into mobile
edge computing and propose an efficient reinforcement learning-based resource
management algorithm, which learns on-the-fly the optimal policy of dynamic
workload offloading (to centralized cloud) and edge server provisioning to
minimize the long-term system cost (including both service delay and
operational cost). Our online learning algorithm uses a decomposition of the
(offline) value iteration and (online) reinforcement learning, thus achieving a
significant improvement of learning rate and run-time performance when compared
to standard reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning.

 <dc:description>  As data sets grow in size, analytics applications struggle to get instant
insight into large datasets. Modern applications involve heavy batch processing
jobs over large volumes of data and at the same time require efficient ad-hoc
interactive analytics on temporary data. Existing solutions, however, typically
focus on one of these two aspects, largely ignoring the need for synergy
between the two. Consequently, interactive queries need to re-iterate costly
passes through the entire dataset (e.g., data loading) that may provide
meaningful return on investment only when data is queried over a long period of
time. In this paper, we propose DiNoDB, an interactive-speed query engine for
ad-hoc queries on temporary data. DiNoDB avoids the expensive loading and
transformation phase that characterizes both traditional RDBMSs and current
interactive analytics solutions. It is tailored to modern workflows found in
machine learning and data exploration use cases, which often involve iterations
of cycles of batch and interactive analytics on data that is typically useful
for a narrow processing window. The key innovation of DiNoDB is to piggyback on
the batch processing phase the creation of metadata that DiNoDB exploits to
expedite the interactive queries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that
DiNoDB achieves very good performance for a wide range of ad-hoc queries
compared to alternatives %such as Hive, Stado, SparkSQL and Impala.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Learning the parameters of complex probabilistic-relational models from
labeled training data is a standard technique in machine learning, which has
been intensively studied in the subfield of Statistical Relational Learning
(SRL), but---so far---this is still an under-investigated topic in the context
of Probabilistic Databases (PDBs). In this paper, we focus on learning the
probability values of base tuples in a PDB from labeled lineage formulas. The
resulting learning problem can be viewed as the inverse problem to confidence
computations in PDBs: given a set of labeled query answers, learn the
probability values of the base tuples, such that the marginal probabilities of
the query answers again yield in the assigned probability labels. We analyze
the learning problem from a theoretical perspective, cast it into an
optimization problem, and provide an algorithm based on stochastic gradient
descent. Finally, we conclude by an experimental evaluation on three real-world
and one synthetic dataset, thus comparing our approach to various techniques
from SRL, reasoning in information extraction, and optimization.

 <dc:description>  Using a known speaker-intrinsic normalization procedure, formant data are
scaled by the reciprocal of the geometric mean of the first three formant
frequencies. This reduces the influence of the talker but results in a
distorted vowel space. The proposed speaker-extrinsic procedure re-scales the
normalized values by the mean formant values of vowels. When tested on the
formant data of vowels published by Peterson and Barney, the combined approach
leads to well separated clusters by reducing the spread due to talkers. The
proposed procedure performs better than two top-ranked normalization procedures
based on the accuracy of vowel classification as the objective measure.

 <dc:title>Parameterized and Approximation Complexity of Partial VC Dimension</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We introduce the problem Partial VC Dimension that asks, given a hypergraph
$H=(X,E)$ and integers $k$ and $\ell$, whether one can select a set $C\subseteq
X$ of $k$ vertices of $H$ such that the set $\{e\cap C, e\in E\}$ of distinct
hyperedge-intersections with $C$ has size at least $\ell$. The sets $e\cap C$
define equivalence classes over $E$. Partial VC Dimension is a generalization
of VC Dimension, which corresponds to the case $\ell=2^k$, and of
Distinguishing Transversal, which corresponds to the case $\ell=|E|$ (the
latter is also known as Test Cover in the dual hypergraph). We also introduce
the associated fixed-cardinality maximization problem Max Partial VC Dimension
that aims at maximizing the number of equivalence classes induced by a solution
set of $k$ vertices. We study the algorithmic complexity of Partial VC
Dimension and Max Partial VC Dimension both on general hypergraphs and on more
restricted instances, in particular, neighborhood hypergraphs of graphs.

 <dc:title>Detection with Multimodal Dependent Data Using Low Dimensional Random
  Projections</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Performing likelihood ratio based detection with high dimensional multimodal
data is a challenging problem since the computation of the joint probability
density functions (pdfs) in the presence of inter-modal dependence is
difficult. While some computationally expensive approaches have been proposed
for dependent multimodal data fusion (e.g., based on copula theory), a commonly
used tractable approach is to compute the joint pdf as the product of marginal
pdfs ignoring dependence. However, this method leads to poor performance when
the data is strongly dependent. In this paper, we consider the problem of
detection when dependence among multimodal data is modeled in a compressed
domain where compression is obtained using low dimensional random projections.
We employ a Gaussian approximation while modeling inter-modal dependence in the
compressed domain which is computationally more efficient. We show that, under
certain conditions, detection with multimodal dependent data in the compressed
domain with a small number of compressed measurements yields enhanced
performance compared to detection with high dimensional data via either the
product approach or other suboptimal fusion approaches proposed in the
literature.

 <dc:title>Barcodes for Medical Image Retrieval Using Autoencoded Radon Transform</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Using content-based binary codes to tag digital images has emerged as a
promising retrieval technology. Recently, Radon barcodes (RBCs) have been
introduced as a new binary descriptor for image search. RBCs are generated by
binarization of Radon projections and by assembling them into a vector, namely
the barcode. A simple local thresholding has been suggested for binarization.
In this paper, we put forward the idea of &quot;autoencoded Radon barcodes&quot;. Using
images in a training dataset, we autoencode Radon projections to perform
binarization on outputs of hidden layers. We employed the mini-batch stochastic
gradient descent approach for the training. Each hidden layer of the
autoencoder can produce a barcode using a threshold determined based on the
range of the logistic function used. The compressing capability of autoencoders
apparently reduces the redundancies inherent in Radon projections leading to
more accurate retrieval results. The IRMA dataset with 14,410 x-ray images is
used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental
results, containing comparison with RBCs, SURF and BRISK, show that autoencoded
Radon barcode (ARBC) has the capacity to capture important information and to
learn richer representations resulting in lower retrieval errors for image
retrieval measured with the accuracy of the first hit only.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the problem of rule-based stream data cleaning,
which sets stringent requirements on latency, rule dynamics and ability to cope
with the unbounded nature of data streams.
  We design a system, called Bleach, which achieves real-time violation
detection and data repair on a dirty data stream. Bleach relies on efficient,
compact and distributed data structures to maintain the necessary state to
repair data, using an incremental version of the equivalence class algorithm.
Additionally, it supports rule dynamics and uses a &quot;cumulative&quot; sliding window
operation to improve cleaning accuracy.
  We evaluate a prototype of Bleach using a TPC-DS derived dirty data stream
and observe its high throughput, low latency and high cleaning accuracy, even
with rule dynamics. Experimental results indicate superior performance of
Bleach compared to a baseline system built on the micro-batch streaming
paradigm.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new technique for computing dense scene flow from two handheld
videos with wide camera baselines and different photometric properties due to
different sensors or camera settings like exposure and white balance. Our
technique innovates in two ways over existing methods: (1) it supports
independently moving cameras, and (2) it computes dense scene flow for
wide-baseline scenarios.We achieve this by combining state-of-the-art
wide-baseline correspondence finding with a variational scene flow formulation.
First, we compute dense, wide-baseline correspondences using DAISY descriptors
for matching between cameras and over time. We then detect and replace occluded
pixels in the correspondence fields using a novel edge-preserving Laplacian
correspondence completion technique. We finally refine the computed
correspondence fields in a variational scene flow formulation. We show dense
scene flow results computed from challenging datasets with independently
moving, handheld cameras of varying camera settings.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Windowing for ICI Mitigation in Doubly Selective Channels with
  Unknown Statistics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vlachos, Evangelos</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Berberidis, Kostas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In doubly selective channels, receiver windowing constitutes an effective
technique for enhancing the banded structure of the frequency-domain channel
matrix, and thus improving the effectiveness of a banded equalizer for
intercarrier interference (ICI) mitigation. A common window design technique,
which performs close to optimal, is based on the criterion of maximum average
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The optimality of this
technique has been verified for stationary channels with perfectly known
statistics. However, in cases where this assumption does not hold, a near
optimal performance can be achieved at the expense of high complexity cost. To
overcome these limitations, an adaptive windowing technique is proposed that is
able to track the optimal receiver window offering low-complexity requirements.
Through simulation experiments it has been verified that the proposed technique
is able to adapt to the varying channel statistics with increased robustness to
channel modeling errors.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, with the explosion of digital images on the Web,
content-based retrieval has emerged as a significant research area. Shapes,
textures, edges and segments may play a key role in describing the content of
an image. Radon and Gabor transforms are both powerful techniques that have
been widely studied to extract shape-texture-based information. The combined
Radon-Gabor features may be more robust against scale/rotation variations,
presence of noise, and illumination changes. The objective of this paper is to
harness the potentials of both Gabor and Radon transforms in order to introduce
expressive binary features, called barcodes, for image annotation/tagging
tasks. We propose two different techniques: Gabor-of-Radon-Image Barcodes
(GRIBCs), and Guided-Radon-of-Gabor Barcodes (GRGBCs). For validation, we
employ the IRMA x-ray dataset with 193 classes, containing 12,677 training
images and 1,733 test images. A total error score as low as 322 and 330 were
achieved for GRGBCs and GRIBCs, respectively. This corresponds to $\approx
81\%$ retrieval accuracy for the first hit.

 <dc:description>  Many research works have successfully extended algorithms such as
evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement agents and neural networks using
&quot;opposition-based learning&quot; (OBL). Two types of the &quot;opposites&quot; have been
defined in the literature, namely \textit{type-I} and \textit{type-II}. The
former are linear in nature and applicable to the variable space, hence easy to
calculate. On the other hand, type-II opposites capture the &quot;oppositeness&quot; in
the output space. In fact, type-I opposites are considered a special case of
type-II opposites where inputs and outputs have a linear relationship. However,
in many real-world problems, inputs and outputs do in fact exhibit a nonlinear
relationship. Therefore, type-II opposites are expected to be better in
capturing the sense of &quot;opposition&quot; in terms of the input-output relation. In
the absence of any knowledge about the problem at hand, there seems to be no
intuitive way to calculate the type-II opposites. In this paper, we introduce
an approach to learn type-II opposites from the given inputs and their outputs
using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). We first perform \emph{opposition
mining} on the sample data, and then use the mined data to learn the
relationship between input $x$ and its opposite $\breve{x}$. We have validated
our algorithm using various benchmark functions to compare it against an
evolving fuzzy inference approach that has been recently introduced. The
results show the better performance of a neural approach to learn the
opposites. This will create new possibilities for integrating oppositional
schemes within existing algorithms promising a potential increase in
convergence speed and/or accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Ever more robust, accurate and detailed mapping using visual sensing has
proven to be an enabling factor for mobile robots across a wide variety of
applications. For the next level of robot intelligence and intuitive user
interaction, maps need extend beyond geometry and appearence - they need to
contain semantics. We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and a state of the art dense Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense
correspondence between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning
trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from
multiple view points to be probabilistically fused into a map. This not only
produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that
fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic
labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a
smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint,
the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is
efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of
approximately 25Hz.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of the most successful deep
machine learning technologies for processing image, voice and video data. CNNs
require large amounts of processing capacity and memory, which can exceed the
resources of low power mobile and embedded systems. Several designs for
hardware accelerators have been proposed for CNNs which typically contain large
numbers of Multiply Accumulate (MAC) units. One approach to reducing data sizes
and memory traffic in CNN accelerators is &quot;weight sharing&quot;, where the full
range of values in a trained CNN are put in bins and the bin index is stored
instead of the original weight value. In this paper we propose a novel MAC
circuit that exploits binning in weight-sharing CNNs. Rather than computing the
MAC directly we instead count the frequency of each weight and place it in a
bin. We then compute the accumulated value in a subsequent multiply phase. This
allows hardware multipliers in the MAC circuit to be replaced with adders and
selection logic. Experiments show that for the same clock speed our approach
results in fewer gates, smaller logic, and reduced power.

 <dc:description>  Computational micromagnetics requires numerical solution of partial
differential equations to resolve complex interactions in magnetic
nanomaterials. The Virtual Micromagnetics project described here provides
virtual machine simulation environments to run open-source micromagnetic
simulation packages. These environments allow easy access to simulation
packages that are often difficult to compile and install, and enable
simulations and their data to be shared and stored in a single virtual hard
disk file, which encourages reproducible research. Virtual Micromagnetics can
be extended to automate the installation of micromagnetic simulation packages
on non-virtual machines, and to support closed-source and new open-source
simulation packages, including packages from disciplines other than
micromagnetics, encouraging reuse. Virtual Micromagnetics is stored in a public
GitHub repository under a three-clause Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)

 <dc:description>  We study the consensus-halving problem of dividing an object into two
portions, such that each of $n$ agents has equal valuation for the two
portions. The $\epsilon$-approximate consensus-halving problem allows each
agent to have an $\epsilon$ discrepancy on the values of the portions. We prove
that computing $\epsilon$-approximate consensus-halving solution using $n$ cuts
is in PPA, and is PPAD-hard, where $\epsilon$ is some positive constant; the
problem remains PPAD-hard when we allow a constant number of additional cuts.
It is NP-hard to decide whether a solution with $n-1$ cuts exists for the
problem. As a corollary of our results, we obtain that the approximate
computational version of the Continuous Necklace Splitting Problem is PPAD-hard
when the number of portions $t$ is two.

 <dc:description>  The switching model is a Markov chain approach to sample graphs with fixed
degree sequence uniformly at random. The recently invented Curveball algorithm
for bipartite graphs applies several switches simultaneously (`trades'). Here,
we introduce Curveball algorithms for simple (un)directed graphs which use
single or simultaneous trades. We show experimentally that these algorithms
converge magnitudes faster than the corresponding switching models.

 <dc:description>  Temporal abstraction is key to scaling up learning and planning in
reinforcement learning. While planning with temporally extended actions is well
understood, creating such abstractions autonomously from data has remained
challenging. We tackle this problem in the framework of options [Sutton, Precup
&amp; Singh, 1999; Precup, 2000]. We derive policy gradient theorems for options
and propose a new option-critic architecture capable of learning both the
internal policies and the termination conditions of options, in tandem with the
policy over options, and without the need to provide any additional rewards or
subgoals. Experimental results in both discrete and continuous environments
showcase the flexibility and efficiency of the framework.

 <dc:title>STEM: A Scheme for Two-phase Evaluation of Majority Logic</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The switching time of a magnet in a spin current based majority gate depends
on the input vector combination, and this often restricts the speed of
majority-based circuits. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel
two-phase scheme to implement majority logic and evaluates it on an all-spin
logic (ASL) majority-based logic structures. In Phase 1, the output is
initialized to a preset value. Next in Phase 2, the inputs are evaluated to
switch the output magnet to its correct value. The time window for the output
to switch in Phase 2 is fixed. Using such a scheme, an n-input AND gate which
requires a total of (2n-1) inputs in the conventional implementation can now be
implemented with only (n+1) inputs. When applied to standard logic functions,
it is demonstrated that the proposed method of designing ASL gates are 1.6-3.4X
faster and 1.9-6.9X more energy-efficient than the conventional method, and for
a five-magnet full adder, it is shown that the proposed ASL implementation is
1.5X faster, 2.2X more energy-efficient, and provides a 16% improvement in
area.

 <dc:description>  Two less addressed issues of deep reinforcement learning are (1) lack of
generalization capability to new target goals, and (2) data inefficiency i.e.,
the model requires several (and often costly) episodes of trial and error to
converge, which makes it impractical to be applied to real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we address these two issues and apply our model to the task of
target-driven visual navigation. To address the first issue, we propose an
actor-critic model whose policy is a function of the goal as well as the
current state, which allows to better generalize. To address the second issue,
we propose AI2-THOR framework, which provides an environment with high-quality
3D scenes and physics engine. Our framework enables agents to take actions and
interact with objects. Hence, we can collect a huge number of training samples
efficiently.
  We show that our proposed method (1) converges faster than the
state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, (2) generalizes across
targets and across scenes, (3) generalizes to a real robot scenario with a
small amount of fine-tuning (although the model is trained in simulation), (4)
is end-to-end trainable and does not need feature engineering, feature matching
between frames or 3D reconstruction of the environment.

 <dc:title>Style Imitation and Chord Invention in Polyphonic Music with Exponential

 <dc:description>  Modeling polyphonic music is a particularly challenging task because of the
intricate interplay between melody and harmony. A good model should satisfy
three requirements: statistical accuracy (capturing faithfully the statistics
of correlations at various ranges, horizontally and vertically), flexibility
(coping with arbitrary user constraints), and generalization capacity
(inventing new material, while staying in the style of the training corpus).
Models proposed so far fail on at least one of these requirements. We propose a
statistical model of polyphonic music, based on the maximum entropy principle.
This model is able to learn and reproduce pairwise statistics between
neighboring note events in a given corpus. The model is also able to invent new
chords and to harmonize unknown melodies. We evaluate the invention capacity of
the model by assessing the amount of cited, re-discovered, and invented chords
on a corpus of Bach chorales. We discuss how the model enables the user to
specify and enforce user-defined constraints, which makes it useful for
style-based, interactive music generation.

 <dc:description>  Recently, several models based on deep neural networks have achieved great
success in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational performance
for single image super-resolution. In these methods, the low resolution (LR)
input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single
filter, commonly bicubic interpolation, before reconstruction. This means that
the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate
that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we
present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of
1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN
architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition,
we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of
upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By
doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR
pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each
feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall
SR operation. We evaluate the proposed approach using images and videos from
publicly available datasets and show that it performs significantly better
(+0.15dB on Images and +0.39dB on Videos) and is an order of magnitude faster
than previous CNN-based methods.

 <dc:title>Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for SWIPT in Multiple Access

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study optimal resource allocation strategies for
simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) focusing on the system
energy efficiency. We consider two-user multiple access channels in which
energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) nodes are spatially
separated. We formulate optimization problems that maximize system energy
efficiency while taking harvested energy constraints into account. These are
concave-linear fractional problems, and hence Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions are necessary and sufficient to obtain globally optimal solution.
Solving these optimization problems, we provide analytical expressions for
optimal transmit power allocation among the source nodes, and identify the
corresponding energy efficiency. We confirm the theoretical analysis via
numerical results. Furthermore, we also characterize the effect of circuit
power consumption on the system's efficiency as the harvested energy demand
varies.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the problem of path planning under uncertainty.
Specifically, we consider online receding horizon based planners that need to
operate in a latent environment where the latent information can be modeled via
Gaussian Processes. Online path planning in latent environments is challenging
since the robot needs to explore the environment to get a more accurate model
of latent information for better planning later and also achieves the task as
quick as possible. We propose UCB style algorithms that are popular in the
bandit settings and show how those analyses can be adapted to the online
robotic path planning problems. The proposed algorithm trades-off exploration
and exploitation in near-optimal manner and has appealing no-regret properties.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework on the application of aircraft
flight path planning when the winds are partially observed.

 <dc:title>ADC Bit Allocation under a Power Constraint for MmWave Massive MIMO

 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mmWave) systems operating over a wide bandwidth and using a
large number of antennas impose a heavy burden on power consumption. In a
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink, analog-to-digital con-
verters (ADCs) would be the primary consumer of power in the base station
receiver. This paper proposes a bit allocation (BA) method for mmWave
multi-user (MU) massive MIMO systems under a power constraint. We apply ADCs to
the outputs of an analog phased array for beamspace projection to exploit
mmWave channel sparsity. We relax a mean square quantization error (MSQE)
minimization problem and map the closed-form solution to non-negative integer
bits at each ADC. In link-level simulations, the proposed method gives better
communication performance than conventional low-resolution ADCs for the same or
less power. Our contribution is a near optimal low-complexity BA method that
minimizes total MSQE under a power constraint.

 <dc:title>Should Terminology Principles be re-examined?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Roche, Christophe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Operationalization of terminology for IT applications has revived the
Wusterian approach. The conceptual dimension once more prevails after taking
back seat to specialised lexicography. This is demonstrated by the emergence of
ontology in terminology. While the Terminology Principles as defined in Felber
manual and the ISO standards remain at the core of traditional terminology,
their computational implementation raises some issues. In this article, while
reiterating their importance, we will be re-examining these Principles from a
dual perspective: that of logic in the mathematical sense of the term and that
of epistemology as in the theory of knowledge. We will thus be clarifying and
describing some of them so as to take into account advances in knowledge
engineering (ontology) and formal systems (logic). The notion of
ontoterminology, terminology whose conceptual system is a formal ontology,
results from this approach.

 <dc:description>  SimuLTE is a tool that enables system-level simulations of LTE/LTE-Advanced
networks within OMNeT++. It is designed such that it can be plugged within
network elements as an additional Network Interface Card (NIC) to those already
provided by the INET framework (e.g. Wi-Fi). Recently, device-to-device (D2D)
technology has been widely studied by the research community, as a mechanism to
allow direct communications between devices of a LTE cellular network. In this
work, we present how SimuLTE can be employed to simulate both one-to-one and
one-to-many D2D communications, so that the latter can be exploited as a new
communication opportunity in several research fields, like vehicular networks,
IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.

 <dc:title>Privacy Preserving Distance Computation using Somewhat-trusted Third
  Parties</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A critically important component of most signal processing procedures is that
of computing the distance between signals. In multi-party processing
applications where these signals belong to different parties, this introduces
privacy challenges. The signals may themselves be private, and the parties to
the computation may not be willing to expose them. Solutions proposed to the
problem in the literature generally invoke homomorphic encryption schemes,
secure multi-party computation, or other cryptographic methods which introduce
significant computational complexity into the proceedings, often to the point
of making more complex computations requiring repeated computations unfeasible.
Other solutions invoke third parties, making unrealistic assumptions about
their trustworthiness.
  In this paper we propose an alternate approach, also based on third party
computation, but without assuming as much trust in the third party. Individual
participants to the computation &quot;secure&quot; their data through a proposed secure
hashing scheme with shared keys, prior to sharing it with the third party. The
hashing ensures that the third party cannot recover any information about the
individual signals or their statistics, either from analysis of individual
computations or their long-term aggregate patterns. We provide theoretical
proof of these properties and empirical demonstration of the feasibility of the
computation.

 <dc:description>  In-vehicle communication technologies are evolving. While today's cars are
equipped with fieldbusses to interconnect the various electronic control units,
next generation vehicles have timing and bandwidth requirements that exceed the
capacities. In particular Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
automated driving using high bandwidth sensors such as cameras, LIDAR or radar
will challenge the in-car network. Automotive Ethernet is the most promising
candidate to solve the upcoming challenges. But to design and evaluate new
protocols, concepts, and architectures suitable analysis tools are required.
Especially in the interim period with architectures using automotive Ethernet
and legacy fieldbusses together, careful planning and design is of vital
importance. Simulation can provide a good understanding of the expectable
network metrics in an early development phase. This paper contributes a
workflow as well as the required toolchain to evaluate new real-time Ethernet
communication architectures using event based simulation in OMNeT++. We
introduce a domain specific language (DSL) - the Abstract Network Description
Language (ANDL) - to describe and configure the simulation and present the
required simulation models for real-time Ethernet and fieldbus technologies
such as CAN and FlexRay. We further introduce new analysis tools for special
in-vehicle network use-cases and the interaction of the simulation with
third-party applications established in the automotive domain.

 <dc:description>  Language students are most engaged while reading texts at an appropriate
difficulty level. However, existing methods of evaluating text difficulty focus
mainly on vocabulary and do not prioritize grammatical features, hence they do
not work well for language learners with limited knowledge of grammar. In this
paper, we introduce grammatical templates, the expert-identified units of
grammar that students learn from class, as an important feature of text
difficulty evaluation. Experimental classification results show that
grammatical template features significantly improve text difficulty prediction
accuracy over baseline readability features by 7.4%. Moreover, we build a
simple and human-understandable text difficulty evaluation approach with 87.7%
accuracy, using only 5 grammatical template features.

 <dc:description>  Data shuffling is one of the fundamental building blocks for distributed
learning algorithms, that increases the statistical gain for each step of the
learning process. In each iteration, different shuffled data points are
assigned by a central node to a distributed set of workers to perform local
computations, which leads to communication bottlenecks. The focus of this paper
is on formalizing and understanding the fundamental information-theoretic
trade-off between storage (per worker) and the worst-case communication
overhead for the data shuffling problem. We completely characterize the
information theoretic trade-off for $K=2$, and $K=3$ workers, for any value of
storage capacity, and show that increasing the storage across workers can
reduce the communication overhead by leveraging coding. We propose a novel and
systematic data delivery and storage update strategy for each data shuffle
iteration, which preserves the structural properties of the storage across the
workers, and aids in minimizing the communication overhead in subsequent data
shuffling iterations.

 <dc:title>Stacked-VLAN-Based Modeling of Hybrid ISP Traffic Control Schemes and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The current practice of shaping subscriber traffic using a token bucket
filter by Internet service providers may result in a severe waste of network
resources in shared access networks; except for a short period of time
proportional to the size of a token bucket, it cannot allocate excess bandwidth
among active subscribers even when there are only a few active subscribers. To
better utilize the network resources in shared access networks, therefore, we
recently proposed and analyzed the performance of access traffic control
schemes, which can allocate excess bandwidth among active subscribers
proportional to their token generation rates. Also, to exploit the excess
bandwidth allocation enabled by the proposed traffic control schemes, we have
been studying flexible yet practical service plans under a hybrid traffic
control architecture, which are attractive to both an Internet service provider
and its subscribers in terms of revenue and quality of service. In this paper
we report the current status of our modeling of the hybrid traffic control
schemes and service plans with OMNeT++/INET-HNRL based on IEEE standard 802.1Q
stacked VLANs.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to grow into billions of devices in
the near future. Evaluating mechanisms such as networking architectures for
communications in the IoT require the use of simulators due to the scale of the
size of networks. Mobility is one of the key aspects that need to be evaluated
when considering the different scenarios of the IoT. Small Worlds in Motion
(SWIM) is a mobility model that mathematically characterises the movement
patterns of humans. The work presented in this paper details the development
and verification of the SWIM mobility model in the OMNeT++ simulator.

 <dc:description>  Echo-State Networks and Reservoir Computing have been studied for more than a
decade. As they provide an elegant yet powerful alternative to traditional
computing, researchers have tried to implement them using physical systems, in
particular non-linear optical elements, achieving high bandwidth and low power
consumption. Here we present a completely different optical implementation of
Echo-State Networks using light-scattering materials. As a proof of concept,
binary networks have been successfully trained to perform non-linear operations
on time series and memory of such networks has been evaluated. This new method
is fast, power efficient and easily scalable to very large networks.

 <dc:description>  We present a new kind of nontermination argument, called geometric
nontermination argument. The geometric nontermination argument is a finite
representation of an infinite execution that has the form of a sum of several
geometric series. For so-called linear lasso programs we can decide the
existence of a geometric nontermination argument using a nonlinear algebraic
$\exists$-constraint. We show that a deterministic conjunctive loop program
with nonnegative eigenvalues is nonterminating if an only if there exists a
geometric nontermination argument. Furthermore, we present an evaluation that
demonstrates that our method is feasible in practice.

 <dc:description>  Routing and switching capabilities of computer networks seem as the closed
environment containing a limited set of deployed protocols, which nobody dares
to change. The majority of wired network designs are stuck with OSPF
(guaranteeing dynamic routing exchange on network layer) and RSTP (securing
loop-free data-link layer topology). Recently, more use-case specific routing
protocols, such as Babel, have appeared. These technologies claim to have
better characteristic than current industry standards. Babel is a fresh
contribution to the family of distance-vector routing protocols, which is
gaining its momentum for small double-stack (IPv6 and IPv4) networks. This
paper briefly describes Babel behavior and provides details on its
implementation in OMNeT++ discrete event simulator.

 <dc:description>  Finding a conceptually new way to control the magnetic state of media with
the lowest possible production of heat and simultaneously at the fastest
possible time-scale is a new challenge in fundamental magnetism [1-4] as well
as an increasingly important issue in modern information technology [5]. Recent
results demonstrate that exclusively in metals it is possible to switch
magnetization between metastable states by femtosecond circularly polarized
laser pulses [6-8]. However, despite the record breaking speed of the
switching, the mechanisms in these materials are directly related to strong
optical absorption and laser-induced heating close to the Curie temperature
[9-12]. Here we report about ultrafast all-optical photo-magnetic recording in
transparent dielectrics. In ferrimagnetic garnet film a single linearly
polarized femtosecond laser pulse breaks the degeneracy between metastable
magnetic states and promotes switching of spins between them. Changing the
polarization of the laser pulse we deterministically steer the net
magnetization in the garnet, write &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; magnetic bits at will. This
mechanism operates at room temperature and allows ever fastest write-read
magnetic recording event (&lt; 20 ps) accompanied by unprecedentedly low heat load
(&lt; 6 J/cm3).

preference relation that takes the argument structure into account, we prove
that the conclusions of the justified arguments correspond to the PDL
extensions. We will first assume that the default priority is total, and then
generalise to the case where it is a partial order. This provides a
characterisation of non-monotonic inference in PDL as an exchange of argument
and counter-argument, providing a basis for distributed non-monotonic reasoning
in the form of dialogue.

 <dc:description>  Spaceborne gravity gradients are proposed in this paper to provide autonomous
orbit determination capabilities for near Earth satellites. The gravity
gradients contain useful position information which can be extracted by
matching the observations with a precise gravity model. The extended Kalman
filter is investigated as the principal estimator. The stochastic model of
orbital motion, the measurement equation and the model configuration are
discussed for the filter design. An augmented state filter is also developed to
deal with unknown significant measurement biases. Simulations are conducted to
analyze the effects of initial errors, data-sampling periods, orbital heights,
attitude and gradiometer noise levels, and measurement biases. Results show
that the filter performs well with additive white noise observation errors.
Degraded observability for the along-track position is found for the augmented
state filter. Real flight data from the GOCE satellite are used to test the
algorithm. Radial and cross-track position errors of less than 100 m have been

 <dc:description>  Usually gradual and continuous changes in entities will lead to appear
events. But usually it is supposed that an event is occurred at once. In this
research an integrated framework called continuous occurrence theory (COT) is
presented to investigate respective path leading to occurrence of the events in
the real world. For this purpose initially fundamental concepts are defined.
Afterwards, the appropriate tools such as occurrence variables computations,
occurrence dependency function and occurrence model are introduced and
explained in a systematic manner. Indeed, COT provides the possibility to: (a)
monitor occurrence of events during time; (b) study background of the events;
(c) recognize the relevant issues of each event; and (d) understand how these
issues affect on the considered event. The developed framework (COT) provides
the necessary context to analyze accurately continual changes of the issues and
the relevant events in the various branches of science and business. Finally,
typical applications of COT and an applied modeling example of it have been
explained and a mathematical programming example is modeled in the occurrence
based environment.

 <dc:description>  User-machine interaction is important for spoken content retrieval. For text
content retrieval, the user can easily scan through and select on a list of
retrieved item. This is impossible for spoken content retrieval, because the
retrieved items are difficult to show on screen. Besides, due to the high
degree of uncertainty for speech recognition, the retrieval results can be very
noisy. One way to counter such difficulties is through user-machine
interaction. The machine can take different actions to interact with the user
to obtain better retrieval results before showing to the user. The suitable
actions depend on the retrieval status, for example requesting for extra
information from the user, returning a list of topics for user to select, etc.
In our previous work, some hand-crafted states estimated from the present
retrieval results are used to determine the proper actions. In this paper, we
propose to use Deep-Q-Learning techniques instead to determine the machine
actions for interactive spoken content retrieval. Deep-Q-Learning bypasses the
need for estimation of the hand-crafted states, and directly determine the best
action base on the present retrieval status even without any human knowledge.
It is shown to achieve significantly better performance compared with the
previous hand-crafted states.

 <dc:title>RFM-SLAM: Exploiting Relative Feature Measurements to Separate

 <dc:description>  The SLAM problem is known to have a special property that when robot
orientation is known, estimating the history of robot poses and feature
locations can be posed as a standard linear least squares problem. In this
work, we develop a SLAM framework that uses relative feature-to-feature
measurements to exploit this structural property of SLAM. Relative feature
measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose
orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear
on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for
robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot
orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map
estimation. Our approach reduces the computational burden of non-linear
optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard
graph-based methods for feature-based SLAM. Further, empirical results show our
method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using
odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy
degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method
through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art
solver.

 <dc:title>Fast Second-order Cone Programming for Safe Mission Planning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of safe mission planning of dynamic systems
operating under uncertain environments. Much of the prior work on achieving
robust and safe control requires solving second-order cone programs (SOCP).
Unfortunately, existing general purpose SOCP methods are often infeasible for
real-time robotic tasks due to high memory and computational requirements
imposed by existing general optimization methods. The key contribution of this
paper is a fast and memory-efficient algorithm for SOCP that would enable
robust and safe mission planning on-board robots in real-time. Our algorithm
does not have any external dependency, can efficiently utilize warm start
provided in safe planning settings, and in fact leads to significant speed up
over standard optimization packages (like SDPT3) for even standard SOCP
problems. For example, for a standard quadrotor problem, our method leads to
speedup of 1000x over SDPT3 without any deterioration in the solution quality.
  Our method is based on two insights: a) SOCPs can be interpreted as
optimizing a function over a polytope with infinite sides, b) a linear function
can be efficiently optimized over this polytope. We combine the above
observations with a novel utilization of Wolfe's algorithm to obtain an
efficient optimization method that can be easily implemented on small embedded
devices. In addition to the above mentioned algorithm, we also design a
two-level sensing method based on Gaussian Process for complex obstacles with
non-linear boundaries such as a cylinder.

 <dc:description>  Multimodal sentiment analysis is drawing an increasing amount of attention
these days. It enables mining of opinions in video reviews which are now
available aplenty on online platforms. However, multimodal sentiment analysis
has only a few high-quality data sets annotated for training machine learning
algorithms. These limited resources restrict the generalizability of models,
where, for example, the unique characteristics of a few speakers (e.g., wearing
glasses) may become a confounding factor for the sentiment classification task.
In this paper, we propose a Select-Additive Learning (SAL) procedure that
improves the generalizability of trained neural networks for multimodal
sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we show that our SAL approach improves
prediction accuracy significantly in all three modalities (verbal, acoustic,
visual), as well as in their fusion. Our results show that SAL, even when
trained on one dataset, achieves good generalization across two new test
datasets.

 <dc:description>  Atomic force microscopes have proved to be fundamental research tools in many
situations where a gentle imaging process is required, and in a variety of
environmental conditions, such as the study of biological samples. Among the
possible modes of operation, intermittent contact mode is one that causes less
wear to both the sample and the instrument; therefore, it is ideal when imaging
soft samples. However, intermittent contact mode is not particularly fast when
compared to other imaging strategies. In this paper, we introduce three
enhanced control approaches, applied at both the dither and z-axis piezos, to
address the limitations of existing control schemes. Our proposed strategies
are able to eliminate different image artefacts, automatically adapt scan speed
to the sample being scanned and predict its features in real time. The result
is that both the image quality and the scan time are improved.

 <dc:title>Viewpoint Selection for Grasp Detection</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gualtieri, Marcus</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Platt, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In grasp detection, the robot estimates the position and orientation of
potential grasp configurations directly from sensor data. This paper explores
the relationship between viewpoint and grasp detection performance.
Specifically, we consider the scenario where the approximate position and
orientation of a desired grasp is known in advance and we want to select a
viewpoint that will enable a grasp detection algorithm to localize it more
precisely and with higher confidence. Our main findings are that the right
viewpoint can dramatically increase the number of detected grasps and the
classification accuracy of the top-n detections. We use this insight to create
a viewpoint selection algorithm and compare it against a random viewpoint
selection strategy and a strategy that views the desired grasp head-on. We find
that the head-on strategy and our proposed viewpoint selection strategy can
improve grasp success rates on a real robot by 8% and 4%, respectively.
Moreover, we find that the combination of the two methods can improve grasp
success rates by as much as 12%.

 <dc:description>  Many people with motor disabilities are unable to complete activities of
daily living (ADLs) without assistance. This paper describes a complete robotic
system developed to provide mobile grasping assistance for ADLs. The system is
comprised of a robot arm from a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot mounted to an
assistive mobility device, a control system for that arm, and a user interface
with a variety of access methods for selecting desired objects. The system uses
grasp detection to allow previously unseen objects to be picked up by the
system. The grasp detection algorithms also allow for objects to be grasped in
cluttered environments. We evaluate our system in a number of experiments on a
large variety of objects. Overall, we achieve an object selection success rate
of 88% and a grasp detection success rate of 90% in a non-mobile scenario, and
success rates of 89% and 72% in a mobile scenario.

 <dc:description>  Advances in sensor networks enable pervasive health monitoring and
patient-specific treatments that take into account the patients medical
history, current state, genetic background, and personal habits. However,
sensors are often battery power limited and vastly differ in their application
related requirements. In this paper, we address both of these problems.
Specifically, we study IEEE 802.15.6 ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless body area
networks (WBANs) that use impulse radio (IR). We formulate the joint
optimization of the payload size and number of pulses per symbol to optimize
the energy efficiency under the minimum rate constraint. The proposed
algorithm, cross-layer optimization for energy efficiency (CLOEE), enables us
to carry out a cross-layer resource allocation that addresses the rate and
reliability trade-off in the physical (PHY) layer as well as the packet size
optimization and transmission efficiency for the medium access control (MAC)
layer. Simulation results demonstrate that CLOEE can provide an order of
magnitude improvement in to static strategies.

 <dc:description>  We present a convolutional approach to reflection symmetry detection in 2D.
Our model, built on the products of complex-valued wavelet convolutions,
simplifies previous edge-based pairwise methods. Being parameter-centered, as
opposed to feature-centered, it has certain computational advantages when the
object sizes are known a priori, as demonstrated in an ellipse detection
application. The method outperforms the best-performing algorithm on the CVPR
2013 Symmetry Detection Competition Database in the single-symmetry case. Code
and a new database for 2D symmetry detection is available.

 <dc:description>  Robotic challenges like the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC) or the DARPA
Challenges are an established and important way to drive scientific progress.
They make research comparable on a well-defined benchmark with equal test
conditions for all participants. However, such challenge events occur only
occasionally, are limited to a small number of contestants, and the test
conditions are very difficult to replicate after the main event. We present a
new physical benchmark challenge for robotic picking: the ACRV Picking
Benchmark (APB). Designed to be reproducible, it consists of a set of 42 common
objects, a widely available shelf, and exact guidelines for object arrangement
using stencils. A well-defined evaluation protocol enables the comparison of
\emph{complete} robotic systems -- including perception and manipulation --
instead of sub-systems only. Our paper also describes and reports results
achieved by an open baseline system based on a Baxter robot.

 <dc:title>Capacity of the Two-Hop Relay Channel with Wireless Energy Transfer from

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate a communication system comprised of an energy
harvesting (EH) source which harvests radio frequency (RF) energy from an
out-of-band full-duplex relay node and exploits this energy to transmit data to
a destination node via the relay node. We assume two scenarios for the battery
of the EH source. In the first scenario, we assume that the EH source is not
equipped with a battery and thereby cannot store energy. As a result, the RF
energy harvested during one symbol interval can only be used in the following
symbol interval. In the second scenario, we assume that the EH source is
equipped with a battery having unlimited storage capacity in which it can store
the harvested RF energy. As a result, the RF energy harvested during one symbol
interval can be used in any of the following symbol intervals. For both system
models, we derive the channel capacity subject to an average power constraint
at the relay and an additional energy transmission cost at the EH source. We
compare the derived capacities to the achievable rates of several benchmark
schemes. Our results show that using the optimal input distributions at both
the EH source and the relay is essential for high performance. Moreover, we
demonstrate that neglecting the energy transmission cost at the source can
result in a severe overestimation of the achievable performance.

 <dc:description>  A decomposition-based coverage control scheme is proposed for multi-agent,
persistent surveillance missions operating in a communication-constrained,
dynamic environment. The proposed approach decouples high-level task assignment
from low-level motion planning in a modular framework. Coverage assignments and
surveillance parameters are managed by a central base station, and transmitted
to mobile agents via unplanned and asynchronous exchanges. Coverage updates
promote load balancing, while maintaining geometric and temporal
characteristics that allow effective pairing with generic path planners.
Namely, the proposed scheme guarantees that (i) coverage regions are connected
and collectively cover the environment, (ii) subregions may only go uncovered
for bounded periods of time, (iii) collisions (or sensing overlaps) are
inherently avoided, and (iv) under static event likelihoods, the collective
coverage regions converge to a Pareto-optimal configuration. This management
scheme is then paired with a generic path planner satisfying loose assumptions.
The scheme is illustrated through simulated surveillance missions.

 <dc:title>Optimal Control of Large-Scale Networks using Clustering Based
  Projections</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Xue, Nan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chakrabortty, Aranya</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a set of projection-based designs for constructing
simplified linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controllers for large-scale network
systems. When such systems have tens of thousands of states, the design of
conventional LQR controllers becomes numerically challenging, and their
implementation requires a large number of communication links. Our proposed
algorithms bypass these difficulties by clustering the system states using
structural properties of its closed-loop transfer matrix. The assignment of
clusters is defined through a structured projection matrix P, which leads to a
significantly lower-dimensional LQR design. The reduced-order controller is
finally projected back to the original coordinates via an inverse projection.
The problem is, therefore, posed as a model matching problem of finding the
optimal set of clusters or P that minimizes the H2-norm of the error between
the transfer matrix of the full-order network with the full-order LQR and that
with the projected LQR. We derive a tractable relaxation for this model
matching problem, and design a P that solves the relaxation. The design is
shown to be implementable by a convenient, hierarchical two-layer control
architecture, requiring far less number of communication links than full-order
LQR.

 <dc:description>  Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are among the most useful techniques for the
visualization and exploration of high-dimensional data spaces. They are
especially useful for the representation of correlations among the dimensions,
which identify relationships and interdependencies between variables. However,
within these high-dimensional spaces, PCPs face difficulties in displaying the
correlation between combinations of dimensions and generally require additional
display space as the number of dimensions increases. In this paper, we present
a new technique for high-dimensional data visualization in which a set of
low-dimensional PCPs are interactively constructed by sampling user-selected
subsets of the high-dimensional data space. In our technique, we first
construct a graph visualization of sets of well-correlated dimensions. Users
observe this graph and are able to interactively select the dimensions by
sampling from its cliques, thereby dynamically specifying the most relevant
lower dimensional data to be used for the construction of focused PCPs. Our
interactive sampling overcomes the shortcomings of the PCPs by enabling the
visualization of the most meaningful dimensions (i.e., the most relevant
information) from high-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our technique through two case studies, where we show that the proposed
interactive low-dimensional space constructions were pivotal for visualizing
the high-dimensional data and discovering new patterns.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new centrality index for bipartite network of papers and
authors that we call $K$-index. The $K$-index grows with the citation
performance of the papers that cite a given researcher and can seen as a
measure of scientific social recognition. Indeed, the $K$-index measures the
number of hubs, defined in a self-consistent way in the bipartite network, that
cites a given author. We show that the $K$-index can be computed by simple
inspection of the Web of Science platform and presents several advantages over
other centrality indexes, in particular Hirsch $h$-index. The $K$-index is
robust to self-citations, is not limited by the total number of papers
published by a researcher as occurs for the $h$-index and can distinguish in a
consistent way researchers that have the same $h$-index but very different
scientific social recognition. The $K$-index easily detects a known case of a
researcher with inflated number of papers, citations and $h$-index due to
scientific misconduct. Finally, we show that, in a sample of twenty-eight
physics Nobel laureates and twenty-eight highly cited non-Nobel-laureate
physicists, the $K$-index correlates better to the achievement of the prize
than the number of papers, citations, citations per paper, citing articles or
the $h$-index. Clustering researchers in a $K$ versus $h$ plot reveals
interesting outliers that suggest that these two indexes can present
complementary independent information.

 <dc:description>  We study the size (or volume) of balls in the metric space of permutations,
$S_n$, under the infinity metric. We focus on the regime of balls with radius
$r = \rho \cdot (n\!-\!1)$, $\rho \in [0,1]$, i.e., a radius that is a constant
fraction of the maximum possible distance. We provide new lower bounds on the
size of such balls. These new lower bounds reduce the asymptotic gap to the
known upper bounds to at most $0.029$ bits per symbol. Additionally, they imply
an improved ball-packing bound for error-correcting codes, and an improved
upper bound on the size of optimal covering codes.

 <dc:description>  Data generated from real world events are usually temporal and contain
multimodal information such as audio, visual, depth, sensor etc. which are
required to be intelligently combined for classification tasks. In this paper,
we propose a novel generalized deep neural network architecture where temporal
streams from multiple modalities are combined. There are total M+1 (M is the
number of modalities) components in the proposed network. The first component
is a novel temporally hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that exploits the
complimentary nature of the multimodal temporal information by allowing the
network to learn both modality specific temporal dynamics as well as the
dynamics in a multimodal feature space. M additional components are added to
the network which extract discriminative but non-temporal cues from each
modality. Finally, the predictions from all of these components are linearly
combined using a set of automatically learned weights. We perform exhaustive
experiments on three different datasets spanning four modalities. The proposed
network is relatively 3.5%, 5.7% and 2% better than the best performing
temporal multimodal baseline for UCF-101, CCV and Multimodal Gesture datasets
respectively.

 <dc:title>Converting Basic D3 Charts into Reusable Style Templates</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a technique for converting a basic D3 chart into a reusable style
template. Then, given a new data source we can apply the style template to
generate a chart that depicts the new data, but in the style of the template.
To construct the style template we first deconstruct the input D3 chart to
recover its underlying structure: the data, the marks and the mappings that
describe how the marks encode the data. We then rank the perceptual
effectiveness of the deconstructed mappings. To apply the resulting style
template to a new data source we first obtain importance ranks for each new
data field. We then adjust the template mappings to depict the source data by
matching the most important data fields to the most perceptually effective
mappings. We show how the style templates can be applied to source data in the
form of either a data table or another D3 chart. While our implementation
focuses on generating templates for basic chart types (e.g. variants of bar
charts, line charts, dot plots, scatterplots, etc.), these are the most
commonly used chart types today. Users can easily find such basic D3 charts on
the Web, turn them into templates, and immediately see how their own data would
look in the visual style (e.g. colors, shapes, fonts, etc.) of the templates.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying a diverse set of
style templates to a variety of source datasets.

 <dc:description>  Teaching a computer to read and answer general questions pertaining to a
document is a challenging yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we describe a
novel neural network architecture called the Reasoning Network (ReasoNet) for
machine comprehension tasks. ReasoNets make use of multiple turns to
effectively exploit and then reason over the relation among queries, documents,
and answers. Different from previous approaches using a fixed number of turns
during inference, ReasoNets introduce a termination state to relax this
constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning,
ReasoNets can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension
process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it
concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer. ReasoNets
have achieved exceptional performance in machine comprehension datasets,
including unstructured CNN and Daily Mail datasets, the Stanford SQuAD dataset,
and a structured Graph Reachability dataset.

 <dc:title>Distributed Processing of Generalized Graph-Pattern Queries in SPARQL

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose an efficient and scalable architecture for processing generalized
graph-pattern queries as they are specified by the current W3C recommendation
of the SPARQL 1.1 &quot;Query Language&quot; component. Specifically, the class of
queries we consider consists of sets of SPARQL triple patterns with labeled
property paths. From a relational perspective, this class resolves to
conjunctive queries of relational joins with additional graph-reachability
predicates. For the scalable, i.e., distributed, processing of this kind of
queries over very large RDF collections, we develop a suitable partitioning and
indexing scheme, which allows us to shard the RDF triples over an entire
cluster of compute nodes and to process an incoming SPARQL query over all of
the relevant graph partitions (and thus compute nodes) in parallel. Unlike most
prior works in this field, we specifically aim at the unified optimization and
distributed processing of queries consisting of both relational joins and
graph-reachability predicates. All communication among the compute nodes is
established via a proprietary, asynchronous communication protocol based on the
Message Passing Interface.

 <dc:description>  We are interested in exploring the possibility and benefits of structure
learning for deep models. As the first step, this paper investigates the matter
for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We conduct the study with Replicated
Softmax, a variant of RBMs for unsupervised text analysis. We present a method
for learning what we call Sparse Boltzmann Machines, where each hidden unit is
connected to a subset of the visible units instead of all of them. Empirical
results show that the method yields models with significantly improved model
fit and interpretability as compared with RBMs where each hidden unit is
connected to all visible units.

 <dc:title>Development of a Fuzzy Expert System based Liveliness Detection Scheme

 <dc:description>  Liveliness detection acts as a safe guard against spoofing attacks. Most of
the researchers used vision based techniques to detect liveliness of the user,
but they are highly sensitive to illumination effects. Therefore it is very
hard to design a system, which will work robustly under all circumstances.
Literature shows that most of the research utilize eye blink or mouth movement
to detect the liveliness, while the other group used face texture to
distinguish between real and imposter. The classification results of all these
approaches decreases drastically in variable light conditions. Hence in this
paper we are introducing fuzzy expert system which is sufficient enough to
handle most of the cases comes in real time. We have used two testing
parameters, (a) under bad illumination and (b) less movement in eyes and mouth
in case of real user to evaluate the performance of the system. The system is
behaving well in all, while in first case its False Rejection Rate (FRR) is
0.28, and in second case its FRR is 0.4.

network. It provides a sufficient condition, in terms of the feasibility of
certain linear matrix inequalities, which guarantees distributed input attack

 <dc:description>  Finding the Time-Optimal Parameterization of a Path (TOPP) subject to
second-order constraints (e.g. acceleration, torque, contact stability, etc.)
is an important and well-studied problem in robotics. In comparison, TOPP
subject to third-order constraints (e.g. jerk, torque rate, etc.) has received
far less attention and remains largely open. In this paper, we investigate the
structure of the TOPP problem with third-order constraints. In particular, we
identify two major difficulties: (i) how to smoothly connect optimal profiles,
and (ii) how to address singularities, which stop profile integration
prematurely. We propose a new algorithm, TOPP3, which addresses these two
difficulties and thereby constitutes an important milestone towards an
efficient computational solution to TOPP with third-order constraints.

 <dc:title>On protocol and physical interference models in Poisson wireless

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes the connection between the protocol and physical
interference models in the setting of Poisson wireless networks. A transmission
is successful under the protocol model if there are no interferers within a
parameterized guard zone around the receiver, while a transmission is
successful under the physical model if the signal to interference plus noise
ratio (SINR) at the receiver is above a threshold. The parameterized protocol
model forms a family of decision rules for predicting the success or failure of
the same transmission attempt under the physical model. For Poisson wireless
networks, we employ stochastic geometry to determine the prior, evidence, and
posterior distributions associated with this estimation problem. With this in
hand, we proceed to develop five sets of results: i) the maximum correlation of
protocol and physical model success indicators, ii) the minimum Bayes risk in
estimating physical success from a protocol observation, iii) the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) of false rejection (Type I) and false acceptance
(Type II) probabilities, iv) the impact of Rayleigh fading vs. no fading on the
correlation and ROC, and v) the impact of multiple prior protocol model
observations in the setting of a wireless network with a fixed set of nodes in
which the nodes employ the slotted Aloha protocol in each time slot.

 <dc:title>NPCs Vote! Changing Voter Reactions Over Time Using the Extreme AI

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Can non-player characters have human-realistic personalities, changing over
time depending on input from those around them? And can they have different
reactions and thoughts about different people? Using Extreme AI, a
psychology-based personality engine using the Five Factor model of personality,
I answer these questions by creating personalities for 100 voters and allowing
them to react to two politicians to see if the NPC voters' choice of candidate
develops in a realistic-seeming way, based on initial and changing personality
facets and on their differing feelings toward the politicians (in this case,
across liking, trusting, and feeling affiliated with the candidates). After 16
test runs, the voters did indeed change their attitudes and feelings toward the
candidates in different and yet generally realistic ways, and even changed
their attitudes about other issues based on what a candidate extolled.

 <dc:description>  Learning articulated object pose is inherently difficult because the pose is
high dimensional but has many structural constraints. Most existing work do not
model such constraints and does not guarantee the geometric validity of their
pose estimation, therefore requiring a post-processing to recover the correct
geometry if desired, which is cumbersome and sub-optimal. In this work, we
propose to directly embed a kinematic object model into the deep neutral
network learning for general articulated object pose estimation. The kinematic
function is defined on the appropriately parameterized object motion variables.
It is differentiable and can be used in the gradient descent based optimization
in network training. The prior knowledge on the object geometric model is fully
exploited and the structure is guaranteed to be valid. We show convincing
experiment results on a toy example and the 3D human pose estimation problem.
For the latter we achieve state-of-the-art result on Human3.6M dataset.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is consisting of independent and distributed
sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature,
sound, pressure, etc. The most crucial and fundamental challenge facing WSN is
security. Due to minimum capacity in-term of memory cost, processing and
physical accessibility to sensors devices the security attacks are problematic.
They are mostly deployed in open area, which expose them to different kinds of
attacks. In this paper, we present an illustration of different attacks and
vulnerabilities in WSN. Then we describe and analyze security requirement,
countermeasures based on cryptography mechanisms in literature. Finally, we
present possible directions in future research.

 <dc:description>  This paper is devoted to the construction of polynomial 2-surfaces which
possess a polynomial area element. In particular we study these surfaces in the
Euclidean space $\mathbb R^3$ (where they are equivalent to the PN surfaces)
and in the Minkowski space $\mathbb R^{3,1}$ (where they provide the MOS
surfaces). We show generally in real vector spaces of any dimension and any
metric that the Gram determinant of a parametric set of subspaces is a perfect
square if and only if the Gram determinant of its orthogonal complement is a
perfect square. Consequently the polynomial surfaces of a given degree with
polynomial area element can be constructed from the prescribed normal fields
solving a system of linear equations. The degree of the constructed surface
depending on the degree and the quality of the prescribed normal field is
investigated and discussed. We use the presented approach to interpolate a
network of points and associated normals with piecewise polynomial surfaces
with polynomial area element and demonstrate our method on a number of examples
(constructions of quadrilateral as well as triangular patches

training activity as an opportunity to create social interactions, by
complementing training features with social instruments. Finally, we report on

 <dc:description>  We describe a complete Scheme implementation of miniAdapton, which implements
the core functionality of the Adapton system for incremental computation (also
known as self-adjusting computation). Like Adapton, miniAdapton allows
programmers to safely combine mutation and memoization. miniAdapton is built on
top of an even simpler system, microAdapton. Both miniAdapton and microAdapton
are designed to be easy to understand, extend, and port to host languages other
than Scheme. We also present adapton variables, a new interface in Adapton for
variables intended to represent expressions.

 <dc:description>  Devices and sensors for identification of fallers can be used to implement
actions to prevent falls and to allow the elderly to live an independent life
while reducing the long-term care costs. In this study we aimed to investigate
the accuracy of Timed Up and Go test, for fallers' identification, using fusion
of features extracted from accelerometer data. Single and dual tasks TUG
(manual and cognitive) were performed by a final sample (94% power) of 36
community dwelling healthy older persons (18 fallers paired with 18
non-fallers) while they wear a single triaxial accelerometer at waist with
sampling rate of 200Hz. The segmentation of the TUG different trials and its
comparative analysis allows to better discriminate fallers from non-fallers,
while conventional functional tests fail to do so. In addition, we show that
the fusion of features improve the discrimination power, achieving AUC of 0.84
(Sensitivity=Specificity=0.83, 95% CI 0.62-0.91), and demonstrating the
clinical relevance of the study. We concluded that features extracted from
segmented TUG trials acquired with dual tasks has potential to improve
performance when identifying fallers via accelerometer sensors, which can
improve TUG accuracy for clinical and epidemiological applications.

 <dc:description>  Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) models arise naturally as
simple reformulations of many standard clustering algorithms including the
popular spectral clustering method. Recent work has demonstrated that an
elementary instance of SNMF provides superior clustering quality compared to
many classic clustering algorithms on a variety of synthetic and real world
data sets. In this work, we present novel reformulations of this instance of
SNMF based on the notion of variable splitting and produce two fast and
effective algorithms for its optimization using i) the provably convergent
Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) procedure and ii) a heuristic version of
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework. Our two
algorithms present an interesting tradeoff between computational speed and
mathematical convergence guarantee: while the former method is provably
convergent it is considerably slower than the latter approach, for which we
also provide significant but less stringent mathematical proof regarding its
convergence. Through extensive experiments we show not only that the efficacy
of these approaches is equal to that of the state of the art SNMF algorithm,
but also that the latter of our algorithms is extremely fast being one to two
orders of magnitude faster in terms of total computation time than the state of
the art approach, outperforming even spectral clustering in terms of
computation time on large data sets.

 <dc:description>  Volumetric cloudscapes are prohibitively expensive to render in real time
without extensive optimisations. Previous approaches render the clouds to an
offscreen buffer at one quarter resolution and update a fraction of the pixels
per frame, drawing the remaining pixels by temporal reprojection. We present an
alternative approach, reducing the number of raymarching steps and adding a
randomly jittered offset to the raymarch. We use an analytical integration
technique to make results consistent with a lower number of raymarching steps.
To remove noise from the resulting image we apply a temporal anti-aliasing
implementation. The result is a technique producing visually similar results
with 1/16 the number of steps.

 <dc:description>  Vector quantization is an essential tool for tasks involving large scale
data, for example, large scale similarity search, which is crucial for
content-based information retrieval and analysis. In this paper, we propose a
novel vector quantization framework that iteratively minimizes quantization
error. First, we provide a detailed review on a relevant vector quantization
method named \textit{residual vector quantization} (RVQ). Next, we propose
\textit{generalized residual vector quantization} (GRVQ) to further improve
over RVQ. Many vector quantization methods can be viewed as the special cases
of our proposed framework. We evaluate GRVQ on several large scale benchmark
datasets for large scale search, classification and object retrieval. We
compared GRVQ with existing methods in detail. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GRVQ framework substantially outperforms existing methods in
term of quantization accuracy and computation efficiency.

to provide a realistic representation of the mobility behavior of autonomous

real-world applications. Knowledge about the current mobility properties and
its predicted development is used by mobility-aware routing mechanisms in order
to optimize routing decisions and avoid path losses at runtime. In a proof of

improvements to the robustness of communication paths.

 <dc:description>  Utilizing complex dynamics of chaotic maps and systems in encryption was
studied comprehensively in the past two and a half decades. In 1989, Fridrich's
chaotic image encryption scheme was designed by iterating chaotic position
permutation and value substitution some rounds, which received intensive
attention in the field of chaos-based cryptography. In 2010, Solak \textit{et
al.} proposed a chosen-ciphertext attack on the Fridrich's scheme utilizing
influence network between cipher-pixels and the corresponding plain-pixels.
Based on their creative work, this paper scrutinized some properties of
Fridrich's scheme with concise mathematical language. Then, some minor defects
of the real performance of Solak's attack method were given. The work provides
some bases for further optimizing attack on the Fridrich's scheme and its
variants.

 <dc:description>  Key to biological success, the requisite variety that confronts an adaptive
organism is the set of detectable, accessible, and controllable states in its
environment. We analyze its role in the thermodynamic functioning of
information ratchets---a form of autonomous Maxwellian Demon capable of
exploiting fluctuations in an external information reservoir to harvest useful
work from a thermal bath. This establishes a quantitative paradigm for
understanding how adaptive agents leverage structured thermal environments for
their own thermodynamic benefit. General ratchets behave as memoryful
communication channels, interacting with their environment sequentially and
storing results to an output. The bulk of thermal ratchets analyzed to date,
however, assume memoryless environments that generate input signals without
temporal correlations. Employing computational mechanics and a new
information-processing Second Law of Thermodynamics (IPSL) we remove these
restrictions, analyzing general finite-state ratchets interacting with
structured environments that generate correlated input signals. On the one
hand, we demonstrate that a ratchet need not have memory to exploit an
uncorrelated environment. On the other, and more appropriate to biological
adaptation, we show that a ratchet must have memory to most effectively
leverage structure and correlation in its environment. The lesson is that to
optimally harvest work a ratchet's memory must reflect the input generator's
memory. Finally, we investigate achieving the IPSL bounds on the amount of work
a ratchet can extract from its environment, discovering that finite-state,
optimal ratchets are unable to reach these bounds. In contrast, we show that
infinite-state ratchets can go well beyond these bounds by utilizing their own
infinite &quot;negentropy&quot;. We conclude with an outline of the collective
thermodynamics of information-ratchet swarms.

 <dc:description>  We explore if and how Microsoft Academic (MA) could be used for bibliometric
analyses. First, we examine the Academic Knowledge API (AK API), an interface
to access MA data, and compare it to Google Scholar (GS). Second, we perform a
comparative citation analysis of researchers by normalizing data from MA and
Scopus. We find that MA offers structured and rich metadata, which facilitates
data retrieval, handling and processing. In addition, the AK API allows
retrieving frequency distributions of citations. We consider these features to
be a major advantage of MA over GS. However, we identify four main limitations
regarding the available metadata. First, MA does not provide the document type
of a publication. Second, the 'fields of study' are dynamic, too specific and
field hierarchies are incoherent. Third, some publications are assigned to
incorrect years. Fourth, the metadata of some publications did not include all
authors. Nevertheless, we show that an average-based indicator (i.e. the
journal normalized citation score; JNCS) as well as a distribution-based
indicator (i.e. percentile rank classes; PR classes) can be calculated with
relative ease using MA. Hence, normalization of citation counts is feasible
with MA. The citation analyses in MA and Scopus yield uniform results. The JNCS
and the PR classes are similar in both databases, and, as a consequence, the
evaluation of the researchers' publication impact is congruent in MA and
Scopus. Given the fast development in the last year, we postulate that MA has
the potential to be used for full-fledged bibliometric analyses.

 <dc:description>  Food, energy, and water (FEW) are key resources to sustain human life and
economic growth. There is an increasing stress on these interconnected
resources due to population growth, natural disasters, and human activities.
New research is necessary to foster more efficient, more secure, and safer use
of FEW resources in the U.S. and globally. In this position paper, we present
the idea of a knowledge ecosystem for enabling the semantic data integration of
heterogeneous datasets in the FEW system to promote knowledge discovery and
superior decision making through semantic reasoning. Rich, diverse datasets
published by U.S. federal agencies will be utilized. Our knowledge ecosystem
will build on Semantic Web technologies and advances in statistical relational
learning to (a) represent, integrate, and harmonize diverse data sources and
(b) perform ontology-based reasoning to discover actionable insights from FEW
datasets.

 <dc:description>  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been recently considered as means to
provide enhanced coverage or relaying services to mobile users (MUs) in
wireless systems with limited or no infrastructure. In this paper, a UAV-based
mobile cloud computing system is studied in which a moving UAV is endowed with
computing capabilities to offer computation offloading opportunities to MUs
with limited local processing capabilities. The system aims at minimizing the
total mobile energy consumption while satisfying quality of service
requirements of the offloaded mobile application. Offloading is enabled by
uplink and downlink communications between the mobile devices and the UAV that
take place by means of frequency division duplex (FDD) via orthogonal or
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. The problem of jointly
optimizing the bit allocation for uplink and downlink communication as well as
for computing at the UAV, along with the cloudlet's trajectory under latency
and UAV's energy budget constraints is formulated and addressed by leveraging
successive convex approximation (SCA) strategies. Numerical results demonstrate
the significant energy savings that can be accrued by means of the proposed
joint optimization of bit allocation and cloudlet's trajectory as compared to
local mobile execution as well as to partial optimization approaches that
design only the bit allocation or the cloudlet's trajectory.

 <dc:title>Taming Context-Sensitive Languages with Principled Stateful Parsing</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>D.3.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Historically, true context-sensitive parsing has seldom been applied to
programming languages, due to its inherent complexity. However, many mainstream
programming and markup languages (C, Haskell, Python, XML, and more) possess
context-sensitive features. These features are traditionally handled with
ad-hoc code (e.g., custom lexers), outside of the scope of parsing theory.
  Current grammar formalisms struggle to express context-sensitive features.
Most solutions lack context transparency: they make grammars hard to write,
maintain and compose by hardwiring context through the entire grammar. Instead,
we approach context-sensitive parsing through the idea that parsers may recall
previously matched input (or data derived therefrom) in order to make parsing
decisions. We make use of mutable parse state to enable this form of recall.
  We introduce principled stateful parsing as a new transactional discipline
that makes state changes transparent to parsing mechanisms such as backtracking
and memoization. To enforce this discipline, users specify parsers using
formally specified primitive state manipulation operations.
  Our solution is available as a parsing library named Autumn. We illustrate
our solution by implementing some practical context-sensitive grammar features
such as significant whitespace handling and namespace classification.

other tools ranging from mathematical programming to constraint programming. We
use both real and randomly generated benchmarks.
  From this and similar results, we claim for the convenience of developing
compiler front-ends being able to translate from constraint programming
languages to the SMT-LIB standard language.

 <dc:description>  In this study, we propose two voting rules that extend the D'Hondt method for
approval-based multi-winner elections. Our theoretical results prove that one
of such rules preserves the main properties of the original D'Hondt method:
house monotonicity, lower quota satisfaction, and population monotonicity, and
that it can be executed in polynomial time.

 <dc:title>Online Learning of Combinatorial Objects via Extended Formulation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The standard techniques for online learning of combinatorial objects perform
multiplicative updates followed by projections into the convex hull of all the
objects. However, this methodology can be expensive if the convex hull contains
many facets. For example, the convex hull of $n$-symbol Huffman trees is known
to have exponentially many facets (Maurras et al., 2010). We get around this
difficulty by exploiting extended formulations (Kaibel, 2011), which encode the
polytope of combinatorial objects in a higher dimensional &quot;extended&quot; space with
only polynomially many facets. We develop a general framework for converting
extended formulations into efficient online algorithms with good relative loss
bounds. We present applications of our framework to online learning of Huffman
trees and permutations. The regret bounds of the resulting algorithms are
within a factor of $O(\sqrt{\log(n)})$ of the state-of-the-art specialized
algorithms for permutations, and depending on the loss regimes, improve on or
match the state-of-the-art for Huffman trees. Our method is general and can be
applied to other combinatorial objects.

 <dc:description>  Patterns of event propagation in online social networks provide novel
insights on the modeling and analysis of information dissemination over
networks and physical systems. This paper studies the importance of follower
links for event propagation on Twitter. Three recent event propagation traces
are collected with the Twitter user language field being used to identify the
Network of Networks (NoN) structure embedded in the Twitter follower networks.
We first formulate event propagation on Twitter as an iterative state equation,
and then propose an effective score function on follower links accounting for
the containment of event propagation via link removals. Furthermore, we find
that utilizing the NoN model can successfully identify influential follower
links such that their removals lead to remarkable reduction in event
propagation on Twitter follower networks. Experimental results find that the
between-network follower links, though only account for a small portion of the
total follower links, are crucial to event propagation on Twitter.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) is large-scale by nature, which is manifested by
the massive number of connected devices as well as their vast spatial
existence. Cellular networks, which provide ubiquitous, reliable, and efficient
wireless access, are natural candidates to provide the first-mile access for
the data tsunami to be generated by the IoT. However, cellular networks may
have scalability problems to provide uplink connectivity to massive numbers of
connected things. To characterize the scalability of cellular uplink in the
context of IoT networks, this paper develops a traffic-aware spatiotemporal
mathematical model for IoT devices supported by cellular uplink connectivity.
The developed model is based on stochastic geometry and queueing theory to
account for the traffic requirement per IoT device, the different transmission
strategies, and the mutual interference between the IoT devices. To this end,
the developed model is utilized to characterize the extent to which cellular
networks can accommodate IoT traffic as well as to assess and compare three
different transmission strategies that incorporate a combination of
transmission persistency, backoff, and power-ramping. The analysis and the
results clearly illustrate the scalability problem imposed by IoT on cellular
network and offer insights into effective scenarios for each transmission
strategy.

 <dc:description>  In a dynamic parametric process every subprocess may spawn arbitrarily many,
identical child processes, that may communicate either over global variables,
or over local variables that are shared with their parent.
  We show that reachability for dynamic parametric processes is decidable under
mild assumptions. These assumptions are e.g. met if individual processes are
realized by pushdown systems, or even higher-order pushdown systems. We also
provide algorithms for subclasses of pushdown dynamic parametric processes,
with complexity ranging between NP and DEXPTIME.

 <dc:description>  Many important applications, including signal reconstruction, parameter
estimation, and signal processing in a compressed domain, rely on a
low-dimensional representation of the dataset that preserves {\em all} pairwise
distances between the data points and leverages the inherent geometric
structure that is typically present. Recently Hedge, Sankaranarayanan, Yin and
Baraniuk \cite{hedge2015} proposed the first data-aware near-isometric linear
embedding which achieves the best of both worlds. However, their method NuMax
does not scale to large-scale datasets.
  Our main contribution is a simple, data-aware, near-isometric linear
dimensionality reduction method which significantly outperforms a
state-of-the-art method \cite{hedge2015} with respect to scalability while
achieving high quality near-isometries. Furthermore, our method comes with
strong worst-case theoretical guarantees that allow us to guarantee the quality
of the obtained near-isometry. We verify experimentally the efficiency of our
method on numerous real-world datasets, where we find that our method ($&lt;$10
secs) is more than 3\,000$\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art method
\cite{hedge2015} ($&gt;$9 hours) on medium scale datasets with 60\,000 data points
in 784 dimensions. Finally, we use our method as a preprocessing step to
increase the computational efficiency of a classification application and for
speeding up approximate nearest neighbor queries.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work proposes adaptive buffer-aided distributed space-time coding
schemes and algorithms with feedback for wireless networks equipped with
buffer-aided relays. The proposed schemes employ a maximum likelihood receiver
at the destination and adjustable codes subject to a power constraint with an
amplify-and-forward cooperative strategy at the relays. Each relay is equipped
with a buffer and is capable of storing blocks of received symbols and
forwarding the data to the destination if selected. Different antenna
configurations and wireless channels, such as static block fading channels, are
considered. The effects of using buffer-aided relays to improve the bit error
rate (BER) performance are also studied. Adjustable relay selection and
optimization algorithms that exploit the extra degrees of freedom of relays
equipped with buffers are developed to improve the BER performance. We also
analyze the pairwise error probability and diversity of the system when using
the proposed schemes and algorithms in a cooperative network. Simulation
results show that the proposed schemes and algorithms obtain performance gains
over previously reported techniques.

 <dc:title>Predicting Future Shanghai Stock Market Price using ANN in the Period
  21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Predicting the prices of stocks at any stock market remains a quest for many
investors and researchers. Those who trade at the stock market tend to use
technical, fundamental or time series analysis in their predictions. These
methods usually guide on trends and not the exact likely prices. It is for this
reason that Artificial Intelligence systems, such as Artificial Neural Network,
that is feedforward multi-layer perceptron with error backpropagation, can be
used for such predictions. A difficulty in neural network application is the
determination of suitable network parameters. A previous research by the author
already determined the network parameters as 5:21:21:1 with 80% training data
or 4-year of training data as a good enough model for stock prediction. This
model has been put to the test in predicting selected Shanghai Stock Exchange
stocks in the future period of 21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016, about one week after
the publication of these predictions. The research aims at confirming that
simple neural network systems can be quite powerful in typical stock market
predictions.

 <dc:description>  Multimodal registration is a challenging problem in medical imaging due the
high variability of tissue appearance under different imaging modalities. The
crucial component here is the choice of the right similarity measure. We make a
step towards a general learning-based solution that can be adapted to specific
situations and present a metric based on a convolutional neural network. Our
network can be trained from scratch even from a few aligned image pairs. The
metric is validated on intersubject deformable registration on a dataset
different from the one used for training, demonstrating good generalization. In
this task, we outperform mutual information by a significant margin.

 <dc:title>Evaluating Trajectory Collision Probability through Adaptive Importance
  Sampling for Safe Motion Planning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schmerling, Edward</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pavone, Marco</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a tool for addressing a key component in many algorithms
for planning robot trajectories under uncertainty: evaluation of the safety of
a robot whose actions are governed by a closed-loop feedback policy near a
nominal planned trajectory. We describe an adaptive importance sampling Monte
Carlo framework that enables the evaluation of a given control policy for
satisfaction of a probabilistic collision avoidance constraint which also
provides an associated certificate of accuracy (in the form of a confidence
interval). In particular this adaptive technique is well-suited to addressing
the complexities of rigid-body collision checking applied to non-linear robot
dynamics. As a Monte Carlo method it is amenable to parallelization for
computational tractability, and is generally applicable to a wide gamut of
simulatable systems, including alternative noise models. Numerical experiments
demonstrating the effectiveness of the adaptive importance sampling procedure
are presented and discussed.

 <dc:description>  Networks created from real-world data contain some inaccuracies or noise,
manifested as small changes in the network structure. An important question is
whether these small changes can significantly affect the analysis results. In
this paper, we study the effect of noise in changing ranks of the high
centrality vertices. We compare, using the Jaccard Index (JI), how many of the
top-k high centrality nodes from the original network are also part of the
top-k ranked nodes from the noisy network. We deem a network as stable if the
JI value is high. We observe two features that affect the stability. First, the
stability is dependent on the number of top-ranked vertices considered. When
the vertices are ordered according to their centrality values, they group into
clusters. Perturbations to the network can change the relative ranking within
the cluster, but vertices rarely move from one cluster to another. Second, the
stability is dependent on the local connections of the high ranking vertices.
The network is highly stable if the high ranking vertices are connected to each
other. Our findings show that the stability of a network is affected by the
local properties of high centrality vertices, rather than the global properties
of the entire network. Based on these local properties we can identify the
stability of a network, without explicitly applying a noise model.

 <dc:description>  The internet has been blurring the lines between local and global cultures,
affecting in different ways the perception of people about themselves and
others. In the global context of the internet, search engine platforms are a
key mediator between individuals and information. In this paper, we examine the
local and global impact of the internet on the formation of female physical
attractiveness stereotypes in search engine results. By investigating datasets
of images collected from two major search engines in 42 countries, we identify
a significant fraction of replicated images. We find that common images are
clustered around countries with the same language. We also show that existence
of common images among countries is practically eliminated when the queries are
limited to local sites. In summary, we show evidence that results from search
engines are biased towards the language used to query the system, which leads
to certain attractiveness stereotypes that are often quite different from the
majority of the female population of the country.

 <dc:title>Pose from Action: Unsupervised Learning of Pose Features based on Motion</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Human actions are comprised of a sequence of poses. This makes videos of
humans a rich and dense source of human poses. We propose an unsupervised
method to learn pose features from videos that exploits a signal which is
complementary to appearance and can be used as supervision: motion. The key
idea is that humans go through poses in a predictable manner while performing
actions. Hence, given two poses, it should be possible to model the motion that
caused the change between them. We represent each of the poses as a feature in
a CNN (Appearance ConvNet) and generate a motion encoding from optical flow
maps using a separate CNN (Motion ConvNet). The data for this task is
automatically generated allowing us to train without human supervision. We
demonstrate the strength of the learned representation by finetuning the
trained model for Pose Estimation on the FLIC dataset, for static image action
recognition on PASCAL and for action recognition in videos on UCF101 and
HMDB51.

 <dc:description>  We have been developing a paradigm, which we refer to as
Learning-from-observation, for a robot to automatically acquire what-to-do
through observation of human performance. Since a simple mimicking method to
repeat exact joint angles does not work due to the kinematic and dynamic
difference between a human and a robot, the method introduces an intermediate
symbolic representation, task models, to conceptually represent what-to-do
through observation. Then, these task models are mapped appropriate robot
motions depending on each robot hardware. This paper presents task models,
designed based on the Labanotation, for upper body movements of humanoid
robots. Given a human motion sequence, we first analyze the motions of the
upper body, and extract certain fixed poses at certain key frames. These key
poses are translated into states represented by Labanotation symbols. Then,
task models, identified from the state transitions, are mapped to robot
movements on a particular robot hardware. Since the task models based on
Labanotation are independent from different robot hardware, we can share the
same observation module; we only need task mapping modules depending on
different robot hardware. The system was implemented and demonstrated that
three different robots can automatically mimic human upper body motions with
satisfactory level of resemblance.

 <dc:description>  The L1 norm has been tremendously popular in signal and image processing in
the past two decades due to its sparsity-promoting properties. More recently,
its generalization to non-Euclidean domains has been found useful in shape
analysis applications. For example, in conjunction with the minimization of the
Dirichlet energy, it was shown to produce a compactly supported quasi-harmonic
orthonormal basis, dubbed as compressed manifold modes. The continuous L1 norm
on the manifold is often replaced by the vector l1 norm applied to sampled
functions. We show that such an approach is incorrect in the sense that it does
not consistently discretize the continuous norm and warn against its
sensitivity to the specific sampling. We propose two alternative
discretizations resulting in an iteratively-reweighed l2 norm. We demonstrate
the proposed strategy on the compressed modes problem, which reduces to a
sequence of simple eigendecomposition problems not requiring non-convex
optimization on Stiefel manifolds and producing more stable and accurate
results.

 <dc:description>  The collision channel without feedback (CCw/oFB) model introduced by Massey
and Mathys, depicts a scenario in which M users share a thermal noise-free
communication channel with random relative time offsets among their clocks.
This paper considers an extension of this model, which allows the receiver to
use successive interference cancellation (SIC) to iteratively cancel the
interference caused by those collided packets that have been decoded by the
receiver. As the main result of this paper, we derive the zero-error capacity
region of this channel in the slot-synchronous case, and present a zero-error
capacity achieving scheme by joint protocol sequences and channel coding
design. It is shown that the negative impact on the zero-error capacity due to
a lack of time synchronization can be removed by the help of SIC. Moreover, we
characterize the protocol sequences that can be used to achieve zero-error
capacity 1 [packets/slot] by proving new results on shift-invariant sequences
and throughput-invariant sequences; these sequences have been known to achieve
zero-error capacity for the basic CCw/oFB model without SIC. This
characterization sheds light on the minimum sequence period required in order
to attain zero-error capacity 1.

 <dc:title>Frameworks for Solving Turing Kernel Lower Bound Problem and Finding
  Natural Candidate Problems in NP-intermediate</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Luo, Weidong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Kernelization is a significant topic in parameterized complexity. Turing
kernelization is a general form of kernelization. In the aspect of
kernelization, an impressive hardness theory has been established [Bodlaender
etc. (ICALP 2008, JCSS2009), Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008, JCSS 2011), Dell
and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010, J. ACM 2014), Drucker (FOCS 2012, SIAM J. Comput.
2015)], which can obtain lower bounds of kernel size. Unfortunately, there is
yet no tool can prove Turing kernel lower bound for any FPT problem modulo any
reasonable complexity hypothesis. Thus, constructing a framework for Turing
kernel lower bound was proposed as an open problem in different occasions
[Fernau etc. (STACS 2009), Misra etc. (Discrete Optimization 2011), Kratsch
(Bulletin of the EATCS 2014), Cygan etc. (Dagstuhl Seminars on kernels 2014)].
Ladner [J. ACM 1975] proved that if $P \not = NP$, then there exist infinitely
many NP-intermediate problems. However, the NP-intermediate problem constructed
by Ladner is artificial. Thus, finding natural NP-intermediate problems under
the assumption of $P \not= NP$ is a longstanding open problem in computation
complexity community. This paper builds a new bridge between parameterized
complexity and classic computational complexity. By using this new connection,
some frameworks can be constructed. Based on the assumption that the polynomial
hierarchy and the exponential hierarchy will not collapse, these frameworks
have three main applications. Firstly, these frameworks can be used to obtain
Turing kernel lower bounds of some important FPT problems, thus solving the
first open problem. Secondly, these frameworks can also be used to obtain
better kernel lower bounds for these problems. Thirdly, these frameworks can be
used to figure out a large number of natural problems in NP-intermediate, thus
making some contributions to the second open problem.

 <dc:description>  As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN)
that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model
has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it
has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A
major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make
it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the
generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete
sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to
balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been
generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called
SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic
policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator
differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL
reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence,
and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo
search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks
demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.

 <dc:description>  Recently developed neuromorphic vision sensors have become promising
candidates for agile and autonomous robotic applications primarily due to, in
particular, their high temporal resolution and low latency. Each pixel of this
sensor independently fires an asynchronous stream of &quot;retinal events&quot; once a
change in the light field is detected. Existing computer vision algorithms can
only process periodic frames and so a new class of algorithms needs to be
developed that can efficiently process these events for control tasks. In this
paper, we investigate the problem of regulating a continuous-time linear time
invariant (LTI) system to a desired point using measurements from a
neuromorphic sensor. We present an $H_\infty$ controller that regulates the LTI
system to a desired set-point and provide the set of neuromorphic sensor based
cameras for the given system that fulfill the regulation task. The
effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on an unstable system.

 <dc:description>  Sparse Bayesian learning is one of the state-of- the-art machine learning
algorithms, which is able to make stable and reliable probabilistic
predictions. However, some of these algorithms, e.g. probabilistic
classification vector machine (PCVM) and relevant vector machine (RVM), are not
capable of eliminating irrelevant and redundant features which could lead to
performance degradation. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a
sparse Bayesian classifier which simultaneously selects the relevant samples
and features. We name this classifier a probabilistic feature selection and
classification vector machine (PFCVM), in which truncated Gaussian
distributions are em- ployed as both sample and feature priors. In order to
derive the analytical solution for the proposed algorithm, we use Laplace
approximation to calculate approximate posteriors and marginal likelihoods.
Finally, we obtain the optimized parameters and hyperparameters by the type-II
maximum likelihood method. The experiments on synthetic data set, benchmark
data sets and high dimensional data sets validate the performance of PFCVM
under two criteria: accuracy of classification and efficacy of selected
features. Finally, we analyze the generalization performance of PFCVM and
derive a generalization error bound for PFCVM. Then by tightening the bound, we
demonstrate the significance of the sparseness for the model.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Integer coefficient selection is an important decoding step in the
implementation of compute-and-forward (C-F) relaying scheme. Choosing the
optimal integer coefficients in C-F has been shown to be a shortest vector
problem (SVP) which is known to be NP hard in its general form. Exhaustive
search of the integer coefficients is only feasible in complexity for small
number of users while approximation algorithms such as Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz
(LLL) lattice reduction algorithm only find a vector within an exponential
factor of the shortest vector. An optimal deterministic algorithm was proposed
for C-F by Sahraei and Gastpar specifically for the real valued channel case.
In this paper, we adapt their idea to the complex valued channel and propose an
efficient search algorithm to find the optimal integer coefficient vectors over
the ring of Gaussian integers and the ring of Eisenstein integers. A second
algorithm is then proposed that generalises our search algorithm to the
Integer-Forcing MIMO C-F receiver. Performance and efficiency of the proposed
algorithms are evaluated through simulations and theoretical analysis.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new approach to linear ill-posed inverse problems. Our algorithm
alternates between enforcing two constraints: the measurements and the
statistical correlation structure in some transformed space. We use a
non-linear multiscale scattering transform which discards the phase and thus
exposes strong spectral correlations otherwise hidden beneath the phase
fluctuations. As a result, both constraints may be put into effect by linear
projections in their respective spaces. We apply the algorithm to
super-resolution and tomography and show that it outperforms ad hoc convex
regularizers and stably recovers the missing spectrum.

 <dc:description>  Communication and networking research introduces new protocols and standards
with an increasing number of researchers relying on real experiments rather
than simulations to evaluate the performance of their new protocols. A number
of testbeds are currently available for this purpose and a growing number of
users are requesting access to those testbeds. This motivates the need for
better utilization of the testbeds by allowing concurrent experimentations. In
this work, we introduce a novel mapping algorithm that aims to maximize
wireless testbed utilization using frequency slicing of the spectrum resources.
The mapper employs genetic algorithm to find the best combination of requests
that can be served concurrently, after getting all possible mappings of each
request via an induced sub-graph isomorphism stage. The proposed mapper is
tested on grid testbeds and randomly generated topologies. The solution of our
mapper is compared to the optimal one, obtained through a brute-force search,
and was able to serve the same number of requests in 82.96% of testing
scenarios. Furthermore, we show the effect of the careful design of testbed
topology on enhancing the testbed utilization by applying our mapper on a
carefully positioned 8-nodes testbed. In addition, our proposed approach for
testbed slicing and requests mapping has shown an improved performance in terms
of total served requests, about five folds, compared to the simple allocation
policy with no slicing.

 <dc:title>Multilinear Grammar: Ranks and Interpretations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gibbon, Dafydd</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multilinear Grammar provides a framework for integrating the many different
syntagmatic structures of language into a coherent semiotically based Rank
Interpretation Architecture, with default linear grammars at each rank. The
architecture defines a Sui Generis Condition on ranks, from discourse through
utterance and phrasal structures to the word, with its sub-ranks of morphology
and phonology. Each rank has unique structures and its own semantic-pragmatic
and prosodic-phonetic interpretation models. Default computational models for
each rank are proposed, based on a Procedural Plausibility Condition:
incremental processing in linear time with finite working memory. We suggest
that the Rank Interpretation Architecture and its multilinear properties
provide systematic design features of human languages, contrasting with
unordered lists of key properties or single structural properties at one rank,
such as recursion, which have previously been been put forward as language
design features. The framework provides a realistic background for the gradual
development of complexity in the phylogeny and ontogeny of language, and
clarifies a range of challenges for the evaluation of realistic linguistic
theories and applications. The empirical objective of the paper is to
demonstrate unique multilinear properties at each rank and thereby motivate the
Multilinear Grammar and Rank Interpretation Architecture framework as a
coherent approach to capturing the complexity of human languages in the
simplest possible way.

 <dc:description>  We study simultaneous localization and mapping with a device that uses
reflections to measure its distance from walls. Such a device can be realized
acoustically with a synchronized collocated source and receiver; it behaves
like a bat with no capacity for directional hearing or vocalizing. In this
paper we generalize our previous work in 2D, and show that the 3D case is not
just a simple extension, but rather a fundamentally different inverse problem.
While generically the 2D problem has a unique solution, in 3D uniqueness is
always absent in rooms with fewer than nine walls. In addition to the complete
characterization of ambiguities which arise due to this non-uniqueness, we
propose a robust solution for inexact measurements similar to analogous results
for Euclidean Distance Matrices. Our theoretical results have important
consequences for the design of collocated range-only SLAM systems, and we
support them with an array of computer experiments.

 <dc:description>  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brings the power of deep neural networks to
bear on the generic task of trial-and-error learning, and its effectiveness has
been convincingly demonstrated on tasks such as Atari video games and the game
of Go. However, contemporary DRL systems inherit a number of shortcomings from
the current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require
very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn
even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to
reason on an abstract level, which makes it difficult to implement high-level
cognitive functions such as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and
hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally, their operation is largely opaque to
humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains in which verifiability is
important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning
architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with the
potential to overcome each of these shortcomings. As proof-of-concept, we
present a preliminary implementation of the architecture and apply it to
several variants of a simple video game. We show that the resulting system --
though just a prototype -- learns effectively, and, by acquiring a set of
symbolic rules that are easily comprehensible to humans, dramatically
outperforms a conventional, fully neural DRL system on a stochastic variant of
the game.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a problem of formation control of large vehicle
network and propose a systematic way to establish robust and efficient
interaction between agents, referred as cascade formulation. The proposed
formulation divides the network into smaller clusters and meta-cluster ensuring
2-rooted communication graph. We use complex Laplacian approach to provide
control law for proposed formulation. Further, we provide sufficient conditions
on proposed approach to ensure globally stable formation. We also demonstrate
that the proposed formulation gives flexibility to constrain the eigenvalue
spectra of overall closed-loop dynamics to ensure desired convergence rate and
control input intensity. The paper also illustrates the robustness of the
proposed formulation to some uncertainties such as loss in communication links
and actuator failure. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated
by simulating it for an example of vehicle network with thirty agents.

 <dc:description>  Advances in deep reinforcement learning have allowed autonomous agents to
perform well on Atari games, often outperforming humans, using only raw pixels
to make their decisions. However, most of these games take place in 2D
environments that are fully observable to the agent. In this paper, we present
the first architecture to tackle 3D environments in first-person shooter games,
that involve partially observable states. Typically, deep reinforcement
learning methods only utilize visual input for training. We present a method to
augment these models to exploit game feature information such as the presence
of enemies or items, during the training phase. Our model is trained to
simultaneously learn these features along with minimizing a Q-learning
objective, which is shown to dramatically improve the training speed and
performance of our agent. Our architecture is also modularized to allow
different models to be independently trained for different phases of the game.
We show that the proposed architecture substantially outperforms built-in AI
agents of the game as well as humans in deathmatch scenarios.

 <dc:description>  The objective of this work is to estimate 3D human pose from a single RGB
image. Extracting image representations which incorporate both spatial relation
of body parts and their relative depth plays an essential role in accurate3D
pose reconstruction. In this paper, for the first time, we show that camera
viewpoint in combination to 2D joint lo-cations significantly improves 3D pose
accuracy without the explicit use of perspective geometry mathematical
models.To this end, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Net-work (CNN) to
learn categorical camera viewpoint. To make the network robust against clothing
and body shape of the subject in the image, we utilized 3D computer rendering
to synthesize additional training images. We test our framework on the largest
3D pose estimation bench-mark, Human3.6m, and achieve up to 20% error reduction
compared to the state-of-the-art approaches that do not use body part
segmentation.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that options can make planning more efficient, among their
many benefits. Thus far, algorithms for autonomously discovering a set of
useful options were heuristic. Naturally, a principled way of finding a set of
useful options may be more promising and insightful. In this paper we suggest a
mathematical characterization of good sets of options using tools from
information theory. This characterization enables us to find conditions for a
set of options to be optimal and an algorithm that outputs a useful set of
options and illustrate the proposed algorithm in simulation.

 <dc:title>Sequential Ensemble Learning for Outlier Detection: A Bias-Variance

 <dc:description>  Ensemble methods for classification and clustering have been effectively used
for decades, while ensemble learning for outlier detection has only been
studied recently. In this work, we design a new ensemble approach for outlier
detection in multi-dimensional point data, which provides improved accuracy by
reducing error through both bias and variance. Although classification and
outlier detection appear as different problems, their theoretical underpinnings
are quite similar in terms of the bias-variance trade-off [1], where outlier
detection is considered as a binary classification task with unobserved labels
but a similar bias-variance decomposition of error.
  In this paper, we propose a sequential ensemble approach called CARE that
employs a two-phase aggregation of the intermediate results in each iteration
to reach the final outcome. Unlike existing outlier ensembles which solely
incorporate a parallel framework by aggregating the outcomes of independent
base detectors to reduce variance, our ensemble incorporates both the parallel
and sequential building blocks to reduce bias as well as variance by ($i$)
successively eliminating outliers from the original dataset to build a better
data model on which outlierness is estimated (sequentially), and ($ii$)
combining the results from individual base detectors and across iterations
(parallelly). Through extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets
mainly from the UCI machine learning repository [2], we show that CARE performs
significantly better than or at least similar to the individual baselines. We
also compare CARE with the state-of-the-art outlier ensembles where it also
provides significant improvement when it is the winner and remains close
otherwise.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of online learning of optimal control for repeatedly
operated systems in the presence of parametric uncertainty. During each round
of operation, environment selects system parameters according to a fixed but
unknown probability distribution. These parameters govern the dynamics of a
plant. An agent chooses a control input to the plant and is then revealed the
cost of the choice. In this setting, we design an agent that personalizes the
control input to this plant taking into account the stochasticity involved. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a simulated system.

 <dc:description>  We give a quantum algorithm for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs). It has
worst-case running time $n^{\frac{1}{2}} m^{\frac{1}{2}} s^2
\text{poly}(\log(n), \log(m), R, r, 1/\delta)$, with $n$ and $s$ the dimension
and row-sparsity of the input matrices, respectively, $m$ the number of
constraints, $\delta$ the accuracy of the solution, and $R, r$ a upper bounds
on the size of the optimal primal and dual solutions. This gives a square-root
unconditional speed-up over any classical method for solving SDPs both in $n$
and $m$. We prove the algorithm cannot be substantially improved (in terms of
$n$ and $m$) giving a $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{2}}+m^{\frac{1}{2}})$ quantum lower
bound for solving semidefinite programs with constant $s, R, r$ and $\delta$.
  The quantum algorithm is constructed by a combination of quantum Gibbs
sampling and the multiplicative weight method. In particular it is based on a
classical algorithm of Arora and Kale for approximately solving SDPs. We
present a modification of their algorithm to eliminate the need for solving an
inner linear program which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the randomized distributed coordinate descent
algorithm with quantized updates. In the literature, the iteration complexity
of the randomized distributed coordinate descent algorithm has been
characterized under the assumption that machines can exchange updates with an
infinite precision. We consider a practical scenario in which the messages
exchange occurs over channels with finite capacity, and hence the updates have
to be quantized. We derive sufficient conditions on the quantization error such
that the algorithm with quantized update still converge. We further verify our
theoretical results by running an experiment, where we apply the algorithm with
quantized updates to solve a linear regression problem.

 <dc:description>  Science is becoming increasingly more interdisciplinary, giving rise to more
diversity in the areas of expertise within research labs and groups. This also
have brought changes to the role researchers in scientific works. As a
consequence, multi-authored scientific papers have now became a norm for high
quality research. Unfortunately, such a phenomenon induces bias to existing
metrics employed to evaluate the productivity and success of researchers. While
some metrics were adapted to account for the rank of authors in a paper, many
journals are now requiring a description of the specific roles of each author
in a publication. Surprisingly, the investigation of the relationship between
the rank of authors and their contributions has been limited to a few studies.
By analyzing such kind of data, here we show, quantitatively, that the
regularity in the authorship contributions decreases with the number of authors
in a paper. Furthermore, we found that the rank of authors and their roles in
papers follows three general patterns according to the nature of their
contributions, such as writing, data analysis, and the conduction of
experiments. This was accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data
retrieved from PLoS ONE and by devising an entropy-based measurement to
quantify the effective number of authors in a paper according to their
contributions. The analysis of such patterns confirms that some aspects of the
author ranking are in accordance with the expected convention, such as the fact
that the first and last authors are more likely to contribute more in a
scientific work. Conversely, such analysis also revealed that authors in the
intermediary positions of the rank contribute more in certain specific roles,
such as the task of collecting data. This indicates that the an unbiased
evaluation of researchers must take into account the distinct types of
scientific contributions.

 <dc:description>  Opponent modeling is necessary in multi-agent settings where secondary agents
with competing goals also adapt their strategies, yet it remains challenging
because strategies interact with each other and change. Most previous work
focuses on developing probabilistic models or parameterized strategies for
specific applications. Inspired by the recent success of deep reinforcement
learning, we present neural-based models that jointly learn a policy and the
behavior of opponents. Instead of explicitly predicting the opponent's action,
we encode observation of the opponents into a deep Q-Network (DQN); however, we
retain explicit modeling (if desired) using multitasking. By using a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, our model automatically discovers different
strategy patterns of opponents without extra supervision. We evaluate our
models on a simulated soccer game and a popular trivia game, showing superior
performance over DQN and its variants.

 <dc:description>  Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple views has made impressive strides in
recent years, chiefly by correlating isolated feature points, intensity
patterns, or curvilinear structures. In the general setting - without
controlled acquisition, abundant texture, curves and surfaces following
specific models or limiting scene complexity - most methods produce unorganized
point clouds, meshes, or voxel representations, with some exceptions producing
unorganized clouds of 3D curve fragments. Ideally, many applications require
structured representations of curves, surfaces and their spatial relationships.
This paper presents a step in this direction by formulating an approach that
combines 2D image curves into a collection of 3D curves, with topological
connectivity between them represented as a 3D graph. This results in a 3D
drawing, which is complementary to surface representations in the same sense as
a 3D scaffold complements a tent taut over it. We evaluate our results against
truth on synthetic and real datasets.

 <dc:description>  Context:More than half the literature on software effort estimation (SEE)
focuses on comparisons of new estimation methods. Surprisingly, there are no
studies comparing state of the art latest methods with decades-old approaches.
Objective:To check if new SEE methods generated better estimates than older
methods. Method: Firstly, collect effort estimation methods ranging from
&quot;classical&quot; COCOMO (parametric estimation over a pre-determined set of
attributes) to &quot;modern&quot; (reasoning via analogy using spectral-based clustering
plus instance and feature selection, and a recent &quot;baseline method&quot; proposed in
ACM Transactions on Software Engineering).Secondly, catalog the list of
objections that lead to the development of post-COCOMO estimation
methods.Thirdly, characterize each of those objections as a comparison between
newer and older estimation methods.Fourthly, using four COCOMO-style data sets
(from 1991, 2000, 2005, 2010) and run those comparisons experiments.Fifthly,
compare the performance of the different estimators using a Scott-Knott
procedure using (i) the A12 effect size to rule out &quot;small&quot; differences and
(ii) a 99% confident bootstrap procedure to check for statistically different
groupings of treatments). Results: The major negative results of this paper are
that for the COCOMO data sets, nothing we studied did any better than Boehm's
original procedure. Conclusions: When COCOMO-style attributes are available, we
strongly recommend (i) using that data and (ii) use COCOMO to generate
predictions. We say this since the experiments of this paper show that, at
least for effort estimation,how data is collected is more important than what
learner is applied to that data.

 <dc:title>Label-Free Supervision of Neural Networks with Physics and Domain
  Knowledge</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many machine learning applications, labeled data is scarce and obtaining
more labels is expensive. We introduce a new approach to supervising neural
networks by specifying constraints that should hold over the output space,
rather than direct examples of input-output pairs. These constraints are
derived from prior domain knowledge, e.g., from known laws of physics. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on real world and simulated
computer vision tasks. We are able to train a convolutional neural network to
detect and track objects without any labeled examples. Our approach can
significantly reduce the need for labeled training data, but introduces new
challenges for encoding prior knowledge into appropriate loss functions.

 <dc:description>  A central problem of random matrix theory is to understand the eigenvalues of
spiked random matrix models, in which a prominent eigenvector is planted into a
random matrix. These distributions form natural statistical models for
principal component analysis (PCA) problems throughout the sciences. Baik, Ben
Arous and P\'ech\'e showed that the spiked Wishart ensemble exhibits a sharp
phase transition asymptotically: when the signal strength is above a critical
threshold, it is possible to detect the presence of a spike based on the top
eigenvalue, and below the threshold the top eigenvalue provides no information.
Such results form the basis of our understanding of when PCA can detect a
low-rank signal in the presence of noise.
  However, not all the information about the spike is necessarily contained in
the spectrum. We study the fundamental limitations of statistical methods,
including non-spectral ones. Our results include:
  I) For the Gaussian Wigner ensemble, we show that PCA achieves the optimal
detection threshold for a variety of benign priors for the spike. We extend
previous work on the spherically symmetric and i.i.d. Rademacher priors through
an elementary, unified analysis.
  II) For any non-Gaussian Wigner ensemble, we show that PCA is always
suboptimal for detection. However, a variant of PCA achieves the optimal
threshold (for benign priors) by pre-transforming the matrix entries according
to a carefully designed function. This approach has been stated before, and we
give a rigorous and general analysis.
  III) For both the Gaussian Wishart ensemble and various synchronization
problems over groups, we show that inefficient procedures can work below the
threshold where PCA succeeds, whereas no known efficient algorithm achieves
this. This conjectural gap between what is statistically possible and what can
be done efficiently remains open.

 <dc:description>  Initial access is the process which allows a mobile user to first connect to
a cellular network. It consists of two main steps: cell search (CS) on the
downlink and random access (RA) on the uplink. Millimeter wave (mmWave)
cellular systems typically must rely on directional beamforming (BF) in order
to create a viable connection. The beamforming direction must therefore be
learned-as well as used-in the initial access process for mmWave cellular
networks. This paper considers four simple but representative initial access
protocols that use various combinations of directional beamforming and
omnidirectional transmission and reception at the mobile and the BS, during the
CS and RA phases. We provide a system-level analysis of the success probability
for CS and RA for each one, as well as of the initial access delay and
user-perceived downlink throughput (UPT). For a baseline exhaustive search
protocol, we find the optimal BS beamwidth and observe that in terms of initial
access delay it is decreasing as blockage becomes more severe, but is
relatively constant (about $\pi/12$) for UPT. Of the considered protocols, the
best trade-off between initial access delay and UPT is achieved under a fast
cell search protocol.

 <dc:description>  Computational aesthetics is an emerging field of research which has attracted
different research groups in the last few years. In this field, one of the main
approaches to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings and photographs is a
feature-based approach. Among the different features proposed to reach this
goal, color plays an import role. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset
that consists of paintings of Western provenance from 36 well-known painters
from the 15th to the 20th century. As a first step and to assess this dataset,
using a classifier, we investigate the correlation between the subjective
scores and two widely used features that are related to color perception and in
different aesthetic quality assessment approaches. Results show a
classification rate of up to 73% between the color features and the subjective
scores.

 <dc:description>  Instead of assuming fully loaded cells in the analysis on cache-enabled
networks with tools of stochastic geometry, we focus on the dynamic traffic in
this letter. With modeling traffic dynamics of request arrivals and departures,
probabilities of full-, free-, and modest-load cells in the large-scale
cache-enabled network are elaborated based on the traffic queue state.
Moreover, we propose to exploit the packets cached at cache-enabled users as
side information to cancel the incoming interference. Then the packet loss
rates for both the cache-enabled and cache-untenable users are investigated.
The simulation results verify our analysis.

alternates over the matrices (tensors) in the MPS representation. This
development is motivated in part by the success of matrix completion algorithms
which alternate over the (low-rank) factors. We comment on the computational
complexity of the proposed algorithm and numerically compare it with existing
methods employing low rank tensor train approximation for data completion as
well as several other recently proposed methods. We show that our method is
superior to existing ones for a variety of real settings.

 <dc:description>  For applications in navigation and robotics, estimating the 3D pose of
objects is as important as detection. Many approaches to pose estimation rely
on detecting or tracking parts or keypoints [11, 21]. In this paper we build on
a recent state-of-the-art convolutional network for slidingwindow detection
[10] to provide detection and rough pose estimation in a single shot, without
intermediate stages of detecting parts or initial bounding boxes. While not the
first system to treat pose estimation as a categorization problem, this is the
first attempt to combine detection and pose estimation at the same level using
a deep learning approach. The key to the architecture is a deep convolutional
network where scores for the presence of an object category, the offset for its
location, and the approximate pose are all estimated on a regular grid of
locations in the image. The resulting system is as accurate as recent work on
pose estimation (42.4% 8 View mAVP on Pascal 3D+ [21] ) and significantly
faster (46 frames per second (FPS) on a TITAN X GPU). This approach to
detection and rough pose estimation is fast and accurate enough to be widely
applied as a pre-processing step for tasks including high-accuracy pose
estimation, object tracking and localization, and vSLAM.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes to improve visual question answering (VQA) with
structured representations of both scene contents and questions. A key
challenge in VQA is to require joint reasoning over the visual and text
domains. The predominant CNN/LSTM-based approach to VQA is limited by
monolithic vector representations that largely ignore structure in the scene
and in the form of the question. CNN feature vectors cannot effectively capture
situations as simple as multiple object instances, and LSTMs process questions
as series of words, which does not reflect the true complexity of language
structure. We instead propose to build graphs over the scene objects and over
the question words, and we describe a deep neural network that exploits the
structure in these representations. This shows significant benefit over the
sequential processing of LSTMs. The overall efficacy of our approach is
demonstrated by significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, from 71.2%
to 74.4% in accuracy on the &quot;abstract scenes&quot; multiple-choice benchmark, and
from 34.7% to 39.1% in accuracy over pairs of &quot;balanced&quot; scenes, i.e. images
with fine-grained differences and opposite yes/no answers to a same question.

 <dc:description>  Fraud (swindling money, property, or authority by fictionizing,
counterfeiting, forging, or imitating things, or by feigning other persons
privately) forms its threats against public security and network security.
Anti-fraud is essentially the identification of a person or thing. In this
paper, the authors first propose the concept of idology - a systematic and
scientific study of identifications of persons and things, and give the
definitions of a symmetric identity and an asymmetric identity. Discuss the
converting symmetric identities (e.g., fingerprints) to asymmetric identities.
Make a comparison between a symmetric identity and an asymmetric identity, and
emphasize that symmetric identities cannot guard against inside jobs. Compare
asymmetric RFIDs with BFIDs, and point out that a BFID is lightweight,
economical, convenient, and environmentalistic, and more suitable for the
anti-counterfeiting and source tracing of consumable merchandise such as foods,
drugs, and cosmetics. The authors design the structure of a united verification
platform for BFIDs and the composition of an identification system, and discuss
the wide applications of BFIDs in public security and network security -
antiterrorism and dynamic passwords for example.

 <dc:description>  Learning to rank is a machine learning technique broadly used in many areas
such as document retrieval, collaborative filtering or question answering. We
present experimental results which suggest that the performance of the current
state-of-the-art learning to rank algorithm LambdaMART, when used for document
retrieval for search engines, can be improved if standard regression trees are
replaced by oblivious trees. This paper provides a comparison of both variants
and our results demonstrate that the use of oblivious trees can improve the
performance by more than $2.2\%$. Additional experimental analysis of the
influence of a number of features and of a size of the training set is also
provided and confirms the desirability of properties of oblivious decision
trees.

 <dc:title>Preorder-Based Triangle: A Modified Version of Bilattice-Based Triangle

 <dc:description>  Bilattice-based triangle provides an elegant algebraic structure for
reasoning with vague and uncertain information. But the truth and knowledge
ordering of intervals in bilattice-based triangle can not handle repetitive
belief revisions which is an essential characteristic of nonmonotonic
reasoning. Moreover the ordering induced over the intervals by the
bilattice-based triangle is not sometimes intuitive. In this work, we construct
an alternative algebraic structure, namely preorder-based triangle and we
formulate proper logical connectives for this. It is also demonstrated that
Preorder-based triangle serves to be a better alternative to the
bilattice-based triangle for reasoning in application areas, that involve
nonmonotonic fuzzy reasoning with uncertain information.

 <dc:description>  The amount of surgical data, recorded during video-monitored surgeries, has
extremely increased. This paper aims at improving existing solutions for the
automated analysis of cataract surgeries in real time. Through the analysis of
a video recording the operating table, it is possible to know which instruments
exit or enter the operating table, and therefore which ones are likely being
used by the surgeon. Combining these observations with observations from the
microscope video should enhance the overall performance of the systems. To this
end, the proposed solution is divided into two main parts: one to detect the
instruments at the beginning of the surgery and one to update the list of
instruments every time a change is detected in the scene. In the first part,
the goal is to separate the instruments from the background and from irrelevant
objects. For the second, we are interested in detecting the instruments that
appear and disappear whenever the surgeon interacts with the table. Experiments
on a dataset of 36 cataract surgeries validate the good performance of the
proposed solution.

 <dc:description>  Unification in Description Logics has been introduced as a means to detect
redundancies in ontologies. We try to extend the known decidability results for
unification in the Description Logic $\mathcal{EL}$ to disunification since
negative constraints can be used to avoid unwanted unifiers. While decidability
of the solvability of general $\mathcal{EL}$-disunification problems remains an
open problem, we obtain NP-completeness results for two interesting special
cases: dismatching problems, where one side of each negative constraint must be
ground, and local solvability of disunification problems, where we consider
only solutions that are constructed from terms occurring in the input problem.
More precisely, we first show that dismatching can be reduced to local
disunification, and then provide two complementary NP-algorithms for finding
local solutions of disunification problems.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the Arabic Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB-2) Challenge for
SLT-2016. Unlike last year's English MGB Challenge, which focused on
recognition of diverse TV genres, this year, the challenge has an emphasis on
handling the diversity in dialect in Arabic speech. Audio data comes from 19
distinct programmes from the Aljazeera Arabic TV channel between March 2005 and
December 2015. Programmes are split into three groups: conversations,
interviews, and reports. A total of 1,200 hours have been released with lightly
supervised transcriptions for the acoustic modelling. For language modelling,
we made available over 110M words crawled from Aljazeera Arabic website
Aljazeera.net for a 10 year duration 2000-2011. Two lexicons have been
provided, one phoneme based and one grapheme based. Finally, two tasks were
proposed for this year's challenge: standard speech transcription, and word
alignment. This paper describes the task data and evaluation process used in
the MGB challenge, and summarises the results obtained.

 <dc:description>  k-mers (nucleotide strings of length k) form the basis of several algorithms
in computational genomics. In particular, k-mer abundance information in
sequence data is useful in read error correction, parameter estimation for
genome assembly, digital normalization etc. We give a streaming algorithm
Kmerlight for computing the k-mer abundance histogram from sequence data. Our
algorithm is fast and uses very small memory footprint. We provide analytical
bounds on the error guarantees of our algorithm. Kmerlight can efficiently
process genome scale and metagenome scale data using standard desktop machines.
Few applications of abundance histograms computed by Kmerlight are also shown.
We use abundance histogram for de novo estimation of repetitiveness in the
genome based on a simple probabilistic model that we propose. We also show
estimation of k-mer error rate in the sampling using abundance histogram. Our
algorithm can also be used for abundance estimation in a general streaming
setting. The Kmerlight tool is written in C++ and is available for download and
use from https://github.com/nsivad/kmerlight.

 <dc:description>  Time series interpretation aims to provide an explanation of what is observed
in terms of its underlying processes. The present work is based on the
assumption that common classification-based approaches to time series
interpretation suffer from a set of inherent weaknesses whose ultimate cause
lies in the monotonic nature of the deductive reasoning paradigm. In this
document we propose a new approach to this problem based on the initial
hypothesis that abductive reasoning properly accounts for the human ability to
identify and characterize patterns appearing in a time series. The result of
the interpretation is a set of conjectures in the form of observations,
organized into an abstraction hierarchy, and explaining what has been observed.
A knowledge-based framework and a set of algorithms for the interpretation task
are provided, implementing a hypothesize-and-test cycle guided by an
attentional mechanism. As a representative application domain, the
interpretation of the electrocardiogram allows us to highlight the strengths of
the proposed approach in comparison with traditional classification-based
approaches.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces three key features in geometry-based stochastic channel
models in order to include massive MIMO channels. Those key features consists
of multi-user (MU) consistency, non-stationarities across the base station
array and inclusion of spherical wave modelling. To ensure MU consistency, we
introduce the concept of &quot;user aura&quot;, which is a circle around the user with
radius defined according to the stationarity interval. The overlap between
auras determines the share of common clusters among users. To model
non-stationarities across a massive array, sub-arrays are defined for which
clusters are independently generated. At last, we describe a procedure to
incorporate spherical wave modelling, where a cluster focal point is defined to
account for distance between user and cluster.

between human users and data analytics systems. HCI researchers and developers
have to be able to understand both human needs and back-end data analytics.
Participants of our tutorial will learn how visualisation and interface design
can be combined with data analytics to provide better visualisations. In the
first of three parts, the participants will learn about visualisations and how
to appropriately select them. In the second part, restrictions and
opportunities associated with different data analytics systems will be
discussed. In the final part, the participants will have the opportunity to
develop visualisations and interface designs under given scenarios of data and
system settings.

 <dc:description>  We derive the explicit analytical form of the time-dependent coupling
parameter to an external field for perfect absorption of traveling single
photon fields with arbitrary temporal profiles by a tunable single input-output
open quantum system, which can be realized as either a single qubit or single
resonator system. However, the time-dependent coupling parameter for perfect
absorption has a singularity at $t=0$ and constraints on real systems prohibit
a faithful physical realization of the perfect absorber. A numerical example is
included to illustrate the absorber's performance under practical limitations
on the coupling strength.

 <dc:description>  Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes is a class of linear codes introduced
by Massey in 1964. LCD codes have been extensively studied in literature
recently. In addition to their applications in data storage, communications
systems, and consumer electronics, LCD codes have been employed in
cryptography. More specifically, it has been shown that LCD codes can also help
improve the security of the information processed by sensitive devices,
especially against so-called side-channel attacks (SCA) and fault non-invasive
attacks. In this paper, we are interested in the construction of particular
algebraic geometry (AG) LCD codes which could be good candidates to be
resistant against SCA. We firstly provide a construction scheme for obtaining
LCD codes from elliptic curves. Then, some explicit LCD codes from elliptic
curve are presented. MDS codes are of the most importance in coding theory due
to their theoretical significance and practical interests. In this paper, all
the constructed LCD codes from elliptic curves are MDS or almost MDS. Some
infinite classes of LCD codes from elliptic curves are optimal due to the
Griesmer bound. Finally, we introduce a construction mechanism for obtaining
LCD codes from any algebraic curve and derive some explicit LCD codes from
hyperelliptic curves and Hermitian curves.

 <dc:title>Multi-view Dimensionality Reduction for Dialect Identification of Arabic
  Broadcast Speech</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present a new Vector Space Model (VSM) of speech utterances
for the task of spoken dialect identification. Generally, DID systems are built
using two sets of features that are extracted from speech utterances; acoustic
and phonetic. The acoustic and phonetic features are used to form vector
representations of speech utterances in an attempt to encode information about
the spoken dialects. The Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs, thus formed, are used
for the task of DID. The aim of this paper is to construct a single VSM that
encodes information about spoken dialects from both the Phonotactic and
Acoustic VSMs. Given the two views of the data, we make use of a well known
multi-view dimensionality reduction technique known as Canonical Correlation
Analysis (CCA), to form a single vector representation for each speech
utterance that encodes dialect specific discriminative information from both
the phonetic and acoustic representations. We refer to this approach as feature
space combination approach and show that our CCA based feature vector
representation performs better on the Arabic DID task than the phonetic and
acoustic feature representations used alone. We also present the feature space
combination approach as a viable alternative to the model based combination
approach, where two DID systems are built using the two VSMs (Phonotactic and
Acoustic) and the final prediction score is the output score combination from
the two systems.

 <dc:description>  In heterogeneous networks, the random deployment of femto access points
(FAPs) and macro base stations (MBSs) with uncoordinated channel access impose
huge inter-tier interferences. In real-life networks, the process of MBSs
deployment exhibits the homogeneity, however the FAPs have the behavioral
characteristic of clusters formation like in malls, apartments, offices, etc.
Therefore, the composite modeling of the MBSs and the FAPs using Poisson point
process and Poisson cluster process is employed for the evaluation of coverage
probability. The scenario of the real-time traffic for macro-tier and the
best-effort traffic for femto-tier is considered. Cognition is introduced in
the clustered FAPs to control the inter-tier interference. Furthermore, the
impact of macro-tier load is analyzed by exploiting the inherent coupling
between coverage probability and activity factor of an MBS. Further, we study
the effect of co-channel, orthogonal, and partial spectrum sharing modes on the
coverage for given parameters like load condition, FAPs/MBSs density, etc. We
provide simulation validation for the derived expressions of coverage and
present an comparative analysis for the mentioned spectrum sharing modes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a constructive heuristic algorithm for the
$2$-connected $m$-dominating set problem. It is based on a greedy heuristic in
which a 2-connected subgraph is iteratively extended with suitable open ears.
The growth procedure is an adaptation of the breadth-first-search which
efficiently manages to find open ears. Further, a heuristic function is defined
for selecting the best ear out of a list of candidates. The performance of the
basic approach is improved by adding a correction procedure which removes
unnecessary nodes from a generated solution. Finally, randomization is included
and the method is extended towards the GRASP metaheuristic. In our
computational experiments, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm
to recently published results and show that the method is highly competitive
and especially suitable for dense graphs.

 <dc:description>  For real-time traffic, the link quality and call blocking probability (both
derived from coverage probability) are realized to be poor for cell edge users
(CEUs) compared to cell center users (CCUs) as the signal reception in the cell
center region is better compared to the cell edge region. In heterogeneous
networks (HetNets), the uncoordinated channel access by different types of base
stations determine the interference statistics that further arbitrates the
coverage probability. Thus, the spectrum allocation techniques have major
impact on the performance of CCU and CEU. In this paper, the performance of
CCUs and CEUs in a random two-tier network is studied for two spectrum
allocation techniques namely: 1) co-channel (CSA), and 2) shared (SSA). For
performance analysis, the widely accepted conception of modeling the tiers of
HetNet using independent homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) is considered
to accommodate the spatial randomness in location of BSs. To incorporate the
spatial randomness in the arrival of service and to aid the load-aware
analysis, the cellular traffic is modeled using spatio-temporal PPP. Under this
scenario, we have developed an analytical framework to evaluate the load-aware
performance, including coverage and blocking probabilities, of CCUs and CEUs
under both spectrum allocation techniques. Further, we provide insight into
achievable area energy efficiency for SSA and CSA. The developed analytical
framework is validated through extensive simulations. Next, we demonstrate the
impact of traffic load and femto access points density on the performance of
CCUs/CEUs under CSA and SSA.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article, we take one step toward understanding the learning behavior
of deep residual networks, and supporting the observation that deep residual
networks behave like ensembles. We propose a new convolutional neural network
architecture which builds upon the success of residual networks by explicitly
exploiting the interpretation of very deep networks as an ensemble. The
proposed multi-residual network increases the number of residual functions in
the residual blocks. Our architecture generates models that are wider, rather
than deeper, which significantly improves accuracy. We show that our model
achieves an error rate of 3.73% and 19.45% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
respectively, that outperforms almost all of the existing models. We also
demonstrate that our model outperforms very deep residual networks by 0.22%
(top-1 error) on the full ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. Additionally,
inspired by the parallel structure of multi-residual networks, a model
parallelism technique has been investigated. The model parallelism method
distributes the computation of residual blocks among the processors, yielding
up to 15% computational complexity improvement.

 <dc:description>  Arbitrary Arrow Update Logic is a dynamic modal logic that uses an arbitrary
arrow update modality to quantify over all arrow updates. Some properties of
this logic have already been established, but until now it remained an open
question whether the logic's satisfiability problem is decidable. Here, we show
that the satisfiability problem of Arbitrary Arrow Update Logic is co-RE hard,
and therefore undecidable, by a reduction of the tiling problem.

 <dc:description>  Actor coordination armoured with a suitable protocol description language has
been a pressing problem in the actors community. We study the applicability of
multiparty session type (MPST) protocols for verification of actor programs. We
incorporate sessions to actors by introducing minimum additions to the model
such as the notion of actor roles and protocol mailboxes. The framework uses
Scribble, which is a protocol description language based on multiparty session
types. Our programming model supports actor-like syntax and runtime
verification mechanism guaranteeing communication safety of the participating
entities. An actor can implement multiple roles in a similar way as an object
can implement multiple interfaces. Multiple roles allow for cooperative
inter-concurrency in a single actor. We demonstrate our framework by designing
and implementing a session actor library in Python and its runtime verification
mechanism. Benchmark results demonstrate that the runtime checks induce
negligible overhead. We evaluate the applicability of our verification
framework to specify actor interactions by implementing twelve examples from an
actor benchmark suit.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a switch-based hybrid massive MIMO structure that aims to reduce
the hardware complexity and power consumption has been proposed as a potential
candidate for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Exploiting the sparse
nature of the mmWave channel, compressive sensing (CS)-based channel estimators
have been proposed. When applied to real mmWave channels, the CS-based channel
estimators may encounter heavy computational burden due to the high
dimensionality of the basis. Meanwhile, knowledge about the response of the
antenna array, which is needed for constructing the basis of the CS estimators,
may not be perfect due to array uncertainties such as phase mismatch among
array elements. This can result in the loss of sparse representation and hence
the degraded performance of the CS estimator. In this paper, we propose a novel
matrix completion (MC)-based low-complexity channel estimator. The proposed
scheme is compatible with switch-based hybrid structures, does not need to
specify a basis, and can avoid the basis mismatch issue. Compared with the
existing CS-based estimator, the proposed basis-free scheme is immune to array
response mismatch and exhibits a significantly lower complexity.

targets, the removing of task-specified network redundancy can promote a wide
range of potential applications. We propose a task-specified knowledge

cost and minimized accuracy loss, which suits the resource constraint front-end
systems well. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed approach as well as the existence of task-specified

 <dc:description>  The output of oscillators is usually not stable over time. In particular,
phase variations---or \emph{phase noise}---corrupts the oscillations. In this
letter, we describe a circuit that designed to average the phase noise
processes and frequency offsets in frequency-matched oscillators. The basic
circuit uses the independence of 2 phase noise processes to provide a cleaner
oscillating output with lower phase noise variance. We describe extensions of
the circuit designed to average out more than 2 oscillators, as well as a
single one through delay elements. In all the examples covered, we provide a
theoretical analysis of the resulting phase noise process when the input phase
noise processes follow a Wiener model.

 <dc:description>  The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is globally used by Autonomous Systems
(ASes) to establish route paths for IP prefixes in the Internet. Due to the
lack of authentication in BGP, an AS can hijack IP prefixes owned by other ASes
(i.e., announce illegitimate route paths), impacting thus the Internet routing
system and economy. To this end, a number of hijacking detection systems have
been proposed. However, existing systems are usually third party services that
-inherently- introduce a significant delay between the hijacking detection (by
the service) and its mitigation (by the network administrators). To overcome
this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose ARTEMIS, a tool that enables an AS
to timely detect hijacks on its own prefixes, and automatically proceed to
mitigation actions. To evaluate the performance of ARTEMIS, we conduct real
hijacking experiments. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that a
hijacking detection/mitigation system is evaluated through extensive
experiments in the real Internet. Our results (a) show that ARTEMIS can detect
(mitigate) a hijack within a few seconds (minutes) after it has been launched,
and (b) demonstrate the efficiency of the different control-plane sources used
by ARTEMIS, towards monitoring routing changes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an approach that is able to handle with Z-numbers
in the context of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems. Z-numbers are
composed of two parts, the first one is a restriction on the values that can be
assumed, and the second part is the reliability of the information. As human
beings we communicate with other people by means of natural language using
sentences like: the journey time from home to university takes about half hour,
very likely. Firstly, Z-numbers are converted to fuzzy numbers using a standard
procedure. Next, the Z-TODIM and Z-TOPSIS are presented as a direct extension
of the fuzzy TODIM and fuzzy TOPSIS, respectively. The proposed methods are
applied to two case studies and compared with the standard approach using crisp
values. Results obtained show the feasibility of the approach. In addition, a
graphical interface was built to handle with both methods Z- TODIM and Z-TOPSIS
allowing ease of use for user in other areas of knowledge.

 <dc:title>Reducing energy consumption of network infrastructure using spectral

 <dc:description>  The energy consumption by ICT (Information and Communication Technology)
equipment is rapidly increasing which causes a significant economic and
environmental problem. At present, the network infrastructure is becoming a
large portion of the energy footprint in ICT. Thus, the concept of energy
efficient or green networking has been introduced. Now one of the main concerns
of network industry is to minimize energy consumption of network infrastructure
because of the potential economic benefits, ethical responsibility, and its
environmental impact. In this paper, the energy management strategies to reduce
the energy consumed by network switches in LAN (Local Area Network) have been
developed. According to the life-cycle assessment of network switches, the
highest amount of energy is consumed during usage phase. The study considers
bandwidth, link load and traffic matrices as input parameters which have the
highest contribution to energy footprints of network switches during usage
phase and energy consumption as output. Then with the objective of reducing
energy usage of network infrastructure, the feasibility of putting Ethernet
switches hibernate or sleep mode was investigated. After that, the network
topology was reorganized using clustering method based on the spectral approach
for putting network switches to hibernate or switched off mode considering the
time and communications among them. Experimental results show the interest in
this approach in terms of energy consumption. .

 <dc:description>  The relationship between the complexity classes P and NP is an unsolved
question in the field of theoretical computer science. In this paper, we
investigate a descriptor approach based on lattice properties. This paper
proposes a new way to decide the satisfiability of any 3-CNF-SAT problem. The
analysis of this exact [non heuristical] algorithm shows a strictly bounded
exponential complexity. The complexity of any 3-CNF-SAT solution is bounded by
O(2^490). This over-estimated bound is reached by an algorithm working on the
smallest description (via descriptor functions) of the evolving set of
solutions in function of the already considered clauses, without exploring
these solutions. Any remark about this paper is warmly welcome.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, a number of major improvements were introduced in the area
of computer networks, energy-efficient network protocols and network management
systems. Software Defined Networking (SDN) as a new paradigm for managing
complex networks brings a significant opportunity to reduce the energy
consumption among ICT. In this paper, we are tackling improvements in the
process of monitoring the states of the networking devices and optimizing the
existing solutions. We are monitoring the energy consumption of a network
architecture and augment the retrieved raw power data to detect changes in the
state of the devices. The goal is to benchmark the difference between the power
data fetched from the real-measures and the data extracted from the power
models, translated as the expected behavior of the devices. An application is
designed to monitor and analyze the retrieved power data of a simulated ICT
infrastructure composed of Cisco switches and routers, Dell Precision stations
and Raritan PDUs. Moreover, smart algorithms are developed which outcome
results with detection of changes in the state of the devices, as well as with
detection and isolation of possible anomalies and their impact on the energy
consumption. The application is envisioned to be an extension to the existing
SDN controllers for monitoring and reporting the changes in the state of the
ICT devices.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider distributed optimization problems in which the cost
function is separable (i.e., a sum of possibly non-smooth functions all sharing
a common variable) and can be split into a strongly convex term and a convex
one. The second term is typically used to encode constraints or to regularize
the solution. We propose an asynchronous, distributed optimization algorithm
over an undirected topology, based on a proximal gradient update on the dual
problem. We show that by means of a proper choice of primal variables, the dual
problem is separable and the dual variables can be stacked into separate
blocks. This allows us to show that a distributed gossip update can be obtained
by means of a randomized block-coordinate proximal gradient on the dual
function.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a method to approximate pairwise distance on a graph, having an
amortized sub-linear complexity in its size. The proposed method follows the so
called heat method due to Crane et al. The only additional input are the values
of the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian at a subset of the vertices. Using
these values we estimate a random walk from the source points, and normalize
the result into a unit gradient function. The eigenfunctions are then used to
synthesize distance values abiding by these constraints at desired locations.
We show that this method works in practice on different types of inputs ranging
from triangular meshes to general graphs. We also demonstrate that the
resulting approximate distance is accurate enough to be used as the input to a
recent method for intrinsic shape correspondence computation.

 <dc:description>  Due to the chronic nature of diabetes, patient self-care factors play an
important role in any treatment plan. In order to understand the behaviour of
patients in response to medical advice on self-care, clinicians often conduct
cross-sectional surveys. When analysing the survey data, statistical machine
learning methods can potentially provide additional insight into the data
either through deeper understanding of the patterns present or making
information available to clinicians in an intuitive manner. In this study, we
use self-organising maps (SOMs) to visualise the responses of patients who
share similar responses to survey questions, with the goal of helping
clinicians understand how patients are managing their treatment and where
action should be taken. The principle behavioural patterns revealed through
this are that: patients who take the correct dose of insulin also tend to take
their injections at the correct time, patients who eat on time also tend to
correctly manage their food portions and patients who check their blood glucose
with a monitor also tend to adjust their insulin dosage and carry snacks to
counter low blood glucose. The identification of these positive behavioural
patterns can also help to inform treatment by exploiting their negative
corollaries.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a comparison between rectilinear and radio-concentric
networks. Indeed, those networks are often observed in urban areas, in several
cities all over the world. One of the interesting properties of such networks
is described by the \textit{straightness} measure from graph theory, which
assesses how much moving from one node to another along the network links
departs from the network-independent straightforward path. We study this
property in both rectilinear and radio-concentric networks, first by analyzing
mathematically routes from the center to peripheral locations in a theoretical
framework with perfect topology, then using simulations for multiple
origin-destination paths. We show that in most of the cases, radio-concentric
networks have a better straightness than rectilinear ones. How may this
property be used in the future for urban networks?

 <dc:description>  Poisson denoising is an essential issue for various imaging applications,
such as night vision, medical imaging and microscopy. State-of-the-art
approaches are clearly dominated by patch-based non-local methods in recent
years. In this paper, we aim to propose a local Poisson denoising model with
both structure simplicity and good performance. To this end, we consider a
variational modeling to integrate the so-called Fields of Experts (FoE) image
prior, that has proven an effective higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRF)
model for many classic image restoration problems. We exploit several feasible
variational variants for this task. We start with a direct modeling in the
original image domain by taking into account the Poisson noise statistics,
which performs generally well for the cases of high SNR. However, this strategy
encounters problem in cases of low SNR. Then we turn to an alternative modeling
strategy by using the Anscombe transform and Gaussian statistics derived data
term. We retrain the FoE prior model directly in the transform domain. With the
newly trained FoE model, we end up with a local variational model providing
strongly competitive results against state-of-the-art non-local approaches,
meanwhile bearing the property of simple structure. Furthermore, our proposed
model comes along with an additional advantage, that the inference is very
efficient as it is well-suited for parallel computation on GPUs. For images of
size $512 \times 512$, our GPU implementation takes less than 1 second to
produce state-of-the-art Poisson denoising performance.

 <dc:description>  Many large, real-world complex networks have rich community structure that a
network scientist seeks to understand. These communities may overlap or have
intricate internal structure. Extracting communities with particular
topological structure, even when they overlap with other communities, is a
powerful capability that would provide novel avenues of focusing in on
structure of interest. In this work we consider extracting highly-cyclic
regions of directed graphs (digraphs). We demonstrate that embeddings derived
from complex-valued eigenvectors associated with stochastic propagator
eigenvalues near roots of unity are well-suited for this purpose. We prove
several fundamental theoretic results demonstrating the connection between
these eigenpairs and the presence of highly-cyclic structure and we demonstrate
the use of these vectors on a few real-world examples.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by timeouts in Internet services, we consider networks of infinite
server queues in which routing decisions are based on deadlines. Specifically,
at each node in the network, the total service time equals the minimum of
several independent service times (e.g. the minimum of the amount of time
required to complete a transaction and a deadline). Furthermore, routing
decisions depend on which of the independent service times achieves the minimum
(e.g. exceeding a deadline will require the customer to be routed so they can
re-attempt the transaction). Because current routing decisions are dependent on
past service times, much of the existing theory on product-form queueing
networks does not apply. In spite of this, we are able to show that such
networks have product-form equilibrium distributions. We verify our analytic
characterization with a simulation of a simple network. We also discuss
extensions of this work to more general settings.

 <dc:description>  Online learners spend millions of hours per year testing their new skills on
assignments with known answers. This paper explores whether framing research
questions as assignments with unknown answers helps learners generate novel,
useful, and difficult-to-find knowledge while increasing their motivation by
contributing to a larger goal. Collaborating with the American Gut Project, the
world's largest crowdfunded citizen science project, we deploy Gut Instinct to
allow novices to generate hypotheses about the constitution of the human gut
microbiome. The tool enables online learners to explore learning material about
the microbiome and create their own theories around causal variances for
microbiome. Building on crowdsourcing or serious games that use people as
replaceable units, this work-in-progress lays our plans for how people (a) use
their personal knowledge (b) towards solving a larger real-world goal (c) that
can provide potential benefits to them. We hope to demonstrate that Gut
Instinct citizen scientists generate useful hypotheses, perform better on
learning tasks than traditional MOOC learners, and are better engaged with the
learning material.

 <dc:description>  Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds have become more popular enabling
users to run applications under virtual machines. Energy efficiency for IaaS
clouds is still challenge. This paper investigates the energy-efficient
scheduling problems of virtual machines (VMs) onto physical machines (PMs) in
IaaS clouds along characteristics: multiple resources, fixed intervals and
non-preemption of virtual machines. The scheduling problems are NP-hard. Most
of existing works on VM placement reduce the total energy consumption by using
the minimum number of active physical machines. There, however, are cases using
the minimum number of physical machines results in longer the total busy time
of the physical machines. For the scheduling problems, minimizing the total
energy consumption of all physical machines is equivalent to minimizing total
busy time of all physical machines. In this paper, we propose an scheduling
algorithm, denoted as EMinTRE-LFT, for minimizing the total energy consumption
of physical machines in the scheduling problems. Our extensive simulations
using parallel workload models in Parallel Workload Archive show that the
proposed algorithm has the least total energy consumption compared to the
state-of-the art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a restriction to non-negative matrix factorization in
which at least one matrix factor is stochastic. That is, the elements of the
matrix factors are non-negative and the columns of one matrix factor sum to 1.
This restriction includes topic models, a popular method for analyzing
unstructured data. It also includes a method for storing and finding pictures.
The paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the observed data
such that the factorization is unique. In addition, the paper characterizes
natural bounds on the parameters for any observed data and presents a
consistent least squares estimator. The results are illustrated using a topic
model analysis of PhD abstracts in economics and the problem of storing and
retrieving a set of pictures of faces.

 <dc:description>  Biosurveillance, a relatively young field, has recently increased in
importance because of its relevance to national security and global health.
Databases and tools describing particular subsets of disease are becoming
increasingly common in the field. However, a common method to describe those
diseases is lacking. Here, we present the Anthology of Biosurveillance Diseases
(ABD), an ontology of infectious diseases of biosurveillance relevance.

 <dc:description>  Militaries around the world have long been cognizant of the potential
benefits associated with autonomous systems both in the conduct of warfare and
in its prevention. This has lead to the declaration by some that this
technology will lead to a fundamental change in the ways in which war is
conducted, i.e., a revolution in military affairs (RMA) not unlike gunpowder,
the long bow, the rifled bullet, the aircraft carrier, etc. Indeed the United
States has created roadmaps for robotics with ever-increasing autonomous
capability that span almost 40 years. These systems span air, sea, sea surface,
littoral, ground and subterranean environments. There are serious societal and
ethical concerns associated with the deployment of this technology that remain
unaddressed. How can sufficient protection be afforded noncombatants? What
about civilian blowback, where this technology may end up being used in
policing operations against domestic groups? How can we protect the fundamental
human rights of all involved? Considerable discussion is being conducted at an
international level, including at the United Nations Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons (CCW) over the past two years, debating if and how such
systems, particularly lethal platforms should be banned or regulated.

 <dc:description>  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with LiDAR, electro-optical and
infrared cameras, SAR and atmospheric sensors have transformed the way we
acquire high spatio-temporal resolution data. For example, UAVs equipped with
these sensors have been able to obtain topography at resolutions of less than
one meter, revolutionizing earth sciences. Surface processes act at spatial
scales on the order of a meter to produce intricate landforms and UAVs equipped
with these sensors are able to measure the three dimensional spatio-temporal
geometry of the earths surface and overlying anthropogenic features and
vegetation at resolutions appropriate to document these processes. In addition,
surface changes due to erosion, transport and sedimentation, as well as
earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes can be quantified with this data.

 <dc:description>  Since sequential information plays an important role in modeling user
behaviors, various sequential recommendation methods have been proposed.
Methods based on Markov assumption are widely-used, but independently combine
several most recent components. Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based
methods have been successfully applied in several sequential modeling tasks.
However, for real-world applications, these methods have difficulty in modeling
the contextual information, which has been proved to be very important for
behavior modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Context-Aware
Recurrent Neural Networks (CA-RNN). Instead of using the constant input matrix
and transition matrix in conventional RNN models, CA-RNN employs adaptive
context-specific input matrices and adaptive context-specific transition
matrices. The adaptive context-specific input matrices capture external
situations where user behaviors happen, such as time, location, weather and so
on. And the adaptive context-specific transition matrices capture how lengths
of time intervals between adjacent behaviors in historical sequences affect the
transition of global sequential features. Experimental results show that the
proposed CA-RNN model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art
sequential recommendation methods and context-aware recommendation methods on
two public datasets, i.e., the Taobao dataset and the Movielens-1M dataset.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a natural variant of the parallel chip-firing game, called the
diffusion game. Chips are initially assigned to vertices of a graph. At every
step, all vertices simultaneously send one chip to each neighbour with fewer
chips. As the dynamics of the parallel chip-firing game occur on a finite set
the process is inherently periodic. However the diffusion game is not obviously
periodic: even if $2|E(G)|$ chips are assigned to vertices of graph G, there
may exist time steps where some vertices have a negative number of chips. We
investigate the process, prove periodicity for a number of graph classes, and
pose some questions for future research.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the nature of dark energy, the mysterious force driving the
accelerated expansion of the Universe, is a major challenge of modern
cosmology. The next generation of cosmological surveys, specifically designed
to address this issue, rely on accurate measurements of the apparent shapes of
distant galaxies. However, shape measurement methods suffer from various
unavoidable biases and therefore will rely on a precise calibration to meet the
accuracy requirements of the science analysis. This calibration process remains
an open challenge as it requires large sets of high quality galaxy images. To
this end, we study the application of deep conditional generative models in
generating realistic galaxy images. In particular we consider variations on
conditional variational autoencoder and introduce a new adversarial objective
for training of conditional generative networks. Our results suggest a reliable
alternative to the acquisition of expensive high quality observations for
generating the calibration data needed by the next generation of cosmological
surveys.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the task of camera localization in a known 3D scene given
a single input RGB image. State-of-the-art approaches accomplish this in two
steps: firstly, regressing for every pixel in the image its 3D scene coordinate
and subsequently, using these coordinates to estimate the final 6D camera pose
via RANSAC. To solve the first step, Random Forests (RFs) are typically used.
On the other hand, Neural Networks (NNs) reign in many dense regression tasks,
but are not test-time efficient. We ask the question: which of the two is best
for camera localization? To address this, we make two method contributions: (1)
a test-time efficient NN architecture which we term a ForestNet that is derived
and initialized from a RF, and (2) a new fully-differentiable robust averaging
technique for regression ensembles which can be trained end-to-end with a NN.
Our experimental findings show that for scene coordinate regression,
traditional NN architectures are superior to test-time efficient RFs and
ForestNets, however, this does not translate to final 6D camera pose accuracy
where RFs and ForestNets perform slightly better. To summarize, our best
method, a ForestNet with a robust average, which has an equivalent fast and
lightweight RF, improves over the state-of-the-art for camera localization on
the 7-Scenes dataset. While this work focuses on scene coordinate regression
for camera localization, our innovations may also be applied to other
continuous regression tasks.

 <dc:title>A Distributed Observer for a Time-Invariant Linear System</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, L.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A time-invariant, linear, distributed observer is described for estimating
the state of an $m&gt;0$ channel, $n$-dimensional continuous-time linear system of
the form $ \dot{x} = Ax,\ y_i = C_i x,\ i \in \{1,2,\cdots, m\}$. The state $x$
is simultaneously estimated by $m$ agents assuming each agent $i$ senses $y_i$
and receives the state $z_j$ of each of its neighbors' estimators. Neighbor
relations are characterized by a constant directed graph $\mathbb{N}$ whose
vertices correspond to agents and whose arcs depict neighbor relations. The
overall distributed observer consists of $m$ linear estimators, one for each
agent; $m-1$ of the estimators are of dimension $n$ and one estimator is of
dimension $n+m-1$. Using results from classical decentralized control theory,
it is shown that subject to the assumptions that (i) none of the $C_i$ are
zero, (ii) the neighbor graph $\mathbb{N}$ is strongly connected, (iii) the
system whose state is to be estimated is jointly observable, and nothing more,
it is possible to freely assign the spectrum of the overall distributed
observer.

 <dc:description>  Recent discussion in the public sphere about algorithmic classification has
involved tension between competing notions of what it means for a probabilistic
classification to be fair to different groups. We formalize three fairness
conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and we prove that except in
highly constrained special cases, there is no method that can satisfy these
three conditions simultaneously. Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions
approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of
the constrained special cases identified by our theorem. These results suggest
some of the ways in which key notions of fairness are incompatible with each
other, and hence provide a framework for thinking about the trade-offs between
them.

 <dc:description>  In this note we consider the problem of introducing variables in temporal
logic programs under the formalism of &quot;Temporal Equilibrium Logic&quot; (TEL), an
extension of Answer Set Programming (ASP) for dealing with linear-time modal
operators. To this aim, we provide a definition of a first-order version of TEL
that shares the syntax of first-order Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) but has
a different semantics, selecting some LTL models we call &quot;temporal stable
models&quot;. Then, we consider a subclass of theories (called &quot;splittable temporal
logic programs&quot;) that are close to usual logic programs but allowing a
restricted use of temporal operators. In this setting, we provide a syntactic
definition of &quot;safe variables&quot; that suffices to show the property of &quot;domain
independence&quot; -- that is, addition of arbitrary elements in the universe does
not vary the set of temporal stable models. Finally, we present a method for
computing the derivable facts by constructing a non-temporal logic program with
variables that is fed to a standard ASP grounder. The information provided by
the grounder is then used to generate a subset of ground temporal rules which
is equivalent to (and generally smaller than) the full program instantiation.

 <dc:description>  In Star Wars Episode V, we see Luke Skywalker being repaired by a surgical
robot. In the context of the movie, this doesn't seem surprising or disturbing.
After all, it is a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. It would
never happen here. Or could it? Would we accept a robot as our doctor, our
surgeon, or our in-home care specialist? Imagine walking into an operating room
and no one was there. You are instructed to lie down on the operating table,
and the OR system takes over. Would you feel comfortable with this possible
future world?

 <dc:description>  An Autonomous Physical System (APS) will be expected to reliably and
independently evaluate, execute, and achieve goals while respecting surrounding
rules, laws, or conventions. In doing so, an APS must rely on a broad spectrum
of dynamic, complex, and often imprecise information about its surroundings,
the task it is to perform, and its own sensors and actuators. For example,
cleaning in a home or commercial setting requires the ability to perceive,
grasp, and manipulate many physical objects, the ability to reliably perform a
variety of subtasks such as washing, folding, and stacking, and knowledge about
local conventions such as how objects are classified and where they should be
stored. The information required for reliable autonomous operation may come
from external sources and from the robot's own sensor observations or in the
form of direct instruction by a trainer. Similar considerations apply across
many domains - construction, manufacturing, in-home assistance, and healthcare.
For example, surgeons spend many years learning about physiology and anatomy
before they touch a patient. They then perform roughly 1000 surgeries under the
tutelage of an expert surgeon, and they practice basic maneuvers such as suture
tying thousands of times outside the operating room. All of these elements come
together to achieve expertise at this task. Endowing a system with robust
autonomy by traditional programming methods has thus far had limited success.
Several promising new paths to acquiring and processing such data are emerging.
This white paper outlines three promising research directions for enabling an
APS to learn the physical and information skills necessary to perform tasks
with independence and flexibility: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Human-Robot
Interaction, and Cloud Robotics.

 <dc:title>Generalized Fano and non-Fano networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is known that the Fano network has a vector linear solution if and only if
the characteristic of the finite field is $2$; and the non-Fano network has a
vector linear solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field is
not $2$. Using these properties of Fano and non-Fano networks it has been shown
that linear network coding is insufficient. In this paper we generalize the
properties of Fano and non-Fano networks. Specifically, by adding more nodes
and edges to the Fano network, we construct a network which has a vector linear
solution for any vector dimension if and only if the characteristic of the
finite field belongs to an arbitrary given set of primes
$\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_l\}$. Similarly, by adding more nodes and edges to the
non-Fano network, we construct a network which has a vector linear solution for
any vector dimension if and only if the characteristic of the finite field does
not belong to an arbitrary given set of primes $\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_l\}$.

 <dc:description>  A recent study by the Robotic Industries Association has highlighted how
service robots are increasingly broadening our horizons beyond the factory
floor. From robotic vacuums, bomb retrievers, exoskeletons and drones, to
robots used in surgery, space exploration, agriculture, home assistance and
construction, service robots are building a formidable resume. In just the last
few years we have seen service robots deliver room service meals, assist
shoppers in finding items in a large home improvement store, checking in
customers and storing their luggage at hotels, and pour drinks on cruise ships.
Personal robots are here to educate, assist and entertain at home. These
domestic robots can perform daily chores, assist people with disabilities and
serve as companions or pets for entertainment. By all accounts, the growth
potential for service robotics is quite large.

 <dc:title>The Projected Power Method: An Efficient Algorithm for Joint Alignment

 <dc:description>  Various applications involve assigning discrete label values to a collection
of objects based on some pairwise noisy data. Due to the discrete---and hence
nonconvex---structure of the problem, computing the optimal assignment
(e.g.~maximum likelihood assignment) becomes intractable at first sight. This
paper makes progress towards efficient computation by focusing on a concrete
joint alignment problem---that is, the problem of recovering $n$ discrete
variables $x_i \in \{1,\cdots, m\}$, $1\leq i\leq n$ given noisy observations
of their modulo differences $\{x_i - x_j~\mathsf{mod}~m\}$. We propose a
low-complexity and model-free procedure, which operates in a lifted space by
representing distinct label values in orthogonal directions, and which attempts
to optimize quadratic functions over hypercubes. Starting with a first guess
computed via a spectral method, the algorithm successively refines the iterates
via projected power iterations. We prove that for a broad class of statistical
models, the proposed projected power method makes no error---and hence
converges to the maximum likelihood estimate---in a suitable regime. Numerical
experiments have been carried out on both synthetic and real data to
demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm. We expect this algorithmic
framework to be effective for a broad range of discrete assignment problems.

 <dc:description>  Transportation systems are currently being transformed by advances in
information and communication technologies. The development of autonomous
transportation holds the promise of providing revolutionary improvements in
speed, efficiency, safety and reliability along with concomitant benefits for
society and economy. It is anticipated these changes will soon affect household
activity patterns, public safety, supply chains and logistics, manufacturing,
and quality of life in general.

 <dc:description>  We review some of the most widely used patterns for the programming of
microservices: circuit breaker, service discovery, and API gateway. By
systematically analysing different deployment strategies for these patterns, we
reach new insight especially for the application of circuit breakers. We also
evaluate the applicability of Jolie, a language for the programming of
microservices, for these patterns and report on other standard frameworks
offering similar solutions. Finally, considerations for future developments are
presented.

 <dc:description>  The combination of edge caching and coded multicasting is a promising
approach to improve the efficiency of content delivery over cache-aided
networks. The global caching gain resulting from content overlap distributed
across the network in current solutions is limited due to the increasingly
personalized nature of the content consumed by users. In this paper, the
cache-aided coded multicast problem is generalized to account for the
correlation among the network content by formulating a source compression
problem with distributed side information. A correlation-aware achievable
scheme is proposed and an upper bound on its performance is derived. It is
shown that considerable load reductions can be achieved, compared to state of
the art correlation-unaware schemes, when caching and delivery phases
specifically account for the correlation among the content files.
