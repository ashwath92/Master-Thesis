 <dc:description>  We present a method to perform online Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) of known
object categories in monocular video data. Current Tracking-by-Detection MOT
approaches build on top of 2D bounding box detections. In contrast, we exploit
state-of-the-art instance aware semantic segmentation techniques to compute 2D
shape representations of target objects in each frame. We predict position and
shape of segmented instances in subsequent frames by exploiting optical flow
cues. We define an affinity matrix between instances of subsequent frames which
reflects locality and visual similarity. The instance association is solved by
applying the Hungarian method. We evaluate different configurations of our
algorithm using the MOT 2D 2015 train dataset. The evaluation shows that our
tracking approach is able to track objects with high relative motions. In
addition, we provide results of our approach on the MOT 2D 2015 test set for
comparison with previous works. We achieve a MOTA score of 32.1.

 <dc:title>Bridging Saliency Detection to Weakly Supervised Object Detection Based

 <dc:description>  Weakly-supervised object detection (WOD) is a challenging problems in
computer vision. The key problem is to simultaneously infer the exact object
locations in the training images and train the object detectors, given only the
training images with weak image-level labels. Intuitively, by simulating the
selective attention mechanism of human visual system, saliency detection
technique can select attractive objects in scenes and thus is a potential way
to provide useful priors for WOD. However, the way to adopt saliency detection
in WOD is not trivial since the detected saliency region might be possibly
highly ambiguous in complex cases. To this end, this paper first
comprehensively analyzes the challenges in applying saliency detection to WOD.
Then, we make one of the earliest efforts to bridge saliency detection to WOD
via the self-paced curriculum learning, which can guide the learning procedure
to gradually achieve faithful knowledge of multi-class objects from easy to
hard. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can
successfully bridge saliency detection and WOD tasks and achieve the
state-of-the-art object detection results under the weak supervision.

 <dc:description>  Parity games play an important role in model checking and synthesis. In their
paper, Calude et al. have shown that these games can be solved in
quasi-polynomial time. We show that their algorithm can be implemented
efficiently: we use their data structure as a progress measure, allowing for a
backward implementation instead of a complete unravelling of the game. To
achieve this, a number of changes have to be made to their techniques, where
the main one is to add power to the antagonistic player that allows for
determining her rational move without changing the outcome of the game. We
provide a first implementation for a quasi-polynomial algorithm, test it on
small examples, and provide a number of side results, including minor
algorithmic improvements, a quasi bi-linear complexity in the number of states
and edges for a fixed number of colours, and matching lower bounds for the
algorithm of Calude et al.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a personal account of the early legacy of discovery
informatics, especially surrounding the first published definition of
domain-independent DI. The state of DI is traced across various reference
sources and the literature on the fourth paradigm of the scientific method.
Observations are offered on DI, concluding that it will retain its appeal as a
highly apt descriptor for research and practice activities that are inherent in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bellemare et al. (2016) introduced the notion of a pseudo-count, derived from
a density model, to generalize count-based exploration to non-tabular
reinforcement learning. This pseudo-count was used to generate an exploration
bonus for a DQN agent and combined with a mixed Monte Carlo update was
sufficient to achieve state of the art on the Atari 2600 game Montezuma's
Revenge. We consider two questions left open by their work: First, how
important is the quality of the density model for exploration? Second, what
role does the Monte Carlo update play in exploration? We answer the first
question by demonstrating the use of PixelCNN, an advanced neural density model
for images, to supply a pseudo-count. In particular, we examine the intrinsic
difficulties in adapting Bellemare et al.'s approach when assumptions about the
model are violated. The result is a more practical and general algorithm
requiring no special apparatus. We combine PixelCNN pseudo-counts with
different agent architectures to dramatically improve the state of the art on
several hard Atari games. One surprising finding is that the mixed Monte Carlo
update is a powerful facilitator of exploration in the sparsest of settings,
including Montezuma's Revenge.

 <dc:description>  Recently-proposed virtualization platforms give cloud users the freedom to
specify their network topologies and addressing schemes. These platforms have,
however, been targeting a single datacenter of a cloud provider, which is
insufficient to support (critical) applications that need to be deployed across
multiple trust domains while enforcing diverse security requirements. This
paper addresses this problem by presenting a novel solution for a central
component of network virtualization -- the online network embedding, which
finds efficient mappings of virtual networks requests onto the substrate
network. Our solution considers security as a first class citizen, enabling the
definition of flexible policies in three central areas: on the communications,
where alternative security compromises can be explored (e.g., encryption); on
the computations, supporting redundancy if necessary while capitalizing on
hardware assisted trusted executions; across multiples clouds, including public
and private facilities, with the associated trust levels. We formulate the
solution as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), and evaluate our proposal
against the most commonly used alternative. Our analysis gives insight into the
trade-offs involved with the inclusion of security and trust into network
virtualization, providing evidence that this notion may enhance profits under
the appropriate cost models.

 <dc:description>  As digital collections of scientific literature are widespread and used
frequently in knowledge-intense working environments, it has become a challenge
to identify author names correctly. The treatment of homonyms is crucial for
the reliable resolution of author names. Apart from varying handling of first,
middle and last names, vendors as well as the digital library community created
tools to address the problem of author name disambiguation. This technical
report focuses on two widespread collections of scientific literature, Web of
Science (WoS) and Scopus, and the coverage with author identification
information such as Researcher ID, ORCID and Scopus Author Identifier in the
period 1996 - 2014. The goal of this study is to describe the significant
differences of the two collections with respect to overall distribution of
author identifiers and its use across different subject domains. We found that
the STM disciplines show the best coverage of author identifiers in our dataset
of 6,032,000 publications which are both covered by WoS and Scopus. In our
dataset we found 184,823 distinct ResearcherIDs and 70,043 distinct ORCIDs. In
the appendix of this report we list a complete overview of all WoS subject
areas and the amount of author identifiers in these subject areas.

 <dc:description>  This research investigates the implementation mechanism of block-wise ILU(k)
preconditioner on GPU. The block-wise ILU(k) algorithm requires both the level
k and the block size to be designed as variables. A decoupled ILU(k) algorithm
consists of a symbolic phase and a factorization phase. In the symbolic phase,
a ILU(k) nonzero pattern is established from the point-wise structure extracted
from a block-wise matrix. In the factorization phase, the block-wise matrix
with a variable block size is factorized into a block lower triangular matrix
and a block upper triangular matrix. And a further diagonal factorization is
required to perform on the block upper triangular matrix for adapting a
parallel triangular solver on GPU.We also present the numerical experiments to
study the preconditioner actions on different k levels and block sizes.

 <dc:description>  Unifying seemingly disparate algorithmic ideas to produce better performing
algorithms has been a longstanding goal in reinforcement learning. As a primary
example, TD($\lambda$) elegantly unifies one-step TD prediction with Monte
Carlo methods through the use of eligibility traces and the trace-decay
parameter $\lambda$. Currently, there are a multitude of algorithms that can be
used to perform TD control, including Sarsa, $Q$-learning, and Expected Sarsa.
These methods are often studied in the one-step case, but they can be extended
across multiple time steps to achieve better performance. Each of these
algorithms is seemingly distinct, and no one dominates the others for all
problems. In this paper, we study a new multi-step action-value algorithm
called $Q(\sigma)$ which unifies and generalizes these existing algorithms,
while subsuming them as special cases. A new parameter, $\sigma$, is introduced
to allow the degree of sampling performed by the algorithm at each step during
its backup to be continuously varied, with Sarsa existing at one extreme (full
sampling), and Expected Sarsa existing at the other (pure expectation).
$Q(\sigma)$ is generally applicable to both on- and off-policy learning, but in
this work we focus on experiments in the on-policy case. Our results show that
an intermediate value of $\sigma$, which results in a mixture of the existing
algorithms, performs better than either extreme. The mixture can also be varied
dynamically which can result in even greater performance.

 <dc:description>  Optimal sampling of non band-limited functions is an issue of great
importance that has attracted considerable attention. We propose to tackle this
problem through the use of a frequency warping: First, by a nonlinear shrinking
of frequencies, the function is transformed into a band-limited one. One may
then perform a decomposition in Fourier series. This process gives rise to new
orthonormal bases of the Sobolev spaces H^alpha. When alpha is an integer,
these orthonormal bases can be expressed in terms of Laguerre functions. We
study the reconstruction and speed of convergence properties of the
warping-based sampling. Besides theoretical considerations, numerical
experiments are performed.

different technologies and architectures. The SMATV concept is chosen to be
presented extensively. The most important design formulae are presented with a
software package supporting the network planner to design and optimize the
network. A case study is realized, using standard components in SMATV, for a 5
floor building. The study proved that it is possible to design and optimize the
entire network, without realizing first a costly experimental setup. It is also
possible to run different architectures, optimizing also the costs of the final

 <dc:description>  Community-based question answering (CQA) services are facing key challenges
to motivate domain experts to provide timely answers. Recently, CQA services
are exploring new incentive models to engage experts and celebrities by
allowing them to set a price on their answers. In this paper, we perform a
data-driven analysis on two emerging payment-based CQA systems: Fenda (China)
and Whale (US). By analyzing a large dataset of 220K questions (worth 1 million
USD collectively), we examine how monetary incentives affect different players
in the system. We find that, while monetary incentive enables quick answers
from experts, it also drives certain users to aggressively game the system for
profits. In addition, in this supplier-driven marketplace, users need to
proactively adjust their price to make profits. Famous people are unwilling to
lower their price, which in turn hurts their income and engagement over time.
Finally, we discuss the key implications to future CQA design.

 <dc:description>  Poisoning attack is identified as a severe security threat to machine
learning algorithms. In many applications, for example, deep neural network
(DNN) models collect public data as the inputs to perform re-training, where
the input data can be poisoned. Although poisoning attack against support
vector machines (SVM) has been extensively studied before, there is still very
limited knowledge about how such attack can be implemented on neural networks
(NN), especially DNNs. In this work, we first examine the possibility of
applying traditional gradient-based method (named as the direct gradient
method) to generate poisoned data against NNs by leveraging the gradient of the
target model w.r.t. the normal data. We then propose a generative method to
accelerate the generation rate of the poisoned data: an auto-encoder
(generator) used to generate poisoned data is updated by a reward function of
the loss, and the target NN model (discriminator) receives the poisoned data to
calculate the loss w.r.t. the normal data. Our experiment results show that the
generative method can speed up the poisoned data generation rate by up to
239.38x compared with the direct gradient method, with slightly lower model
accuracy degradation. A countermeasure is also designed to detect such
poisoning attack methods by checking the loss of the target model.

 <dc:description>  We study contextual multi-armed bandit problems under linear realizability on
rewards and uncertainty (or noise) on features. For the case of identical noise
on features across actions, we propose an algorithm, coined {\em NLinRel},
having $O\left(T^{\frac{7}{8}} \left(\log{(dT)}+K\sqrt{d}\right)\right)$ regret
bound for $T$ rounds, $K$ actions, and $d$-dimensional feature vectors. Next,
for the case of non-identical noise, we observe that popular linear hypotheses
including {\em NLinRel} are impossible to achieve such sub-linear regret.
Instead, under assumption of Gaussian feature vectors, we prove that a greedy
algorithm has $O\left(T^{\frac23}\sqrt{\log d}\right)$ regret bound with
respect to the optimal linear hypothesis. Utilizing our theoretical
understanding on the Gaussian case, we also design a practical variant of {\em
NLinRel}, coined {\em Universal-NLinRel}, for arbitrary feature distributions.
It first runs {\em NLinRel} for finding the `true' coefficient vector using
feature uncertainties and then adjust it to minimize its regret using the
statistical feature information. We justify the performance of {\em
Universal-NLinRel} on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

 <dc:title>Collusion-resistant and privacy-preserving P2P multimedia distribution
  based on recombined fingerprinting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Meg&#xed;as, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Qureshi, Amna</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recombined fingerprints have been suggested as a convenient approach to
improve the efficiency of anonymous fingerprinting for the legal distribution
of copyrighted multimedia contents in P2P systems. The recombination idea is
inspired by the principles of mating, recombination and heredity of the DNA
sequences of living beings, but applied to binary sequences, like in genetic
algorithms. However, the existing recombination-based fingerprinting systems do
not provide a convenient solution for collusion resistance, since they require
double-layer fingerprinting codes, making the practical implementation of such
systems a challenging task. In fact, collusion resistance is regarded as the
most relevant requirement of a fingerprinting scheme, and the lack of any
acceptable solution to this problem would possibly deter content merchants from
deploying any practical implementation of the recombination approach. In this
paper, this drawback is overcome by introducing two non-trivial improvements,
paving the way for a future real-life application of recombination-based
systems. First, Nuida et al.'s collusion-resistant codes are used in
segment-wise fashion for the first time. Second, a novel version of the
traitor-tracing algorithm is proposed in the encrypted domain, also for the
first time, making it possible to provide the buyers with security against
framing. In addition, the proposed method avoids the use of public-key
cryptography for the multimedia content and expensive cryptographic protocols,
leading to excellent performance in terms of both computational and
communication burdens. The paper also analyzes the security and privacy
properties of the proposed system both formally and informally, whereas the
collusion resistance and the performance of the method are shown by means of
experiments and simulations.

 <dc:description>  Convex hulls are fundamental objects in computational geometry. In moderate
dimensions or for large numbers of vertices, computing the convex hull can be
impractical due to the computational complexity of convex hull algorithms. In
this article we approximate the convex hull in using a scalable algorithm which
finds high curvature vertices with high probability. The algorithm is
particularly effective for approximating convex hulls which have a relatively
small number of extreme points.

 <dc:title>Inducing syntactic cut-elimination for indexed nested sequents</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ramanayake, Revantha</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The key to the proof-theoretical study of a logic is a cutfree proof
calculus. Unfortunately there are many logics of interest lacking suitable
proof calculi. The proof formalism of nested sequents was recently generalised
to indexed nested sequents in order to yield cutfree proof calculi for
extensions of the modal logic K by Geach (Lemmon-Scott) axioms. The proofs of
completeness and cut-elimination therein were semantical and intricate. Here we
identify a subclass of the labelled sequent formalism and show that it
corresponds to the indexed nested sequent formalism. This correspondence is
then exploited to induce syntactic proofs for indexed nested sequents using the
elegant existing proofs in the labelled sequent formalism. A larger goal of
this work is to demonstrate how specialising existing proof-theoretical
transformations (adapting these as required to remain within the subclass) is
an alternative means of argument which can alleviate the need for independent
proofs from `scratch' in each formalism. Moreover, such coercion can be used to
induce new cutfree calculi. We demonstrate by presenting the first indexed
nested sequent calculi for intermediate logics. Finally, we introduce a notion
of duplicate subgraph using certain graph automorphisms---generalising the
notion of contraction for labelled sequents whose underlying structure is more
general than trees---yielding a normal form for derivations. We envisage that
such notions might be employed in order to prove decidability of a logic using
its restricted labelled calculus.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, work has been done to develop the theory of General
Reinforcement Learning (GRL). However, there are few examples demonstrating
these results in a concrete way. In particular, there are no examples
demonstrating the known results regarding gener- alised discounting. We have
added to the GRL simulation platform AIXIjs the functionality to assign an
agent arbitrary discount functions, and an environment which can be used to
determine the effect of discounting on an agent's policy. Using this, we
investigate how geometric, hyperbolic and power discounting affect an informed
agent in a simple MDP. We experimentally reproduce a number of theoretical
results, and discuss some related subtleties. It was found that the agent's
behaviour followed what is expected theoretically, assuming appropriate
parameters were chosen for the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning
algorithm.

 <dc:title>First and Second Order Asymptotics in Covert Communication with
  Pulse-Position Modulation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tahmasbi, Mehrdad</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bloch, Matthieu R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the first- and second-order asymptotics of covert communication with
PPM over binary-input DMCs for three different metrics of covertness. When
covertness is measured in terms of the relative entropy between the channel
output distributions induced with and without communication, we characterize
the exact PPM second-order asymptotics of the number of bits that can be
reliably transmitted with a probability of error less than $\epsilon$ and a
relative entropy less than $\delta$. When covertness is measured in terms of
the variational distance between the channel output distributions or in terms
of the probability of missed detection for fixed probability of false alarm, we
establish bounds on the PPM second-order asymptotics. {For all three metrics,
we show that PPM achieves the optimal first-order asymptotics among all codes;
for relative entropy, we show that PPM also achieves the optimal second-order
asymptotics among all constant composition codes.} The main conceptual
contribution of this paper is to clarify how the choice of a covertness metric
impacts the information-theoretic limits of the number of covert and reliable
bits. The main technical contribution underlying our results is a detailed
analysis of the probability of existence of a code satisfying the reliability
and covertness criteria.

seemingly divergent matrix optimization problems associated with inverse
problems, regularization and learning. In this paper we dramatically simplify
the support function representation for GMF functions as well as the
representation of their subdifferentials. These new representations allow the
ready computation of a range of important related geometric objects whose

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to its
input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We
identify two fundamental axioms---Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance
that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied
by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental
weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new
attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no
modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it
just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method
to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model,
demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network,
and to enable users to engage with models better.

 <dc:title>Finding Likely Errors with Bayesian Specifications</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a Bayesian framework for learning probabilistic specifications
from large, unstructured code corpora, and a method to use this framework to
statically detect anomalous, hence likely buggy, program behavior. The
distinctive insight here is to build a statistical model that correlates all
specifications hidden inside a corpus with the syntax and observed behavior of
programs that implement these specifications. During the analysis of a
particular program, this model is conditioned into a posterior distribution
that prioritizes specifications that are relevant to this program. This allows
accurate program analysis even if the corpus is highly heterogeneous. The
problem of finding anomalies is now framed quantitatively, as a problem of
computing a distance between a &quot;reference distribution&quot; over program behaviors
that our model expects from the program, and the distribution over behaviors
that the program actually produces.
  We present a concrete embodiment of our framework that combines a topic model
and a neural network model to learn specifications, and queries the learned
models to compute anomaly scores. We evaluate this implementation on the task
of detecting anomalous usage of Android APIs. Our encouraging experimental
results show that the method can automatically discover subtle errors in
Android applications in the wild, and has high precision and recall compared to
competing probabilistic approaches.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a synthetic statistical top-down MIMO power line
communications channel model based on a pure phenomenological approach. The
basic idea consists of directly synthesizing the experimental channel
statistical properties to obtain an extremely compact model that requires a
small set of parameters. The model is derived from the analysis of the in-home
2 $\times$ 3 MIMO PLC channel data set obtained by the ETSI Specialist Task
Force 410 measurement campaign in the band 1.8-100 MHz. The challenge of
modeling the channel statistical correlation, exhibited among the frequencies
and between the MIMO modes, in compact form is tackled and it is shown that a
small set of parameters can be used to reconstruct such a correlation behavior.
The model is validated and compared to the measured channels, showing a good
agreement in terms of average channel gain, root-mean-square delay spread,
coherence bandwidth, and channel capacity distribution.

 <dc:description>  Every teacher understands that different students benefit from different
activities. Recent advances in data processing allow us to detect and use
behavioral variability for adapting to a student. This approach allows us to
optimize learning process but does not focus on understanding it. Conversely,
classical findings in educational sciences allow us to understand the learner
but are hard to embed in a large scale adaptive system. In this study we design
and build a framework to investigate when the two approaches coincide.

 <dc:description>  With increasing connectivity among comprising agents or (sub-)systems in
large, complex systems, there is a growing interest in understanding
interdependent security and dealing with inefficiency in security investments.
Making use of a population game model and the well-known Chung-Lu random graph
model, we study how one could encourage selfish agents to invest more in
security by internalizing the externalities produced by their security
investments.
  To this end, we first establish an interesting relation between the local
minimizers of social cost and the Nash equilibria of a population game with
slightly altered costs. Secondly, under a mild technical assumption, we
demonstrate that there exists a unique minimizer of social cost and it
coincides with the unique Nash equilibrium of the population game. This finding
tells us how to modify the private cost functions of selfish agents in order to
enhance the overall security and reduce social cost. In addition, it reveals
how the sensitivity of overall security to security investments of agents
influences their externalities and, consequently, penalties or taxes that
should be imposed for internalization of externalities. Finally, we illustrate
how the degree distribution of agents influences their security investments and
overall security at both the NEs of population games and social optima.

 <dc:title>Multi-Scale Wavelet Domain Residual Learning for Limited-Angle CT

 <dc:description>  Limited-angle computed tomography (CT) is often used in clinical applications
such as C-arm CT for interventional imaging. However, CT images from limited
angles suffers from heavy artifacts due to incomplete projection data. Existing
iterative methods require extensive calculations but can not deliver
satisfactory results. Based on the observation that the artifacts from limited
angles have some directional property and are globally distributed, we propose
a novel multi-scale wavelet domain residual learning architecture, which
compensates for the artifacts. Experiments have shown that the proposed method
effectively eliminates artifacts, thereby preserving edge and global structures
of the image.

 <dc:description>  Model based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms for low-dose X-ray CT
are computationally complex because of the repeated use of the forward and
backward projection. Inspired by this success of deep learning in computer
vision applications, we recently proposed a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) for low-dose X-ray CT and won the second place in 2016 AAPM Low-Dose CT
Grand Challenge. However, some of the texture are not fully recovered, which
was unfamiliar to some radiologists. To cope with this problem, here we propose
a direct residual learning approach on directional wavelet domain to solve this
problem and to improve the performance against previous work. In particular,
the new network estimates the noise of each input wavelet transform, and then
the de-noised wavelet coefficients are obtained by subtracting the noise from
the input wavelet transform bands. The experimental results confirm that the
proposed network has significantly improved performance, preserving the detail
texture of the original images.

 <dc:description>  This paper extends fully-convolutional neural networks (FCN) for the clothing
parsing problem. Clothing parsing requires higher-level knowledge on clothing
semantics and contextual cues to disambiguate fine-grained categories. We
extend FCN architecture with a side-branch network which we refer outfit
encoder to predict a consistent set of clothing labels to encourage
combinatorial preference, and with conditional random field (CRF) to explicitly
consider coherent label assignment to the given image. The empirical results
using Fashionista and CFPD datasets show that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in clothing parsing, without additional
supervision during training. We also study the qualitative influence of
annotation on the current clothing parsing benchmarks, with our Web-based tool
for multi-scale pixel-wise annotation and manual refinement effort to the
Fashionista dataset. Finally, we show that the image representation of the
outfit encoder is useful for dress-up image retrieval application.

 <dc:description>  Reciprocity in directed networks points to user's willingness to return
favors in building mutual interactions. High reciprocity has been widely
observed in many directed social media networks such as following relations in
Twitter and Tumblr. Therefore, reciprocal relations between users are often
regarded as a basic mechanism to create stable social ties and play a crucial
role in the formation and evolution of networks. Each reciprocity relation is
formed by two parasocial links in a back-and-forth manner with a time delay.
Hence, understanding the delay can help us gain better insights into the
underlying mechanisms of network dynamics. Meanwhile, the accurate prediction
of delay has practical implications in advancing a variety of real-world
applications such as friend recommendation and marketing campaign. For example,
by knowing when will users follow back, service providers can focus on the
users with a potential long reciprocal delay for effective targeted marketing.
This paper presents the initial investigation of the time delay in reciprocal
relations. Our study is based on a large-scale directed network from Tumblr
that consists of 62.8 million users and 3.1 billion user following relations
with a timespan of multiple years (from 31 Oct 2007 to 24 Jul 2013). We reveal
a number of interesting patterns about the delay that motivate the development
of a principled learning model to predict the delay in reciprocal relations.
Experimental results on the above mentioned dynamic networks corroborate the
effectiveness of the proposed delay prediction model.

 <dc:description>  Stacking-based deep neural network (S-DNN), in general, denotes a deep neural
network (DNN) resemblance in terms of its very deep, feedforward network
architecture. The typical S-DNN aggregates a variable number of individually
learnable modules in series to assemble a DNN-alike alternative to the targeted
object recognition tasks. This work likewise devises an S-DNN instantiation,
dubbed deep analytic network (DAN), on top of the spectral histogram (SH)
features. The DAN learning principle relies on ridge regression, and some key
DNN constituents, specifically, rectified linear unit, fine-tuning, and
normalization. The DAN aptitude is scrutinized on three repositories of varying
domains, including FERET (faces), MNIST (handwritten digits), and CIFAR10
(natural objects). The empirical results unveil that DAN escalates the SH
baseline performance over a sufficiently deep layer.

 <dc:description>  Transformer life assessment and failure diagnostics have always been
important problems for electric utility companies. Ambient temperature and load
profile are the main factors which affect aging of the transformer insulation,
and consequently, the transformer lifetime. The IEEE Std. C57.911995 provides a
model for calculating the transformer loss of life based on ambient temperature
and transformer's loading. In this paper, this standard is used to develop a
data-driven static model for hourly estimation of the transformer loss of life.
Among various machine learning methods for developing this static model, the
Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is selected. Numerical
simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed
ANFIS method compared with other relevant machine learning based methods to
solve this problem.

 <dc:description>  We consider the case in which a robot has to navigate in an unknown
environment but does not have enough on-board power or payload to carry a
traditional depth sensor (e.g., a 3D lidar) and thus can only acquire a few
(point-wise) depth measurements. We address the following question: is it
possible to reconstruct the geometry of an unknown environment using sparse and
incomplete depth measurements? Reconstruction from incomplete data is not
possible in general, but when the robot operates in man-made environments, the
depth exhibits some regularity (e.g., many planar surfaces with only a few
edges); we leverage this regularity to infer depth from a small number of
measurements. Our first contribution is a formulation of the depth
reconstruction problem that bridges robot perception with the compressive
sensing literature in signal processing. The second contribution includes a set
of formal results that ascertain the exactness and stability of the depth
reconstruction in 2D and 3D problems, and completely characterize the geometry
of the profiles that we can reconstruct. Our third contribution is a set of
practical algorithms for depth reconstruction: our formulation directly
translates into algorithms for depth estimation based on convex programming. In
real-world problems, these convex programs are very large and general-purpose
solvers are relatively slow. For this reason, we discuss ad-hoc solvers that
enable fast depth reconstruction in real problems. The last contribution is an
extensive experimental evaluation in 2D and 3D problems, including Monte Carlo
runs on simulated instances and testing on multiple real datasets. Empirical
results confirm that the proposed approach ensures accurate depth
reconstruction, outperforms interpolation-based strategies, and performs well
even when the assumption of structured environment is violated.

 <dc:description>  We consider the recovery of a continuous domain piecewise constant image from
its non-uniform Fourier samples using a convex matrix completion algorithm. We
assume the discontinuities/edges of the image are localized to the zero
levelset of a bandlimited function. This assumption induces linear dependencies
between the Fourier coefficients of the image, which results in a two-fold
block Toeplitz matrix constructed from the Fourier coefficients being low-rank.
The proposed algorithm reformulates the recovery of the unknown Fourier
coefficients as a structured low-rank matrix completion problem, where the
nuclear norm of the matrix is minimized subject to structure and data
constraints. We show that exact recovery is possible with high probability when
the edge set of the image satisfies an incoherency property. We also show that
the incoherency property is dependent on the geometry of the edge set curve,
implying higher sampling burden for smaller curves. This paper generalizes
recent work on the super-resolution recovery of isolated Diracs or signals with
finite rate of innovation to the recovery of piecewise constant images.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a real-time approach to local trajectory replanning
for microaerial vehicles (MAVs). Current trajectory generation methods for
multicopters achieve high success rates in cluttered environments, but assume
that the environment is static and require prior knowledge of the map. In the
presented study, we use the results of such planners and extend them with a
local replanning algorithm that can handle unmodeled (possibly dynamic)
obstacles while keeping the MAV close to the global trajectory. To ensure that
the proposed approach is real-time capable, we maintain information about the
environment around the MAV in an occupancy grid stored in a three-dimensional
circular buffer, which moves together with a drone, and represent the
trajectories by using uniform B-splines. This representation ensures that the
trajectory is sufficiently smooth and simultaneously allows for efficient
optimization.

the actuator exhibits a bending angle of 170.3 {\deg} and a blocked force of
0.34 N at the applied pressure of 25 kPa. These values are comparable to
elastomer based pneumatic actuators. As a validation example, two actuators are
integrated to form a gripper capable of handling various objects, highlighting
the high performance and applicability of the edible actuator. These edible

 <dc:title>Deep Matching Prior Network: Toward Tighter Multi-oriented Text

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Detecting incidental scene text is a challenging task because of
multi-orientation, perspective distortion, and variation of text size, color
and scale. Retrospective research has only focused on using rectangular
bounding box or horizontal sliding window to localize text, which may result in
redundant background noise, unnecessary overlap or even information loss. To
address these issues, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
based method, named Deep Matching Prior Network (DMPNet), to detect text with
tighter quadrangle. First, we use quadrilateral sliding windows in several
specific intermediate convolutional layers to roughly recall the text with
higher overlapping area and then a shared Monte-Carlo method is proposed for
fast and accurate computing of the polygonal areas. After that, we designed a
sequential protocol for relative regression which can exactly predict text with
compact quadrangle. Moreover, a auxiliary smooth Ln loss is also proposed for
further regressing the position of text, which has better overall performance
than L2 loss and smooth L1 loss in terms of robustness and stability. The
effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on a public word-level,
multi-oriented scene text database, ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition
Challenge 4 &quot;Incidental scene text localization&quot;. The performance of our method
is evaluated by using F-measure and found to be 70.64%, outperforming the
existing state-of-the-art method with F-measure 63.76%.

 <dc:description>  The Web of Things (WoT) is rapidly growing in popularity getting the interest
of not only technologist and scientific communities but industrial, system
integrators and solution providers. The key aspect of the WoT to succeed is the
relatively, easy-to-build ecosystems nature inherited from the web and the
capacity for building end-to-end solutions. At the WoT connecting physical
devices such as sensors, RFID tags or any devices that can send data through
the Internet using the Web is almost automatic. The WoT shared data can be used
to build smarter solutions that offer business services in the form of IoT
applications. In this chapter, we review the main WoT challenges, with
particular interest on highlighting those that rely on combining heterogeneous
IoT data for the design of smarter services and applications and that benefit
from data interoperability. Semantic web technologies help for overcoming with
such challenges by addressing, among other ones the following objectives: 1)
semantically annotating and unifying heterogeneous data, 2) enriching semantic
WoT datasets with external knowledge graphs, and 3) providing an analysis of
data by means of reasoning mechanisms to infer meaningful information. To
overcome the challenge of building interoperable semantics-based IoT
applications, the Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) semantic engine has been
designed to semantically annotate WoT data, build the logic of smarter services
and deduce meaningful knowledge by linking it to the external knowledge graphs
available on the web. M3 assists application and business developers in
designing interoperable Semantic Web of Things applications. Contributions in
the context of European semantic-based WoT projects are discussed and a
particular use case within FIESTA-IoT project is presented.

 <dc:title>Noncoherent Analog Network Coding using LDPC-coded FSK</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ferrett, Terry</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Valenti, Matthew C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Analog network coding (ANC) is a throughput increasing technique for the
two-way relay channel (TWRC) whereby two end nodes transmit simultaneously to a
relay at the same time and band, followed by the relay broadcasting the
received sum of signals to the end nodes. Coherent reception under ANC is
challenging due to requiring oscillator synchronization for all nodes, a
problem further exacerbated by Doppler shift. This work develops a noncoherent
M-ary frequency-shift keyed (FSK) demodulator implementing ANC. The demodulator
produces soft outputs suitable for use with capacity-approaching channel codes
and supports information feedback from the channel decoder. A unique aspect of
the formulation is the presence of an infinite summation in the received symbol
probability density function. Detection and channel decoding succeed when the
truncated summation contains a sufficient number of terms. Bit error rate
performance is investigated by Monte Carlo simulation, considering modulation
orders two, four and eight, channel coded and uncoded operation, and with and
without information feedback from decoder to demodulator. The channel code
considered for simulation is the LDPC code defined by the DVB-S2 standard. To
our knowledge this work is the first to develop a noncoherent soft-output
demodulator for ANC.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel method to register football broadcast video
frames on the static top view model of the playing surface. The proposed method
is fully automatic in contrast to the current state of the art which requires
manual initialization of point correspondences between the image and the static
model. Automatic registration using existing approaches has been difficult due
to the lack of sufficient point correspondences. We investigate an alternate
approach exploiting the edge information from the line markings on the field.
We formulate the registration problem as a nearest neighbour search over a
synthetically generated dictionary of edge map and homography pairs. The
synthetic dictionary generation allows us to exhaustively cover a wide variety
of camera angles and positions and reduce this problem to a minimal per-frame
edge map matching procedure. We show that the per-frame results can be improved
in videos using an optimization framework for temporal camera stabilization. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting extensive results on a
dataset collected from matches of football World Cup 2014.

 <dc:title>On the set of optimal homeomorphisms for the natural pseudo-distance

 <dc:description>  If $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are two continuous real-valued functions defined on a
compact topological space $X$ and $G$ is a subgroup of the group of all
homeomorphisms of $X$ onto itself, the natural pseudo-distance
$d_G(\varphi,\psi)$ is defined as the infimum of $\mathcal{L}(g)=\|\varphi-\psi
\circ g \|_\infty$, as $g$ varies in $G$. In this paper, we make a first step
towards extending the study of this concept to the case of Lie groups, by
assuming $X=G=S^1$. In particular, we study the set of the optimal
homeomorphisms for $d_G$, i.e. the elements $\rho_\alpha$ of $S^1$ such that
$\mathcal{L}(\rho_\alpha)$ is equal to $d_G(\varphi,\psi)$. As our main
results, we give conditions that a homeomorphism has to meet in order to be
optimal, and we prove that the set of the optimal homeomorphisms is finite
under suitable conditions.

 <dc:description>  Given a relational specification R(X, Y), where X and Y are sequences of

the inputs such that the specification holds. This is called the Boolean
functional synthesis problem and has applications in several areas. In this

compositional and CEGAR-style reasoning as key building blocks. We show by
means of extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing tools on

 <dc:description>  It was shown by Massey that linear complementary dual (LCD for short) codes
are asymptotically good. In 2004, Sendrier proved that LCD codes meet the
asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov (GV for short) bound. Until now, the GV bound
still remains to be the best asymptotical lower bound for LCD codes. In this
paper, we show that an algebraic geometry code over a finite field of even
characteristic is equivalent to an LCD code and consequently there exists a
family of LCD codes that are equivalent to algebraic geometry codes and exceed
the asymptotical GV bound.

 <dc:description>  Poisson factorization is a probabilistic model of users and items for
recommendation systems, where the so-called implicit consumer data is modeled
by a factorized Poisson distribution. There are many variants of Poisson
factorization methods who show state-of-the-art performance on real-world
recommendation tasks. However, most of them do not explicitly take into account
the temporal behavior and the recurrent activities of users which is essential
to recommend the right item to the right user at the right time. In this paper,
we introduce Recurrent Poisson Factorization (RPF) framework that generalizes
the classical PF methods by utilizing a Poisson process for modeling the
implicit feedback. RPF treats time as a natural constituent of the model and
brings to the table a rich family of time-sensitive factorization models. To
elaborate, we instantiate several variants of RPF who are capable of handling
dynamic user preferences and item specification (DRPF), modeling the
social-aspect of product adoption (SRPF), and capturing the consumption
heterogeneity among users and items (HRPF). We also develop a variational
algorithm for approximate posterior inference that scales up to massive data
sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate RPF's superior performance over many
state-of-the-art methods on synthetic dataset, and large scale real-world
datasets on music streaming logs, and user-item interactions in M-Commerce
platforms.

 <dc:description>  As code search is a frequent developer activity in software development
practices, improving the performance of code search is a critical task. In the
text retrieval based search techniques employed in the code search, the term
mismatch problem is a critical language issue for retrieval effectiveness. By
reformulating the queries, query expansion provides effective ways to solve the
term mismatch problem. In this paper, we propose Query Expansion based on Crowd
Knowledge (QECK), a novel technique to improve the performance of code search
algorithms. QECK identifies software-specific expansion words from the high
quality pseudo relevance feedback question and answer pairs on Stack Overflow
to automatically generate the expansion queries. Furthermore, we incorporate
QECK in the classic Rocchio's model, and propose QECK based code search method
QECKRocchio. We conduct three experiments to evaluate our QECK technique and
investigate QECKRocchio in a large-scale corpus containing real-world code
snippets and a question and answer pair collection. The results show that QECK
improves the performance of three code search algorithms by up to 64 percent in
Precision, and 35 percent in NDCG. Meanwhile, compared with the
state-of-the-art query expansion method, the improvement of QECK Rocchio is 22
percent in Precision, and 16 percent in NDCG.

 <dc:description>  When implementing unfamiliar programming tasks, developers commonly search
code examples and learn usage patterns of APIs from the code examples or reuse
them by copy-pasting and modifying. For providing high-quality code examples,
previous studies present several methods to recommend code snippets mainly
based on information retrieval. In this paper, to provide better recommendation
results, we propose ROSF, Recommending cOde Snippets with multi-aspect
Features, a novel method combining both information retrieval and supervised
learning. In our method, we recommend Top-Kcode snippets for a givenfree-form
query based on two stages, i.e., coarse-grained searching and fine-grained
re-ranking. First, we generate a code snippet candidate set by searching a code
snippet corpus using an information retrieval method. Second, we predict
probability values of the code snippets for different relevance scores in the
candidate set by the learned prediction model from a training set, re-rank
these candidate code snippets according to the probability values, and
recommend the final results to developers. We conduct several experiments to
evaluate our method in a large-scale corpus containing 921,713 real-world code
snippets. The results show that ROSF is an effective method for code snippets
recommendation and outperforms the-state-of-the-art methods by 20%-41% in
Precision and 13%-33% in NDCG

 <dc:description>  We present a new distributed representation in deep neural nets wherein the
information is represented in native form as a matrix. This differs from
current neural architectures that rely on vector representations. We consider
matrices as central to the architecture and they compose the input, hidden and
output layers. The model representation is more compact and elegant - the
number of parameters grows only with the largest dimension of the incoming
layer rather than the number of hidden units. We derive feed-forward nets that
map an input matrix into an output matrix, and recurrent nets which map a
sequence of input matrices into a sequence of output matrices. Experiments on
handwritten digits recognition, face reconstruction, sequence to sequence
learning and EEG classification demonstrate the efficacy and compactness of the
matrix-centric architectures.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown their good performances
in many computer vision tasks. However, the high computational complexity of
CNN involves a huge amount of data movements between the computational
processor core and memory hierarchy which occupies the major of the power
consumption. This paper presents Chain-NN, a novel energy-efficient 1D chain
architecture for accelerating deep CNNs. Chain-NN consists of the dedicated
dual-channel process engines (PE). In Chain-NN, convolutions are done by the 1D
systolic primitives composed of a group of adjacent PEs. These systolic
primitives, together with the proposed column-wise scan input pattern, can
fully reuse input operand to reduce the memory bandwidth requirement for energy
saving. Moreover, the 1D chain architecture allows the systolic primitives to
be easily reconfigured according to specific CNN parameters with fewer design
complexity. The synthesis and layout of Chain-NN is under TSMC 28nm process. It
costs 3751k logic gates and 352KB on-chip memory. The results show a 576-PE
Chain-NN can be scaled up to 700MHz. This achieves a peak throughput of
806.4GOPS with 567.5mW and is able to accelerate the five convolutional layers
in AlexNet at a frame rate of 326.2fps. 1421.0GOPS/W power efficiency is at
least 2.5 to 4.1x times better than the state-of-the-art works.

 <dc:description>  Simulation-based training (SBT) is gaining popularity as a low-cost and
convenient training technique in a vast range of applications. However, for a
SBT platform to be fully utilized as an effective training tool, it is
essential that feedback on performance is provided automatically in real-time
during training. It is the aim of this paper to develop an efficient and
effective feedback generation method for the provision of real-time feedback in
SBT. Existing methods either have low effectiveness in improving novice skills
or suffer from low efficiency, resulting in their inability to be used in
real-time. In this paper, we propose a neural network based method to generate
feedback using the adversarial technique. The proposed method utilizes a
bounded adversarial update to minimize a L1 regularized loss via
back-propagation. We empirically show that the proposed method can be used to
generate simple, yet effective feedback. Also, it was observed to have high
effectiveness and efficiency when compared to existing methods, thus making it
a promising option for real-time feedback generation in SBT.

 <dc:description>  Appearance changes due to weather and seasonal conditions represent a strong
impediment to the robust implementation of machine learning systems in outdoor
robotics. While supervised learning optimises a model for the training domain,
it will deliver degraded performance in application domains that underlie
distributional shifts caused by these changes. Traditionally, this problem has
been addressed via the collection of labelled data in multiple domains or by
imposing priors on the type of shift between both domains. We frame the problem
in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation and develop a framework for
applying adversarial techniques to adapt popular, state-of-the-art network
architectures with the additional objective to align features across domains.
Moreover, as adversarial training is notoriously unstable, we first perform an
extensive ablation study, adapting many techniques known to stabilise
generative adversarial networks, and evaluate on a surrogate classification
task with the same appearance change. The distilled insights are applied to the
problem of free-space segmentation for motion planning in autonomous driving.

 <dc:description>  Traditional image and video compression algorithms rely on hand-crafted
encoder/decoder pairs (codecs) that lack adaptability and are agnostic to the
data being compressed. Here we describe the concept of generative compression,
the compression of data using generative models, and suggest that it is a
direction worth pursuing to produce more accurate and visually pleasing
reconstructions at much deeper compression levels for both image and video
data. We also demonstrate that generative compression is orders-of-magnitude
more resilient to bit error rates (e.g. from noisy wireless channels) than
traditional variable-length coding schemes.

 <dc:description>  With the growing popularity of online social media, identifying influential
users in these social networks has become very popular. Existing works have
studied user attributes, network structure and user interactions when measuring
user influence. In contrast to these works, we focus on user behavioural
characteristics. We investigate the temporal dynamics of user activity patterns
and how these patterns affect user interactions. We assimilate such
characteristics into a PageRank based temporal influence ranking model (TIR) to
identify influential users. The transition probability in TIR is predicted by a
logistic regression model and the random walk, biased according to users'
temporal activity patterns. Experiments demonstrate that TIR has better
performance and is more stable than the existing models in global influence
ranking and friend recommendation.

 <dc:description>  The population recovery problem is a basic problem in noisy unsupervised
learning that has attracted significant research attention in recent years
[WY12,DRWY12, MS13, BIMP13, LZ15,DST16]. A number of different variants of this
problem have been studied, often under assumptions on the unknown distribution
(such as that it has restricted support size). In this work we study the sample
complexity and algorithmic complexity of the most general version of the
problem, under both bit-flip noise and erasure noise model. We give essentially
matching upper and lower sample complexity bounds for both noise models, and
efficient algorithms matching these sample complexity bounds up to polynomial
factors.

 <dc:description>  The problem that we consider is the following: given an $n \times n$ array
$A$ of positive numbers, find a tiling using at most $p$ rectangles (which
means that each array element must be covered by some rectangle and no two
rectangles must overlap) that minimizes the maximum weight of any rectangle
(the weight of a rectangle is the sum of elements which are covered by it). We
prove that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within a factor of
\textbf{1$\frac{1}{3}$} (the previous best result was $1\frac{1}{4}$).

 <dc:description>  The emergence of new digital technologies has allowed the study of human
behaviour at a scale and at level of granularity that were unthinkable just a
decade ago. In particular, by analysing the digital traces left by people
interacting in the online and offline worlds, we are able to trace the
spreading of knowledge and ideas at both local and global scales.
  In this article we will discuss how these digital traces can be used to map
knowledge across the world, outlining both the limitations and the challenges
in performing this type of analysis. We will focus on data collected from
social media platforms, large-scale digital repositories and mobile data.
Finally, we will provide an overview of the tools that are available to
scholars and practitioners for understanding these processes using these
emerging forms of data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe some ways to utilize various lexical resources to
improve the quality of statistical machine translation system. We have
augmented the training corpus with various lexical resources such as
IndoWordnet semantic relation set, function words, kridanta pairs and verb
phrases etc. Our research on the usage of lexical resources mainly focused on
two ways such as augmenting parallel corpus with more vocabulary and augmenting
with various word forms. We have described case studies, evaluations and
detailed error analysis for both Marathi to Hindi and Hindi to Marathi machine
translation systems. From the evaluations we observed that, there is an
incremental growth in the quality of machine translation as the usage of
various lexical resources increases. Moreover usage of various lexical
resources helps to improve the coverage and quality of machine translation
where limited parallel corpus is available.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we use player behavior during the closed beta test of the
MMORPG ArcheAge as a proxy for an extreme situation: at the end of the closed
beta test, all user data is deleted, and thus, the outcome (or penalty) of
players' in-game behaviors in the last few days loses its meaning. We analyzed
270 million records of player behavior in the 4th closed beta test of ArcheAge.
Our findings show that there are no apparent pandemic behavior changes, but
some outliers were more likely to exhibit anti-social behavior (e.g., player
killing). We also found that contrary to the reassuring adage that &quot;Even if I
knew the world would go to pieces tomorrow, I would still plant my apple tree,&quot;
players abandoned character progression, showing a drastic decrease in quest
completion, leveling, and ability changes at the end of the beta test.

 <dc:title>Opinion dynamics model based on cognitive biases</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an introduction to a novel model of an individual and group
opinion dynamics, taking into account different ways in which different sources
of information are filtered due to cognitive biases. The agent based model,
using Bayesian updating of the individual belief distribution, is based on the
recent psychology work by Dan Kahan. Open nature of the model allows to study
the effects of both static and time-dependent biases and information processing
filters. In particular, the paper compares the effects of two important
psychological mechanisms: the confirmation bias and the politically motivated
reasoning. Depending on the effectiveness of the information filtering (agent
bias), the agents confronted with an objective information source may either
reach a consensus based on the truth, or remain divided despite the evidence.
In general, the model might provide an understanding into the increasingly
polarized modern societies, especially as it allows mixing of different types
of filters: psychological, social, and algorithmic.

 <dc:description>  We consider the setting of a master server who possesses confidential data
(genomic, medical data, etc.) and wants to run intensive computations on it, as
part of a machine learning algorithm for example. The master wants to
distribute these computations to untrusted workers who have volunteered or are
incentivized to help with this task. However, the data must be kept private (in
an information theoretic sense) and not revealed to the individual workers. The
workers may be busy, or even unresponsive, and will take a random time to
finish the task assigned to them. We are interested in reducing the aggregate
delay experienced by the master. We focus on linear computations as an
essential operation in many iterative algorithms. A known solution is to use a
linear secret sharing scheme to divide the data into secret shares on which the
workers can compute. We propose to use instead new secure codes, called
Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of the authors. We study the
delay induced by Staircase codes which is always less than that of secret
sharing. The reason is that secret sharing schemes need to wait for the
responses of a fixed fraction of the workers, whereas Staircase codes offer
more flexibility in this respect. For instance, for codes with rate $R=1/2$
Staircase codes can lead to up to $40\%$ reduction in delay compared to secret
sharing.

 <dc:description>  Permutation testing is a non-parametric method for obtaining the max null
distribution used to compute corrected $p$-values that provide strong control
of false positives. In neuroimaging, however, the computational burden of
running such an algorithm can be significant. We find that by viewing the
permutation testing procedure as the construction of a very large permutation
testing matrix, $T$, one can exploit structural properties derived from the
data and the test statistics to reduce the runtime under certain conditions. In
particular, we see that $T$ is low-rank plus a low-variance residual. This
makes $T$ a good candidate for low-rank matrix completion, where only a very
small number of entries of $T$ ($\sim0.35\%$ of all entries in our experiments)
have to be computed to obtain a good estimate. Based on this observation, we
present RapidPT, an algorithm that efficiently recovers the max null
distribution commonly obtained through regular permutation testing in
voxel-wise analysis. We present an extensive validation on a synthetic dataset
and four varying sized datasets against two baselines: Statistical
NonParametric Mapping (SnPM13) and a standard permutation testing
implementation (referred as NaivePT). We find that RapidPT achieves its best
runtime performance on medium sized datasets ($50 \leq n \leq 200$), with
speedups of 1.5x - 38x (vs. SnPM13) and 20x-1000x (vs. NaivePT). For larger
datasets ($n \geq 200$) RapidPT outperforms NaivePT (6x - 200x) on all
datasets, and provides large speedups over SnPM13 when more than 10000
permutations (2x - 15x) are needed. The implementation is a standalone toolbox
and also integrated within SnPM13, able to leverage multi-core architectures
when available.

 <dc:title>Machine Learning Friendly Set Version of Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we make a novel use of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. The
Lemma has an existential form saying that there exists a JL transformation $f$
of the data points into lower dimensional space such that all of them fall into
predefined error range $\delta$.
  We formulate in this paper a theorem stating that we can choose the target
dimensionality in a random projection type JL linear transformation in such a
way that with probability $1-\epsilon$ all of them fall into predefined error
range $\delta$ for any user-predefined failure probability $\epsilon$.
  This result is important for applications such a data clustering where we
want to have a priori dimensionality reducing transformation instead of trying
out a (large) number of them, as with traditional Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma.
In particular, we take a closer look at the $k$-means algorithm and prove that
a good solution in the projected space is also a good solution in the original
space. Furthermore, under proper assumptions local optima in the original space
are also ones in the projected space. We define also conditions for which
clusterability property of the original space is transmitted to the projected
space, so that special case algorithms for the original space are also
applicable in the projected space.

 <dc:description>  An aperiodic sampled-data min-jumping rule is proposed for linear impulsive
systems, a class of systems encompassing switched and sampled-data systems as
particular cases. Several sufficient co-design conditions characterizing the
stabilization of a given linear impulsive system subject to the considered
min-jumping rule and a sampled-data state-feedback controller are formulated in
terms of discrete-time Lyapunov-Metzler conditions. These conditions are then
exactly reformulated as clock-dependent conditions known to be more convenient
to verify and that allow for an immediate extension of the results to uncertain
systems and to performance analysis. Several examples pertaining on
sampled-data control of switched and impulsive systems are given for
illustration.

 <dc:description>  The deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the state-of-the-art solution
for large-scale visual recognition. Following basic principles such as
increasing the depth and constructing highway connections, researchers have
manually designed a lot of fixed network structures and verified their
effectiveness.
  In this paper, we discuss the possibility of learning deep network structures
automatically. Note that the number of possible network structures increases
exponentially with the number of layers in the network, which inspires us to
adopt the genetic algorithm to efficiently traverse this large search space. We
first propose an encoding method to represent each network structure in a
fixed-length binary string, and initialize the genetic algorithm by generating
a set of randomized individuals. In each generation, we define standard genetic
operations, e.g., selection, mutation and crossover, to eliminate weak
individuals and then generate more competitive ones. The competitiveness of
each individual is defined as its recognition accuracy, which is obtained via
training the network from scratch and evaluating it on a validation set. We run
the genetic process on two small datasets, i.e., MNIST and CIFAR10,
demonstrating its ability to evolve and find high-quality structures which are
little studied before. These structures are also transferrable to the
large-scale ILSVRC2012 dataset.

 <dc:description>  Temporal action localization is an important yet challenging problem. Given a
long, untrimmed video consisting of multiple action instances and complex
background contents, we need not only to recognize their action categories, but
also to localize the start time and end time of each instance. Many
state-of-the-art systems use segment-level classifiers to select and rank
proposal segments of pre-determined boundaries. However, a desirable model
should move beyond segment-level and make dense predictions at a fine
granularity in time to determine precise temporal boundaries. To this end, we
design a novel Convolutional-De-Convolutional (CDC) network that places CDC
filters on top of 3D ConvNets, which have been shown to be effective for
abstracting action semantics but reduce the temporal length of the input data.
The proposed CDC filter performs the required temporal upsampling and spatial
downsampling operations simultaneously to predict actions at the frame-level
granularity. It is unique in jointly modeling action semantics in space-time
and fine-grained temporal dynamics. We train the CDC network in an end-to-end
manner efficiently. Our model not only achieves superior performance in
detecting actions in every frame, but also significantly boosts the precision
of localizing temporal boundaries. Finally, the CDC network demonstrates a very
high efficiency with the ability to process 500 frames per second on a single
GPU server. We will update the camera-ready version and publish the source
codes online soon.

 <dc:description>  Surface codes are among the best candidates to ensure the fault-tolerance of
a quantum computer. In order to avoid the accumulation of errors during a
computation, it is crucial to have at our disposal a fast decoding algorithm to
quickly identify and correct errors as soon as they occur. We propose a
linear-time maximum likelihood decoder for surface codes over the quantum
erasure channel. This decoding algorithm for dealing with qubit loss is optimal
both in terms of performance and speed.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates power control and relay selection in Full Duplex
Cognitive Relay Networks (FDCRNs), where the secondary-user (SU) relays can
simultaneously receive and forward the signal from the SU source. We study both
non-coherent and coherent scenarios. In the non-coherent case, the SU relay
forwards the signal from the SU source without regulating the phase, while in
the coherent scenario, the SU relay regulates the phase when forwarding the
signal to minimize the interference at the primary-user (PU) receiver. We
consider the problem of maximizing the transmission rate from the SU source to
the SU destination subject to the interference constraint at the PU receiver
and power constraints at both the SU source and SU relay. We develop
low-complexity and high-performance joint power control and relay selection
algorithms. The superior performance of the proposed algorithms are confirmed
using extensive numerical evaluation. In particular, we demonstrate the
significant gain of phase regulation at the SU relay (i.e., the gain of the
coherent mechanism over the noncoherent mechanism).

 <dc:description>  Early and accurate identification of parkinsonian syndromes (PS) involving
presynaptic degeneration from non-degenerative variants such as Scans Without
Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD) and tremor disorders, is important for
effective patient management as the course, therapy and prognosis differ
substantially between the two groups. In this study, we use Single Photon
Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images from healthy normal, early PD and
SWEDD subjects, as obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative
(PPMI) database, and process them to compute shape- and surface fitting-based
features for the three groups. We use these features to develop and compare
various classification models that can discriminate between scans showing
dopaminergic deficit, as in PD, from scans without the deficit, as in healthy
normal or SWEDD. Along with it, we also compare these features with Striatal
Binding Ratio (SBR)-based features, which are well-established and clinically
used, by computing a feature importance score using Random forests technique.
We observe that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier gave the best
performance with an accuracy of 97.29%. These features also showed higher
importance than the SBR-based features. We infer from the study that shape
analysis and surface fitting are useful and promising methods for extracting
discriminatory features that can be used to develop diagnostic models that
might have the potential to help clinicians in the diagnostic process.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates power control and relay selection in Full Duplex
Cognitive Relay Networks (FDCRNs), where the secondary-user (SU) relays can
simultaneously receive data from the SU source and forward them to the SU
destination. We study both non-coherent and coherent scenarios. In the
non-coherent case, the SU relay forwards the signal from the SU source without
regulating the phase; while in the coherent scenario, the SU relay regulates
the phase when forwarding the signal to minimize the interference at the
primary-user (PU) receiver. We consider the problem of maximizing the
transmission rate from the SU source to the SU destination subject to the
interference constraint at the PU receiver and power constraints at both the SU
source and SU relay. We then develop a mathematical model to analyze the data
rate performance of the FDCRN considering the self-interference effects at the
FD relay. We develop low-complexity and high-performance joint power control
and relay selection algorithms. Extensive numerical results are presented to
illustrate the impacts of power level parameters and the self-interference
cancellation quality on the rate performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the
significant gain of phase regulation at the SU relay.

 <dc:description>  A novel matching based heuristic algorithm designed to detect specially
formulated infeasible zero-one IPs is presented. The algorithm input is a set
of nested doubly stochastic subsystems and a set E of instance defining
variables set at zero level. The algorithm deduces additional variables at zero
level until either a constraint is violated (the IP is infeasible), or no more
variables can be deduced zero (the IP is undecided). All feasible IPs, and all
infeasible IPs not detected infeasible are undecided. We successfully apply the
algorithm to a small set of specially formulated infeasible zero-one IP
instances of the Hamilton cycle decision problem. We show how to model both the
graph and subgraph isomorphism decision problems for input to the algorithm.
Increased levels of nested doubly stochastic subsystems can be implemented
dynamically. The algorithm is designed for parallel processing, and for
inclusion of techniques in addition to matching.

 <dc:description>  Capturing the vast amount of meaningful information encoded in the human
genome is a fascinating research problem. The outcome of these researches have
significant influences in a number of health related fields --- personalized
medicine, paternity testing and disease susceptibility testing are a few to be
named. To facilitate these types of large scale biomedical research projects,
it oftentimes requires to share genomic and clinical data collected by
disparate organizations among themselves. In that case, it is of utmost
importance to ensure that sharing, managing and analyzing the data does not
reveal the identity of the individuals who contribute their genomic samples.
The task of storage and computation on the shared data can be delegated to
third party cloud infrastructures, equipped with large storage and high
performance computation resources. Outsourcing these sensitive genomic data to
the third party cloud storage is associated with the challenges of the
potential loss, theft or misuse of the data as the server administrator cannot
be completely trusted as well as there is no guarantee that the security of the
server will not be breached. In this paper, we provide a model for secure
sharing and computation on genomic data in a semi-honest third party cloud
server. The security of the shared data is guaranteed through encryption while
making the overall computation fast and scalable enough for real-life
large-scale biomedical applications. We evaluated the efficiency of our
proposed model on a database of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) sequences
and experimental results demonstrate that a query of 50 SNPs in a database of
50000 records, where each record contains 300 SNPs, takes approximately 6
seconds.

 <dc:description>  A new development of smart-home systems is to use mobile apps to control IoT
devices across a Home Area Network (HAN). Those systems tend to rely on the
Wi-Fi router to authenticate other devices; as verified in our study, IoT
vendors tend to trust all devices connected to the HAN. This treatment exposes
them to the attack from malicious apps, particularly those running on
authorized phones, which the router does not have information to control, as
confirmed in our measurement study. Mitigating this threat cannot solely rely
on IoT manufacturers, which may need to change the hardware on the devices to
support encryption, increasing the cost of the device, or software developers
who we need to trust to implement security correctly.
  In this work, we present a new technique to control the communication between
the IoT devices and their apps in a unified, backward-compatible way. Our
approach, called Hanguard, does not require any changes to the IoT devices
themselves, the IoT apps or the OS of the participating phones. Hanguard
achieves a fine-grained, per-app protection through bridging the OS-level
situation awareness and the router-level per-flow control: each phone runs a
non-system userspace Monitor app to identify the party that attempts to access
the protected IoT device and inform the router through a control plane of its
access decision; the router enforces the decision on the data plane after
verifying whether the phone should be allowed to talk to the device. Hanguard
uses a role-based access control (RBAC) schema which leverages type enforcement
(TE) and multi-category security (MCS) primitives to define highly flexible
access control rules. We implemented our design over both Android and iOS (&gt;95%
of mobile OS market share) and a popular router. Our study shows that Hanguard
is both efficient and effective in practice.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed an increasing popularity of algorithm design for
distributed data, largely due to the fact that massive datasets are often
collected and stored in different locations. In the distributed setting
communication typically dominates the query processing time. Thus it becomes
crucial to design communication efficient algorithms for queries on distributed
data. Simultaneously, it has been widely recognized that partial optimizations,
where we are allowed to disregard a small part of the data, provide us
significantly better solutions. The motivation for disregarded points often
arise from noise and other phenomena that are pervasive in large data
scenarios.
  In this paper we focus on partial clustering problems, $k$-center, $k$-median
and $k$-means, in the distributed model, and provide algorithms with
communication sublinear of the input size. As a consequence we develop the
first algorithms for the partial $k$-median and means objectives that run in
subquadratic running time. We also initiate the study of distributed algorithms
for clustering uncertain data, where each data point can possibly fall into
multiple locations under certain probability distribution.

 <dc:description>  In an $\mathsf{L}$-embedding of a graph, each vertex is represented by an
$\mathsf{L}$-segment, and two segments intersect each other if and only if the
corresponding vertices are adjacent in the graph. If the corner of each
$\mathsf{L}$-segment in an $\mathsf{L}$-embedding lies on a straight line, we
call it a monotone $\mathsf{L}$-embedding. In this paper we give a full
characterization of monotone $\mathsf{L}$-embeddings by introducing a new class
of graphs which we call &quot;non-jumping&quot; graphs. We show that a graph admits a
monotone $\mathsf{L}$-embedding if and only if the graph is a non-jumping
graph. Further, we show that outerplanar graphs, convex bipartite graphs,
interval graphs, 3-leaf power graphs, and complete graphs are subclasses of
non-jumping graphs. Finally, we show that distance-hereditary graphs and
$k$-leaf power graphs ($k\le 4$) admit $\mathsf{L}$-embeddings.

 <dc:description>  Coded caching scheme, which is an effective technique to increase the
transmission efficiency during peak traffic times, has recently become quite
popular among the coding community. Generally rate can be measured to the
transmission in the peak traffic times, i.e., this efficiency increases with
the decreasing of rate. In order to implement a coded caching scheme, each file
in the library must be split in a certain number of packets. And this number
directly reflects the complexity of a coded caching scheme, i.e., the
complexity increases with the increasing of the packet number. However there
exists a tradeoff between the rate and packet number. So it is meaningful to
characterize this tradeoff and design the related Pareto-optimal coded caching
schemes with respect to both parameters.
  Recently, a new concept called placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed to
characterize the coded caching scheme. However as far as we know no one has yet
proved that one of the previously known PDAs is Pareto-optimal. In this paper,
we first derive two lower bounds on the rate under the framework of PDA.
Consequently, the PDA proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen is Pareto-optimal, and
a tradeoff between rate and packet number is obtained for some parameters.
Then, from the above observations and the view point of combinatorial design,
two new classes of Pareto-optimal PDAs are obtained. Based on these PDAs, the
schemes with low rate and packet number are obtained. Finally the performance
of some previously known PDAs are estimated by comparing with these two classes
of schemes.

 <dc:description>  Histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps is an important
principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of
surveillance for patients. This characterization is time-intensive, requires
years of specialized training, and suffers from significant inter-observer and
intra-observer variability. In this work, we built an automatic
image-understanding method that can accurately classify different types of
colorectal polyps in whole-slide histology images to help pathologists with
histopathological characterization and diagnosis of colorectal polyps. The
proposed image-understanding method is based on deep-learning techniques, which
rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and have shown
state-of-the-art results for various image analysis tasks. Our
image-understanding method covers all five polyp types (hyperplastic polyp,
sessile serrated polyp, traditional serrated adenoma, tubular adenoma, and
tubulovillous/villous adenoma) that are included in the US multi-society task
force guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment and surveillance, and
encompasses the most common occurrences of colorectal polyps. Our evaluation on
239 independent test samples shows our proposed method can identify the types
of colorectal polyps in whole-slide images with a high efficacy (accuracy:
93.0%, precision: 89.7%, recall: 88.3%, F1 score: 88.8%). The presented method
in this paper can reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their
accuracy and efficiency in histopathological characterization of colorectal
polyps, and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations.

 <dc:title>An Unsupervised Approach for Discovering Relevant Tutorial Fragments for

 <dc:description>  Developers increasingly rely on API tutorials to facilitate software
development. However, it remains a challenging task for them to discover
relevant API tutorial fragments explaining unfamiliar APIs. Existing supervised
approaches suffer from the heavy burden of manually preparing corpus-specific
annotated data and features. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised
approach, namely Fragment Recommender for APIs with PageRank and Topic model
(FRAPT). FRAPT can well address two main challenges lying in the task and
effectively determine relevant tutorial fragments for APIs. In FRAPT, a
Fragment Parser is proposed to identify APIs in tutorial fragments and replace
ambiguous pronouns and variables with related ontologies and API names, so as
to address the pronoun and variable resolution challenge. Then, a Fragment
Filter employs a set of nonexplanatory detection rules to remove
non-explanatory fragments, thus address the non-explanatory fragment
identification challenge. Finally, two correlation scores are achieved and
aggregated to determine relevant fragments for APIs, by applying both topic
model and PageRank algorithm to the retained fragments. Extensive experiments
over two publicly open tutorial corpora show that, FRAPT improves the
state-of-the-art approach by 8.77% and 12.32% respectively in terms of
F-Measure. The effectiveness of key components of FRAPT is also validated.

 <dc:description>  Developers prefer to utilize third-party libraries when they implement some
functionalities and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are frequently
used by them. Facing an unfamiliar API, developers tend to consult tutorials as
learning resources. Unfortunately, the segments explaining a specific API
scatter across tutorials. Hence, it remains a challenging issue to find the
relevant segments. In this study, we propose a more accurate model to find the
exact tutorial fragments explaining APIs. This new model consists of a text
classifier with domain specific features. More specifically, we discover two
important indicators to complement traditional text based features, namely
co-occurrence APIs and knowledge based API extensions. In addition, we
incorporate Word2Vec, a semantic similarity metric to enhance the new model.
Extensive experiments over two publicly available tutorial datasets show that
our new model could find up to 90% fragments explaining APIs and improve the
state-of-the-art model by up to 30% in terms of F-measure.

algorithms. Specifically, we present a declarative language for modeling both
traditional supervised classification tasks and many SSL heuristics, including
both well-known heuristics such as co-training and novel domain-specific
heuristics. In addition to representing individual SSL heuristics, we show that
multiple heuristics can be automatically combined using Bayesian optimization
methods. We experiment with two classes of tasks, link-based text
classification and relation extraction. We show modest improvements on
well-studied link-based classification benchmarks, and state-of-the-art results
on relation-extraction tasks for two realistic domains.

networks (GANs), the proposed GAN learns to generate image background and
foregrounds separately and recursively, and stitch the foregrounds on the
background in a contextually relevant manner to produce a complete natural
image. For each foreground, the model learns to generate its appearance, shape
and pose. The whole model is unsupervised, and is trained in an end-to-end
manner with gradient descent methods. The experiments demonstrate that LR-GAN
can generate more natural images with objects that are more human recognizable
than DCGAN.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a practical receiver for multicarrier signals
subjected to a strong memoryless nonlinearity. The receiver design is based on
a generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) framework, and this allows
real-time algorithm implementation in software or hardware with moderate
complexity. We demonstrate that the proposed receiver can provide more than a
2dB gain compared with an ideal uncoded linear OFDM transmission at a BER range
$10^{-4}\div10^{-6}$ in the AWGN channel, when the OFDM signal is subjected to
clipping nonlinearity and the crest-factor of the clipped waveform is only
1.9dB. Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed receiver provides
significant performance gain in frequency-selective multipath channels

 <dc:description>  Liquids are an important part of many common manipulation tasks in human
environments. If we wish to have robots that can accomplish these types of
tasks, they must be able to interact with liquids in an intelligent manner. In
this paper, we investigate ways for robots to perceive and reason about
liquids. That is, a robot asks the questions What in the visual data stream is
liquid? and How can I use that to infer all the potential places where liquid
might be? We collected two datasets to evaluate these questions, one using a
realistic liquid simulator and another on our robot. We used fully
convolutional neural networks to learn to detect and track liquids across
pouring sequences. Our results show that these networks are able to perceive
and reason about liquids, and that integrating temporal information is
important to performing such tasks well.

 <dc:description>  The Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a bio-electrochemical transducer converting
waste products into electricity using microbial communities. Cellular Automaton
(CA) is a uniform array of finite-state machines that update their states in
discrete time depending on states of their closest neighbors by the same rule.
Arrays of MFCs could, in principle, act as massive-parallel computing devices
with local connectivity between elementary processors. We provide a theoretical
design of such a parallel processor by implementing CA in MFCs. We have chosen
Conway's Game of Life as the 'benchmark' CA because this is the most popular CA
which also exhibits an enormously rich spectrum of patterns. Each cell of the
Game of Life CA is realized using two MFCs. The MFCs are linked electrically
and hydraulically. The model is verified via simulation of an electrical
circuit demonstrating equivalent behaviors. The design is a first step towards
future implementations of fully autonomous biological computing devices with
massive parallelism. The energy independence of such devices counteracts their
somewhat slow transitions - compared to silicon circuitry - between the
different states during computation.

 <dc:title>A Unified Bellman Equation for Causal Information and Value in Markov

 <dc:description>  The interaction between an artificial agent and its environment is
bi-directional. The agent extracts relevant information from the environment,
and affects the environment by its actions in return to accumulate high
expected reward. Standard reinforcement learning (RL) deals with the expected
reward maximization. However, there are always information-theoretic
limitations that restrict the expected reward, which are not properly
considered by the standard RL. In this work we consider RL objectives with
information-theoretic limitations. For the first time we derive a Bellman-type
recursive equa- tion for the causal information between the environment and the
agent, which is combined plausibly with the Bellman recursion for the value
function. The unified equitation serves to explore the typical behavior of
artificial agents in an infinite time horizon.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the asymptotic rates of length-$n$ binary codes with
VC-dimension at most $dn$ and minimum distance at least $\delta n$. Two upper
bounds are obtained, one as a simple corollary of a result by Haussler and the
other via a shortening approach combining Sauer-Shelah lemma and the linear
programming bound. Two lower bounds are given using Gilbert-Varshamov type
arguments over constant-weight and Markov-type sets.

 <dc:description>  The hyperbolic Pascal triangle ${\cal HPT}_{4,q}$ $(q\ge5)$ is a new
mathematical construction, which is a geometrical generalization of Pascal's
arithmetical triangle. In the present study we show that a natural pattern of
rows of ${\cal HPT}_{4,5}$ is almost the same as the sequence consisting of
every second term of the well-known Fibonacci words. Further, we give a
generalization of the Fibonacci words using the hyperbolic Pascal triangles.
The geometrical properties of a ${\cal HPT}_{4,q}$ imply a graph structure
between the finite Fibonacci words.

 <dc:description>  We present a new random sampling strategy for k-bandlimited signals defined
on graphs, based on determinantal point processes (DPP). For small graphs, ie,
in cases where the spectrum of the graph is accessible, we exhibit a DPP
sampling scheme that enables perfect recovery of bandlimited signals. For large
graphs, ie, in cases where the graph's spectrum is not accessible, we
investigate, both theoretically and empirically, a sub-optimal but much faster
DPP based on loop-erased random walks on the graph. Preliminary experiments
show promising results especially in cases where the number of measurements
should stay as small as possible and for graphs that have a strong community
structure. Our sampling scheme is efficient and can be applied to graphs with
up to $10^6$ nodes.

 <dc:title>Face Alignment with Cascaded Semi-Parametric Deep Greedy Neural Forests</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Face alignment is an active topic in computer vision, consisting in aligning
a shape model on the face. To this end, most modern approaches refine the shape
in a cascaded manner, starting from an initial guess. Those shape updates can
either be applied in the feature point space (\textit{i.e.} explicit updates)
or in a low-dimensional, parametric space. In this paper, we propose a
semi-parametric cascade that first aligns a parametric shape, then captures
more fine-grained deformations of an explicit shape. For the purpose of
learning shape updates at each cascade stage, we introduce a deep greedy neural
forest (GNF) model, which is an improved version of deep neural forest (NF).
GNF appears as an ideal regressor for face alignment, as it combines
differentiability, high expressivity and fast evaluation runtime. The proposed
framework is very fast and achieves high accuracies on multiple challenging
benchmarks, including small, medium and large pose experiments.

 <dc:description>  Routing games are one of the most successful domains of application of game
theory. It is well understood that simple dynamics converge to equilibria,
whose performance is nearly optimal regardless of the size of the network or
the number of agents. These strong theoretical assertions prompt a natural
question: How well do these pen-and-paper calculations agree with the reality
of everyday traffic routing? We focus on a semantically rich dataset from
Singapore's National Science Experiment that captures detailed information
about the daily behavior of thousands of Singaporean students. Using this
dataset, we can identify the routes as well as the modes of transportation used
by the students, e.g. car (driving or being driven to school) versus bus or
metro, estimate source and sink destinations (home-school) and trip duration,
as well as their mode-dependent available routes. We quantify both the system
and individual optimality. Our estimate of the Empirical Price of Anarchy lies
between 1.11 and 1.22. Individually, the typical behavior is consistent from
day to day and nearly optimal, with low regret for not deviating to alternative
paths.

 <dc:description>  The &quot;reproducibility crisis&quot; has been a highly visible source of scientific
controversy and dispute. Here, I propose and review several avenues for
identifying and prioritizing research studies for the purpose of targeted
validation. Of the various proposals discussed, I identify scientific data
science as being a strategy that merits greater attention among those
interested in reproducibility. I argue that the tremendous potential of
scientific data science for uncovering high-value research studies is a
significant and rarely discussed benefit of the transition to a fully
open-access publishing model.

 <dc:description>  We consider a wireless sensor network that uses inductive near-field coupling
for wireless powering or communication, or for both. The severely limited range
of an inductively coupled source-destination pair can be improved using
resonant relay devices, which are purely passive in nature. Utilization of such
magneto-inductive relays has only been studied for regular network topologies,
allowing simplified assumptions on the mutual antenna couplings. In this work
we present an analysis of magneto-inductive passive relaying in arbitrarily
arranged networks. We find that the resulting channel has characteristics
similar to multipath fading: the channel power gain is governed by a
non-coherent sum of phasors, resulting in increased frequency selectivity. We
propose and study two strategies to increase the channel power gain of random
relay networks: i) deactivation of individual relays by open-circuit switching
and ii) frequency tuning. The presented results show that both methods improve
the utilization of available passive relays, leading to reliable and
significant performance gains.

 <dc:description>  Current face alignment algorithms can robustly find a set of landmarks along
face contour. However, the landmarks are sparse and lack curve details,
especially in chin and cheek areas where a lot of concave-convex bending
information exists. In this paper, we propose a local to global seam cutting
and integrating algorithm (L2GSCI) to extract continuous and accurate face
contour. Our method works in three steps with the help of a rough initial
curve. First, we sample small and overlapped squares along the initial curve.
Second, the seam cutting part of L2GSCI extracts a local seam in each square
region. Finally, the seam integrating part of L2GSCI connects all the redundant
seams together to form a continuous and complete face curve. Overall, the
proposed method is much more straightforward than existing face alignment
algorithms, but can achieve pixel-level continuous face curves rather than
discrete and sparse landmarks. Moreover, experiments on two face benchmark
datasets (i.e., LFPW and HELEN) show that our method can precisely reveal
concave-convex bending details of face contours, which has significantly
improved the performance when compared with the state-ofthe- art face alignment
approaches.

 <dc:description>  When learning a mapping from an input space to an output space, the
assumption that the sample distribution of the training data is the same as
that of the test data is often violated. Unsupervised domain shift methods
adapt the learned function in order to correct for this shift. Previous work
has focused on utilizing unlabeled samples from the target distribution. We
consider the complementary problem in which the unlabeled samples are given
post mapping, i.e., we are given the outputs of the mapping of unknown samples
from the shifted domain. Two other variants are also studied: the two sided
version, in which unlabeled samples are give from both the input and the output
spaces, and the Domain Transfer problem, which was recently formalized. In all
cases, we derive generalization bounds that employ discrepancy terms.

 <dc:description>  We study combinatorial multi-armed bandit with probabilistically triggered
arms (CMAB-T) and semi-bandit feedback. We resolve a serious issue in the prior
CMAB-T studies where the regret bounds contain a possibly exponentially large
factor of 1/p*, where p* is the minimum positive probability that an arm is
triggered by any action. We address this issue by introducing a triggering
probability modulated (TPM) bounded smoothness condition into the general
CMAB-T framework, and show that many applications such as influence
maximization bandit and combinatorial cascading bandit satisfy this TPM
condition. As a result, we completely remove the factor of $1/p^*$ from the
regret bounds, achieving significantly better regret bounds for influence
maximization and cascading bandits than before. Finally, we provide lower bound
results showing that the factor 1/p* is unavoidable for general CMAB-T
problems, suggesting that the TPM condition is crucial in removing this factor.

 <dc:description>  This tutorial introduces a new and powerful set of techniques variously
called &quot;neural machine translation&quot; or &quot;neural sequence-to-sequence models&quot;.
These techniques have been used in a number of tasks regarding the handling of
human language, and can be a powerful tool in the toolbox of anyone who wants
to model sequential data of some sort. The tutorial assumes that the reader
knows the basics of math and programming, but does not assume any particular
experience with neural networks or natural language processing. It attempts to
explain the intuition behind the various methods covered, then delves into them
with enough mathematical detail to understand them concretely, and culiminates
with a suggestion for an implementation exercise, where readers can test that
they understood the content in practice.

 <dc:description>  Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a common type of cancer of the oral
epithelium. Despite their high impact on mortality, sufficient screening
methods for early diagnosis of OSCC often lack accuracy and thus OSCCs are
mostly diagnosed at a late stage. Early detection and accurate outline
estimation of OSCCs would lead to a better curative outcome and an reduction in
recurrence rates after surgical treatment.
  Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) records sub-surface micro-anatomical
images for in vivo cell structure analysis. Recent CLE studies showed great
prospects for a reliable, real-time ultrastructural imaging of OSCC in situ.
  We present and evaluate a novel automatic approach for a highly accurate OSCC
diagnosis using deep learning technologies on CLE images. The method is
compared against textural feature-based machine learning approaches that
represent the current state of the art.
  For this work, CLE image sequences (7894 images) from patients diagnosed with
OSCC were obtained from 4 specific locations in the oral cavity, including the
OSCC lesion. The present approach is found to outperform the state of the art
in CLE image recognition with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 and a mean
accuracy of 88.3% (sensitivity 86.6%, specificity 90%).

 <dc:description>  We derive the first performance guarantees for a combinatorial online
algorithm that schedules stochastic, non-preemptive jobs on unrelated machines
to minimize the expectation of the total weighted completion time. Prior work
on unrelated machine scheduling with stochastic jobs was restricted to the
offline case, and required sophisticated linear or convex programming
relaxations for the assignment of jobs to machines. Our algorithm is purely
combinatorial, and therefore it also works for the online setting. As to the
techniques applied, this paper shows how the dual fitting technique can be put
to work for stochastic and non-preemptive scheduling problems.

 <dc:description>  In recent years it has become popular to study dynamic problems in a
sensitivity setting: Instead of allowing for an arbitrary sequence of updates,
the sensitivity model only allows to apply batch updates of small size to the
original input data. The sensitivity model is particularly appealing since
recent strong conditional lower bounds ruled out fast algorithms for many
dynamic problems, such as shortest paths, reachability, or subgraph
connectivity.
  In this paper we prove conditional lower bounds for sensitivity problems. For
example, we show that under the Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) conjecture
combinatorial algorithms cannot compute the (4/3 - {\epsilon})-approximate
diameter of an undirected unweighted dense graph with truly subcubic
preprocessing time and truly subquadratic update/query time. This result is
surprising since in the static setting it is not clear whether a reduction from
BMM to diameter is possible. We further show under the BMM conjecture that many
problems, such as reachability or approximate shortest paths, cannot be solved
faster than by recomputation from scratch even after only one or two edge
insertions. We give more lower bounds under the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis and the All Pairs Shortest Paths Conjecture. Many of our lower
bounds also hold for static oracle data structures where no sensitivity is
required. Finally, we give the first algorithm for the (1 +
{\epsilon})-approximate radius, diameter, and eccentricity problems in directed
or undirected unweighted graphs in case of single edges failures. The algorithm
has a truly subcubic running time for graphs with a truly subquadratic number
of edges; it is tight w.r.t. the conditional lower bounds we obtain.

 <dc:title>Approximation algorithms for TSP with neighborhoods in the plane</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the Euclidean TSP with neighborhoods (TSPN), we are given a collection of
n regions (neighborhoods) and we seek a shortest tour that visits each region.
As a generalization of the classical Euclidean TSP, TSPN is also NP-hard. In
this paper, we present new approximation results for the TSPN, including (1) a
constant-factor approximation algorithm for the case of arbitrary connected
neighborhoods having comparable diameters; and (2) a PTAS for the important
special case of disjoint unit disk neighborhoods (or nearly disjoint,
nearly-unit disks). Our methods also yield improved approximation ratios for
various special classes of neighborhoods, which have previously been studied.
Further, we give a linear-time O(1)-approximation algorithm for the case of
neighborhoods that are (infinite) straight lines.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel framework that reduces the management and integration
overheads for real-time network flows by leveraging the capabilities
(especially global visibility and management) of software-defined networking
(SDN) architectures. Given the specifications of flows that must meet hard
real-time requirements, our framework synthesizes paths through the network and
associated switch configurations - to guarantee that these flows meet their
end-to-end timing requirements. In doing so, our framework makes SDN
architectures &quot;delay-aware&quot; - remember that SDN is otherwise not able to reason
about delays. Hence, it is easier to use such architectures in safety-critical
and other latency-sensitive applications. We demonstrate our principles as well
as the feasibility of our approach using both - exhaustive simulations as well
as experiments using real hardware switches.

artifacts from two points of view: Effectiveness and Affectiveness. The first
attribute is meant to analyze the productivity of the Open Source Communities
by measuring the time required to resolve an issue, while the latter provides a
novel approach for studying the development process by analyzing the
affectiveness ex-pressed by developers in their comments posted during the
issue resolution phase. Affectivenes is obtained by measuring Sentiment,

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) non-orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (NOFDM) scheme for visible light communications
(VLC) where the multiplexing/demultiplexing employs the inverse fractional
cosine transform (IFrCT)/FrCT. Different to the common fractional Fourier
transform-based NOFDM (FrFT-NOFDM) signal, FrCT-based NOFDM (FrCT-NOFDM) signal
is real-valued which can be directly applied to the VLC systems without the
expensive upconversion. Thus, FrCT-NOFDM is more suitable for the
cost-sensitive VLC systems. Meanwhile, under the same transmission rate,
FrCT-NOFDM signal occupies smaller bandwidth compared to OFDM signal. When the
bandwidth compression factor $\alpha$ is set to $0.8$, $20\%$ bandwidth saving
can be obtained. Therefore, FrCT-NOFDM has higher spectral efficiency and
suffers less high-frequency distortion compared to OFDM, which benefits the
bandwidth-limited VLC systems. As the simulation results show, bit error rate
(BER) performance of FrCT-NOFDM with $\alpha$ of $0.9$ or $0.8$ is better than
that of OFDM. Moreover, FrCT-NOFDM has a superior security performance. In
conclusion, FrCT-NOFDM shows great potential for application in the future VLC
systems.

 <dc:title>A PTAS for TSP with Neighborhoods Among Fat Regions in the Plane</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mitchell, Joseph S. B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Euclidean TSP with neighborhoods (TSPN) problem seeks a shortest tour
that visits a given collection of $n$ regions ({\em neighborhoods}). We present
the first polynomial-time approximation scheme for TSPN for a set of regions
given by arbitrary disjoint fat regions in the plane. This improves
substantially upon the known approximation algorithms, and is the first PTAS
for TSPN on regions of non-comparable sizes. Our result is based on a novel
extension of the $m$-guillotine method. The result applies to regions that are
&quot;fat&quot; in a very weak sense: each region $P_i$ has area $\Omega([diam(P_i)]^2)$,
but is otherwise arbitrary.

 <dc:description>  We study fair allocation of indivisible goods to agents with unequal
entitlements. Fair allocation has been the subject of many studies in both
divisible and indivisible settings. Our emphasis is on the case where the goods
are indivisible and agents have unequal entitlements. This problem is a
generalization of the work by Procaccia and Wang wherein the agents are assumed
to be symmetric with respect to their entitlements. Although Procaccia and Wang
show an almost fair (constant approximation) allocation exists in their
setting, our main result is in sharp contrast to their observation. We show
that, in some cases with $n$ agents, no allocation can guarantee better than
$1/n$ approximation of a fair allocation when the entitlements are not
necessarily equal. Furthermore, we devise a simple algorithm that ensures a
$1/n$ approximation guarantee. Our second result is for a restricted version of
the problem where the valuation of every agent for each good is bounded by the
total value he wishes to receive in a fair allocation. Although this assumption
might seem w.l.o.g, we show it enables us to find a $1/2$ approximation fair
allocation via a greedy algorithm. Finally, we run some experiments on
real-world data and show that, in practice, a fair allocation is likely to
exist. We also support our experiments by showing positive results for two
stochastic variants of the problem, namely stochastic agents and stochastic
items.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  ADROIT Manipulation platform is a pneumatically actuated, tendon driven 28
degree of freedom platform being developed for investigating complex hand
manipulation behaviors. ADROIT derives its unique capabilities, necessary to
support dynamic and dexterous manipulation, from a custom designed
high-performance pneumatic actuation system for tendon-driven hands. The custom
pneumatic actuation system is fast, strong, low friction-stiction, compliant
and is capable of actuating a shadow hand skeleton faster that human
capabilities -- at a unique combination of speed, force, and compliance that
has never been achieved before. In this paper, we develop models for the
pneumatic muscles of ADROIT and perform a thorough investigation of the various
parameters that affect pressure dynamics in a pneumatic system such as,
different cylinder types, leakage from valves and cylinders, valve deadzone,
input pressure fluctuations etc to improve the model's accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Simulators are powerful tools for reasoning about a robot's interactions with
its environment. However, when simulations diverge from reality, that reasoning
becomes less useful. In this paper, we show how to close the loop between
liquid simulation and real-time perception. We use observations of liquids to
correct errors when tracking the liquid's state in a simulator. Our results
show that closed-loop simulation is an effective way to prevent large
divergence between the simulated and real liquid states. As a direct
consequence of this, our method can enable reasoning about liquids that would
otherwise be infeasible due to large divergences, such as reasoning about
occluded liquid.

 <dc:description>  The paper evaluates the influence of the maximum vehicle acceleration and
variable proportions of ACC/CACC vehicles on the throughput of an intersection.
Two cases are studied: (1) free road downstream of the intersection; and (2)
red light at some distance downstream of the intersection. Simulation of a
4-mile stretch of an arterial with 13 signalized intersections is used to
evaluate the impact of (C)ACC vehicles on the mean and standard deviation of
travel time as the proportion of (C)ACC vehicles is increased. The results
suggest a very high urban mobility benefit of (C)ACC vehicles at little or no
cost in infrastructure.

 <dc:description>  Recent robotic manipulation competitions have highlighted that sophisticated
robots still struggle to achieve fast and reliable perception of task-relevant
objects in complex, realistic scenarios. To improve these systems' perceptive
speed and robustness, we present SegICP, a novel integrated solution to object
recognition and pose estimation. SegICP couples convolutional neural networks
and multi-hypothesis point cloud registration to achieve both robust pixel-wise
semantic segmentation as well as accurate and real-time 6-DOF pose estimation
for relevant objects. Our architecture achieves 1cm position error and
&lt;5^\circ$ angle error in real time without an initial seed. We evaluate and

 <dc:description>  Recent progresses on deep discriminative and generative modeling have shown
promising results on texture synthesis. However, existing feed-forward based
methods trade off generality for efficiency, which suffer from many issues,
such as shortage of generality (i.e., build one network per texture), lack of
diversity (i.e., always produce visually identical output) and suboptimality
(i.e., generate less satisfying visual effects). In this work, we focus on
solving these issues for improved texture synthesis. We propose a deep
generative feed-forward network which enables efficient synthesis of multiple
textures within one single network and meaningful interpolation between them.
Meanwhile, a suite of important techniques are introduced to achieve better
convergence and diversity. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and techniques for synthesizing a large
number of textures and show its applications with the stylization.

 <dc:description>  First-order iterative optimization methods play a fundamental role in large
scale optimization and machine learning. This paper presents control
interpretations for such optimization methods. First, we give loop-shaping
interpretations for several existing optimization methods and show that they
are composed of basic control elements such as PID and lag compensators. Next,
we apply the small gain theorem to draw a connection between the convergence
rate analysis of optimization methods and the input-output gain computations of
certain complementary sensitivity functions. These connections suggest that
standard classical control synthesis tools may be brought to bear on the design
of optimization algorithms.

 <dc:description>  As statistical classifiers become integrated into real-world applications, it
is important to consider not only their accuracy but also their robustness to
changes in the data distribution. In this paper, we consider the case where
there is an unobserved confounding variable $z$ that influences both the
features $\mathbf{x}$ and the class variable $y$. When the influence of $z$
changes from training to testing data, we find that the classifier accuracy can
degrade rapidly. In our approach, we assume that we can predict the value of
$z$ at training time with some error. The prediction for $z$ is then fed to
Pearl's back-door adjustment to build our model. Because of the attenuation
bias caused by measurement error in $z$, standard approaches to controlling for
$z$ are ineffective. In response, we propose a method to properly control for
the influence of $z$ by first estimating its relationship with the class
variable $y$, then updating predictions for $z$ to match that estimated
relationship. By adjusting the influence of $z$, we show that we can build a
model that exceeds competing baselines on accuracy as well as on robustness
over a range of confounding relationships.

 <dc:description>  Alice holds an r.v. $X$, and Bob is trying to guess its value by asking
questions of the form &quot;is $X=x$?&quot;. Alice answers truthfully and the game
terminates once Bob guesses correctly. Before the game begins, Bob is allowed
to reach out to an oracle, Carole, and ask her any yes/no question, i.e., a
question of the form &quot;is $X\in A$?&quot;. Carole is known to lie with a given
probability $0\leq p\leq 1/2$. What should Bob ask Carole if he would like to
minimize his expected guessing time? When Carole is truthful ($p=0$), it is
easy to show that Bob should order the symbol probabilities in descending
order, and ask Carole whether the index of $X$ w.r.t. this order is even or
odd. We show that this strategy is almost optimal for any lying probability
$p$, up to a small additive constant upper bounded by a $1/4$. We discuss a
connection to the cutoff rate of the BSC with feedback.

 <dc:description>  Network resource allocation shows revived popularity in the era of data
deluge and information explosion. Existing stochastic optimization approaches
fall short in attaining a desirable cost-delay tradeoff. Recognizing the
central role of Lagrange multipliers in network resource allocation, a novel
learn-and-adapt stochastic dual gradient (LA-SDG) method is developed in this
paper to learn the sample-optimal Lagrange multiplier from historical data, and
accordingly adapt the upcoming resource allocation strategy. Remarkably, LA-SDG
only requires just an extra sample (gradient) evaluation relative to the
celebrated stochastic dual gradient (SDG) method. LA-SDG can be interpreted as
a foresighted learning scheme with an eye on the future, or, a modified
heavy-ball iteration from an optimization viewpoint. It is established - both
theoretically and empirically - that LA-SDG markedly improves the cost-delay
tradeoff over state-of-the-art allocation schemes.

 <dc:title>Data-Dependent Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We establish a data-dependent notion of algorithmic stability for Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD), and employ it to develop novel generalization bounds.
This is in contrast to previous distribution-free algorithmic stability results
for SGD which depend on the worst-case constants. By virtue of the
data-dependent argument, our bounds provide new insights into learning with SGD
on convex and non-convex problems. In the convex case, we show that the bound
on the generalization error is multiplicative in the risk at the initialization
point. In the non-convex case, we prove that the expected curvature of the
objective function around the initialization point has crucial influence on the
generalization error. In both cases, our results suggest a simple data-driven
strategy to stabilize SGD by pre-screening its initialization. As a corollary,
our results allow us to show optimistic generalization bounds that exhibit fast
convergence rates for SGD subject to a vanishing empirical risk.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online-learning research has mainly been focusing on minimizing one objective
function. In many real-world applications, however, several objective functions
have to be considered simultaneously. Recently, an algorithm for dealing with
several objective functions in the i.i.d. case has been presented. In this
paper, we extend the multi-objective framework to the case of stationary and
ergodic processes, thus allowing dependencies among observations. We first
identify an asymptomatic lower bound for any prediction strategy and then
present an algorithm whose predictions achieve the optimal solution while
fulfilling any continuous and convex constraining criterion.

 <dc:description>  AI applications have emerged in current world. Among AI applications,
computer-vision (CV) related applications have attracted high interest.
Hardware implementation of CV processors necessitates a high performance but
low-power image detector. The key to energy-efficiency work lies in
analog-digital converting, where output of imaging detectors is transferred to
digital domain and CV algorithms can be performed on data. In this paper,
analog-digital converter architectures are compared, and an example ADC design
is proposed which achieves both good performance and low power consumption.

 <dc:description>  We study the minimum diameter spanning tree problem under the reload cost
model (DIAMETER-TREE for short) introduced by Wirth and Steffan (2001). In this
problem, given an undirected edge-colored graph $G$, reload costs on a path
arise at a node where the path uses consecutive edges of different colors. The
objective is to find a spanning tree of $G$ of minimum diameter with respect to
the reload costs. We initiate a systematic study of the parameterized
complexity of the DIAMETER-TREE problem by considering the following
parameters: the cost of a solution, and the treewidth and the maximum degree
$\Delta$ of the input graph. We prove that DIAMETER-TREE is para-NP-hard for
any combination of two of these three parameters, and that it is FPT
parameterized by the three of them. We also prove that the problem can be
solved in polynomial time on cactus graphs. This result is somehow surprising
since we prove DIAMETER-TREE to be NP-hard on graphs of treewidth two, which is
best possible as the problem can be trivially solved on forests. When the
reload costs satisfy the triangle inequality, Wirth and Steffan (2001) proved
that the problem can be solved in polynomial time on graphs with $\Delta = 3$,
and Galbiati (2008) proved that it is NP-hard if $\Delta = 4$. Our results
show, in particular, that without the requirement of the triangle inequality,
the problem is NP-hard if $\Delta = 3$, which is also best possible. Finally,
in the case where the reload costs are polynomially bounded by the size of the
input graph, we prove that DIAMETER-TREE is in XP and W[1]-hard parameterized
by the treewidth plus $\Delta$.

 <dc:description>  JavaScript systems are becoming increasingly complex and large. To tackle the
challenges involved in implementing these systems, the language is evolving to
include several constructions for programming- in-the-large. For example,
although the language is prototype-based, the latest JavaScript standard, named
ECMAScript 6 (ES6), provides native support for implementing classes. Even
though most modern web browsers support ES6, only a very few applications use
the class syntax. In this paper, we analyze the process of migrating structures
that emulate classes in legacy JavaScript code to adopt the new syntax for
classes introduced by ES6. We apply a set of migration rules on eight legacy
JavaScript systems. In our study, we document: (a) cases that are
straightforward to migrate (the good parts); (b) cases that require manual and
ad-hoc migration (the bad parts); and (c) cases that cannot be migrated due to
limitations and restrictions of ES6 (the ugly parts). Six out of eight systems
(75%) contain instances of bad and/or ugly cases. We also collect the
perceptions of JavaScript developers about migrating their code to use the new
syntax for classes.

 <dc:description>  We define the emph{visual complexity of a plane graph drawing to be the
number of basic geometric objects needed to represent all its edges. In
particular, one object may represent multiple edges (e.g., one needs only one
line segment to draw two collinear edges of the same vertex). Let $n$ denote
the number of vertices of a graph. We show that trees can be drawn with $3n/4$
straight-line segments on a polynomial grid, and with $n/2$ straight-line
segments on a quasi-polynomial grid. Further, we present an algorithm for
drawing planar 3-trees with $(8n-17)/3$ segments on an $O(n)\times O(n^2)$
grid. This algorithm can also be used with a small modification to draw maximal
outerplanar graphs with $3n/2$ edges on an $O(n)\times O(n^2)$ grid. We also
study the problem of drawing maximal planar graphs with circular arcs and
provide an algorithm to draw such graphs using only $(5n - 11)/3$ arcs. This
provides a significant improvement over the lower bound of $2n$ for line
segments for a nontrivial graph class.

 <dc:title>Word forms - not just their lengths- are optimized for efficient

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The inverse relationship between the length of a word and the frequency of
its use, first identified by G.K. Zipf in 1935, is a classic empirical law that
holds across a wide range of human languages. We demonstrate that length is one
aspect of a much more general property of words: how distinctive they are with
respect to other words in a language. Distinctiveness plays a critical role in
recognizing words in fluent speech, in that it reflects the strength of
potential competitors when selecting the best candidate for an ambiguous
signal. Phonological information content, a measure of a word's string
probability under a statistical model of a language's sound or character
sequences, concisely captures distinctiveness. Examining large-scale corpora
from 13 languages, we find that distinctiveness significantly outperforms word
length as a predictor of frequency. This finding provides evidence that
listeners' processing constraints shape fine-grained aspects of word forms
across languages.

 <dc:description>  Plausible reasoning concerns situations whose inherent lack of precision is
not quantified; that is, there are no degrees or levels of precision, and hence
no use of numbers like probabilities. A hopefully comprehensive set of
principles that clarifies what it means for a formal logic to do plausible
reasoning is presented. A new propositional logic, called Propositional
Plausible Logic (PPL), is defined and applied to some important examples. PPL
is the only non-numeric non-monotonic logic we know of that satisfies all the
principles and correctly reasons with all the examples. Some important results
about PPL are proved.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two visual trackers from the different paradigms of
learning and registration based tracking and evaluates their application in
image based visual servoing. They can track object motion with four degrees of
freedom (DoF) which, as we will show here, is sufficient for many fine
manipulation tasks. One of these trackers is a newly developed learning based
tracker that relies on learning discriminative correlation filters while the
other is a refinement of a recent 8 DoF RANSAC based tracker adapted with a new
appearance model for tracking 4 DoF motion.
  Both trackers are shown to provide superior performance to several state of
the art trackers on an existing dataset for manipulation tasks. Further, a new
dataset with challenging sequences for fine manipulation tasks captured from
robot mounted eye-in-hand (EIH) cameras is also presented. These sequences have
a variety of challenges encountered during real tasks including jittery camera
movement, motion blur, drastic scale changes and partial occlusions.
Quantitative and qualitative results on these sequences are used to show that
these two trackers are robust to failures while providing high precision that
makes them suitable for such fine manipulation tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a three-node cooperative wireless powered
communication system consisting of a multi-antenna hybrid access point (H-AP)
and a single-antenna relay and a single-antenna user. The energy constrained
relay and user first harvest energy in the downlink and then the relay assists
the user using the harvested power for information transmission in the uplink.
The optimal energy beamforming vector and the time split between harvest and
cooperation are investigated. To reduce the computational complexity,
suboptimal designs are also studied, where closed-form expressions are derived
for the energy beamforming vector and the time split. For comparison purposes,
we also present a detailed performance analysis in terms of the achievable
outage probability and the average throughput of an intuitive energy
beamforming scheme, where the H-AP directs all the energy towards the user. The
findings of the paper suggest that implementing multiple antennas at the H-AP
can significantly improve the system performance, and the closed-form
suboptimal energy beamforming vector and time split yields near optimal
performance. Also, for the intuitive beamforming scheme, a diversity order of
(N+1)/2 can be achieved, where N is the number of antennas at the H-AP.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of how to choose good viewpoints for taking
photographs of architectures. We achieve this by learning from professional
photographs of world famous landmarks that are available on the Internet.
Unlike previous efforts devoted to photo quality assessment which mainly rely
on 2D image features, we show in this paper combining 2D image features
extracted from images with 3D geometric features computed on the 3D models can
result in more reliable evaluation of viewpoint quality. Specifically, we
collect a set of photographs for each of 15 world famous architectures as well
as their 3D models from the Internet. Viewpoint recovery for images is carried
out through an image-model registration process, after which a newly proposed
viewpoint clustering strategy is exploited to validate users' viewpoint
preferences when photographing landmarks. Finally, we extract a number of 2D
and 3D features for each image based on multiple visual and geometric cues and
perform viewpoint recommendation by learning from both 2D and 3D features using
a specifically designed SVM-2K multi-view learner, achieving superior
performance over using solely 2D or 3D features. We show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach through extensive experiments. The experiments also
demonstrate that our system can be used to recommend viewpoints for rendering
textured 3D models of buildings for the use of architectural design, in
addition to viewpoint evaluation of photographs and recommendation of
viewpoints for photographing architectures in practice.

 <dc:title>Third-Person Imitation Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to train agents capable of
achiev- ing sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key
difficulty in reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the
agent to optimize. Traditionally, imitation learning in RL has been used to
overcome this problem. Unfortunately, hitherto imitation learning methods tend
to require that demonstra- tions are supplied in the first-person: the agent is
provided with a sequence of states and a specification of the actions that it
should have taken. While powerful, this kind of imitation learning is limited
by the relatively hard problem of collect- ing first-person demonstrations.
Humans address this problem by learning from third-person demonstrations: they
observe other humans perform tasks, infer the task, and accomplish the same
task themselves.
  In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third-person imitation
learn- ing. Here third-person refers to training an agent to correctly achieve
a simple goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a
teacher achieving the same goal but from a different viewpoint; and
unsupervised refers to the fact that the agent receives only these third-person
demonstrations, and is not provided a correspondence between teacher states and
student states. Our methods primary insight is that recent advances from domain
confusion can be utilized to yield domain agnostic features which are crucial
during the training process. To validate our approach, we report successful
experiments on learning from third-person demonstrations in a pointmass domain,
a reacher domain, and inverted pendulum.

 <dc:description>  Information dissemination protocols for ad-hoc wireless networks frequently
use a minimal subset of the available communication links, defining a rooted
&quot;broadcast&quot; tree. In this work, we focus on the core challenge of disseminating
from one layer to the next one of such tree. We call this problem Layer
Dissemination. We study Layer Dissemination under a generalized model of
interference, called affectance. The affectance model subsumes previous models,
such as Radio Network and Signal to Inteference-plus-Noise Ratio. We present
randomized and deterministic protocols for Layer Dissemination. These protocols
are based on a combinatorial object that we call Affectance-selective Families.
Our approach combines an engineering solution with theoretical guarantees. That
is, we provide a method to characterize the network with a global measure of
affectance based on measurements of interference in the specific deployment
area. Then, our protocols distributedly produce an ad-hoc transmissions
schedule for dissemination. In the randomized protocol only the network
characterization is needed, whereas the deterministic protocol requires full
knowledge of affectance. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on
schedule length. We also present simulations of a real network-deployment area
contrasting the performance of our randomized protocol, which takes into
account affectance, against previous work for interference models that ignore
some physical constraints. The striking improvement in performance shown by our
simulations show the importance of utilizing a more physically-accurate model
of interference that takes into account other effects beyond distance to
transmitters.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the impact of the channel state information (CSI) and
antenna correlation at the multi-antenna relay on the performance of wireless
powered dual-hop amplify-and-forward relaying systems. Depending on the
available CSI at the relay, two different scenarios are considered, namely,
instantaneous CSI and statistical CSI where the relay has access only to the
antenna correlation matrix. Adopting the power-splitting architecture, we
present a detailed performance study for both cases. Closed-form analytical
expressions are derived for the outage probability and ergodic capacity. In
addition, simple high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage approximations are
obtained. Our results show that, antenna correlation itself does not affect the
achievable diversity order, the availability of CSI at the relay determines the
achievable diversity order. Full diversity order can be achieved with
instantaneous CSI, while only a diversity order of one can be achieved with
statistical CSI. In addition, the transmit antenna correlation and receive
antenna correlation exhibit different impact on the ergodic capacity. Moreover,
the impact of antenna correlation on the ergodic capacity also depends heavily
on the available CSI and operating SNR.

 <dc:description>  Approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) offers the promise of more rapid
sampling at the cost of more biased inference. Since standard MCMC diagnostics
fail to detect these biases, researchers have developed computable Stein
discrepancy measures that provably determine the convergence of a sample to its
target distribution. This approach was recently combined with the theory of
reproducing kernels to define a closed-form kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD)
computable by summing kernel evaluations across pairs of sample points. We
develop a theory of weak convergence for KSDs based on Stein's method,
demonstrate that commonly used KSDs fail to detect non-convergence even for
Gaussian targets, and show that kernels with slowly decaying tails provably
determine convergence for a large class of target distributions. The resulting
convergence-determining KSDs are suitable for comparing biased, exact, and
deterministic sample sequences and simpler to compute and parallelize than
alternative Stein discrepancies. We use our tools to compare biased samplers,
select sampler hyperparameters, and improve upon existing KSD approaches to
one-sample hypothesis testing and sample quality improvement.

 <dc:description>  To be able to interact better with humans, it is crucial for machines to
understand sound - a primary modality of human perception. Previous works have
used sound to learn embeddings for improved generic textual similarity
assessment. In this work, we treat sound as a first-class citizen, studying
downstream textual tasks which require aural grounding. To this end, we propose
sound-word2vec - a new embedding scheme that learns specialized word embeddings
grounded in sounds. For example, we learn that two seemingly (semantically)
unrelated concepts, like leaves and paper are similar due to the similar
rustling sounds they make. Our embeddings prove useful in textual tasks
requiring aural reasoning like text-based sound retrieval and discovering foley
sound effects (used in movies). Moreover, our embedding space captures
interesting dependencies between words and onomatopoeia and outperforms prior
work on aurally-relevant word relatedness datasets such as AMEN and ASLex.

 <dc:description>  The content of today's social media is becoming more and more rich,
increasingly mixing text, images, videos, and audio. It is an intriguing
research question to model the interplay between these different modes in
attracting user attention and engagement. But in order to pursue this study of
multimodal content, we must also account for context: timing effects, community
preferences, and social factors (e.g., which authors are already popular) also
affect the amount of feedback and reaction that social-media posts receive. In
this work, we separate out the influence of these non-content factors in
several ways. First, we focus on ranking pairs of submissions posted to the
same community in quick succession, e.g., within 30 seconds, this framing
encourages models to focus on time-agnostic and community-specific content
features. Within that setting, we determine the relative performance of author
vs. content features. We find that victory usually belongs to &quot;cats and
captions,&quot; as visual and textual features together tend to outperform
identity-based features. Moreover, our experiments show that when considered in
isolation, simple unigram text features and deep neural network visual features
yield the highest accuracy individually, and that the combination of the two
modalities generally leads to the best accuracies overall.

 <dc:description>  Computation of semantic similarity between concepts is an important
foundation for many research works. This paper focuses on IC computing methods
and IC measures, which estimate the semantic similarities between concepts by
exploiting the topological parameters of the taxonomy. Based on analyzing
representative IC computing methods and typical semantic similarity measures,
we propose a new hybrid IC computing method. Through adopting the parameter
dhyp and lch, we utilize the new IC computing method and propose a novel
comprehensive measure of semantic similarity between concepts. An experiment
based on WordNet &quot;is a&quot; taxonomy has been designed to test representative
measures and our measure on benchmark dataset R&amp;G, and the results show that
our measure can obviously improve the similarity accuracy. We evaluate the
proposed approach by comparing the correlation coefficients between five
measures and the artificial data. The results show that our proposal
outperforms the previous measures.

 <dc:description>  With the need for flexible and on-demand decision support, Dynamic Data
Warehouses (DDW) provide benefits over traditional data warehouses due to their
dynamic characteristics in structuring and access mechanism. A DDW is a data
framework that accommodates data source changes easily to allow seamless
querying to users. Materialized Views (MV) are proven to be an effective
methodology to enhance the process of retrieving data from a DDW as results are
pre-computed and stored in it. However, due to the static nature of
materialized views, the level of dynamicity that can be provided at the MV
access layer is restricted. As a result, the collection of materialized views
is not compatible with ever-changing reporting requirements. It is important
that the MV collection is consistent with current and upcoming queries. The
solution to the above problem must consider the following aspects: (a) MV must
be matched against an OLAP query in order to recognize whether the MV can
answer the query, (b) enable scalability in the MV collection, an intuitive
mechanism to prune it and retrieve closely matching MVs must be incorporated,
(c) MV collection must be able to evolve in correspondence to the regularly
changing user query patterns. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is
to explore these aspects and provide a well-rounded solution for the MV access
layer to remove the mismatch between the MV collection and reporting
requirements. Our contribution to solve the problem includes a Query Matching
Technique, a Domain Matching Technique and Maintenance of the MV collection. We
developed an experimental platform using real data-sets to evaluate the
effectiveness in terms of performance and precision of the proposed techniques.

 <dc:title>Surprise-Based Intrinsic Motivation for Deep Reinforcement Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Exploration in complex domains is a key challenge in reinforcement learning,
especially for tasks with very sparse rewards. Recent successes in deep
reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic
exploration strategies such as $\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian
control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to
make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics:
efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an
agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to
learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy,
and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true
transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations
results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the
$k$-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to
succeed in a wide range of environments with high-dimensional state spaces and
very sparse rewards, including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari
RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques.

 <dc:title>Position-based coding and convex splitting for private communication
  over quantum channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wilde, Mark M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The classical-input quantum-output (cq) wiretap channel is a communication
model involving a classical sender $X$, a legitimate quantum receiver $B$, and
a quantum eavesdropper $E$. The goal of a private communication protocol that
uses such a channel is for the sender $X$ to transmit a message in such a way
that the legitimate receiver $B$ can decode it reliably, while the eavesdropper
$E$ learns essentially nothing about which message was transmitted. The
$\varepsilon $-one-shot private capacity of a cq wiretap channel is equal to
the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted over the channel, such that
the privacy error is no larger than $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$. The present paper
provides a lower bound on the $\varepsilon$-one-shot private classical
capacity, by exploiting the recently developed techniques of Anshu,
Devabathini, Jain, and Warsi, called position-based coding and convex
splitting. The lower bound is equal to a difference of the hypothesis testing
mutual information between $X$ and $B$ and the &quot;alternate&quot; smooth
max-information between $X$ and $E$. The one-shot lower bound then leads to a
non-trivial lower bound on the second-order coding rate for private classical
communication over a memoryless cq wiretap channel.

 <dc:description>  Methods for Modalities is a series aimed at bringing together researchers
interested in developing proof methods, verification methods, algorithms and
tools based on modal logic. Here the term &quot;modal logics&quot; is conceived broadly,
including description logic, guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and
hybrid logic, dynamic logic, etc. The first workshop was held in May 1999 in
Amsterdam, and since then it has travelled the world. Please see
https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~careces/M4M for information on past editions of
M4M.
  The 9th Methods for Modalities Workshop is being held at the Indian Institute
of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, from January 8 to 10, 2017, co-located with the
Indian Conference on Logic and its Applications (ICLA), January 5 to 7, 2017.
For details, see https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/icla/M4M/
  This volume constitutes the proceedings of the workshop and given the
substantial instructional content, should be of interest especially to young
researchers and students looking for tools and techniques as well as exciting
problems related to logics and computation.

 <dc:description>  Both feedback of ratings and trust relationships can be used to reveal users'
tastes for improving recommendation performance, especially for cold users.
However, both of them are facing data sparsity problem, which may severely
degrade recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose to utilize the
idea of Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAE) to tackle this problem. Specially, we
propose a novel deep learning model, the \textit{Trust-aware Collaborative
Denoising Auto-Encoder} (TDAE), to learn compact and effective representations
from both rating and trust data for top-N recommendation. In particular, we
present a novel neutral network with a weighted hidden layer to balance the
importance of these representations. Moreover, we propose a novel correlative
regularization to bridge relations between user preferences in different
perspectives. We also conduct comprehensive experiments on two public datasets
to compare with several state-of-the-art approaches. The results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms other comparisons for top-N
recommendation task.

 <dc:creator>Oyallon, Edouard</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we build a generic architecture of Convolutional Neural
Networks to discover empirical properties of neural networks. Our first
contribution is to introduce a state-of-the-art framework that depends upon few
hyper parameters and to study the network when we vary them. It has no max
pooling, no biases, only 13 layers, is purely convolutional and yields up to
95.4% and 79.6% accuracy respectively on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. We show that the
nonlinearity of a deep network does not need to be continuous, non expansive or
point-wise, to achieve good performance. We show that increasing the width of
our network permits being competitive with very deep networks. Our second
contribution is an analysis of the contraction and separation properties of
this network. Indeed, a 1-nearest neighbor classifier applied on deep features
progressively improves with depth, which indicates that the representation is
progressively more regular. Besides, we defined and analyzed local support
vectors that separate classes locally. All our experiments are reproducible and
code is available online, based on TensorFlow.

 <dc:description>  The recently proposed Temporal Ensembling has achieved state-of-the-art
results in several semi-supervised learning benchmarks. It maintains an
exponential moving average of label predictions on each training example, and
penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with this target. However, because
the targets change only once per epoch, Temporal Ensembling becomes unwieldy
when learning large datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose Mean
Teacher, a method that averages model weights instead of label predictions. As
an additional benefit, Mean Teacher improves test accuracy and enables training
with fewer labels than Temporal Ensembling. Without changing the network
architecture, Mean Teacher achieves an error rate of 4.35% on SVHN with 250
labels, outperforming Temporal Ensembling trained with 1000 labels. We also
show that a good network architecture is crucial to performance. Combining Mean
Teacher and Residual Networks, we improve the state of the art on CIFAR-10 with
4000 labels from 10.55% to 6.28%, and on ImageNet 2012 with 10% of the labels
from 35.24% to 9.11%.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the end-to-end approach that learns hierarchical representations
from raw data using deep convolutional neural networks has been successfully
explored in the image, text and speech domains. This approach was applied to
musical signals as well but has been not fully explored yet. To this end, we
propose sample-level deep convolutional neural networks which learn
representations from very small grains of waveforms (e.g. 2 or 3 samples)
beyond typical frame-level input representations. Our experiments show how deep
architectures with sample-level filters improve the accuracy in music
auto-tagging and they provide results comparable to previous state-of-the-art
performances for the Magnatagatune dataset and Million Song Dataset. In
addition, we visualize filters learned in a sample-level DCNN in each layer to
identify hierarchically learned features and show that they are sensitive to
log-scaled frequency along layer, such as mel-frequency spectrogram that is
widely used in music classification systems.

 <dc:description>  Given an unconstrained stream of images captured by a wearable photo-camera
(2fpm), we propose an unsupervised bottom-up approach for automatic clustering
appearing faces into the individual identities present in these data. The
problem is challenging since images are acquired under real world conditions;
hence the visible appearance of the people in the images undergoes intensive
variations. Our proposed pipeline consists of first arranging the photo-stream
into events, later, localizing the appearance of multiple people in them, and
finally, grouping various appearances of the same person across different
events. Experimental results performed on a dataset acquired by wearing a
photo-camera during one month, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for the considered purpose.

 <dc:description>  Music auto-tagging is often handled in a similar manner to image
classification by regarding the 2D audio spectrogram as image data. However,
music auto-tagging is distinguished from image classification in that the tags
are highly diverse and have different levels of abstractions. Considering this
issue, we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based architecture that
embraces multi-level and multi-scaled features. The architecture is trained in
three steps. First, we conduct supervised feature learning to capture local
audio features using a set of CNNs with different input sizes. Second, we
extract audio features from each layer of the pre-trained convolutional
networks separately and aggregate them altogether given a long audio clip.
Finally, we put them into fully-connected networks and make final predictions
of the tags. Our experiments show that using the combination of multi-level and
multi-scale features is highly effective in music auto-tagging and the proposed
method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on the MagnaTagATune dataset and
the Million Song Dataset. We further show that the proposed architecture is
useful in transfer learning.

 <dc:description>  The popular Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm for tensor
decomposition is efficient and easy to implement, but often converges to poor
local optima---particularly when the weights of the factors are non-uniform. We
propose a modification of the ALS approach that is as efficient as standard
ALS, but provably recovers the true factors with random initialization under
standard incoherence assumptions on the factors of the tensor. We demonstrate
the significant practical superiority of our approach over traditional ALS for
a variety of tasks on synthetic data---including tensor factorization on exact,
noisy and over-complete tensors, as well as tensor completion---and for
computing word embeddings from a third-order word tri-occurrence tensor.

 <dc:description>  The use of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks for multimedia distribution has spread
out globally in recent years. The mass popularity is primarily driven by
cost-effective distribution of content, also giving rise to piracy. An end user
(buyer/peer) of a P2P content distribution system does not want to reveal
his/her identity during a transaction with a content owner (merchant), whereas
the merchant does not want the buyer to further distribute the content
illegally. To date, different P2P distribution systems have been proposed that
provide copyright and privacy protection at a cost of high computational burden
at the merchants and/or at the buyer's end and thus, making these systems
impractical. In this paper, we propose PSUM, a P2P content distribution system
which allows efficient distribution of large-sized multimedia content while
preserving the security and privacy of merchants and buyers. The security of
PSUM is ensured by using an asymmetric fingerprinting protocol based on
collusion-resistant codes. In addition, PSUM enables buyers to obtain digital
contents anonymously, but this anonymity can be revoked as soon as he/she is
found guilty of copyright violation. The paper presents a thorough performance
analysis of PSUM, through different experiments and simulations, and also
analyzes several security compromising attacks and countermeasures.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural network is difficult to train and this predicament becomes worse
as the depth increases. The essence of this problem exists in the magnitude of
backpropagated errors that will result in gradient vanishing or exploding
phenomenon. We show that a variant of regularizer which utilizes orthonormality
among different filter banks can alleviate this problem. Moreover, we design a
backward error modulation mechanism based on the quasi-isometry assumption
between two consecutive parametric layers. Equipped with these two ingredients,
we propose several novel optimization solutions that can be utilized for
training a specific-structured (repetitively triple modules of Conv-BNReLU)
extremely deep convolutional neural network (CNN) WITHOUT any shortcuts/
identity mappings from scratch. Experiments show that our proposed solutions
can achieve distinct improvements for a 44-layer and a 110-layer plain networks
on both the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Moreover, we can successfully train
plain CNNs to match the performance of the residual counterparts.
  Besides, we propose new principles for designing network structure from the
insights evoked by orthonormality. Combined with residual structure, we achieve
comparative performance on the ImageNet dataset.

approaches for decomposable submodular function minimization. We provide
improved running time estimates for the state-of-the-art continuous algorithms
for the problem using combinatorial arguments. We also provide a systematic

 <dc:description>  Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is a promising framework to analyze
multi-dimensional neuroimaging datasets, while taking into account both the
spatial and functional dependencies between brain signals. In the present work,
we apply dimensionality reduction techniques based on graph representations of
the brain to decode brain activity from real and simulated fMRI datasets. We
introduce seven graphs obtained from a) geometric structure and/or b)
functional connectivity between brain areas at rest, and compare them when
performing dimension reduction for classification. We show that mixed graphs
using both a) and b) offer the best performance. We also show that graph
sampling methods perform better than classical dimension reduction including
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

 <dc:title>Tight Space-Approximation Tradeoff for the Multi-Pass Streaming Set
  Cover Problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Assadi, Sepehr</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the classic set cover problem in the streaming model: the sets that
comprise the instance are revealed one by one in a stream and the goal is to
solve the problem by making one or few passes over the stream while maintaining
a sublinear space $o(mn)$ in the input size; here $m$ denotes the number of the
sets and $n$ is the universe size. Notice that in this model, we are mainly
concerned with the space requirement of the algorithms and hence do not
restrict their computation time.
  Our main result is a resolution of the space-approximation tradeoff for the
streaming set cover problem: we show that any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm
for the set cover problem requires $\widetilde{\Omega}(mn^{1/\alpha})$ space,
even if it is allowed polylog${(n)}$ passes over the stream, and even if the
sets are arriving in a random order in the stream. This space-approximation
tradeoff matches the best known bounds achieved by the recent algorithm of
Har-Peled et.al. (PODS 2016) that requires only $O(\alpha)$ passes over the
stream in an adversarial order, hence settling the space complexity of
approximating the set cover problem in data streams in a quite robust manner.
Additionally, our approach yields tight lower bounds for the space complexity
of $(1- \epsilon)$-approximating the streaming maximum coverage problem studied
in several recent works.

 <dc:title>Approximation Algorithms for Maximin Fair Division</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Barman, Siddharth</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of dividing indivisible goods fairly among n agents
who have additive and submodular valuations for the goods. Our fairness
guarantees are in terms of the maximin share, that is defined to be the maximum
value that an agent can ensure for herself, if she were to partition the goods
into n bundles, and then receive a minimum valued bundle. Since maximin fair
allocations (i.e., allocations in which each agent gets at least her maximin
share) do not always exist, prior work has focussed on approximation results
that aim to find allocations in which the value of the bundle allocated to each
agent is (multiplicatively) as close to her maximin share as possible. In
particular, Procaccia and Wang (2014) along with Amanatidis et al. (2015) have
shown that under additive valuations a 2/3-approximate maximin fair allocation
always exists and can be found in polynomial time. We complement these results
by developing a simple and efficient algorithm that achieves the same
approximation guarantee.
  Furthermore, we initiate the study of approximate maximin fair division under
submodular valuations. Specifically, we show that when the valuations of the
agents are nonnegative, monotone, and submodular, then a 1/10-approximate
maximin fair allocation is guaranteed to exist. In fact, we show that such an
allocation can be efficiently found by using a simple round-robin algorithm. A
technical contribution of the paper is to analyze the performance of this
combinatorial algorithm by employing the concept of multilinear extensions.

 <dc:title>Exploiting Spontaneous Transmissions for Broadcasting and Leader
  Election in Radio Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Czumaj, Artur</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Davies, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study two fundamental communication primitives: broadcasting and leader
election in the classical model of multi-hop radio networks with unknown
topology and without collision detection mechanisms.
  It has been known for almost 20 years that in undirected networks with n
nodes and diameter D, randomized broadcasting requires Omega(D log n/D + log^2
n) rounds in expectation, assuming that uninformed nodes are not allowed to
communicate (until they are informed). Only very recently, Haeupler and Wajc
(PODC'2016) showed that this bound can be slightly improved for the model with
spontaneous transmissions, providing an O(D log n loglog n / log D + log^O(1)
n)-time broadcasting algorithm. In this paper, we give a new and faster
algorithm that completes broadcasting in O(D log n/log D + log^O(1) n) time,
with high probability. This yields the first optimal O(D)-time broadcasting
algorithm whenever D is polynomial in n.
  Furthermore, our approach can be applied to design a new leader election
algorithm that matches the performance of our broadcasting algorithm.
Previously, all fast randomized leader election algorithms have been using
broadcasting as their subroutine and their complexity have been asymptotically
strictly bigger than the complexity of broadcasting. In particular, the fastest
previously known randomized leader election algorithm of Ghaffari and Haeupler
(SODA'2013) requires O(D log n/D min{loglog n, log n/D} + log^O(1) n)-time with
high probability. Our new algorithm requires O(D log n / log D + log^O(1) n)
time with high probability, and it achieves the optimal O(D) time whenever D is
polynomial in n.

 <dc:description>  The parameterized model-checking problem for a class of first-order sentences
(queries) asks to decide whether a given sentence from the class holds true in
a given relational structure (database); the parameter is the length of the
sentence. In 1995 Vardi observed a polynomial time algorithm deciding the
model-checking problem for queries with a bounded number of variables. We study
its parameterized space complexity. For each bound on the quantifier
alternation rank the problem becomes complete for the corresponding level of
what we call the tree hierarchy, a hierarchy of parameterized complexity
classes defined via space bounded alternating machines between parameterized
logarithmic space and fixed-parameter tractable time. We observe that a
parameterized logarithmic space model-checker for existential bounded variable
queries would allow to improve Savitch's classical simulation of
nondeterministic logarithmic space in deterministic space $O(\log^2)$. Further,
we define a highly space efficient model-checker for queries with a bounded
number of variables and bounded quantifier alternation rank. We study its
optimality under the assumption that Savitch's theorem is optimal.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the robust distributed relay beamforming problem is solved
using the worst case approach, where the problem solution has been involved
because of the effect of uncertainty of channel knowledge on the quality of
service (QoS) constraints. It is shown that the original robust design, which
is a non-convex semi-infinite problem (SIP), can be relaxed and reformed to a
semi-definite problem (SDP). Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to verify
the performance improvement of our proposed robust problem over existing robust

 <dc:description>  Stochastic user equilibrium is an important issue in the traffic assignment
problems, tradition models for the stochastic user equilibrium problem are
designed as mathematical programming problems. In this article, a
Physarum-inspired model for the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium
problem is proposed. There are two main contributions of our work. On the one
hand, the origin Physarum model is modified to find the shortest path in
traffic direction networks with the properties of two-way traffic
characteristic. On the other hand, the modified Physarum-inspired model could
get the equilibrium flows when traveller's perceived transportation cost
complies with normal distribution. The proposed method is constituted with a
two-step procedure. First, the modified Physarum model is applied to get the
auxiliary flows. Second, the auxiliary flows are averaged to obtain the
equilibrium flows. Numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the
performance of the proposed method, which is compared with the Method of
Successive Average method.

 <dc:description>  Humanoid robots may require a degree of compliance at the joint level for
improving efficiency, shock tolerance, and safe interaction with humans. The
presence of joint elasticity, however, complexifies the design of balancing and
walking controllers. This paper proposes a control framework for extending
momentum based controllers developed for stiff actuators to the case of series
elastic actuators. The key point is to consider the motor velocities as an
intermediate control input, and then apply high-gain control to stabilise the
desired motor velocities achieving momentum control. Simulations carried out on
a model of the robot iCub verify the soundness of the proposed approach.

proposals in the literature, the described system is able to work directly and
based only on raw depth data. Moreover, the head pose estimation is solved as a
regression problem and does not rely on visual facial features like facial
landmarks. We tested our system on a well known public dataset, Biwi Kinect
Head Pose, showing that our approach achieves state-of-art results and is able
to meet real time performance requirements.

 <dc:description>  Multi-task learning employs shared representation of knowledge for learning
multiple instances from the same or related problems. Time series prediction
consists of several instances that are defined by the way they are broken down
into fixed windows known as embedding dimension. Finding the optimal values for
embedding dimension is a computationally intensive task. Therefore, we
introduce a new category of problem called dynamic time series prediction that
requires a trained model to give prediction when presented with different
values of the embedding dimension. This can be seen a new class of time series
prediction where dynamic prediction is needed. In this paper, we propose a
co-evolutionary multi-task learning method that provides a synergy between
multi-task learning and coevolution. This enables neural networks to retain
modularity during training for building blocks of knowledge for different
instances of the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated using one-step-ahead chaotic time series problems. The results
show that the proposed method can effectively be used for different instances
of the related time series problems while providing improved generalisation
performance.

 <dc:description>  We consider a multitask estimation problem where nodes in a network are
divided into several connected clusters, with each cluster performing a
least-mean-squares estimation of a different random parameter vector. Inspired
by the adapt-then-combine diffusion strategy, we propose a multitask diffusion
strategy whose mean stability can be ensured whenever individual nodes are
stable in the mean, regardless of the inter-cluster cooperation weights. In
addition, the proposed strategy is able to achieve an asymptotically unbiased
estimation, when the parameters have same mean. We also develop an
inter-cluster cooperation weights selection scheme that allows each node in the
network to locally optimize its inter-cluster cooperation weights. Numerical
results demonstrate that our approach leads to a lower average steady-state
network mean-square deviation, compared with using weights selected by various
other commonly adopted methods in the literature.

 <dc:description>  As a well-known NP-hard problem, the Three-Index Assignment Problem (AP3) has
attracted lots of research efforts for developing heuristics. However, existing
heuristics either obtain less competitive solutions or consume too much time.
In this paper, a new heuristic named Approximate Muscle guided Beam Search
(AMBS) is developed to achieve a good trade-off between solution quality and
running time. By combining the approximate muscle with beam search, the
solution space size can be significantly decreased, thus the time for searching
the solution can be sharply reduced. Extensive experimental results on the
benchmark indicate that the new algorithm is able to obtain solutions with
competitive quality and it can be employed on instances with largescale. Work
of this paper not only proposes a new efficient heuristic, but also provides a
promising method to improve the efficiency of beam search.

 <dc:description>  Software engineers working in large projects must navigate complex
information landscapes. Change Impact Analysis (CIA) is a task that relies on
engineers' successful information seeking in databases storing, e.g., source
code, requirements, design descriptions, and test case specifications. Several
previous approaches to support information seeking are task-specific, thus
understanding engineers' seeking behavior in specific tasks is fundamental. We
present an industrial case study on how engineers seek information in CIA, with
a particular focus on traceability and development artifacts that are not
source code. We show that engineers have different information seeking
behavior, and that some do not consider traceability particularly useful when
conducting CIA. Furthermore, we observe a tendency for engineers to prefer less
rigid types of support rather than formal approaches, i.e., engineers value
support that allows flexibility in how to practically conduct CIA. Finally, due
to diverse information seeking behavior, we argue that future CIA support
should embrace individual preferences to identify change impact by empowering
several seeking alternatives, including searching, browsing, and tracing.

 <dc:description>  We empirically characterize the performance of discriminative and generative
LSTM models for text classification. We find that although RNN-based generative
models are more powerful than their bag-of-words ancestors (e.g., they account
for conditional dependencies across words in a document), they have higher
asymptotic error rates than discriminatively trained RNN models. However we
also find that generative models approach their asymptotic error rate more
rapidly than their discriminative counterparts---the same pattern that Ng &amp;
Jordan (2001) proved holds for linear classification models that make more
naive conditional independence assumptions. Building on this finding, we
hypothesize that RNN-based generative classification models will be more robust
to shifts in the data distribution. This hypothesis is confirmed in a series of
experiments in zero-shot and continual learning settings that show that
generative models substantially outperform discriminative models.

 <dc:description>  While we once thought of cancer as single monolithic diseases affecting a
specific organ site, we now understand that there are many subtypes of cancer
defined by unique patterns of gene mutations. These gene mutational data, which
can be more reliably obtained than gene expression data, help to determine how
the subtypes develop, evolve, and respond to therapies. Different from dense
continuous-value gene expression data, which most existing cancer subtype
discovery algorithms use, somatic mutational data are extremely sparse and
heterogeneous, because there are less than 0.5\% mutated genes in discrete
value 1/0 out of 20,000 human protein-coding genes, and identical mutated genes
are rarely shared by cancer patients.
  Our focus is to search for cancer subtypes from extremely sparse and high
dimensional gene mutational data in discrete 1 and 0 values using unsupervised
learning. We propose a new network-based distance metric. We project cancer
patients' mutational profile into their gene network structure and measure the
distance between two patients using the similarity between genes and between
the gene vertexes of the patients in the network. Experimental results in
synthetic data and real-world data show that our approach outperforms the top
competitors in cancer subtype discovery. Furthermore, our approach can identify
cancer subtypes that cannot be detected by other clustering algorithms in real
cancer data.

 <dc:title>A proposal for ethically traceable artificial intelligence</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Although the problem of a critique of robotic behavior in near-unanimous
agreement to human norms seems intractable, a starting point of such an
ambition is a framework of the collection of knowledge a priori and experience
a posteriori categorized as a set of synthetical judgments available to the
intelligence, translated into computer code. If such a proposal were
successful, an algorithm with ethically traceable behavior and cogent
equivalence to human cognition is established. This paper will propose the
application of Kant's critique of reason to current programming constructs of
an autonomous intelligent system.

 <dc:description>  Emulating spiking neural networks on analog neuromorphic hardware offers
several advantages over simulating them on conventional computers, particularly
in terms of speed and energy consumption. However, this usually comes at the
cost of reduced control over the dynamics of the emulated networks. In this
paper, we demonstrate how iterative training of a hardware-emulated network can
compensate for anomalies induced by the analog substrate. We first convert a
deep neural network trained in software to a spiking network on the BrainScaleS
wafer-scale neuromorphic system, thereby enabling an acceleration factor of 10
000 compared to the biological time domain. This mapping is followed by the
in-the-loop training, where in each training step, the network activity is
first recorded in hardware and then used to compute the parameter updates in
software via backpropagation. An essential finding is that the parameter
updates do not have to be precise, but only need to approximately follow the
correct gradient, which simplifies the computation of updates. Using this
approach, after only several tens of iterations, the spiking network shows an
accuracy close to the ideal software-emulated prototype. The presented
techniques show that deep spiking networks emulated on analog neuromorphic
devices can attain good computational performance despite the inherent
variations of the analog substrate.

 <dc:description>  Transactional frequent subgraph mining identifies frequent subgraphs in a
collection of graphs. This research problem has wide applicability and
increasingly requires higher scalability over single machine solutions to
address the needs of Big Data use cases. We introduce DIMSpan, an advanced
approach to frequent subgraph mining that utilizes the features provided by
distributed in-memory dataflow systems such as Apache Spark or Apache Flink. It
determines the complete set of frequent subgraphs from arbitrary string-labeled
directed multigraphs as they occur in social, business and knowledge networks.
DIMSpan is optimized to runtime and minimal network traffic but memory-aware.
An extensive performance evaluation on large graph collections shows the
scalability of DIMSpan and the effectiveness of its pruning and optimization
techniques.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of testing the equivalence between two discrete
histograms. A {\em $k$-histogram} over $[n]$ is a probability distribution that
is piecewise constant over some set of $k$ intervals over $[n]$. Histograms
have been extensively studied in computer science and statistics. Given a set
of samples from two $k$-histogram distributions $p, q$ over $[n]$, we want to
distinguish (with high probability) between the cases that $p = q$ and
$\|p-q\|_1 \geq \epsilon$. The main contribution of this paper is a new
algorithm for this testing problem and a nearly matching information-theoretic
lower bound. Specifically, the sample complexity of our algorithm matches our
lower bound up to a logarithmic factor, improving on previous work by
polynomial factors in the relevant parameters. Our algorithmic approach applies
in a more general setting and yields improved sample upper bounds for testing
closeness of other structured distributions as well.

 <dc:description>  We consider extended starlike networks where the hub node is coupled with
several chains of nodes representing star rays. Assuming that nodes of the
network are occupied by nonidentical self-oscillators we study various forms of
their cluster synchronization. Radial cluster emerges when the nodes are
synchronized along a ray, while circular cluster is formed by nodes without
immediate connections but located on identical distances to the hub. By its
nature the circular synchronization is a new manifestation of so called remote
synchronization [Phys. Rev. E 85 (2012), 026208]. We report its long-range form
when the synchronized nodes interact through at least three intermediate nodes.
Forms of long-range remote synchronization are elements of scenario of
transition to the total synchronization of the network. We observe that the far
ends of rays synchronize first. Then more circular clusters appear involving
closer to hub nodes. Subsequently the clusters merge and, finally, all network
become synchronous. Behavior of the extended starlike networks is found to be
strongly determined by the ray length, while varying the number of rays
basically affects fine details of a dynamical picture. Symmetry of the star
also extensively influences the dynamics. In an asymmetric star circular
cluster mainly vanish in favor of radial ones, however, long-range remote
synchronization survives.

 <dc:description>  This paper optimizes the pilot assignment and pilot transmit powers to
mitigate pilot contamination in Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output)
systems. While prior works have treated pilot assignment as a combinatorial
problem, we achieve a more tractable problem formulation by directly optimizing
the pilot sequences. To this end, we compute a lower bound on the uplink (UL)
spectral efficiency (SE), for Rayleigh fading channels with maximum ratio (MR)
detection and arbitrary pilot sequences. We optimize the max-min SE with
respect to the pilot sequences and pilot powers, under power budget
constraints. This becomes an NP-hard signomial problem, but we propose an
efficient algorithm to obtain a local optimum with polynomial complexity.
Numerical results manifest the near optimality of the proposed algorithm and
show significant gains over existing suboptimal algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Unmanned aircraft have decreased the cost required to collect remote sensing
imagery, which has enabled researchers to collect high-spatial resolution data
from multiple sensor modalities more frequently and easily. The increase in
data will push the need for semantic segmentation frameworks that are able to
classify non-RGB imagery, but this type of algorithmic development requires an
increase in publicly available benchmark datasets with class labels. In this
paper, we introduce a high-resolution multispectral dataset with image labels.
This new benchmark dataset has been pre-split into training/testing folds in
order to standardize evaluation and continue to push state-of-the-art
classification frameworks for non-RGB imagery.

 <dc:title>Generalizing CoSaMP to Signals from a Union of Low Dimensional Linear

 <dc:description>  The idea that signals reside in a union of low dimensional subspaces subsumes
many low dimensional models that have been used extensively in the recent
decade in many fields and applications. Until recently, the vast majority of
works have studied each one of these models on its own. However, a recent
approach suggests providing general theory for low dimensional models using
their Gaussian mean width, which serves as a measure for the intrinsic low
dimensionality of the data. In this work we use this novel approach to study a
generalized version of the popular compressive sampling matching pursuit
(CoSaMP) algorithm, and to provide general recovery guarantees for signals from
a union of low dimensional linear subspaces, under the assumption that the
measurement matrix is Gaussian. We discuss the implications of our results for
specific models, and use the generalized algorithm as an inspiration for a new
greedy method for signal reconstruction in a combined sparse-synthesis and
cosparse-analysis model. We perform experiments that demonstrate the usefulness
of the proposed strategy.

 <dc:title>A time series distance measure for efficient clustering of input output

 <dc:description>  Starting from a dataset with input/output time series generated by multiple
deterministic linear dynamical systems, this paper tackles the problem of
automatically clustering these time series. We propose an extension to the
so-called Martin cepstral distance, that allows to efficiently cluster these
time series, and apply it to simulated electrical circuits data. Traditionally,
two ways of handling the problem are used. The first class of methods employs a
distance measure on time series (e.g. Euclidean, Dynamic Time Warping) and a
clustering technique (e.g. k-means, k-medoids, hierarchical clustering) to find
natural groups in the dataset. It is, however, often not clear whether these
distance measures effectively take into account the specific temporal
correlations in these time series. The second class of methods uses the
input/output data to identify a dynamic system using an identification scheme,
and then applies a model norm-based distance (e.g. H2, H-infinity) to find out
which systems are similar. This, however, can be very time consuming for large
amounts of long time series data. We show that the new distance measure
presented in this paper performs as good as when every input/output pair is
modelled explicitly, but remains computationally much less complex. The
complexity of calculating this distance between two time series of length N is
O(N logN).

 <dc:description>  We investigate the relationship between several enumeration complexity
classes and focus in particular on problems having enumeration algorithms with
incremental and polynomial delay (IncP and DelayP respectively). We show that,
for some algorithms, we can turn an average delay into a worst case delay
without increasing the space complexity, suggesting that IncP_1 = DelayP even
with polynomially bounded space. We use the Exponential Time Hypothesis to
exhibit a strict hierarchy inside IncP which gives the first separation of
DelayP and IncP. Finally we relate the uniform generation of solutions to
probabilistic enumeration algorithms with polynomial delay and polynomial
space.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the key challenges for multi-agent learning is scalability. In this
paper, we introduce a technique for speeding up multi-agent learning by
exploiting concurrent and incremental experience sharing. This solution
adaptively identifies opportunities to transfer experiences between agents and
allows for the rapid acquisition of appropriate policies in large-scale,
stochastic, homogeneous multi-agent systems. We introduce an online,
distributed, supervisor-directed transfer technique for constructing high-level
characterizations of an agent's dynamic learning environment---called
contexts---which are used to identify groups of agents operating under
approximately similar dynamics within a short temporal window. A set of
supervisory agents computes contextual information for groups of subordinate
agents, thereby identifying candidates for experience sharing. Our method uses
a tiered architecture to propagate, with low communication overhead, state,
action, and reward data amongst the members of each dynamically-identified
information-sharing group. We applied this method to a large-scale distributed
task allocation problem with hundreds of information-sharing agents operating
in an unknown, non-stationary environment. We demonstrate that our approach
results in significant performance gains, that it is robust to noise-corrupted
or suboptimal context features, and that communication costs scale linearly
with the supervisor-to-subordinate ratio.

 <dc:title>Random Triggering Based Sub-Nyquist Sampling System for Sparse Multiband

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel random triggering based modulated wideband compressive
sampling (RT-MWCS) method to facilitate efficient realization of sub-Nyquist
rate compressive sampling systems for sparse wideband signals. Under the
assumption that the signal is repetitively (not necessarily periodically)
triggered, RT-MWCS uses random modulation to obtain measurements of the signal
at randomly chosen positions. It uses multiple measurement vector method to
estimate the non-zero supports of the signal in the frequency domain. Then, the
signal spectrum is solved using least square estimation. The distinct ability
of estimating sparse multiband signal is facilitated with the use of level
triggering and time to digital converter devices previously used in random
equivalent sampling (RES) scheme. Compared to the existing compressive sampling
(CS) techniques, such as modulated wideband converter (MWC), RT-MWCS is with
simple system architecture and can be implemented with one channel at the cost
of more sampling time. Experimental results indicate that, for sparse multiband
signal with unknown spectral support, RT-MWCS requires a sampling rate much
lower than Nyquist rate, while giving great quality of signal reconstruction.

 <dc:title>Distributed Exact Shortest Paths in Sublinear Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Elkin, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The distributed single-source shortest paths problem is one of the most
fundamental and central problems in the message-passing distributed computing.
Classical Bellman-Ford algorithm solves it in $O(n)$ time, where $n$ is the
number of vertices in the input graph $G$. Peleg and Rubinovich (FOCS'99)
showed a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(D + \sqrt{n})$ for this problem, where
$D$ is the hop-diameter of $G$.
  Whether or not this problem can be solved in $o(n)$ time when $D$ is
relatively small is a major notorious open question. Despite intensive research
\cite{LP13,N14,HKN15,EN16,BKKL16} that yielded near-optimal algorithms for the
approximate variant of this problem, no progress was reported for the original
problem.
  In this paper we answer this question in the affirmative. We devise an
algorithm that requires $O((n \log n)^{5/6})$ time, for $D = O(\sqrt{n \log
n})$, and $O(D^{1/3} \cdot (n \log n)^{2/3})$ time, for larger $D$. This
running time is sublinear in $n$ in almost the entire range of parameters,
specifically, for $D = o(n/\log^2 n)$. For the all-pairs shortest paths
problem, our algorithm requires $O(n^{5/3} \log^{2/3} n)$ time, regardless of
the value of $D$.
  We also devise the first algorithm with non-trivial complexity guarantees for
computing exact shortest paths in the multipass semi-streaming model of
computation.
  From the technical viewpoint, our algorithm computes a hopset $G&quot;$ of a
skeleton graph $G'$ of $G$ without first computing $G'$ itself. We then conduct
a Bellman-Ford exploration in $G' \cup G&quot;$, while computing the required edges
of $G'$ on the fly. As a result, our algorithm computes exactly those edges of
$G'$ that it really needs, rather than computing approximately the entire $G'$.

 <dc:description>  A (convex) polytope $P$ is said to be $2$-level if for every direction of
hyperplanes which is facet-defining for $P$, the vertices of $P$ can be covered
with two hyperplanes of that direction. The study of these polytopes is
motivated by questions in combinatorial optimization and communication
complexity, among others. In this paper, we present the first algorithm for
enumerating all combinatorial types of $2$-level polytopes of a given dimension
$d$, and provide complete experimental results for $d \leqslant 7$. Our
approach is inductive: for each fixed $(d-1)$-dimensional $2$-level polytope
$P_0$, we enumerate all $d$-dimensional $2$-level polytopes $P$ that have $P_0$
as a facet. This relies on the enumeration of the closed sets of a closure
operator over a finite ground set. By varying the prescribed facet $P_0$, we
obtain all $2$-level polytopes in dimension $d$.

 <dc:description>  This work investigates the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
technology for measurement of rock fragmentation without placement of scale
objects in the scene to determine image scale. Commonly practiced image-based
rock fragmentation analysis requires a technician to walk to a rock pile, place
a scale object of known size in the area of interest, and capture individual 2D
images. Our previous work has used UAV technology for the first time to acquire
real-time rock fragmentation data and has shown comparable quality of results;
however, it still required the (potentially dangerous) placement of scale
objects, and continued to make the assumption that the rock pile surface is
planar and that the scale objects lie on the surface plane. This work improves
our UAV-based approach to enable rock fragmentation measurement without
placement of scale objects and without the assumption of planarity. This is
achieved by first generating a point cloud of the rock pile from 2D images,
taking into account intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and then taking
2D images for fragmentation analysis. This work represents an important step
towards automating post-blast rock fragmentation analysis. In experiments, a
rock pile with known size distribution was photographed by the UAV with and
without using scale objects. For fragmentation analysis without scale objects,
a point cloud of the rock pile was generated and used to compute image scale.
Comparison of the rock size distributions show that this point-cloud-based
method enables producing measurements with better or comparable accuracy
(within 10% of the ground truth) to the manual method with scale objects.

 <dc:description>  Human-centered environments are rich with a wide variety of spatial relations
between everyday objects. For autonomous robots to operate effectively in such
environments, they should be able to reason about these relations and
generalize them to objects with different shapes and sizes. For example, having
learned to place a toy inside a basket, a robot should be able to generalize
this concept using a spoon and a cup. This requires a robot to have the
flexibility to learn arbitrary relations in a lifelong manner, making it
challenging for an expert to pre-program it with sufficient knowledge to do so
beforehand. In this paper, we address the problem of learning spatial relations
by introducing a novel method from the perspective of distance metric learning.
Our approach enables a robot to reason about the similarity between pairwise
spatial relations, thereby enabling it to use its previous knowledge when
presented with a new relation to imitate. We show how this makes it possible to
learn arbitrary spatial relations from non-expert users using a small number of
examples and in an interactive manner. Our extensive evaluation with real-world
data demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in reasoning about a
continuous spectrum of spatial relations and generalizing them to new objects.

 <dc:title>Efficient Strategy Computation in Zero-Sum Asymmetric Repeated Games</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Zero-sum asymmetric games model decision making scenarios involving two
competing players who have different information about the game being played. A
particular case is that of nested information, where one (informed) player has
superior information over the other (uninformed) player. This paper considers
the case of nested information in repeated zero-sum games and studies the
computation of strategies for both the informed and uninformed players for
finite-horizon and discounted infinite-horizon nested information games. For
finite-horizon settings, we exploit that for both players, the security
strategy, and also the opponent's corresponding best response depend only on
the informed player's history of actions. Using this property, we refine the
sequence form, and formulate an LP computation of player strategies that is
linear in the size of the uninformed player's action set. For the
infinite-horizon discounted game, we construct LP formulations to compute the
approximated security strategies for both players, and provide a bound on the
performance difference between the approximated security strategies and the
security strategies. Finally, we illustrate the results on a network
interdiction game between an informed system administrator and uniformed
intruder.

 <dc:description>  The provision of both wireless and wired services in the optical access
domain will be an important function for future passive optical networks (PON).
With the emergence of 5th generation (5G) mobile communications, a move toward
a dense deployment of small cell antenna sites, in conjunction with a cloud
radio access network (C-RAN) architecture, is foreseen. This type of network
architecture greatly increases the requirement for high capacity mobile
fronthaul and backhaul links. An efficient way of achieving such connectivity
is to make use of wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) PON infrastructure
where wireless and wired services may be converged for distribution. In this
work, for the first time, the convergence of 5G wireless candidate waveforms
with a single-carrier wired signal is demonstrated in a PON. Three bands of
universally filtered orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UF-OFDM) and
generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM), are transmitted at an
intermediate frequency in conjunction with a digital 10Gb/s pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM) signal in the downlink direction. Orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) is also evaluated as a benchmark. Results show,
for each waveform, how performance varies due to the 5G channel spacing -
indicating UF-OFDM's superiority in terms of PON convergence. Successful
transmission over 25km of fibre is also demonstrated for all waveforms.

 <dc:title>An LP Approach for Solving Two-Player Zero-Sum Repeated Bayesian Games</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Shamma, Jeff</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  This paper studies two-player zero-sum repeated Bayesian games in which every
player has a private type that is unknown to the other player, and the initial
probability of the type of every player is publicly known. The types of players
are independently chosen according to the initial probabilities, and are kept
the same all through the game. At every stage, players simultaneously choose
actions, and announce their actions publicly. For finite horizon cases, an
explicit linear program is provided to compute players' security strategies.
Moreover, based on the existing results in [1], this paper shows that a
player's sufficient statistics, which is independent of the strategy of the
other player, consists of the belief over the player's own type, the regret
with respect to the other player's type, and the stage. Explicit linear
programs are provided to compute the initial regrets, and the security
strategies that only depends on the sufficient statistics. For discounted
cases, following the same idea in the finite horizon, this paper shows that a
player's sufficient statistics consists of the belief of the player's own type
and the anti-discounted regret with respect to the other player's type.
Besides, an approximated security strategy depending on the sufficient
statistics is provided, and an explicit linear program to compute the
approximated security strategy is given. This paper also obtains a bound on the
performance difference between the approximated security strategy and the
security strategy.

 <dc:description>  Many important problems can be modeled as a system of interconnected
entities, where each entity is recording time-dependent observations or
measurements. In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the
temporal dynamics of such data, it is essential to understand the relationships
between the different entities and how these relationships evolve over time. In
this paper, we introduce the time-varying graphical lasso (TVGL), a method of
inferring time-varying networks from raw time series data. We cast the problem
in terms of estimating a sparse time-varying inverse covariance matrix, which
reveals a dynamic network of interdependencies between the entities. Since
dynamic network inference is a computationally expensive task, we derive a
scalable message-passing algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem in an efficient way. We also discuss
several extensions, including a streaming algorithm to update the model and
incorporate new observations in real time. Finally, we evaluate our TVGL
algorithm on both real and synthetic datasets, obtaining interpretable results
and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both accuracy and
scalability.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Text password has long been the dominant user authentication technique and is
used by large numbers of Internet services. If they follow recommended
practice, users are faced with the almost insuperable problem of generating and
managing a large number of site-unique and strong (i.e. non-guessable)
passwords. One way of addressing this problem is through the use of a password
generator, i.e. a client-side scheme which generates (and regenerates)
site-specific strong passwords on demand, with the minimum of user input. This
paper provides a detailed specification and analysis of AutoPass, a password
generator scheme previously outlined as part of a general analysis of such
schemes. AutoPass has been designed to address issues identified in previously
proposed password generators, and incorporates novel techniques to address
these issues. Unlike almost all previously proposed schemes, AutoPass enables
the generation of passwords that meet important real-world requirements,
including forced password changes, use of pre-specified passwords, and
generation of passwords meeting site-specific requirements.

 <dc:description>  We reinterpret multiplicative noise in neural networks as auxiliary random
variables that augment the approximate posterior in a variational setting for
Bayesian neural networks. We show that through this interpretation it is both
efficient and straightforward to improve the approximation by employing
normalizing flows while still allowing for local reparametrizations and a
tractable lower bound. In experiments we show that with this new approximation
we can significantly improve upon classical mean field for Bayesian neural
networks on both predictive accuracy as well as predictive uncertainty.

 <dc:title>A new belief Markov chain model and its application in inventory

 <dc:description>  Markov chain model is widely applied in many fields, especially the field of
prediction. The classical Discrete-time Markov chain(DTMC) is a widely used
method for prediction. However, the classical DTMC model has some limitation
when the system is complex with uncertain information or state space is not
discrete. To address it, a new belief Markov chain model is proposed by
combining Dempster-Shafer evidence theory with Markov chain. In our model, the
uncertain data is allowed to be handle in the form of interval number and the
basic probability assignment(BPA) is generated based on the distance between
interval numbers. The new belief Markov chain model overcomes the shortcomings
of classical Markov chain and has an efficient ability in dealing with
uncertain information. Moreover, an example of inventory prediction and the
comparison between our model and classical DTMC model can show the
effectiveness and rationality of our proposed model.

 <dc:title>Concentration Bounds for High Sensitivity Functions Through Differential
  Privacy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nissim, Kobbi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Stemmer, Uri</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new line of work [Dwork et al. STOC 2015], [Hardt and Ullman FOCS 2014],
[Steinke and Ullman COLT 2015], [Bassily et al. STOC 2016] demonstrates how
differential privacy [Dwork et al. TCC 2006] can be used as a mathematical tool
for guaranteeing generalization in adaptive data analysis. Specifically, if a
differentially private analysis is applied on a sample S of i.i.d. examples to
select a low-sensitivity function f, then w.h.p. f(S) is close to its
expectation, although f is being chosen based on the data.
  Very recently, Steinke and Ullman observed that these generalization
guarantees can be used for proving concentration bounds in the non-adaptive
setting, where the low-sensitivity function is fixed beforehand. In particular,
they obtain alternative proofs for classical concentration bounds for
low-sensitivity functions, such as the Chernoff bound and McDiarmid's
Inequality.
  In this work, we set out to examine the situation for functions with
high-sensitivity, for which differential privacy does not imply generalization
guarantees under adaptive analysis. We show that differential privacy can be
used to prove concentration bounds for such functions in the non-adaptive
setting.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Supplier selection is a typical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem
and lots of uncertain information exist inevitably. To address this issue, a
new method was proposed based on interval data fusion. Our method follows the
original way to generate classical basic probability assignment(BPA) determined
by the distance among the evidences. However, the weights of criteria are kept
as interval numbers to generate interval BPAs and do the fusion of interval
BPAs. Finally, the order is ranked and the decision is made according to the
obtained interval BPAs. In this paper, a numerical example of supplier
selection is applied to verify the feasibility and validity of our method. The
new method is presented aiming at solving multiple-criteria decision-making
problems in which the weights of criteria or experts are described in fuzzy
data like linguistic terms or interval data.

 <dc:description>  Region of interest (ROI) alignment in medical images plays a crucial role in
diagnostics, procedure planning, treatment, and follow-up. Frequently, a model
is represented as triangulated mesh while the patient data is provided from CAT
scanners as pixel or voxel data. Previously, we presented a 2D method for
curve-to-pixel registration. This paper contributes (i) a general
mesh-to-raster (M2R) framework to register ROIs in multi-modal images; (ii) a
3D surface-to-voxel application, and (iii) a comprehensive quantitative
evaluation in 2D using ground truth provided by the simultaneous truth and
performance level estimation (STAPLE) method. The registration is formulated as
a minimization problem where the objective consists of a data term, which
involves the signed distance function of the ROI from the reference image, and
a higher order elastic regularizer for the deformation. The evaluation is based
on quantitative light-induced fluoroscopy (QLF) and digital photography (DP) of
decalcified teeth. STAPLE is computed on 150 image pairs from 32 subjects, each
showing one corresponding tooth in both modalities. The ROI in each image is
manually marked by three experts (900 curves in total). In the QLF-DP setting,
our approach significantly outperforms the mutual information-based
registration algorithm implemented with the Insight Segmentation and
Registration Toolkit (ITK) and Elastix.

 <dc:description>  We propose and implement an algorithm for solving an overdetermined system of
partial differential equations in one unknown. Our approach relies on
Bour-Mayer method to determine compatibility conditions via Jacobi-Mayer
brackets. We solve compatible systems recursively by imitating what one would
do with pen and paper: Solve one equation, substitute the solution into the
remaining equations and iterate the process until the equations of the system
are exhausted. The method we employ for assessing the consistency of the
underlying system differs from the traditional use of differential Gr\&quot;obner
bases yet seems more efficient and straightforward to implement. We are not
aware of a computer algebra system that adopts the procedure we advocate in
this work.

 <dc:description>  Social sensing services use humans as sensor carriers, sensor operators and
sensors themselves in order to provide situation-awareness to applications.
This promises to provide a multitude of benefits to the users, for example in
the management of natural disasters or in community empowerment. However,
current social sensing services depend on Internet connectivity since the
services are deployed on central Cloud platforms. In many circumstances,
Internet connectivity is constrained, for instance when a natural disaster
causes Internet outages or when people do not have Internet access due to
economical reasons. In this paper, we propose the emerging Fog Computing
infrastructure to become a key-enabler of social sensing services in situations
of constrained Internet connectivity. To this end, we develop a generic
architecture and API of Fog-enabled social sensing services. We exemplify the
usage of the proposed social sensing architecture on a number of concrete use
cases from two different scenarios.

 <dc:description>  This report describes our submission to the ISIC 2017 Challenge in Skin
Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. We have participated in the Part 3:
Lesion Classification with a system for automatic diagnosis of nevus, melanoma
and seborrheic keratosis. Our approach aims to incorporate the expert knowledge
of dermatologists into the well known framework of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), which have shown impressive performance in many visual
recognition tasks. In particular, we have designed several networks providing
lesion area identification, lesion segmentation into structural patterns and
final diagnosis of clinical cases. Furthermore, novel blocks for CNNs have been
designed to integrate this information with the diagnosis processing pipeline.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we advocate the use of device-to-device (D2D) communications in
a LoRaWAN Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). After overviewing the critical
features of the LoRaWAN technology, we discuss the pros and cons of enabling
the D2D communications for it. Subsequently we propose a network-assisted D2D
communications protocol and show its feasibility by implementing it on top of a
LoRaWAN-certified commercial transceiver. The conducted experiments show the
performance of the proposed D2D communications protocol and enable us to assess
its performance. More precisely, we show that the D2D communications can reduce
the time and energy for data transfer by 6 to 20 times compared to conventional
LoRaWAN data transfer mechanisms. In addition, the use of D2D communications
may have a positive effect on the network by enabling spatial re-use of the
frequency resources. The proposed LoRaWAN D2D communications can be used for a
wide variety of applications requiring high coverage, e.g. use cases in
distributed smart grid deployments for management and trading.

 <dc:description>  The quality of experience (QoE) is known to be subjective and
context-dependent. Identifying and calculating the factors that affect QoE is
indeed a difficult task. Recently, a lot of effort has been devoted to estimate
the users QoE in order to improve video delivery. In the literature, most of
the QoE-driven optimization schemes that realize trade-offs among different
quality metrics have been addressed under the assumption of homogenous
populations. Nevertheless, people perceptions on a given video quality may not
be the same, which makes the QoE optimization harder. This paper aims at taking
a step further in order to address this limitation and meet users profiles. To
do so, we propose a closed-loop control framework based on the
users(subjective) feedbacks to learn the QoE function and optimize it at the
same time. Our simulation results show that our system converges to a steady
state, where the resulting QoE function noticeably improves the users
feedbacks.

 <dc:description>  Deep reinforcement learning methods attain super-human performance in a wide
range of environments. Such methods are grossly inefficient, often taking
orders of magnitudes more data than humans to achieve reasonable performance.
We propose Neural Episodic Control: a deep reinforcement learning agent that is
able to rapidly assimilate new experiences and act upon them. Our agent uses a
semi-tabular representation of the value function: a buffer of past experience
containing slowly changing state representations and rapidly updated estimates
of the value function. We show across a wide range of environments that our
agent learns significantly faster than other state-of-the-art, general purpose
deep reinforcement learning agents.

 <dc:description>  Two approaches to moment matching based model reduction of aperiodically
sampled data systems are given. The term &quot;aperiodic sampling&quot; is used in the
paper to indicate that the time between two consecutive sampling instants can
take its value from a pre-specified finite set of allowed sampling intervals.
Such systems can be represented by discrete-time linear switched (LS) state
space (SS) models. One of the approaches investigated in the paper is to apply
model reduction by moment matching on the linear time-invariant (LTI) plant
model, then compare the responses of the LS SS models acquired from the
original and reduced order LTI plants. The second approach is to apply a moment
matching based model reduction method on the LS SS model acquired from the
original LTI plant, and then compare the responses of the original and reduced
LS SS models. It is proven that for both methods, as long as the original LTI
plant is stable, the resulting reduced order LS SS model of the sampled data
system is quadratically stable. The results from two approaches are compared
with numerical examples.

 <dc:description>  Class label information has been empirically proven to be very useful in
improving the sample quality of generative adversarial nets (GANs). In this
paper, we mathematically study current variants of GANs that make use of class
label information to reveal how class labels and associated losses influence
GAN's training. Based on the analysis, we propose Activation Maximization
Generative Adversarial Networks (AM-GAN) as an alternative solution. We conduct
a set of controlled experiments to validate our analysis and study the
effectiveness of our solution, where AM-GAN achieves the state-of-the-art
Inception Score (8.91) on CIFAR-10. Through the experiments, we realize the
common used metric for generative models needs further investigation and
refinement. Thus we also delve into the widely-used evaluation metrics and
accordingly propose a new metric as compensation to make the entire metrics
complete and impartial. The proposed model also outperforms the baseline
methods in the new metric.

 <dc:description>  Fraudulent behaviors in Google Android app market fuel search rank abuse and
malware proliferation. We present FairPlay, a novel system that uncovers both
malware and search rank fraud apps, by picking out trails that fraudsters leave
behind. To identify suspicious apps, FairPlay PCF algorithm correlates review
activities and uniquely combines detected review relations with linguistic and
behavioral signals gleaned from longitudinal Google Play app data. We
contribute a new longitudinal app dataset to the community, which consists of
over 87K apps, 2.9M reviews, and 2.4M reviewers, collected over half a year.
FairPlay achieves over 95% accuracy in classifying gold standard datasets of
malware, fraudulent and legitimate apps. We show that 75% of the identified
malware apps engage in search rank fraud. FairPlay discovers hundreds of
fraudulent apps that currently evade Google Bouncer detection technology, and
reveals a new type of attack campaign, where users are harassed into writing
positive reviews, and install and review other apps.

 <dc:description>  In the mid-90's, it was shown that the statistics of aggregated time series
from Internet traffic departed from those of traditional short range dependent
models, and were instead characterized by asymptotic self-similarity. Following
this seminal contribution, over the years, many studies have investigated the
existence and form of scaling in Internet traffic. This contribution aims first
at presenting a methodology, combining multiscale analysis (wavelet and wavelet
leaders) and random projections (or sketches), permitting a precise, efficient
and robust characterization of scaling which is capable of seeing through
non-stationary anomalies. Second, we apply the methodology to a data set
spanning an unusually long period: 14 years, from the MAWI traffic archive,
thereby allowing an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the form, nature and
evolutions of scaling in Internet traffic, as well as network mechanisms
producing them. We also study a separate 3-day long trace to obtain
complementary insight into intra-day behavior. We find that a biscaling (two
ranges of independent scaling phenomena) regime is systematically observed:
long-range dependence over the large scales, and multifractal-like scaling over
the fine scales. We quantify the actual scaling ranges precisely, verify to
high accuracy the expected relationship between the long range dependent
parameter and the heavy tail parameter of the flow size distribution, and
relate fine scale multifractal scaling to typical IP packet inter-arrival and
to round-trip time distributions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of signal parameter estimation from measurements
acquired by a low-complexity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with $1$-bit
output resolution and an unknown quantization threshold is considered.
Single-comparator ADCs are energy-efficient and can be operated at ultra-high
sampling rates. For analysis of such hard-limiting systems, a fixed and known
quantization threshold is usually assumed. In the symmetric case, i.e., zero
hard-limiting offset, it is well-understood that in the low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) regime the signal processing performance degrades moderately by
${2}/{\pi}$ ($-1.96$ dB) when comparing to an ideal $\infty$-bit converter. Due
to hardware imperfections, low-complexity $1$-bit ADCs will in practice exhibit
an unknown threshold different from zero. Therefore, the offset has to be
estimated jointly with the signal parameters. Here we study the estimation
accuracy which can be obtained with receive data preprocessed by a hard-limiter
with unknown quantization level. In order to characterize the achievable
performance, we employ analytic error expressions for different setups while
modeling the offset as a nuisance parameter. In the low SNR regime we establish
the necessary condition for a vanishing loss due to missing offset knowledge at
a receiver with $1$-bit ADC. We then validate our analysis by visualizing the
quantization loss under an unknown $1$-bit threshold when wireless intersymbol
interference (ISI) channel estimation is performed. Finally, we verify the
results by Monte-Carlo simulations of asymptotically optimal estimation
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this work we establish the relation between optimal control and training
deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). We show that the forward propagation
in CNNs can be interpreted as a time-dependent nonlinear differential equation
and learning as controlling the parameters of the differential equation such
that the network approximates the data-label relation for given training data.
Using this continuous interpretation we derive two new methods to scale CNNs
with respect to two different dimensions. The first class of multiscale methods
connects low-resolution and high-resolution data through prolongation and
restriction of CNN parameters. We demonstrate that this enables classifying
high-resolution images using CNNs trained with low-resolution images and vice
versa and warm-starting the learning process. The second class of multiscale
methods connects shallow and deep networks and leads to new training strategies
that gradually increase the depths of the CNN while re-using parameters for
initializations.

reading from, writing to, and administering the database. This separation
limits unnecessary administrator access and protects data in the case of system
breaches. Since protected search was introduced in 2000, the area has grown
rapidly; systems are offered by academia, start-ups, and established companies.
  However, there is no best protected search system or set of techniques.
Design of such systems is a balancing act between security, functionality,
performance, and usability. This challenge is made more difficult by ongoing
database specialization, as some users will want the functionality of SQL,
NoSQL, or NewSQL databases. This database evolution will continue, and the
protected search community should be able to quickly provide functionality
consistent with newly invented databases.
  At the same time, the community must accurately and clearly characterize the
tradeoffs between different approaches. To address these challenges, we provide
the following contributions:
  1) An identification of the important primitive operations across database
paradigms. We find there are a small number of base operations that can be used
and combined to support a large number of database paradigms.
  2) An evaluation of the current state of protected search systems in
implementing these base operations. This evaluation describes the main
approaches and tradeoffs for each base operation. Furthermore, it puts
protected search in the context of unprotected search, identifying key gaps in
functionality.
  3) An analysis of attacks against protected search for different base
queries.
  4) A roadmap and tools for transforming a protected search system into a
protected database, including an open-source performance evaluation platform
and initial user opinions of protected search.

 <dc:title>Game-theoretic Investigation of Intensional Equalities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yamada, Norihiro</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article presents a new game semantics for Martin-L\&quot;of type theory
(MLTT), in which each game is equipped with selected isomorphism strategies
that represent (computational) proofs for (intensional) equality between
strategies on the game. These isomorphism strategies interpret propositional
equalities in MLTT. As a main result, we have obtained a first game semantics
for MLTT that refutes the principle of uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) and
validates univalence axiom (UA) though it does not model non-trivial higher
equalities. Categorically, our model forms a substructure of the classic
groupoid model of MLTT by Hofmann and Streicher. Similarly to the path from the
groupoid model to the $\omega$-groupoid model, we are planning to generalize
the game semantics to give rise to an omega-groupoid structure to interpret
non-trivial higher equalities in homotopy type theory (HoTT).

 <dc:description>  Recent works have demonstrated non-line of sight (NLOS) reconstruction by
using the time-resolved signal frommultiply scattered light. These works
combine ultrafast imaging systems with computation, which back-projects the
recorded space-time signal to build a probabilistic map of the hidden geometry.
Unfortunately, this computation is slow, becoming a bottleneck as the imaging
technology improves. In this work, we propose a new back-projection technique
for NLOS reconstruction, which is up to a thousand times faster than previous
work, with almost no quality loss. We base on the observation that the hidden
geometry probability map can be built as the intersection of the three-bounce
space-time manifolds defined by the light illuminating the hidden geometry and
the visible point receiving the scattered light from such hidden geometry. This
allows us to pose the reconstruction of the hidden geometry as the voxelization
of these space-time manifolds, which has lower theoretic complexity and is
easily implementable in the GPU. We demonstrate the efficiency and quality of
our technique compared against previous methods in both captured and synthetic
data

 <dc:description>  Manipulation of deformable objects, such as ropes and cloth, is an important
but challenging problem in robotics. We present a learning-based system where a
robot takes as input a sequence of images of a human manipulating a rope from
an initial to goal configuration, and outputs a sequence of actions that can
reproduce the human demonstration, using only monocular images as input. To
perform this task, the robot learns a pixel-level inverse dynamics model of
rope manipulation directly from images in a self-supervised manner, using about
60K interactions with the rope collected autonomously by the robot. The human
demonstration provides a high-level plan of what to do and the low-level
inverse model is used to execute the plan. We show that by combining the high
and low-level plans, the robot can successfully manipulate a rope into a
variety of target shapes using only a sequence of human-provided images for
direction.

 <dc:description>  As humans, we can often detect from a persons utterances if he or she is in
favor of or against a given target entity (topic, product, another person,
etc). But from the perspective of a computer, we need means to automatically
deduce the stance of the tweeter, given just the tweet text. In this paper, we
present our results of performing stance detection on twitter data using a
supervised approach. We begin by extracting bag-of-words to perform
classification using TIMBL, then try and optimize the features to improve
stance detection accuracy, followed by extending the dataset with two sets of
lexicons - arguing, and MPQA subjectivity; next we explore the MALT parser and
construct features using its dependency triples, finally we perform analysis
using Scikit-learn Random Forest implementation.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies a system where a set of $N$ relay nodes harvest energy
from the signal received from a source to later utilize it when forwarding the
source's data to a destination node via distributed beamforming. To this end,
we derive (approximate) analytical expressions for the mean SNR at destination
node when relays employ: i) time-switching based energy harvesting policy, ii)
power-splitting based energy harvesting policy. The obtained results facilitate
the study of the interplay between the energy harvesting parameters and the
synchronization error, and their combined impact on mean SNR. Simulation
results indicate that i) the derived approximate expressions are very accurate
even for small $N$ (e.g., $N=15$), ii) time-switching policy by the relays
outperforms power-splitting policy by at least $3$ dB.

 <dc:description>  We show how random vectors and random projection can be implemented in the
usual vector space model to construct a Euclidean semantic space from a French
synonym dictionary. We evaluate theoretically the resulting noise and show the
experimental distribution of the similarities of terms in a neighborhood
according to the choice of parameters. We also show that the Schmidt
orthogonalization process is applicable and can be used to separate homonyms
with distinct semantic meanings. Neighboring terms are easily arranged into
semantically significant clusters which are well suited to the generation of
realistic lists of synonyms and to such applications as word selection for
automatic text generation. This process, applicable to any language, can easily
be extended to collocations, is extremely fast and can be updated in real time,
whenever new synonyms are proposed.

 <dc:description>  The state-of-the-art method for automatically segmenting white matter bundles
in diffusion-weighted MRI is tractography in conjunction with streamline
cluster selection. This process involves long chains of processing steps which
are not only computationally expensive but also complex to setup and tedious
with respect to quality control. Direct bundle segmentation methods treat the
task as a traditional image segmentation problem. While they so far did not
deliver competitive results, they can potentially mitigate many of the
mentioned issues. We present a novel supervised approach for direct tract
segmentation that shows major performance gains. It builds upon a stacked U-Net
architecture which is trained on manual bundle segmentations from Human
Connectome Project subjects. We evaluate our approach \textit{in vivo} as well
as \textit{in silico} using the ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge phantom
dataset. We achieve human segmentation performance and a major performance gain
over previous pipelines. We show how the learned spatial priors efficiently
guide the segmentation even at lower image qualities with little quality loss.

 <dc:description>  User engagement in social networks depends critically on the number of online
actions their users take in the network. Can we design an algorithm that finds
when to incentivize users to take actions to maximize the overall activity in a
social network? In this paper, we model the number of online actions over time
using multidimensional Hawkes processes, derive an alternate representation of
these processes based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with jumps
and, exploiting this alternate representation, address the above question from
the perspective of stochastic optimal control of SDEs with jumps. We find that
the optimal level of incentivized actions depends linearly on the current level
of overall actions. Moreover, the coefficients of this linear relationship can
be found by solving a matrix Riccati differential equation, which can be solved
efficiently, and a first order differential equation, which has a closed form
solution. As a result, we are able to design an efficient online algorithm,
Cheshire, to sample the optimal times of the users' incentivized actions.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data gathered from Twitter show that our
algorithm is able to consistently maximize the number of online actions more
effectively than the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  Expressive efficiency refers to the relation between two architectures A and
B, whereby any function realized by B could be replicated by A, but there
exists functions realized by A, which cannot be replicated by B unless its size
grows significantly larger. For example, it is known that deep networks are
exponentially efficient with respect to shallow networks, in the sense that a
shallow network must grow exponentially large in order to approximate the
functions represented by a deep network of polynomial size. In this work, we
extend the study of expressive efficiency to the attribute of network
connectivity and in particular to the effect of &quot;overlaps&quot; in the convolutional
process, i.e., when the stride of the convolution is smaller than its filter
size (receptive field). Our analysis shows that having overlapping local
receptive fields, and more broadly denser connectivity, results in an
exponential increase in the expressive capacity of neural networks. Moreover,
while denser connectivity can increase the expressive capacity, we show that
the most common types of modern architectures already exhibit exponential
increase in expressivity, without relying on fully-connected layers.

 <dc:title>Performance Analysis for Time-of-Arrival Estimation with Oversampled
  Low-Complexity 1-bit A/D Conversion</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Stein, Manuel S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Analog-to-digtial (A/D) conversion plays a crucial role when it comes to the
design of energy-efficient and fast signal processing systems. As its
complexity grows exponentially with the number of output bits, significant
savings are possible when resorting to a minimum resolution of a single bit.
However, then the nonlinear effect which is introduced by the A/D converter
results in a pronounced performance loss, in particular for the case when the
receiver is operated outside the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. By
trading the A/D resolution for a moderately faster sampling rate, we show that
for time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation under any SNR level it is possible to
obtain a low-complexity $1$-bit receive system which features a smaller
performance degradation then the classical low SNR hard-limiting loss of
$2/\pi$ ($-1.96$ dB). Key to this result is the employment of a lower bound for
the Fisher information matrix which enables us to approximate the estimation
performance for coarsely quantized receivers with correlated noise models in a
pessimistic way.

 <dc:description>  Motion planning classically concerns the problem of accomplishing a goal
configuration while avoiding obstacles. However, the need for more
sophisticated motion planning methodologies, taking temporal aspects into
account, has emerged. To address this issue, temporal logics have recently been
used to formulate such advanced specifications. This paper will consider Signal
Temporal Logic in combination with Model Predictive Control. A robustness
metric, called Discrete Average Space Robustness, is introduced and used to
maximize the satisfaction of specifications which results in a natural
robustness against noise. The comprised optimization problem is convex and
formulated as a Linear Program.

simultaneously each S-polynomial into a unique normal form. We write an

 <dc:description>  Brain extraction or whole brain segmentation is an important first step in
many of the neuroimage analysis pipelines. The accuracy and robustness of brain
extraction, therefore, is crucial for the accuracy of the entire brain analysis
process. With the aim of designing a learning-based, geometry-independent and
registration-free brain extraction tool in this study, we present a technique
based on an auto-context convolutional neural network (CNN), in which intrinsic
local and global image features are learned through 2D patches of different
window sizes. In this architecture three parallel 2D convolutional pathways for
three different directions (axial, coronal, and sagittal) implicitly learn 3D
image information without the need for computationally expensive 3D
convolutions. Posterior probability maps generated by the network are used
iteratively as context information along with the original image patches to
learn the local shape and connectedness of the brain, to extract it from
non-brain tissue.
  The brain extraction results we have obtained from our algorithm are superior
to the recently reported results in the literature on two publicly available
benchmark datasets, namely LPBA40 and OASIS, in which we obtained Dice overlap
coefficients of 97.42% and 95.40%, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the
performance of our algorithm in the challenging problem of extracting
arbitrarily-oriented fetal brains in reconstructed fetal brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. In this application our algorithm performed
much better than the other methods (Dice coefficient: 95.98%), where the other
methods performed poorly due to the non-standard orientation and geometry of
the fetal brain in MRI. Our CNN-based method can provide accurate,
geometry-independent brain extraction in challenging applications.

 <dc:description>  Current smartphone operating systems regulate application permissions by
prompting users on an ask-on-first-use basis. Prior research has shown that
this method is ineffective because it fails to account for context: the
circumstances under which an application first requests access to data may be
vastly different than the circumstances under which it subsequently requests
access. We performed a longitudinal 131-person field study to analyze the
contextuality behind user privacy decisions to regulate access to sensitive
resources. We built a classifier to make privacy decisions on the user's behalf
by detecting when context has changed and, when necessary, inferring privacy
preferences based on the user's past decisions and behavior. Our goal is to
automatically grant appropriate resource requests without further user
intervention, deny inappropriate requests, and only prompt the user when the
system is uncertain of the user's preferences. We show that our approach can
accurately predict users' privacy decisions 96.8% of the time, which is a
four-fold reduction in error rate compared to current systems.

 <dc:description>  Taobao, as the largest online retail platform in the world, provides billions
of online display advertising impressions for millions of advertisers every
day. For commercial purposes, the advertisers bid for specific spots and target
crowds to compete for business traffic. The platform chooses the most suitable
ads to display in tens of milliseconds. Common pricing methods include cost per
mille (CPM) and cost per click (CPC). Traditional advertising systems target
certain traits of users and ad placements with fixed bids, essentially regarded
as coarse-grained matching of bid and traffic quality. However, the fixed bids
set by the advertisers competing for different quality requests cannot fully
optimize the advertisers' key requirements. Moreover, the platform has to be
responsible for the business revenue and user experience. Thus, we proposed a
bid optimizing strategy called optimized cost per click (OCPC) which
automatically adjusts the bid to achieve finer matching of bid and traffic
quality of page view (PV) request granularity. Our approach optimizes
advertisers' demands, platform business revenue and user experience and as a
whole improves traffic allocation efficiency. We have validated our approach in
Taobao display advertising system in production. The online A/B test shows our
algorithm yields substantially better results than previous fixed bid manner.

 <dc:description>  Cooperative localization with map matching has been shown to reduce Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) localization error from several meters to
sub-meter level by fusing the GNSS measurements of four vehicles in our
previous work. While further error reduction is expected to be achievable by
increasing the number of vehicles, the quantitative relationship between the
estimation error and the number of connected vehicles has neither been
systematically investigated nor analytically proved. In this work, a
theoretical study is presented that analytically proves the correlation between
the localization error and the number of connected vehicles in two cases of
practical interest. More specifically, it is shown that, under the assumption
of small non-common error, the expected square error of the GNSS common error
correction is inversely proportional to the number of vehicles, if the road
directions obey a uniform distribution, or inversely proportional to logarithm
of the number of vehicles, if the road directions obey a Bernoulli
distribution. Numerical simulations are conducted to justify these analytic
results. Moreover, the simulation results show that the aforementioned error
decrement rates hold even when the assumption of small non-common error is
violated.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the performance of the standard Greedy algorithm for
cardinality constrained maximization of non-submodular nondecreasing set
functions. While there are strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of
Greedy for maximizing submodular functions, there are few guarantees for
non-submodular ones. However, Greedy enjoys strong empirical performance for
many important non-submodular functions, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality
objective in experimental design. We prove theoretical guarantees supporting
the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by a combination of
the (generalized) curvature $\alpha$ and the submodularity ratio $\gamma$. In
particular, we prove that Greedy enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of
$\frac{1}{\alpha}(1- e^{-\gamma\alpha})$ for cardinality constrained
maximization. In addition, we bound the submodularity ratio and curvature for
several important real-world objectives, including the Bayesian A-optimality
objective, the determinantal function of a square submatrix and certain linear
programs with combinatorial constraints. We experimentally validate our
theoretical findings for both synthetic and real-world applications.

 <dc:description>  Off-policy stochastic actor-critic methods rely on approximating the
stochastic policy gradient in order to derive an optimal policy. One may also
derive the optimal policy by approximating the action-value gradient. The use
of action-value gradients is desirable as policy improvement occurs along the
direction of steepest ascent. This has been studied extensively within the
context of natural gradient actor-critic algorithms and more recently within
the context of deterministic policy gradients. In this paper we briefly discuss
the off-policy stochastic counterpart to deterministic action-value gradients,
as well as an incremental approach for following the policy gradient in lieu of
the natural gradient.

 <dc:description>  Visually impaired people face numerous challenges when it comes to
transportation. Not only must they circumvent obstacles while navigating, but
they also need access to essential information related to available public
transport, up-to-date weather forecast, and convenient method for booking
private taxis. In this paper we introduce Transport Assistant - a voice based
assistive technology prototype, built with a goal of leveling the playing field
for the visually impaired to solve these problems that they face in their day
to day life. Being voice enabled makes it seamlessly integrate into the
environment, and can be invoked by saying a hotword - hello assistant. The
paper explores this research question, followed by investigating existing
technologies, explains the methodology and design, then concludes by presenting
the prototype and results.

 <dc:description>  We study a sequential learning model featuring naive agents on a network.
Agents wrongly believe their predecessors act solely on private information, so
they ignore correlation between observed actions. We provide a simple linear
formula expressing agents' actions in terms of network paths and use this
formula to completely characterize the set of networks allowing eventual
correct learning. Disproportionately influential early agents can cause herding
on incorrect beliefs; we compute comparative statics of the probability of
incorrect herding with respect to network parameters. The probability of
mislearning increases when link densities are higher and when networks are more
integrated. In segregated networks, divergent early signals can lead to
persistent disagreement between groups. We conduct an experiment and find that
the accuracy gain from social learning is twice as large on sparser networks,
which is consistent with our behavioral assumption but inconsistent with the
rational learning model.

 <dc:title>Classification and clustering for samples of event time data using

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Data of the form of event times arise in various applications. A simple model
for such data is a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) which is specified by
a rate function that depends on time. We consider the problem of having access
to multiple independent samples of event time data, observed on a common
interval, from which we wish to classify or cluster the samples according to
their rate functions. Each rate function is unknown but assumed to belong to a
finite number of rate functions each defining a distinct class. We model the
rate functions using a spline basis expansion, the coefficients of which need
to be estimated from data. The classification approach consists of using
training data for which the class membership is known, to calculate maximum
likelihood estimates of the coefficients for each group, then assigning test
samples to a class by a maximum likelihood criterion. For clustering, by
analogy to the Gaussian mixture model approach for Euclidean data, we consider
a mixture of NHPP models and use the expectation-maximisation algorithm to
estimate the coefficients of the rate functions for the component models and
cluster membership probabilities for each sample. The classification and
clustering approaches perform well on both synthetic and real-world data sets.

 <dc:description>  Metabolomic data can potentially enable accurate, non-invasive and low-cost
prediction of coronary artery disease. Regression-based analytical approaches
however might fail to fully account for interactions between metabolites, rely
on a priori selected input features and thus might suffer from poorer accuracy.
Supervised machine learning methods can potentially be used in order to fully
exploit the dimensionality and richness of the data. In this paper, we
systematically implement and evaluate a set of supervised learning methods (L1
regression, random forest classifier) and compare them to traditional
regression-based approaches for disease prediction using metabolomic data.

 <dc:description>  ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$ is a version of Church's type theory with global
quotation and evaluation operators that is engineered to reason about the
interplay of syntax and semantics and to formalize syntax-based mathematical
algorithms. ${\rm CTT}_{\rm uqe}$ is a variant of ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$ that
admits undefined expressions, partial functions, and multiple base types of
individuals. It is better suited than ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$ as a logic for
building networks of theories connected by theory morphisms. This paper
presents the syntax and semantics of ${\rm CTT}_{\rm uqe}$, defines a notion of
a theory morphism from one ${\rm CTT}_{\rm uqe}$ theory to another, and gives
two simple examples that illustrate the use of theory morphisms in ${\rm

 <dc:description>  In-memory computing is a promising approach to addressing the
processor-memory data transfer bottleneck in computing systems. We propose
Spin-Transfer Torque Compute-in-Memory (STT-CiM), a design for in-memory
computing with Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM). The unique
properties of spintronic memory allow multiple wordlines within an array to be
simultaneously enabled, opening up the possibility of directly sensing
functions of the values stored in multiple rows using a single access. We
propose modifications to STT-MRAM peripheral circuits that leverage this
principle to perform logic, arithmetic, and complex vector operations. We
address the challenge of reliable in-memory computing under process variations
by extending ECC schemes to detect and correct errors that occur during CiM
operations. We also address the question of how STT-CiM should be integrated
within a general-purpose computing system. To this end, we propose
architectural enhancements to processor instruction sets and on-chip buses that
enable STT-CiM to be utilized as a scratchpad memory. Finally, we present data
mapping techniques to increase the effectiveness of STT-CiM. We evaluate
STT-CiM using a device-to-architecture modeling framework, and integrate
cycle-accurate models of STT-CiM with a commercial processor and on-chip bus
(Nios II and Avalon from Intel). Our system-level evaluation shows that STT-CiM
provides system-level performance improvements of 3.93x on average (upto
10.4x), and concurrently reduces memory system energy by 3.83x on average (upto
12.4x).

 <dc:description>  A remote-sensing system that can determine the position of hidden objects has
applications in many critical real-life scenarios, such as search and rescue
missions and safe autonomous driving. Previous work has shown the ability to
range and image objects hidden from the direct line of sight, employing
advanced optical imaging technologies aimed at small objects at short range. In
this work we demonstrate a long-range tracking system based on single laser
illumination and single-pixel single-photon detection. This enables us to track
one or more people hidden from view at a stand-off distance of over 50~m. These
results pave the way towards next generation LiDAR systems that will
reconstruct not only the direct-view scene but also the main elements hidden
behind walls or corners.

 <dc:title>Demand Estimation and Chance-Constrained Fleet Management for Ride
  Hailing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Miller, Justin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>How, Jonathan P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In autonomous Mobility on Demand (MOD) systems, customers request rides from
a fleet of shared vehicles that can be automatically positioned in response to
customer demand. Recent approaches to MOD systems have focused on environments
where customers can only request rides through an app or by waiting at a
station. This paper develops MOD fleet management approaches for ride hailing,
where customers may instead request rides simply by hailing a passing vehicle,
an approach of particular importance for campus MOD systems. The challenge for
ride hailing is that customer demand is not explicitly provided as it would be
with an app, but rather customers are only served if a vehicle happens to be
located at the arrival location. This work focuses on maximizing the number of
served hailing customers in an MOD system by learning and utilizing customer
demand. A Bayesian framework is used to define a novel customer demand model
which incorporates observed pedestrian traffic to estimate customer arrival
locations with a quantification of uncertainty. An exploration planner is
proposed which routes MOD vehicles in order to reduce arrival rate uncertainty.
A robust ride hailing fleet management planner is proposed which routes
vehicles under the presence of uncertainty using a chance-constrained
formulation. Simulation of a real-world MOD system on MIT's campus demonstrates
the effectiveness of the planners. The customer demand model and exploration
planner are demonstrated to reduce estimation error over time and the ride
hailing planner is shown to improve the fraction of served customers in the
system by 73\% over a baseline exploration approach.

 <dc:description>  We present a scalable underapproximation of the terminal hitting time
stochastic reach-avoid probability at a given initial condition, for
verification of high-dimensional stochastic LTI systems. While several
approximation techniques have been proposed to alleviate the curse of
dimensionality associated with dynamic programming, these techniques are
limited and cannot handle larger, more realistic systems. We present a scalable
method that uses Fourier transforms to compute an underapproximation of the
reach-avoid probability for systems with disturbances with arbitrary
probability densities. We characterize sufficient conditions for
Borel-measurability of the value functions. We exploit fixed control sequences
parameterized by the initial condition (an open-loop control policy) to
generate the underapproximation. For Gaussian disturbances, the
underapproximation can be obtained using existing efficient algorithms by
solving a convex optimization problem. Our approach produces non-trivial lower
bounds and is demonstrated on a chain of integrators with 40 states.

 <dc:description>  One of the most difficult speech recognition tasks is accurate recognition of
human to human communication. Advances in deep learning over the last few years
have produced major speech recognition improvements on the representative
Switchboard conversational corpus. Word error rates that just a few years ago
were 14% have dropped to 8.0%, then 6.6% and most recently 5.8%, and are now
believed to be within striking range of human performance. This then raises two
issues - what IS human performance, and how far down can we still drive speech
recognition error rates? A recent paper by Microsoft suggests that we have
already achieved human performance. In trying to verify this statement, we
performed an independent set of human performance measurements on two
conversational tasks and found that human performance may be considerably
better than what was earlier reported, giving the community a significantly
harder goal to achieve. We also report on our own efforts in this area,
presenting a set of acoustic and language modeling techniques that lowered the
word error rate of our own English conversational telephone LVCSR system to the
level of 5.5%/10.3% on the Switchboard/CallHome subsets of the Hub5 2000
evaluation, which - at least at the writing of this paper - is a new
performance milestone (albeit not at what we measure to be human performance!).
On the acoustic side, we use a score fusion of three models: one LSTM with
multiple feature inputs, a second LSTM trained with speaker-adversarial
multi-task learning and a third residual net (ResNet) with 25 convolutional
layers and time-dilated convolutions. On the language modeling side, we use
word and character LSTMs and convolutional WaveNet-style language models.

 <dc:title>Asymptotically Optimal Stochastic Encryption for Quantized Sequential
  Detection in the Presence of Eavesdroppers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Jiangfan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Xiaodong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider sequential detection based on quantized data in the presence of
eavesdropper. Stochastic encryption is employed as a counter measure that flips
the quantization bits at each sensor according to certain probabilities, and
the flipping probabilities are only known to the legitimate fusion center (LFC)
but not the eavesdropping fusion center (EFC). As a result, the LFC employs the
optimal sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for sequential detection
whereas the EFC employs a mismatched SPRT (MSPRT). We characterize the
asymptotic performance of the MSPRT in terms of the expected sample size as a
function of the vanishing error probabilities. We show that when the detection
error probabilities are set to be the same at the LFC and EFC, every symmetric
stochastic encryption is ineffective in the sense that it leads to the same
expected sample size at the LFC and EFC. Next, in the asymptotic regime of
small detection error probabilities, we show that every stochastic encryption
degrades the performance of the quantized sequential detection at the LFC by
increasing the expected sample size, and the expected sample size required at
the EFC is no fewer than that is required at the LFC. Then the optimal
stochastic encryption is investigated in the sense of maximizing the difference
between the expected sample sizes required at the EFC and LFC. Although this
optimization problem is nonconvex, we show that if the acceptable tolerance of
the increase in the expected sample size at the LFC induced by the stochastic
encryption is small enough, then the globally optimal stochastic encryption can
be analytically obtained; and moreover, the optimal scheme only flips one type
of quantized bits (i.e., 1 or 0) and keeps the other type unchanged.

 <dc:description>  Motifs are a powerful tool for analyzing physiological waveform data.
Standard motif methods, however, ignore important contextual information (e.g.,
what the patient was doing at the time the data were collected). We hypothesize
that these additional contextual data could increase the utility of motifs.
Thus, we propose an extension to motifs, contextual motifs, that incorporates
context. Recognizing that, oftentimes, context may be unobserved or
unavailable, we focus on methods to jointly infer motifs and context. Applied
to both simulated and real physiological data, our proposed approach improves
upon existing motif methods in terms of the discriminative utility of the
discovered motifs. In particular, we discovered contextual motifs in continuous
glucose monitor (CGM) data collected from patients with type 1 diabetes.
Compared to their contextless counterparts, these contextual motifs led to
better predictions of hypo- and hyperglycemic events. Our results suggest that
even when inferred, context is useful in both a long- and short-term prediction
horizon when processing and interpreting physiological waveform data.

 <dc:description>  Mobility On Demand (MOD) systems are revolutionizing transportation in urban
settings by improving vehicle utilization and reducing parking congestion. A
key factor in the success of an MOD system is the ability to measure and
respond to real-time customer arrival data. Real time traffic arrival rate data
is traditionally difficult to obtain due to the need to install fixed sensors
throughout the MOD network. This paper presents a framework for measuring
pedestrian traffic arrival rates using sensors onboard the vehicles that make
up the MOD fleet. A novel distributed fusion algorithm is presented which
combines onboard LIDAR and camera sensor measurements to detect trajectories of
pedestrians with a 90% detection hit rate with 1.5 false positives per minute.
A novel moving observer method is introduced to estimate pedestrian arrival
rates from pedestrian trajectories collected from mobile sensors. The moving
observer method is evaluated in both simulation and hardware and is shown to
achieve arrival rate estimates comparable to those that would be obtained with
multiple stationary sensors.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present ez-Segway, a decentralized mechanism to consistently and quickly
update the network state while preventing forwarding anomalies (loops and
black-holes) and avoiding link congestion. In our design, the centralized SDN
controller only pre-computes information needed by the switches during the
update execution. This information is distributed to the switches, which use
partial knowledge and direct message passing to efficiently realize the update.
This separation of concerns has the key benefit of improving update performance
as the communication and computation bottlenecks at the controller are removed.
Our evaluations via network emulations and large-scale simulations demonstrate
the efficiency of ez-Segway, which compared to a centralized approach, improves
network update times by up to 45% and 57% at the median and the 99th
percentile, respectively. A deployment of a system prototype in a real OpenFlow
switch and an implementation in P4 demonstrate the feasibility and low overhead
of implementing simple network update functionality within switches.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a hierarchical clustering approach for the segmentation
of mobile LiDAR point clouds. We perform the hierarchical clustering on
unorganized point clouds based on a proximity matrix. The dissimilarity measure
in the proximity matrix is calculated by the Euclidean distances between
clusters and the difference of normal vectors at given points. The main
contribution of this paper is that we succeed to optimize the combination of
clusters in the hierarchical clustering. The combination is obtained by
achieving the matching of a bipartite graph, and optimized by solving the
minimum-cost perfect matching. Results show that the proposed optimal
hierarchical clustering (OHC) succeeds to achieve the segmentation of multiple
individual objects automatically and outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR
point cloud segmentation approaches.

 <dc:description>  Advances in neural network based classifiers have transformed automatic
feature learning from a pipe dream of stronger AI to a routine and expected
property of practical systems. Since the emergence of AlexNet every winning
submission of the ImageNet challenge has employed end-to-end representation
learning, and due to the utility of good representations for transfer learning,
representation learning has become as an important and distinct task from
supervised learning. At present, this distinction is inconsequential, as
supervised methods are state-of-the-art in learning transferable
representations. But recent work has shown that generative models can also be
powerful agents of representation learning. Will the representations learned
from these generative methods ever rival the quality of those from their
supervised competitors? In this work, we argue in the affirmative, that from an
information theoretic perspective, generative models have greater potential for
representation learning. Based on several experimentally validated assumptions,
we show that supervised learning is upper bounded in its capacity for
representation learning in ways that certain generative models, such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not. We hope that our analysis will
provide a rigorous motivation for further exploration of generative
representation learning.

 <dc:description>  Evaluating similarity between graphs is of major importance in several
computer vision and pattern recognition problems, where graph representations
are often used to model objects or interactions between elements. The choice of
a distance or similarity metric is, however, not trivial and can be highly
dependent on the application at hand. In this work, we propose a novel metric
learning method to evaluate distance between graphs that leverages the power of
convolutional neural networks, while exploiting concepts from spectral graph
theory to allow these operations on irregular graphs. We demonstrate the
potential of our method in the field of connectomics, where neuronal pathways
or functional connections between brain regions are commonly modelled as
graphs. In this problem, the definition of an appropriate graph similarity
function is critical to unveil patterns of disruptions associated with certain
brain disorders. Experimental results on the ABIDE dataset show that our method
can learn a graph similarity metric tailored for a clinical application,
improving the performance of a simple k-nn classifier by 11.9% compared to a
traditional distance metric.

 <dc:description>  In today's dynamic ICT environments, the ability to control users' access to
resources becomes ever important. On the one hand, it should adapt to the
users' changing needs; on the other hand, it should not be compromised.
Therefore, it is essential to have a flexible access control model,
incorporating dynamically changing context information. Towards this end, this
paper introduces a policy framework for context-aware access control (CAAC)
applications that extends the role-based access control model with both dynamic
associations of user-role and role-permission capabilities. We first present a
formal model of CAAC policies for our framework. Using this model, we then
introduce an ontology-based approach and a software prototype for modelling and
enforcing CAAC policies. In addition, we evaluate our policy ontology model and
framework by considering (i) the completeness of the ontology concepts,
specifying different context-aware user-role and role-permission assignment
policies from the healthcare scenarios; (ii) the correctness and consistency of
the ontology semantics, assessing the core and domain-specific ontologies
through the healthcare case study; and (iii) the performance of the framework
by means of response time. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility
of our framework and quantify the performance overhead of achieving
context-aware access control to information resources.

 <dc:creator>Van, Nam Tran</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Word segmentation is a basic problem in natural language processing. With the
languages having the complex writing system like the Khmer language in Southern
of Vietnam, this problem really very intractable, posing the significant
challenges. Although there are some experts in Vietnam as well as international
having deeply researched this problem, there are still no reasonable results
meeting the demand, in particular, no treated thoroughly the ambiguous
phenomenon, in the process of Khmer language processing so far. This paper
present a solution based on the syllable division into component clusters using
two syllable models proposed, thereby building a Khmer syllable database, is
still not actually available. This method using a lexical database updated from
the online Khmer dictionaries and some supported dictionaries serving role of
training data and complementary linguistic characteristics. Each component
cluster is labelled and located by the first and last letter to identify
entirety a syllable. This approach is workable and the test results achieve
high accuracy, eliminate the ambiguity, contribute to solving the problem of
word segmentation and applying efficiency in Khmer language processing.

 <dc:description>  Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied
to view synthesis problems. However, such CNN-based methods can suffer from
lack of texture details, shape distortions, or high computational complexity.
In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture for view synthesis called
&quot;Deep View Morphing&quot; that does not suffer from these issues. To synthesize a
middle view of two input images, a rectification network first rectifies the
two input images. An encoder-decoder network then generates dense
correspondences between the rectified images and blending masks to predict the
visibility of pixels of the rectified images in the middle view. A view
morphing network finally synthesizes the middle view using the dense
correspondences and blending masks. We experimentally show the proposed method
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based view synthesis method.

 <dc:description>  A covert communication system under block fading channels is considered where
users experience uncertainty about their channel knowledge. The transmitter
seeks to hide the covert communication to a private user by exploiting a
legitimate public communication link while the warden tries to detect this
covert communication by using a radiometer. We derive the exact expression for
the radiometers optimal threshold which determines the performance limit of the
wardens detector. Furthermore for given transmission outage constraints the
achievable rates for legitimate and covert users are analyzed while maintaining
a specific level of covertness. Our numerical results illustrate how the
achievable performance is affected by the channel uncertainty and required
level of covertness.

 <dc:description>  Residual units are wildly used for alleviating optimization difficulties when
building deep neural networks. However, the performance gain does not well
compensate the model size increase, indicating low parameter efficiency in
these residual units. In this work, we first revisit the residual function in
several variations of residual units and demonstrate that these residual
functions can actually be explained with a unified framework based on
generalized block term decomposition. Then, based on the new explanation, we
propose a new architecture, Collective Residual Unit (CRU), which enhances the
parameter efficiency of deep neural networks through collective tensor
factorization. CRU enables knowledge sharing across different residual units
using shared factors. Experimental results show that our proposed CRU Network
demonstrates outstanding parameter efficiency, achieving comparable
classification performance to ResNet-200 with the model size of ResNet-50. By
building a deeper network using CRU, we can achieve state-of-the-art single
model classification accuracy on ImageNet-1k and Places365-Standard benchmark
datasets. (Code and trained models are available on GitHub)

 <dc:description>  Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed
visually by physicians [1]. Classification with an automated method like CNN
[2, 3] shows potential for challenging tasks [1]. By now, the deep
convolutional neural networks are on par with human dermatologist [1]. This
abstract is dedicated on developing a Deep Learning method for ISIC [5] 2017
Skin Lesion Detection Competition hosted at [6] to classify the dermatology
pictures, which is aimed at improving the diagnostic accuracy rate and general
level of the human health. The challenge falls into three sub-challenges,
including Lesion Segmentation, Lesion Dermoscopic Feature Extraction and Lesion
Classification. This project only participates in the Lesion Classification
part. This algorithm is comprised of three steps: (1) original images
preprocessing, (2) modelling the processed images using CNN [2, 3] in Caffe [4]
framework, (3) predicting the test images and calculating the scores that
represent the likelihood of corresponding classification. The models are built
on the source images are using the Caffe [4] framework. The scores in
prediction step are obtained by two different models from the source images.

 <dc:description>  A multiple classifiers fusion localization technique using received signal
strengths (RSSs) of visible light is proposed, in which the proposed system
transmits different intensity modulated sinusoidal signals by LEDs and the
signals received by a Photo Diode (PD) placed at various grid points. First, we
obtain some {\emph{approximate}} received signal strengths (RSSs) fingerprints
by capturing the peaks of power spectral density (PSD) of the received signals
at each given grid point. Unlike the existing RSSs based algorithms, several
representative machine learning approaches are adopted to train multiple
classifiers based on these RSSs fingerprints. The multiple classifiers
localization estimators outperform the classical RSS-based LED localization
approaches in accuracy and robustness. To further improve the localization
performance, two robust fusion localization algorithms, namely, grid
independent least square (GI-LS) and grid dependent least square (GD-LS), are
proposed to combine the outputs of these classifiers. We also use a singular
value decomposition (SVD) based LS (LS-SVD) method to mitigate the numerical
stability problem when the prediction matrix is singular. Experiments conducted
on intensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD) systems have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that
the probability of having mean square positioning error (MSPE) of less than 5cm
achieved by GD-LS is improved by 93.03\% and 93.15\%, respectively, as compared
to those by the RSS ratio (RSSR) and RSS matching methods with the FFT length
of 2000.

 <dc:description>  Indoor localization based on SIngle Of Fingerprint (SIOF) is rather
susceptible to the changing environment, multipath, and non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) propagation. Building SIOF is also a very time-consuming process.
Recently, we first proposed a GrOup Of Fingerprints (GOOF) to improve the
localization accuracy and reduce the burden of building fingerprints. However,
the main drawback is the timeliness. In this paper, we propose a novel
localization framework by Fusing A Group Of fingerprinTs (FAGOT) based on
random forests. In the offline phase, we first build a GOOF from different
transformations of the received signals of multiple antennas. Then, we design
multiple GOOF strong classifiers based on Random Forests (GOOF-RF) by training
each fingerprint in the GOOF. In the online phase, we input the corresponding
transformations of the real measurements into these strong classifiers to
obtain multiple independent decisions. Finally, we propose a Sliding Window
aIded Mode-based (SWIM) fusion algorithm to balance the localization accuracy
and time. Our proposed approaches can work better in an unknown indoor
scenario. The burden of building fingerprints can also be reduced drastically.
We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms through simulations and real
experimental data using two Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)
platforms.

 <dc:description>  Epistemic planning can be used for decision making in multi-agent situations
with distributed knowledge and capabilities. Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) has
been shown to provide a very natural and expressive framework for epistemic
planning. In this paper, we aim to give an accessible introduction to DEL-based
epistemic planning. The paper starts with the most classical framework for
planning, STRIPS, and then moves towards epistemic planning in a number of
smaller steps, where each step is motivated by the need to be able to model
more complex planning scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In temporal logics, a central question is about the choice of modalities and
their relative expressive power, in comparison to the complexity of decision
problems such as satisfiability. In this tutorial, we will illustrate the study
of such questions over finite word models, first with logics for Unambiguous
Starfree Regular Languages (UL), originally defined by Schutzenberger, and then
for extensions with constraints, which appear in interval logics. We present
Deterministic temporal logics, with diverse sets of modalities, which also
characterize UL. The tools and techniques used go under the name of &quot;Turtle
Programs&quot; or &quot;Rankers&quot;. These are simple kinds of automata. We use properties
such as Ranker Directionality and Ranker Convexity to show that all these
logics have NP satisfiability. A recursive extension of some of these
modalities gives us the full power of first-order logic over finite linear
orders. We also discuss Interval Constraint modalities extending Deterministic
temporal logics, with intermediate expressiveness. These allow counting or
simple algebraic operations on paths. The complexity of these extended logics

 <dc:title>Finite Model Reasoning in Expressive Fragments of First-Order Logic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tendera, Lidia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Over the past two decades several fragments of first-order logic have been
identified and shown to have good computational and algorithmic properties, to
a great extent as a result of appropriately describing the image of the
standard translation of modal logic to first-order logic. This applies most
notably to the guarded fragment, where quantifiers are appropriately
relativized by atoms, and the fragment defined by restricting the number of
variables to two. The aim of this talk is to review recent work concerning
these fragments and their popular extensions. When presenting the material
special attention is given to decision procedures for the finite satisfiability
problems, as many of the fragments discussed contain infinity axioms. We
highlight most effective techniques used in this context, their advantages and
limitations. We also mention a few open directions of study.

 <dc:description>  Justification logics are modal-like logics with the additional capability of
recording the reason, or justification, for modalities in syntactic structures,
called justification terms. Justification logics can be seen as explicit
counterparts to modal logics. The behavior and interaction of agents in
distributed system is often modeled using logics of knowledge and time. In this
paper, we sketch some preliminary ideas on how the modal knowledge part of such
logics of knowledge and time could be replaced with an appropriate
justification logic.

 <dc:description>  Epistemic planning can be used for decision making in multi-agent situations
with distributed knowledge and capabilities. Recently, Dynamic Epistemic Logic
(DEL) has been shown to provide a very natural and expressive framework for
epistemic planning. We extend the DEL-based epistemic planning framework to
include perspective shifts, allowing us to define new notions of sequential and
conditional planning with implicit coordination. With these, it is possible to
solve planning tasks with joint goals in a decentralized manner without the
agents having to negotiate about and commit to a joint policy at plan time.
First we define the central planning notions and sketch the implementation of a
planning system built on those notions. Afterwards we provide some case studies
in order to evaluate the planner empirically and to show that the concept is
useful for multi-agent systems in practice.

 <dc:description>  The syntax of modal graphs is defined in terms of the continuous cut and
broken cut following Charles Peirce's notation in the gamma part of his
graphical logic of existential graphs. Graphical calculi for normal modal
logics are developed based on a reformulation of the graphical calculus for
classical propositional logic. These graphical calculi are of the nature of
deep inference. The relationship between graphical calculi and sequent calculi
for modal logics is shown by translations between graphs and modal formulas.

 <dc:title>Strong Completeness and the Finite Model Property for Bi-Intuitionistic

 <dc:description>  Bi-Intuitionistic Stable Tense Logics (BIST Logics) are tense logics with a
Kripke semantics where worlds in a frame are equipped with a pre-order as well
as with an accessibility relation which is 'stable' with respect to this
pre-order. BIST logics are extensions of a logic, BiSKt, which arose in the
semantic context of hypergraphs, since a special case of the pre-order can
represent the incidence structure of a hypergraph. In this paper we provide,
for the first time, a Hilbert-style axiomatisation of BISKt and prove the
strong completeness of BiSKt. We go on to prove strong completeness of a class
of BIST logics obtained by extending BiSKt by formulas of a certain form.
Moreover we show that the finite model property and the decidability hold for a
class of BIST logics.

 <dc:description>  Malware is constantly evolving. Although existing countermeasures have
success in malware detection, corresponding counter-countermeasures are always
emerging. In this study, a counter-countermeasure that avoids network-based
detection approaches by camouflaging malicious traffic as an innocuous protocol
is presented. The approach includes two steps: Traffic format transformation
and side-channel massage (SCM). Format transforming encryption (FTE) translates
protocol syntax to mimic another innocuous protocol while SCM obscures traffic
side-channels. The proposed approach is illustrated by transforming Zeus botnet
(Zbot) Command and Control (C&amp;C) traffic into smart grid Phasor Measurement
Unit (PMU) data. The experimental results show that the transformed traffic is
identified by Wireshark as synchrophasor protocol, and the transformed protocol
fools current side-channel attacks. Moreover, it is shown that a real smart
grid Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) accepts the false PMU data.

 <dc:description>  Both enterprise and national firewalls filter network connections. For data
forensics and botnet removal applications, it is important to establish the
information source. In this paper, we describe a data transport layer which
allows a client to transfer encrypted data that provides no discernible
information regarding the data source. We use a domain generation algorithm
(DGA) to encode AES encrypted data into domain names that current tools are
unable to reliably differentiate from valid domain names. The domain names are
registered using (free) dynamic DNS services. The data transmission format is
not vulnerable to Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).

 <dc:description>  This study proposes a fully convolutional network (FCN) model for raw
waveform-based speech enhancement. The proposed system performs speech
enhancement in an end-to-end (i.e., waveform-in and waveform-out) manner, which
dif-fers from most existing denoising methods that process the magnitude
spectrum (e.g., log power spectrum (LPS)) only. Because the fully connected
layers, which are involved in deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional
neural networks (CNN), may not accurately characterize the local information of
speech signals, particularly with high frequency components, we employed fully
convolutional layers to model the waveform. More specifically, FCN consists of
only convolutional layers and thus the local temporal structures of speech
signals can be efficiently and effectively preserved with relatively few
weights. Experimental results show that DNN- and CNN-based models have limited
capability to restore high frequency components of waveforms, thus leading to
decreased intelligibility of enhanced speech. By contrast, the proposed FCN
model can not only effectively recover the waveforms but also outperform the
LPS-based DNN baseline in terms of short-time objective intelligibility (STOI)
and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). In addition, the number of
model parameters in FCN is approximately only 0.2% compared with that in both
DNN and CNN.

 <dc:description>  Certificate transparency (CT) is an elegant mechanism designed to detect when
a certificate authority (CA) has issued a certificate incorrectly. Many CAs now
support CT and it is being actively deployed in browsers. However, a number of
privacy-related challenges remain. In this paper we propose practical solutions
to two issues. First, we develop a mechanism that enables web browsers to audit
a CT log without violating user privacy. Second, we extend CT to support
non-public subdomains.

 <dc:description>  Users are rarely familiar with the content of a data source they are
querying, and therefore cannot avoid using keywords that do not exist in the
data source. Traditional systems may respond with an empty result, causing
dissatisfaction, while the data source in effect holds semantically related
content. In this paper we study this no-but-semantic-match problem on XML
keyword search and propose a solution which enables us to present the top-k
semantically related results to the user. Our solution involves two steps: (a)
extracting semantically related candidate queries from the original query and
(b) processing candidate queries and retrieving the top-k semantically related
results. Candidate queries are generated by replacement of non-mapped keywords
with candidate keywords obtained from an ontological knowledge base. Candidate
results are scored using their cohesiveness and their similarity to the
original query. Since the number of queries to process can be large, with each
result having to be analyzed, we propose pruning techniques to retrieve the
top-$k$ results efficiently. We develop two query processing algorithms based
on our pruning techniques. Further, we exploit a property of the candidate
queries to propose a technique for processing multiple queries in batch, which
improves the performance substantially. Extensive experiments on two real
datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches.

 <dc:description>  An efficient adaptive algorithm for the removal of Salt and Pepper noise from
gray scale and color image is presented in this paper. In this proposed method
first a 3X3 window is taken and the central pixel of the window is considered
as the processing pixel. If the processing pixel is found as uncorrupted, then
it is left unchanged. And if the processing pixel is found corrupted one, then
the window size is increased according to the conditions given in the proposed
algorithm. Finally the processing pixel or the central pixel is replaced by
either the mean, median or trimmed value of the elements in the current window
depending upon different conditions of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm
efficiently removes noise at all densities with better Peak Signal to Noise
Ratio (PSNR) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF). The proposed algorithm is
compared with different existing algorithms like MF, AMF, MDBUTMF, MDBPTGMF and
AWMF.

 <dc:description>  Opinion formation in the population has attracted extensive research
interest. Various models have been introduced and studied, including the ones
with individuals' free will allowing them to change their opinions. Such
models, however, have not taken into account the fact that individuals with
different opinions may have different levels of loyalty, and consequently,
different probabilities of changing their opinions. In this work, we study on
how the non-uniform distribution of the opinion changing probability may affect
the final state of opinion distribution. By simulating a few different cases
with different symmetric and asymmetric non-uniform patterns of opinion
changing probabilities, we demonstrate the significant effects that the

 <dc:description>  Opinion formation has been gaining increasing research interests recently,
and various models have been proposed. These models, however, have their
limitations, among which noticeably include (i) it is generally assumed that
adjacent nodes holding similar opinions will further reduce their difference in
between, while adjacent nodes holding significantly different opinions would
either do nothing, or cut the link in between them; (ii) opinion mutation,
which describes &quot;opinion changes not due to neighborhood influences&quot; in real
life, is typically random. While such models enjoy their simplicity and
nevertheless help reveal lots of useful insights, they lack the capability of
describing many complex behaviors which we may easily observe in real life. In
this paper, we propose a new bit-string modeling approach. Preliminary study on
the new model demonstrates its great potentials in revealing complex behaviors
of social opinion evolution and formation.

 <dc:description>  It is interesting and of significant importance to investigate how network
structures co-evolve with opinions. The existing models of such co-evolution
typically lead to the final states where network nodes either reach a global
consensus or break into separated communities, each of which holding its own
community consensus. Such results, however, can hardly explain the richness of
real-life observations that opinions are always diversified with no global or
even community consensus, and people seldom, if not never, totally cut off
themselves from dissenters. In this article, we show that, a simple model
integrating consensus formation, link rewiring and opinion change allows
complex system dynamics to emerge, driving the system into a dynamic
equilibrium with co-existence of diversified opinions. Specifically, similar
opinion holders may form into communities yet with no strict community
consensus; and rather than being separated into disconnected communities,
different communities remain to be interconnected by non-trivial proportion of
inter-community links. More importantly, we show that the complex dynamics may
lead to different numbers of communities at steady state with a given tolerance
between different opinion holders. We construct a framework for theoretically
analyzing the co-evolution process. Theoretical analysis and extensive
simulation results reveal some useful insights into the complex co-evolution
process, including the formation of dynamic equilibrium, the phase transition
between different steady states with different numbers of communities, and the
dynamics between opinion distribution and network modularity, etc.

 <dc:description>  Suffix trees have emerged to be very fast for pattern searching yielding O
(m) time, where m is the pattern size. Unfortunately their high memory
requirements make it impractical to work with huge amounts of data. We present
a memory efficient algorithm of a generalized suffix tree which reduces the
space size by a factor of 10 when the size of the pattern is known beforehand.
Experiments on the chromosomes and Pizza&amp;Chili corpus show significant
advantages of our algorithm over standard linear time suffix tree construction
in terms of memory usage for pattern searching.

 <dc:description>  In the Google Play store, an introduction page is associated with every
mobile application (app) for users to acquire its details, including
screenshots, description, reviews, etc. However, it remains a challenge to
identify what items influence users most when downloading an app. To explore
users' perspective, we conduct a survey to inquire about this question. The
results of survey suggest that the participants pay most attention to the app
description which gives users a quick overview of the app. Although there exist
some guidelines about how to write a good app description to attract more
downloads, it is hard to define a high quality app description. Meanwhile,
there is no tool to evaluate the quality of app description. In this paper, we
employ the method of crowdsourcing to extract the attributes that affect the
app descriptions' quality. First, we download some app descriptions from Google
Play, then invite some participants to rate their quality with the score from
one (very poor) to five (very good). The participants are also requested to
explain every score's reasons. By analyzing the reasons, we extract the
attributes that the participants consider important during evaluating the
quality of app descriptions. Finally, we train the supervised learning models
on a sample of 100 app descriptions. In our experiments, the support vector
machine model obtains up to 62% accuracy. In addition, we find that the
permission, the number of paragraphs and the average number of words in one
feature play key roles in defining a good app description.

 <dc:title>Functions that Emerge through End-to-End Reinforcement Learning - The
  Direction for Artificial General Intelligence -</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shibata, Katsunari</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, triggered by the impressive results in TV-games or game of Go by
Google DeepMind, end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) is collecting
attentions. Although little is known, the author's group has propounded this
framework for around 20 years and already has shown various functions that
emerge in a neural network (NN) through RL. In this paper, they are introduced
again at this timing.
  &quot;Function Modularization&quot; approach is deeply penetrated subconsciously. The
inputs and outputs for a learning system can be raw sensor signals and motor
commands. &quot;State space&quot; or &quot;action space&quot; generally used in RL show the
existence of functional modules. That has limited reinforcement learning to
learning only for the action-planning module. In order to extend reinforcement
learning to learning of the entire function on a huge degree of freedom of a
massively parallel learning system and to explain or develop human-like
intelligence, the author has believed that end-to-end RL from sensors to motors
using a recurrent NN (RNN) becomes an essential key. Especially in the higher
functions, this approach is very effective by being free from the need to
decide their inputs and outputs.
  The functions that emerge, we have confirmed, through RL using a NN cover a
broad range from real robot learning with raw camera pixel inputs to
acquisition of dynamic functions in a RNN. Those are (1)image recognition,
(2)color constancy (optical illusion), (3)sensor motion (active recognition),
(4)hand-eye coordination and hand reaching movement, (5)explanation of brain
activities, (6)communication, (7)knowledge transfer, (8)memory, (9)selective
attention, (10)prediction, (11)exploration. The end-to-end RL enables the
emergence of very flexible comprehensive functions that consider many things in
parallel although it is difficult to give the boundary of each function
clearly.

 <dc:description>  Geometric moment invariants (GMIs) have been widely used as basic tool in
shape analysis and information retrieval. Their structure and characteristics
determine efficiency and effectiveness. Two fundamental building blocks or
generating functions (GFs) for invariants are discovered, which are dot product
and vector product of point vectors in Euclidean space. The primitive
invariants (PIs) can be derived by carefully selecting different products of
GFs and calculating the corresponding multiple integrals, which translates
polynomials of coordinates of point vectors into geometric moments. Then the
invariants themselves are expressed in the form of product of moments. This
procedure is just like DNA encoding proteins. All GMIs available in the
literature can be decomposed into linear combinations of PIs. This paper shows
that Hu's seven well known GMIs in computer vision have a more deep structure,
which can be further divided into combination of simpler PIs. In practical
uses, low order independent GMIs are of particular interest. In this paper, a
set of PIs for similarity transformation and affine transformation in 2D are
presented, which are simpler to use, and some of which are newly reported. The
discovery of the two generating functions provides a new perspective of better
understanding shapes in 2D and 3D Euclidean spaces, and the method proposed can
be further extended to higher dimensional spaces and different manifolds, such
as curves, surfaces and so on.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we establish a baseline for object symmetry detection in
complex backgrounds by presenting a new benchmark and an end-to-end deep
learning approach, opening up a promising direction for symmetry detection in
the wild. The new benchmark, named Sym-PASCAL, spans challenges including
object diversity, multi-objects, part-invisibility, and various complex
backgrounds that are far beyond those in existing datasets. The proposed
symmetry detection approach, named Side-output Residual Network (SRN),
leverages output Residual Units (RUs) to fit the errors between the object
symmetry groundtruth and the outputs of RUs. By stacking RUs in a
deep-to-shallow manner, SRN exploits the 'flow' of errors among multiple scales
to ease the problems of fitting complex outputs with limited layers,
suppressing the complex backgrounds, and effectively matching object symmetry
of different scales. Experimental results validate both the benchmark and its
challenging aspects related to realworld images, and the state-of-the-art
performance of our symmetry detection approach. The benchmark and the code for
SRN are publicly available at https://github.com/KevinKecc/SRN.

 <dc:description>  Confidently distinguishing a malicious intrusion over a network is an
important challenge. Most intrusion detection system evaluations have been
performed in a closed set protocol in which only classes seen during training
are considered during classification. Thus far, there has been no realistic
application in which novel types of behaviors unseen at training -- unknown
classes as it were -- must be recognized for manual categorization. This paper
comparatively evaluates malware classification using both closed set and open
set protocols for intrusion recognition on the KDDCUP'99 dataset. In contrast
to much of the previous work, we employ a fine-grained recognition protocol, in
which the dataset is loosely open set -- i.e., recognizing individual intrusion
types -- e.g., &quot;sendmail&quot;, &quot;snmp guess&quot;, ..., etc., rather than more general
attack categories (e.g., &quot;DoS&quot;,&quot;Probe&quot;,&quot;R2L&quot;,&quot;U2R&quot;,&quot;Normal&quot;). We also employ
two different classifier types -- Gaussian RBF kernel SVMs, which are not
theoretically guaranteed to bound open space risk, and W-SVMs, which are
theoretically guaranteed to bound open space risk. We find that the W-SVM
offers superior performance under the open set regime, particularly as the cost
of misclassifying unknown classes at query time (i.e., classes not present in
the training set) increases. Results of performance tradeoff with respect to
cost of unknown as well as discussion of the ramifications of these findings in
an operational setting are presented.

 <dc:description>  Our desire and fascination with intelligent machines dates back to the
antiquity's mythical automaton Talos, Aristotle's mode of mechanical thought
(syllogism) and Heron of Alexandria's mechanical machines and automata.
However, the quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is troubled with
repeated failures of strategies and approaches throughout the history. This
decade has seen a shift in interest towards bio-inspired software and hardware,
with the assumption that such mimicry entails intelligence. Though these steps
are fruitful in certain directions and have advanced automation, their singular
design focus renders them highly inefficient in achieving AGI. Which set of
requirements have to be met in the design of AGI? What are the limits in the
design of the artificial? Here, a careful examination of computation in
biological systems hints that evolutionary tinkering of contextual processing
of information enabled by a hierarchical architecture is the key to build AGI.

 <dc:description>  There are many distributed systems which use a leader in their logic. When
such systems need to be fault tolerant and the current leader suffers a

choose a new leader. In this paper I present a new fault tolerant algorithm
which elects a new leader based on a random roulette wheel selection.

 <dc:description>  The U.S Government has been the target for cyber-attacks from all over the
world. Just recently, former President Obama accused the Russian government of
the leaking emails to Wikileaks and declared that the U.S. might be forced to
respond. While Russia denied involvement, it is clear that the U.S. has to take
some defensive measures to protect its data infrastructure. Insider threats
have been the cause of other sensitive information leaks too, including the
infamous Edward Snowden incident. Most of the recent leaks were in the form of
text. Due to the nature of text data, security classifications are assigned
manually. In an adversarial environment, insiders can leak texts through
E-mail, printers, or any untrusted channels. The optimal defense is to
automatically detect the unstructured text security class and enforce the
appropriate protection mechanism without degrading services or daily tasks.
Unfortunately, existing Data Leak Prevention (DLP) systems are not well suited
for detecting unstructured texts. In this paper, we compare two recent
approaches in the literature for text security classification, evaluating them
on actual sensitive text data from the WikiLeaks dataset.

 <dc:description>  We extend the notion of localic completion of generalised metric spaces by
Steven Vickers to the setting of generalised uniform spaces. A generalised
uniform space (gus) is a set X equipped with a family of generalised metrics on
X, where a generalised metric on X is a map from the product of X to the upper
reals satisfying zero self-distance law and triangle inequality.
  For a symmetric generalised uniform space, the localic completion lifts its
generalised uniform structure to a point-free generalised uniform structure.
This point-free structure induces a complete generalised uniform structure on
the set of formal points of the localic completion that gives the standard
completion of the original gus with Cauchy filters.
  We extend the localic completion to a full and faithful functor from the
category of locally compact uniform spaces into that of overt locally compact
completely regular formal topologies. Moreover, we give an elementary
characterisation of the cover of the localic completion of a locally compact
uniform space that simplifies the existing characterisation for metric spaces.
These results generalise the corresponding results for metric spaces by Erik
Palmgren.
  Furthermore, we show that the localic completion of a symmetric gus is
equivalent to the point-free completion of the uniform formal topology
associated with the gus.
  We work in Aczel's constructive set theory CZF with the Regular Extension
Axiom. Some of our results also require Countable Choice.

 <dc:description>  App store analysis has become an important discipline in recent software
engineering research. It empirically studies apps using information mined from
their distribution platforms. Information provided by users, such as app
reviews, are of high interest to developers. Commercial providers such as App
Annie analyzing this information became an important source for companies
developing and marketing mobile apps. In this paper, we perform an exploratory
study, which analyzes over seven million reviews from the Apple AppStore
regarding their emotional sentiment. Since recent research in this field used
sentiments to detail and refine their results, we aim to gain deeper insights
into the nature of sentiments in user reviews. In this study we try to evaluate
whether or not the emotional sentiment can be an informative feature for
software engineers, as well as pitfalls of its usage. We present our initial
results and discuss how they can be interpreted from the software engineering
perspective.

 <dc:description>  The notion of 1-planarity is among the most natural and most studied
generalizations of graph planarity. A graph is 1-planar if it has an embedding
where each edge is crossed by at most another edge. The study of 1-planar
graphs dates back to more than fifty years ago and, recently, it has driven
increasing attention in the areas of graph theory, graph algorithms, graph
drawing, and computational geometry. This annotated bibliography aims to
provide a guiding reference to researchers who want to have an overview of the
large body of literature about 1-planar graphs. It reviews the current
literature covering various research streams about 1-planarity, such as
characterization and recognition, combinatorial properties, and geometric
representations. As an additional contribution, we offer a list of open
problems on 1-planar graphs.

 <dc:description>  The study on point sources in astronomical images is of special importance,
since most energetic celestial objects in the Universe exhibit a point-like
appearance. An approach to recognize the point sources (PS) in the X-ray
astronomical images using our newly designed granular binary-tree support
vector machine (GBT-SVM) classifier is proposed. First, all potential point
sources are located by peak detection on the image. The image and spectral
features of these potential point sources are then extracted. Finally, a
classifier to recognize the true point sources is build through the extracted
features. Experiments and applications of our approach on real X-ray
astronomical images are demonstrated. comparisons between our approach and
other SVM-based classifiers are also carried out by evaluating the precision
and recall rates, which prove that our approach is better and achieves a higher
accuracy of around 89%.

 <dc:description>  Approximate computing has shown to provide new ways to improve performance
and power consumption of error-resilient applications. While many of these
applications can be found in image processing, data classification or machine
learning, we demonstrate its suitability to a problem from scientific
computing. Utilizing the self-correcting behavior of iterative algorithms, we
show that approximate computing can be applied to the calculation of inverse
matrix p-th roots which are required in many applications in scientific
computing. Results show great opportunities to reduce the computational effort
and bandwidth required for the execution of the discussed algorithm, especially
when targeting special accelerator hardware.

 <dc:title>On the Deployment of Distributed Antennas for Wireless Power Transfer
  with Safety Electromagnetic Radiation Level Requirement</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Chao</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhao, Guanghe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The extremely low efficiency is regarded as the bottleneck of Wireless Power
Transfer (WPT) technology. To tackle this problem, either enlarging the
transfer power or changing the infrastructure of WPT system could be an
intuitively proposed way. However, the drastically important issue on the user
exposure of electromagnetic radiation is rarely considered while we try to
improve the efficiency of WPT. In this paper, a Distributed Antenna Power
Beacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where these antennas are uniformly distributed
on a circle is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation
level (SERL) requirement. In this model, three key questions are intended to be
answered: 1) With the SERL, what is the performance of the harvested power at
the users ? 2) How do we configure the parameters to maximize the efficiency of
WPT? 3) Under the same constraints, does the DA-PB still have performance gain
than the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB)? First, the minimum antenna height of
DA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation
power density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL
published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the
closed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user
in the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order
to maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed
antennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the
typical value $2$ and $4$. For comparison, the CA-PB is also analyzed as a
benchmark. Simulation results verify our derived theoretical results. And it is
shown that the proposed DA-PB indeed achieves larger average harvested DC power
than CA-PB and can improve the efficiency of WPT.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have shown promise in image generation and
semi-supervised learning (SSL). However, existing GANs in SSL have two
problems: (1) the generator and the discriminator (i.e. the classifier) may not
be optimal at the same time; and (2) the generator cannot control the semantics
of the generated samples. The problems essentially arise from the two-player
formulation, where a single discriminator shares incompatible roles of
identifying fake samples and predicting labels and it only estimates the data
without considering the labels. To address the problems, we present triple
generative adversarial net (Triple-GAN), which consists of three players---a
generator, a discriminator and a classifier. The generator and the classifier
characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels, and the
discriminator solely focuses on identifying fake image-label pairs. We design
compatible utilities to ensure that the distributions characterized by the
classifier and the generator both converge to the data distribution. Our
results on various datasets demonstrate that Triple-GAN as a unified model can
simultaneously (1) achieve the state-of-the-art classification results among
deep generative models, and (2) disentangle the classes and styles of the input
and transfer smoothly in the data space via interpolation in the latent space
class-conditionally.

 <dc:description>  A Robust Markov Decision Process (RMDP) is a sequential decision making model
that accounts for uncertainty in the parameters of dynamic systems. This
uncertainty introduces difficulties in learning an optimal policy, especially
for environments with large state spaces. We propose two algorithms, RTD-DQN
and Deep-RoK, for solving large-scale RMDPs using nonlinear approximation
schemes such as deep neural networks. The RTD-DQN algorithm incorporates the
robust Bellman temporal difference error into a robust loss function, yielding
robust policies for the agent. The Deep-RoK algorithm is a robust Bayesian
method, based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), that accounts for both the
uncertainty in the weights of the approximated value function and the
uncertainty in the transition probabilities, improving the robustness of the
agent. We provide theoretical results for our approach and test the proposed
algorithms on a continuous state domain.

 <dc:description>  Automatic differentiation is involved for long in applied mathematics as an
alternative to finite difference to improve the accuracy of numerical
computation of derivatives. Each time a numerical minimization is involved,
automatic differentiation can be used. In between formal derivation and
standard numerical schemes, this approach is based on software solutions
applying mechanically the chain rule to obtain an exact value for the desired
derivative. It has a cost in memory and cpu consumption. For participants of
financial markets (banks, insurances, financial intermediaries, etc), computing
derivatives is needed to obtain the sensitivity of its exposure to well-defined
potential market moves. It is a way to understand variations of their balance
sheets in specific cases. Since the 2008 crisis, regulation demand to compute
this kind of exposure to many different case, to be sure market participants
are aware and ready to face a wide spectrum of configurations. This paper shows
how automatic differentiation provides a partial answer to this recent
explosion of computation to perform. One part of the answer is a
straightforward application of Adjoint Algorithmic Differentiation (AAD), but
it is not enough. Since financial sensitivities involves specific functions and
mix differentiation with Monte-Carlo simulations, dedicated tools and
associated theoretical results are needed. We give here short introductions to
typical cases arising when one use AAD on financial markets.

 <dc:title>The Formal Semantics of Rascal Light</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Rascal is a high-level transformation language that aims to simplify software
language engineering tasks like defining program syntax, analyzing and
transforming programs, and performing code generation. The language provides
several features including built-in collections (lists, sets, maps), algebraic
data-types, powerful pattern matching operations with backtracking, and
high-level traversals supporting multiple strategies. Interaction between
different language features can be difficult to comprehend, since most features
are semantically rich. The report provides a well-defined formal semantics for
a large subset of Rascal, called Rascal Light, suitable for developing formal
techniques, e.g., type systems and static analyses. Additionally, the report
states and proofs a series of interesting properties of the semantics,
including purity of backtracking, strong typing, partial progress and the
existence of a terminating subset.

 <dc:description>  Entity information network is used to describe structural relationships
between entities. Taking advantage of its extension and heterogeneity, entity
information network is more and more widely applied to relationship modeling.
Recent years, lots of researches about entity information network modeling have
been proposed, while seldom of them concentrate on equipment-standard system
with properties of multi-layer, multi-dimension and multi-scale. In order to
efficiently deal with some complex issues in equipment-standard system such as
standard revising, standard controlling, and production designing, a
heterogeneous information network model for equipment-standard system is
proposed in this paper. Three types of entities and six types of relationships
are considered in the proposed model. Correspondingly, several different
similarity-measuring methods are used in the modeling process. The experiments
show that the heterogeneous information network model established in this paper
can reflect relationships between entities accurately. Meanwhile, the modeling
process has a good performance on time consumption.

 <dc:description>  Bird sounds possess distinctive spectral structure which may exhibit small
shifts in spectrum depending on the bird species and environmental conditions.
In this paper, we propose using convolutional recurrent neural networks on the
task of automated bird audio detection in real-life environments. In the
proposed method, convolutional layers extract high dimensional, local frequency
shift invariant features, while recurrent layers capture longer term
dependencies between the features extracted from short time frames. This method
achieves 88.5% Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) score on the unseen evaluation data
and obtains the second place in the Bird Audio Detection challenge.

 <dc:description>  Acoustic beamforming with a microphone array represents an adequate
technology for remote acoustic surveillance, as the system has no mechanical
parts and it has moderate size. However, in order to accomplish real
implementation, several challenges need to be addressed, such as array
geometry, microphone characteristics, and the digital beamforming algorithms.
This paper presents a simulated analysis on the effect of the array geometry in
the beamforming response. Two geometries are considered, namely, the linear and
the circular geometry. The analysis is performed with computer simulations to
mimic reality. The future steps comprise the construction of the physical
microphone array, and the software implementation on a multichannel digital
signal processing (DSP) system.

 <dc:description>  The capacity region of a two-transmitter Gaussian multiple access channel
(MAC) under average input power constraints is studied, when the receiver
employs a zero-threshold one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). It is
proved that the input distributions of the two transmitters that achieve the
boundary points of the capacity region are discrete. Based on the position of a
boundary point, upper bounds on the number of the mass points of the
corresponding distributions are derived.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a robust control architecture for the whole-body motion control
of torque controlled robots with arms and legs. The method is based on the
robust control of contact forces in order to track a planned Center of Mass
trajectory. Its appeal lies in the ability to guarantee robust stability and
performance despite rigid body model mismatch, actuator dynamics, delays,
contact surface stiffness, and unobserved ground profiles. Furthermore, we
introduce a task space decomposition approach which removes the coupling
effects between contact force controller and the other non-contact controllers.
Finally, we verify our control performance on a quadruped robot and compare its
performance to a standard inverse dynamics approach on hardware.

 <dc:title>Performance Analysis of Near-Optimal Energy Buffer Aided Wireless

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a wireless powered communication system, where an
energy harvesting (EH) node harvests energy from a radio frequency (RF) signal
broadcasted by an access point (AP) in the downlink (DL). The node stores the
harvested energy in an energy buffer and uses the stored energy to transmit
data to the AP in the uplink (UL). We investigate two simple online
transmission policies for the EH node, namely a best-effort policy and an
on-off policy, which do not require knowledge of the EH profile nor channel
knowledge. In particular, for both policies, the EH node transmits in each time
slot with a constant desired power if sufficient energy is available in its
energy buffer. Otherwise, the node transmits with the maximum possible power in
the best-effort policy and remains silent in the on-off policy. For both
policies, we use the theory of discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains to
analyze the limiting distribution of the stored energy for finite- and
infinite-size energy buffers. We provide this limiting distribution in closed
form for a Nakagami-m fading DL channel and analyze the outage probability for
a Nakagami-m fading UL channel. All derived analytical results are not limited
to EH via RF WPT but are applicable for any independent and identically
distributed EH process, originating from e.g. solar and wind energy. Our
results reveal that, for low outage probabilities, the best-effort policy is
superior to the on-off policy and the optimal constant UL transmit power of the
EH node that minimizes the outage probability is always less than the average
harvested power but increases with the capacity of the energy buffer. The
opposite behaviour is observed for high outage probabilities. Furthermore, we
show that the minimum outage probability of the two proposed policies closely
approaches the outage probability of the optimal offline power allocation
policy.

 <dc:description>  Time spent in leisure is not a minor research question as it is acknowledged
as a key aspect of one's quality of life. The primary aim of this article is to
qualify time and Internet use of Italian Generation Y beyond media hype and
assumptions. To this aim, we apply a multidimensional extension of Item
Response Theory models to the Italian &quot;Multipurpose survey on households:
aspects of daily life&quot; to ascertain the relevant dimensions of Generation Y
time-use. We show that the use of technology is neither the first nor the
foremost time-use activity of Italian Generation Y, who still prefers to use
its time to socialise and have fun with friends in a non media-medalled manner.

 <dc:description>  We study the NP-hard Minimum Shared Edges (MSE) problem on graphs: decide
whether it is possible to route $p$ paths from a start vertex to a target
vertex in a given graph while using at most $k$ edges more than once. We show
that MSE can be decided on bounded (i.e. finite) grids in linear time when both
dimensions are either small or large compared to the number $p$ of paths. On
the contrary, we show that MSE remains NP-hard on subgraphs of bounded grids.
Finally, we study MSE from a parametrised complexity point of view. It is known
that MSE is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the number $p$ of paths.
We show that, under standard complexity-theoretical assumptions, the problem
parametrised by the combined parameter $k$, $p$, maximum degree, diameter, and
treewidth does not admit a polynomial-size problem kernel, even when restricted
to planar graphs.

 <dc:title>Use of the journal impact factor for assessing individual articles need
  not be wrong</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Waltman, Ludo</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Traag, Vincent A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most scientometricians reject the use of the journal impact factor for
assessing individual articles and their authors. The well-known San Francisco
Declaration on Research Assessment also strongly objects against this way of
using the impact factor. Arguments against the use of the impact factor at the
level of individual articles are often based on statistical considerations. The
skewness of journal citation distributions typically plays a central role in
these arguments. We present a theoretical analysis of statistical arguments
against the use of the impact factor at the level of individual articles. Our
analysis shows that these arguments do not support the conclusion that the
impact factor should not be used for assessing individual articles. In fact,
our computer simulations demonstrate the possibility that the impact factor is
a more accurate indicator of the value of an article than the number of
citations the article has received. The debate on the impact factor and its use
in research evaluations is very important, but this debate should not be based
on misplaced statistical arguments.

 <dc:description>  To design trustworthy robots, we need to understand the impact factors of
trust: people's attitudes, experience, and characteristics; the robot's
physical design, reliability, and performance; a task's specification and the
circumstances under which it is to be performed, e.g. at leisure or under time
pressure. As robots are used for a wide variety of tasks and applications,
robot designers ought to be provided with evidence and guidance, to inform
their decisions to achieve safe, trustworthy and efficient human-robot
interactions. In this work, the impact factors of trust in a collaborative
manufacturing scenario are studied by conducting an experiment with a real
robot and participants where a physical object was assembled and then
disassembled. Objective and subjective measures were employed to evaluate the
development of trust, under faulty and non-faulty robot conditions, and the
effect of previous experience with robots, and personality traits. Our findings
highlight differences when compared to other, more social, scenarios with
robotic assistants (such as a home care assistant), in that the condition
(faulty or not) does not have a significant impact on the human's perception of
the robot in terms of human-likeliness, likeability, trustworthiness, and even
competence. However, personality and previous experience do have an effect on
how the robot is perceived by participants, even though that is relatively
small.

 <dc:title>A scalable line-independent design algorithm for voltage and frequency
  control in AC islanded microgrids</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tucci, Michele</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Trecate, Giancarlo Ferrari</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a decentralized control synthesis procedure for stabilizing
voltage and frequency in AC Islanded microGrids (ImGs), i.e. electrical
networks composed of interconnected Distributed Generation Units (DGUs), power
lines and loads. The presented approach enables Plug-and-Play (PnP) operations,
meaning that DGUs can be arbitrarily added or removed without compromising the
overall ImG stability. The main feature of our approach is that, differently
from [Riverso et al., 2015], the proposed PnP design algorithm is
line-independent. This implies that (i) the synthesis of each local controller
does not require anymore the model of power lines connecting neighboring DGUs,
and (ii) whenever a new DGU is plugged-in, DGUs physically connected to it do
not have to retune their regulators. Theoretical results are validated by
simulating in PSCAD the behavior of a 10-DGUs ImG.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we provide details of a robotic system that can automate the
task of picking and stowing objects from and to a rack in an e-commerce
fulfillment warehouse. The system primarily comprises of four main modules: (1)
Perception module responsible for recognizing query objects and localizing them
in the 3-dimensional robot workspace; (2) Planning module generates necessary
paths that the robot end- effector has to take for reaching the objects in the
rack or in the tote; (3) Calibration module that defines the physical workspace
for the robot visible through the on-board vision system; and (4) Gripping and
suction system for picking and stowing different kinds of objects. The
perception module uses a faster region-based Convolutional Neural Network
(R-CNN) to recognize objects. We designed a novel two finger gripper that
incorporates pneumatic valve based suction effect to enhance its ability to
pick different kinds of objects. The system was developed by IITK-TCS team for
participation in the Amazon Picking Challenge 2016 event. The team secured a
fifth place in the stowing task in the event. The purpose of this article is to
share our experiences with students and practicing engineers and enable them to
build similar systems. The overall efficacy of the system is demonstrated
through several simulation as well as real-world experiments with actual
robots.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of measurement compression with side information in
the one-shot setting with shared randomness. In this problem, Alice shares a
pure state with Referee and Bob and she performs a measurement on her
registers. She wishes to communicate the outcome of this measurement to Bob
using shared randomness only, in such a way that the outcome that Bob receives
is correctly correlated with Reference and Bob's own registers. We provide a
protocol based on convex-split and position based decoding with its
communication upper bounded in terms of smooth-max and hypothesis testing
divergences.
  We also study the randomness cost of our protocol in both one-shot and
asymptotic and i.i.d. setting. By generalizing the convex-split technique to
incorporate pair-wise independent random variables, we show that our one shot
protocol requires small number of bits of shared randomness. This allows us to
construct a new protocol in the asymptotic and i.i.d. setting, which is optimal
in both the number of bits of communication and the number of bits of shared
randomness required.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a unified end-to-end approach to build a large
scale Visual Search and Recommendation system for e-commerce. Previous works
have targeted these problems in isolation. We believe a more effective and
elegant solution could be obtained by tackling them together. We propose a
unified Deep Convolutional Neural Network architecture, called VisNet, to learn
embeddings to capture the notion of visual similarity, across several semantic
granularities. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach for the task of
image retrieval, by comparing against the state-of-the-art on the Exact
Street2Shop dataset. We then share the design decisions and trade-offs made
while deploying the model to power Visual Recommendations across a catalog of
50M products, supporting 2K queries a second at Flipkart, India's largest
e-commerce company. The deployment of our solution has yielded a significant
business impact, as measured by the conversion-rate.

 <dc:description>  Optical backbone networks carry a huge amount of bandwidth and serve as a key
enabling technology to provide telecommunication connectivity across the world.
Hence, in events of network component (node/link) failures, communication
networks may suffer from huge amount of bandwidth loss and service disruptions.
Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc., occur at
different places around the world, causing severe communication service
disruptions due to network component failures. Most of the previous works on
optical network survivability assume that the failures are going to occur in
future, and the network is made survivable to ensure connectivity in events of
failures. With the advancements in seismology, the predictions of earthquakes
are becoming more accurate. Earthquakes have been a major cause of
telecommunication service disruption in the past. Hence, the information
provided by the meteorological departments and other similar agencies of
different countries may be helpful in designing networks that are more robust
against earthquakes. In this work, we consider the actual information provided
by the Indian meteorological department (IMD) on seismic zones, and earthquakes
occurred in the past in India, and propose a scheme to improve the
survivability of the existing Indian optical network through minute changes in
network topology. Simulations show significant improvement in the network
survivability can be achieved using the proposed scheme in events of
earthquakes.

 <dc:title>On the family of 0/1-polytopes with NP-complete non-adjacency relation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Maksimenko, Alexander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 1995 T. Matsui considered a special family 0/1-polytopes for which the
problem of recognizing the non-adjacency of two arbitrary vertices is
NP-complete. In 2012 the author of this paper established that all the
polytopes of this family are present as faces in the polytopes associated with
the following NP-complete problems: the traveling salesman problem, the
3-satisfiability problem, the knapsack problem, the set covering problem, the
partial ordering problem, the cube subgraph problem, and some others. In
particular, it follows that for these families the non-adjacency relation is
also NP-complete. On the other hand, it is known that the vertex adjacency
criterion is polynomial for polytopes of the following NP-complete problems:
the maximum independent set problem, the set packing and the set partitioning
problem, the three-index assignment problem. It is shown that none of the
polytopes of the above-mentioned special family (with the exception of a
one-dimensional segment) can be the face of polytopes associated with the
problems of the maximum independent set, of a set packing and partitioning, and
of 3-assignments.

 <dc:description>  Smartphone applications designed to track human motion in combination with
wearable sensors, e.g., during physical exercising, raised huge attention
recently. Commonly, they provide quantitative services, such as personalized
training instructions or the counting of distances. But qualitative monitoring
and assessment is still missing, e.g., to detect malpositions, to prevent
injuries, or to optimize training success. We address this issue by presenting
a concept for qualitative as well as generic assessment of recurrent human
motion by processing multi-dimensional, continuous time series tracked with
motion sensors. Therefore, our segmentation procedure extracts individual
events of specific length and we propose expressive features to accomplish a
qualitative motion assessment by supervised classification. We verified our
approach within a comprehensive study encompassing 27 athletes undertaking
different body weight exercises. We are able to recognize six different
exercise types with a success rate of 100% and to assess them qualitatively
with an average success rate of 99.3%.

 <dc:description>  Teegi is an anthropomorphic and tangible avatar exposing a users' brain
activity in real time. It is connected to a device sensing the brain by means
of electroencephalog-raphy (EEG). Teegi moves its hands and feet and closes its
eyes along with the person being monitored. It also displays on its scalp the
associated EEG signals, thanks to a semi-spherical display made of LEDs.
Attendees can interact directly with Teegi -- e.g. move its limbs -- to
discover by themselves the underlying brain processes. Teegi can be used for
scientific outreach to introduce neurotechnologies in general and
brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in particular.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of achieving common understanding between agents that use
different vocabularies has been mainly addressed by designing techniques that
explicitly negotiate mappings between their vocabularies, requiring agents to
share a meta-language. In this paper we consider the case of agents that use
different vocabularies and have no meta-language in common, but share the
knowledge of how to perform a task, given by the specification of an
interaction protocol. For this situation, we present a framework that lets
agents learn a vocabulary alignment from the experience of interacting. Unlike
previous work in this direction, we use open protocols that constrain possible
actions instead of defining procedures, making our approach more general. We
present two techniques that can be used either to learn an alignment from
scratch or to repair an existent one, and we evaluate experimentally their
performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of recovering arbitrary-shaped data
clusters from datasets while facing \emph{high space constraints}, as this is
for instance the case in many real-world applications when analysis algorithms
are directly deployed on resources-limited mobile devices collecting the data.
We present DBMSTClu a new space-efficient density-based \emph{non-parametric}
method working on a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) recovered from a limited number
of linear measurements i.e. a \emph{sketched} version of the dissimilarity
graph $\mathcal{G}$ between the $N$ objects to cluster. Unlike $k$-means,
$k$-medians or $k$-medoids algorithms, it does not fail at distinguishing
clusters with particular forms thanks to the property of the MST for expressing
the underlying structure of a graph. No input parameter is needed contrarily to
DBSCAN or the Spectral Clustering method. An approximate MST is retrieved by
following the dynamic \emph{semi-streaming} model in handling the dissimilarity
graph $\mathcal{G}$ as a stream of edge weight updates which is sketched in one
pass over the data into a compact structure requiring $O(N
\operatorname{polylog}(N))$ space, far better than the theoretical memory cost
$O(N^2)$ of $\mathcal{G}$. The recovered approximate MST $\mathcal{T}$ as
input, DBMSTClu then successfully detects the right number of nonconvex
clusters by performing relevant cuts on $\mathcal{T}$ in a time linear in $N$.
We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of the clustering partition
and also demonstrate its advantage over the existing state-of-the-art on
several datasets.

 <dc:description>  Most state-of-the-art graph kernels only take local graph properties into
account, i.e., the kernel is computed with regard to properties of the
neighborhood of vertices or other small substructures. On the other hand,
kernels that do take global graph propertiesinto account may not scale well to
large graph databases. Here we propose to start exploring the space between
local and global graph kernels, striking the balance between both worlds.
Specifically, we introduce a novel graph kernel based on the $k$-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm. Unfortunately, the $k$-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm scales exponentially in $k$. Consequently, we
devise a stochastic version of the kernel with provable approximation
guarantees using conditional Rademacher averages. On bounded-degree graphs, it
can even be computed in constant time. We support our theoretical results with
experiments on several graph classification benchmarks, showing that our
kernels often outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of classification
accuracies.

 <dc:description>  Demand response (DR) programs have emerged as a potential key enabling
ingredient in the context of smart grid (SG). Nevertheless, the rising concerns
over privacy issues raised by customers subscribed to these programs constitute
a major threat towards their effective deployment and utilization. This has
driven extensive research to resolve the hindrance confronted, resulting in a
number of methods being proposed for preserving customers' privacy. While these
methods provide stringent privacy guarantees, only limited attention has been
paid to their computational efficiency and performance quality. Under the
paradigm of differential privacy, this paper initiates a systematic empirical
study on quantifying the trade-off between privacy and optimality in
centralized DR systems for maximizing cumulative customer utility. Aiming to
elucidate the factors governing this trade-off, we analyze the cost of privacy
in terms of the effect incurred on the objective value of the DR optimization
problem when applying the employed privacy-preserving strategy based on Laplace
mechanism. The theoretical results derived from the analysis are complemented
with empirical findings, corroborated extensively by simulations on a 4-bus MG
system with up to thousands of customers. By evaluating the impact of privacy,
this pilot study serves DR practitioners when considering the social and
economic implications of deploying privacy-preserving DR programs in practice.
Moreover, it stimulates further research on exploring more efficient approaches
with bounded performance guarantees for optimizing energy procurement of MGs
without infringing the privacy of customers on demand side.

 <dc:description>  The sure thing principle and the law of total probability are basic laws in
classic probability theory. A disjunction fallacy leads to the violation of
these two classical probability laws. In this paper, a new quantum dynamic
belief decision making model based on quantum dynamic modelling and
Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is proposed to address this issue and
model the real human decision-making process. Some mathematical techniques are
borrowed from quantum mathematics. Generally, belief and action are two parts
in a decision making process. The uncertainty in belief part is represented by
a superposition of certain states. The uncertainty in actions is represented as
an extra uncertainty state. The interference effect is produced due to the
entanglement between beliefs and actions. Basic probability assignment (BPA) of
decisions is generated by quantum dynamic modelling. Then BPA of the extra
uncertain state and an entanglement degree defined by an entropy function named
Deng entropy are used to measure the interference effect. Compared the existing
model, the number of free parameters is less in our model. Finally, a classical
categorization decision-making experiment is illustrated to show the
effectiveness of our model.

 <dc:description>  The ability of learning from noisy labels is very useful in many visual
recognition tasks, as a vast amount of data with noisy labels are relatively
easy to obtain. Traditionally, the label noises have been treated as
statistical outliers, and approaches such as importance re-weighting and
bootstrap have been proposed to alleviate the problem. According to our
observation, the real-world noisy labels exhibit multi-mode characteristics as
the true labels, rather than behaving like independent random outliers. In this
work, we propose a unified distillation framework to use side information,
including a small clean dataset and label relations in knowledge graph, to
&quot;hedge the risk&quot; of learning from noisy labels. Furthermore, unlike the
traditional approaches evaluated based on simulated label noises, we propose a
suite of new benchmark datasets, in Sports, Species and Artifacts domains, to
evaluate the task of learning from noisy labels in the practical setting. The
empirical study demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method in all
the domains.

 <dc:description>  An important step toward adoption of formal methods in software development
is support for mainstream programming languages. Unfortunately, these languages
are often rather complex and come with substantial standard libraries. However,
by choosing a suitable intermediate language, most of the complexity can be
delegated to existing execution-oriented (as opposed to verification-oriented)
compiler frontends and standard library implementations. In this paper, we
describe how support for C++ exceptions can take advantage of the same
principle. Our work is based on DiVM, an LLVM-derived, verification-friendly
intermediate language.
  Our implementation consists of 2 parts: an implementation of the `libunwind`
platform API which is linked to the program under test and consists of 9 C
functions. The other part is a preprocessor for LLVM bitcode which prepares
exception-related metadata and replaces associated special-purpose LLVM
instructions.

 <dc:description>  Internet of things wireless networking with long range, low power and low
throughput is raising as a new paradigm enabling to connect trillions of
devices efficiently. In such networks with low power and bandwidth devices,
localization becomes more challenging. In this work we take a closer look at
the underlying aspects of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based
localization in UNB long-range IoT networks such as Sigfox. Firstly, the RSSI
has been used for fingerprinting localization where RSSI measurements of GPS
anchor nodes have been used as landmarks to classify other nodes into one of
the GPS nodes classes. Through measurements we show that a location
classification accuracy of 100% is achieved when the classes of nodes are
isolated. When classes are approaching each other, our measurements show that
we can still achieve an accuracy of 85%. Furthermore, when the density of the
GPS nodes is increasing, we can rely on peer-to-peer triangulation and thus
improve the possibility of localizing nodes with an error less than 20m from
20% to more than 60% of the nodes in our measurement scenario. 90% of the nodes
is localized with an error of less than 50m in our experiment with
non-optimized anchor node locations.

 <dc:title>On time and consistency in multi-level agent-based simulations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The integration of multiple viewpoints became an increasingly popular
approach to deal with agent-based simulations. Despite their disparities,
recent approaches successfully manage to run such multi-level simulations. Yet,
are they doing it appropriately?
  This paper tries to answer that question, with an analysis based on a generic
model of the temporal dynamics of multi-level simulations. This generic model
is then used to build an orthogonal approach to multi-level simulation called
SIMILAR. In this approach, most time-related issues are explicitly modeled,
owing to an implementation-oriented approach based on the influence/reaction
principle.

 <dc:title>Reduced Complexity Optimal Detection of Binary Faster-than-Nyquist

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the detection problem of binary
faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling and propose a novel sequence estimation
technique that exploits its special structure. In particular, the proposed
sequence estimation technique is based on sphere decoding (SD) and exploits the
following two characteristics about the FTN detection problem: 1) the cor-
relation between the noise samples after the receiver matched filter, and 2)
the structure of the intersymbol interference (ISI) matrix. Simulation results
show that the proposed SD-based sequence estimation (SDSE) achieves the optimal
performance of the maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) at reduced
computational complexity. This paper demonstrates that FTN signaling has the
great potential of increasing the data rate and spectral efficiency
substantially, when compared to Nyquist signaling, for the same bit-error-rate
(BER) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

 <dc:title>On Structured Prediction Theory with Calibrated Convex Surrogate Losses</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We provide novel theoretical insights on structured prediction in the context
of efficient convex surrogate loss minimization with consistency guarantees.
For any task loss, we construct a convex surrogate that can be optimized via
stochastic gradient descent and we prove tight bounds on the so-called
&quot;calibration function&quot; relating the excess surrogate risk to the actual risk.
In contrast to prior related work, we carefully monitor the effect of the
exponential number of classes in the learning guarantees as well as on the
optimization complexity. As an interesting consequence, we formalize the
intuition that some task losses make learning harder than others, and that the
classical 0-1 loss is ill-suited for general structured prediction.

 <dc:title>A Simple Deterministic Distributed MST Algorithm, with Near-Optimal Time
  and Message Complexities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Elkin, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Distributed minimum spanning tree (MST) problem is one of the most central
and fundamental problems in distributed graph algorithms. Garay et al.
\cite{GKP98,KP98} devised an algorithm with running time $O(D + \sqrt{n} \cdot
\log^* n)$, where $D$ is the hop-diameter of the input $n$-vertex $m$-edge
graph, and with message complexity $O(m + n^{3/2})$. Peleg and Rubinovich
\cite{PR99} showed that the running time of the algorithm of \cite{KP98} is
essentially tight, and asked if one can achieve near-optimal running time
**together with near-optimal message complexity**.
  In a recent breakthrough, Pandurangan et al. \cite{PRS16} answered this
question in the affirmative, and devised a **randomized** algorithm with time
$\tilde{O}(D+ \sqrt{n})$ and message complexity $\tilde{O}(m)$. They asked if
such a simultaneous time- and message-optimality can be achieved by a
**deterministic** algorithm.
  In this paper, building upon the work of \cite{PRS16}, we answer this
question in the affirmative, and devise a **deterministic** algorithm that
computes MST in time $O((D + \sqrt{n}) \cdot \log n)$, using $O(m \cdot \log n
+ n \log n \cdot \log^* n)$ messages. The polylogarithmic factors in the time
and message complexities of our algorithm are significantly smaller than the
respective factors in the result of \cite{PRS16}. Also, our algorithm and its
analysis are very **simple** and self-contained, as opposed to rather
complicated previous sublinear-time algorithms \cite{GKP98,KP98,E04b,PRS16}.

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic modeling provides the capability to represent and manipulate
uncertainty in data, models, predictions and decisions. We are concerned with
the problem of learning probabilistic models of dynamical systems from measured
data. Specifically, we consider learning of probabilistic nonlinear state-space
models. There is no closed-form solution available for this problem, implying
that we are forced to use approximations. In this tutorial we will provide a
self-contained introduction to one of the state-of-the-art methods---the
particle Metropolis--Hastings algorithm---which has proven to offer a practical
approximation. This is a Monte Carlo based method, where the particle filter is
used to guide a Markov chain Monte Carlo method through the parameter space.
One of the key merits of the particle Metropolis--Hastings algorithm is that it
is guaranteed to converge to the &quot;true solution&quot; under mild assumptions,
despite being based on a particle filter with only a finite number of
particles. We will also provide a motivating numerical example illustrating the
method using a modeling language tailored for sequential Monte Carlo methods.
The intention of modeling languages of this kind is to open up the power of
sophisticated Monte Carlo methods---including particle
Metropolis--Hastings---to a large group of users without requiring them to know
all the underlying mathematical details.

 <dc:description>  Most current results on coverage control using mobile sensors require that
one partitioned cell is associated with precisely one sensor. In this paper, we
consider a class of coverage control problems involving higher order Voronoi
partitions, motivated by applications where more than one sensor is required to
monitor and cover one cell. Such applications are frequent in scenarios
requiring the sensors to localize targets. We introduce a framework depending
on a coverage performance function incorporating higher order Voronoi cells and
then design a gradient-based controller which allows the multi-sensor system to
achieve a local equilibrium in a distributed manner. The convergence properties
are studied and related to Lloyd algorithm. We study also the extension to
coverage of a discrete set of points. In addition, we provide a number of real
world scenarios where our framework can be applied. Simulation results are also
provided to show the controller performance.

 <dc:description>  State estimation in heavy-tailed process and measurement noise is an
important challenge that must be addressed in, e.g., tracking scenarios with
agile targets and outlier-corrupted measurements. The performance of the Kalman
filter (KF) can deteriorate in such applications because of the close relation
to the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, this paper describes the use of
Student's t distribution to develop robust, scalable, and simple filtering and
smoothing algorithms.
  After a discussion of Student's t distribution, exact filtering in linear
state-space models with t noise is analyzed. Intermediate approximation steps
are used to arrive at filtering and smoothing algorithms that closely resemble
the KF and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother except for a nonlinear
measurement-dependent matrix update. The required approximations are discussed
and an undesirable behavior of moment matching for t densities is revealed. A
favorable approximation based on minimization of the Kullback-Leibler
divergence is presented. Because of its relation to the KF, some properties and
algorithmic extensions are inherited by the t filter. Instructive simulation
examples demonstrate the performance and robustness of the novel algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present machine learning approaches for characterizing and
forecasting the short-term demand for on-demand ride-hailing services. We
propose the spatio-temporal estimation of the demand that is a function of
variable effects related to traffic, pricing and weather conditions. With
respect to the methodology, a single decision tree, bootstrap-aggregated
(bagged) decision trees, random forest, boosted decision trees, and artificial
neural network for regression have been adapted and systematically compared
using various statistics, e.g. R-square, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and
slope. To better assess the quality of the models, they have been tested on a
real case study using the data of DiDi Chuxing, the main on-demand ride hailing
service provider in China. In the current study, 199,584 time-slots describing
the spatio-temporal ride-hailing demand has been extracted with an
aggregated-time interval of 10 mins. All the methods are trained and validated
on the basis of two independent samples from this dataset. The results revealed
that boosted decision trees provide the best prediction accuracy (RMSE=16.41),
while avoiding the risk of over-fitting, followed by artificial neural network
(20.09), random forest (23.50), bagged decision trees (24.29) and single
decision tree (33.55).

 <dc:description>  We employ unsupervised machine learning techniques to learn latent parameters
which best describe states of the two-dimensional Ising model and the
three-dimensional XY model. These methods range from principal component
analysis to artificial neural network based variational autoencoders. The
states are sampled using a Monte-Carlo simulation above and below the critical
temperature. We find that the predicted latent parameters correspond to the
known order parameters. The latent representation of the states of the models
in question are clustered, which makes it possible to identify phases without
prior knowledge of their existence or the underlying Hamiltonian. Furthermore,
we find that the reconstruction loss function can be used as a universal
identifier for phase transitions.

 <dc:description>  Progress in Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) has been historically limited by
the size of the available datasets. We present an efficient framework to
annotate trajectories and use it to produce a MOT dataset of unprecedented
size. In our novel path supervision the annotator loosely follows the object
with the cursor while watching the video, providing a path annotation for each
object in the sequence. Our approach is able to turn such weak annotations into
dense box trajectories. Our experiments on existing datasets prove that our
framework produces more accurate annotations than the state of the art, in a
fraction of the time. We further validate our approach by crowdsourcing the
PathTrack dataset, with more than 15,000 person trajectories in 720 sequences.
Tracking approaches can benefit training on such large-scale datasets, as did
object recognition. We prove this by re-training an off-the-shelf person
matching network, originally trained on the MOT15 dataset, almost halving the
misclassification rate. Additionally, training on our data consistently
improves tracking results, both on our dataset and on MOT15. On the latter, we
improve the top-performing tracker (NOMT) dropping the number of IDSwitches by
18% and fragments by 5%.

 <dc:description>  Many scientific data sets contain temporal dimensions. These are the data
storing information at the same spatial location but different time stamps.
Some of the biggest temporal datasets are produced by parallel computing
applications such as simulations of climate change and fluid dynamics. Temporal
datasets can be very large and cost a huge amount of time to transfer among
storage locations. Using data compression techniques, files can be transferred
faster and save storage space. NUMARCK is a lossy data compression algorithm
for temporal data sets that can learn emerging distributions of element-wise
change ratios along the temporal dimension and encodes them into an index table
to be concisely represented. This paper presents a parallel implementation of
NUMARCK. Evaluated with six data sets obtained from climate and astrophysics
simulations, parallel NUMARCK achieved scalable speedups of up to 8788 when
running 12800 MPI processes on a parallel computer. We also compare the
compression ratios against two lossy data compression algorithms, ISABELA and
ZFP. The results show that NUMARCK achieved higher compression ratio than
ISABELA and ZFP.

 <dc:description>  Each year, the treatment decisions for more than 230,000 breast cancer
patients in the U.S. hinge on whether the cancer has metastasized away from the
breast. Metastasis detection is currently performed by pathologists reviewing
large expanses of biological tissues. This process is labor intensive and
error-prone. We present a framework to automatically detect and localize tumors
as small as 100 x 100 pixels in gigapixel microscopy images sized 100,000 x
100,000 pixels. Our method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture and obtains state-of-the-art results on the Camelyon16 dataset in
the challenging lesion-level tumor detection task. At 8 false positives per
image, we detect 92.4% of the tumors, relative to 82.7% by the previous best
automated approach. For comparison, a human pathologist attempting exhaustive
search achieved 73.2% sensitivity. We achieve image-level AUC scores above 97%
on both the Camelyon16 test set and an independent set of 110 slides. In
addition, we discover that two slides in the Camelyon16 training set were
erroneously labeled normal. Our approach could considerably reduce false
negative rates in metastasis detection.

 <dc:description>  This short paper outlines research results on object classification in images
of Neoclassical furniture. The motivation was to provide an object recognition
framework which is able to support the alignment of furniture images with a
symbolic level model. A data-driven bottom-up research routine in the
Neoclassica research framework is the main use-case. It strives to deliver
tools for analyzing the spread of aesthetic forms which are considered as a
cultural transfer process.

 <dc:title>A Novel Approach of Pseudorandomly sorted list-based Steganography</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new model of steganography based on a list of pseudo-randomly
sorted sequences of characters. Given a list $L$ of $m$ columns containing $n$
distinct strings each, with low or no semantic relationship between columns
taken two by two, and a secret message $s \in \{0,1\}^*$, our model embeds $s$
in $L$ block by block, by generating, for each column of $L$, a permutation
number and by reordering strings contained in it according to that number.
Where, letting $l$ be average bit length of a string, the embedding capacity is
given by $[(m-1)*log_2(n!-1)/n*l]$. We've shown that optimal efficiency of the
method can be obtained with the condition that $(n &gt;&gt; l)$. The results which
has been obtained by experiments, show that our model performs a better hiding
process than some of the important existing methods, in terms of hiding
capacity.

 <dc:description>  Detecting buffer overruns from a source code is one of the most common and
yet challenging tasks in program analysis. Current approaches have mainly
relied on rigid rules and handcrafted features devised by a few experts,
limiting themselves in terms of flexible applicability and robustness due to
diverse bug patterns and characteristics existing in sophisticated real-world
software programs. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach that
is completely end-to-end without requiring any hand-crafted features, thus free
from any program language-specific structural limitations. In particular, our
approach leverages a recently proposed neural network model called memory
networks that have shown the state-of-the-art performances mainly in
question-answering tasks. Our experimental results using source codes
demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of accurately detecting simple
buffer overruns. We also present in-depth analyses on how a memory network can
learn to understand the semantics in programming languages solely from raw
source codes, such as tracing variables of interest, identifying numerical
values, and performing their quantitative comparisons.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating mutual information between dependent
data, an important problem in many science and engineering applications. We
propose a data-driven, non-parametric estimator of mutual information in this
paper. The main novelty of our solution lies in transforming the data to
frequency domain to make the problem tractable. We define a novel
metric--mutual information in frequency--to detect and quantify the dependence
between two random processes across frequency using Cram\'{e}r's spectral
representation. Our solution calculates mutual information as a function of
frequency to estimate the mutual information between the dependent data over
time. We validate its performance on linear and nonlinear models. In addition,
mutual information in frequency estimated as a part of our solution can also be
used to infer cross-frequency coupling in the data.

 <dc:description>  The random k-SAT model is the most important and well-studied distribution
over k-SAT instances. It is closely connected to statistical physics; it is
used as a testbench for satisfiability algorithms, and average-case hardness
over this distribution has also been linked to hardness of approximation via
Feige's hypothesis. We prove that any Cutting Planes refutation for random
k-SAT requires exponential size, for k that is logarithmic in the number of
variables, in the (interesting) regime where the number of clauses guarantees
that the formula is unsatisfiable with high probability.

 <dc:description>  Data science teams often collaboratively analyze datasets, generating dataset
versions at each stage of iterative exploration and analysis. There is a
pressing need for a system that can support dataset versioning, enabling such
teams to efficiently store, track, and query across dataset versions. We
introduce OrpheusDB, a dataset version control system that &quot;bolts on&quot;
versioning capabilities to a traditional relational database system, thereby
gaining the analytics capabilities of the database &quot;for free&quot;. We develop and
evaluate multiple data models for representing versioned data, as well as a
light-weight partitioning scheme, LyreSplit, to further optimize the models for
reduced query latencies. With LyreSplit, OrpheusDB is on average 1000x faster
in finding effective (and better) partitionings than competing approaches,
while also reducing the latency of version retrieval by up to 20x relative to
schemes without partitioning. LyreSplit can be applied in an online fashion as
new versions are added, alongside an intelligent migration scheme that reduces
migration time by 10x on average.

 <dc:description>  We study SIS epidemic spreading processes unfolding on a recent
generalisation of the activity-driven modelling framework. In this model of
time-varying networks each node is described by two variables: activity and
attractiveness. The first, describes the propensity to form connections. The
second, defines the propensity to attract them. We derive analytically the
epidemic threshold considering the timescale driving the evolution of contacts
and the contagion as comparable. The solutions are general and hold for any
joint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is
confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering
heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two
variables. We find that heterogeneous distributions of attractiveness alter the
contagion process. In particular, in case of uncorrelated and positive
correlations between the two variables, heterogeneous attractiveness
facilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between
activity and attractiveness hamper the spreading. The results presented
contribute to the understanding of the dynamical properties of time-varying
networks and their effects on contagion phenomena unfolding on their fabric.

 <dc:description>  A novel parallel simulation algorithm on the GPU, implemented in CUDA and
C++, is presented for the simulation of Brownian particles that display
excluded volume repulsion and interact with long and short range forces. When
an explicit Euler-Maruyama integration step is performed to take into account
the pairwise forces and Brownian motion, particle overlaps can appear. The
excluded volume property brings up the need for correcting these overlaps as
they happen, since predicting them is not feasible due to the random
displacement of Brownian particles. The proposed solution handles, at each time
step, a Delaunay triangulation of the particle positions because it allows us
to efficiently solve overlaps between particles by checking just their
neighborhood. The algorithm starts by generating a Delaunay triangulation of
the particle initial positions on CPU, but after that the triangulation is
always kept on GPU memory. We used a parallel edge-flip implementation to keep
the triangulation updated during each time step, checking previously that the
triangulation was not rendered invalid due to the particle displacements. The
algorithm is validated with two models of active colloidal particles. Upon
testing the parallel implementation of a long range forces simulation, the
results show a performance improvement of up to two orders of magnitude when
compared to the previously existing sequential solution.

 <dc:description>  Let $P_k$ be a path, $C_k$ a cycle on $k$ vertices, and $K_{k,k}$ a complete
bipartite graph with $k$ vertices on each side of the bipartition. We prove
that (1) for any integers $k, t&gt;0$ and a graph $H$ there are finitely many
subgraph minimal graphs with no induced $P_k$ and $K_{t,t}$ that are not
$H$-colorable and (2) for any integer $k&gt;4$ there are finitely many subgraph
minimal graphs with no induced $P_k$ that are not $C_{k-2}$-colorable.
  The former generalizes the result of Hell and Huang [Complexity of coloring
graphs without paths and cycles, Discrete Appl. Math. 216: 211--232 (2017)] and
the latter extends a result of Bruce, Hoang, and Sawada [A certifying algorithm
for 3-colorability of $P_5$-Free Graphs, ISAAC 2009: 594--604]. Both our
results lead to polynomial-time certifying algorithms for the corresponding

 <dc:description>  In the last few years, we have witnessed an explosion of interest in Big Data
in both academic and industry arenas. Big Data is about the capture, storage,
analysis and visualization of huge volumes of data in both structured and
unstructured forms generated from a myriad of applications and devices in a
wide set of scenarios. Focusing on the need of academia to develop professional
posing the competencies that industry demands, the paper presents the approach
adopted by the Faculty of Computer Sciences at {\O}stfold University College,
Norway to deploy Big Data related contents throughout its studies in the
computing field. This paper describes initiatives in bachelor and master
programs along with continuous education courses with regards to Big Data
topics. New master courses were implemented in the 2014-2015 academic year,
while bachelor and continuous education courses will be deployed the year
after. Initial results in terms of course assessments and students' acceptation
unveil promising perspectives for the initiative.

 <dc:description>  A method for online tensor dictionary learning is proposed. With the
assumption of separable dictionaries, tensor contraction is used to diminish a
$N$-way model of $\mathcal{O}\left(L^N\right)$ into a simple matrix equation of
$\mathcal{O}\left(NL^2\right)$ with a real-time capability. To avoid numerical
instability due to inversion of sparse matrix, a class of stochastic gradient
with memory is formulated via a least-square solution to guarantee convergence
and robustness. Both gradient descent with exact line search and Newton's
method are discussed and realized. Extensions onto how to deal with bad
initialization and outliers are also explained in detail. Experiments on two
synthetic signals confirms an impressive performance of our proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Despite being popularly referred to as the ultimate solution for all problems
of our current electric power system, smart grid is still a growing and
unstable concept. It is usually considered as a set of advanced features
powered by promising technological solutions. In this paper, we describe smart
grid as a socio-technical transition and illustrate the evolutionary path on
which a smart grid can be realized. Through this conceptual lens, we reveal the
role of big data, and how it can fuel the organic growth of smart grid. We also
provide a rough estimate of how much data will be potentially generated from
different data sources, which helps clarify the big data challenges during the
evolutionary process.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach for multi-lingual sentiment
classification in short texts. This is a challenging task as the amount of
training data in languages other than English is very limited. Previously
proposed multi-lingual approaches typically require to establish a
correspondence to English for which powerful classifiers are already available.
In contrast, our method does not require such supervision. We leverage large
amounts of weakly-supervised data in various languages to train a multi-layer
convolutional network and demonstrate the importance of using pre-training of
such networks. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on various multi-lingual
datasets, including the recent SemEval-2016 sentiment prediction benchmark
(Task 4), where we achieved state-of-the-art performance. We also compare the
performance of our model trained individually for each language to a variant
trained for all languages at once. We show that the latter model reaches
slightly worse - but still acceptable - performance when compared to the single
language model, while benefiting from better generalization properties across
languages.

 <dc:description>  The recent tremendous success of unsupervised word embeddings in a multitude
of applications raises the obvious question if similar methods could be derived
to improve embeddings (i.e. semantic representations) of word sequences as
well. We present a simple but efficient unsupervised objective to train

state-of-the-art unsupervised models on most benchmark tasks, highlighting the
robustness of the produced general-purpose sentence embeddings.

 <dc:title>Graph of Virtual Actors (GOVA): a Big Data Analytics Architecture for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the emergence of cloud computing and sensor technologies, Big Data
analytics for the Internet of Things (IoT) has become the main force behind
many innovative solutions for our society's problems. This paper provides
practical explanations for the question &quot;why is the number of Big Data
applications that succeed and have an effect on our daily life so limited,
compared with all of the solutions proposed and tested in the literature?&quot;,
with examples taken from Smart Grids. We argue that &quot;noninvariants&quot; are the
most challenging issues in IoT applications, which can be easily revealed if we
use the term &quot;invariant&quot; to replace the more common terms such as
&quot;information&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;, or &quot;insight&quot; in any Big Data for IoT research. From
our experience with developing Smart Grid applications, we produced a list of
&quot;noninvariants&quot;, which we believe to be the main causes of the gaps between Big
Data in a laboratory and in practice in IoT applications. This paper also
proposes Graph of Virtual Actors (GOVA) as a Big Data analytics architecture
for IoT applications, which not only can solve the noninvariants issues, but
can also quickly scale horizontally in terms of computation, data storage,
caching requirements, and programmability of the system.

 <dc:description>  Purpose To develop a computer based method for the automated assessment of
image quality in the context of diabetic retinopathy (DR) to guide the
photographer.
  Methods A deep learning framework was trained to grade the images
automatically. A large representative set of 7000 color fundus images were used
for the experiment which were obtained from the EyePACS that were made
available by the California Healthcare Foundation. Three retinal image analysis
experts were employed to categorize these images into Accept and Reject classes
based on the precise definition of image quality in the context of DR. A deep
learning framework was trained using 3428 images.
  Results A total of 3572 images were used for the evaluation of the proposed
method. The method shows an accuracy of 100% to successfully categorise Accept
and Reject images.
  Conclusion Image quality is an essential prerequisite for the grading of DR.
In this paper we have proposed a deep learning based automated image quality
assessment method in the context of DR. The method can be easily incorporated
with the fundus image capturing system and thus can guide the photographer
whether a recapture is necessary or not.

 <dc:title>Learning opacity in Stratal Maximum Entropy Grammar</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nazarov, Aleksei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pater, Joe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Opaque phonological patterns are sometimes claimed to be difficult to learn;
specific hypotheses have been advanced about the relative difficulty of
particular kinds of opaque processes (Kiparsky 1971, 1973), and the kind of
data that will be helpful in learning an opaque pattern (Kiparsky 2000). In
this paper, we present a computationally implemented learning theory for one
grammatical theory of opacity: a Maximum Entropy version of Stratal OT
(Berm\'udez-Otero 1999, Kiparsky 2000), and test it on simplified versions of
opaque French tense-lax vowel alternations and the opaque interaction of
diphthong raising and flapping in Canadian English. We find that the difficulty
of opacity can be influenced by evidence for stratal affiliation: the Canadian
English case is easier if the learner encounters application of raising outside
the flapping context, or non-application of raising between words (i.e., &lt;life&gt;
with a raised vowel; &lt;lie for&gt; with a non-raised vowel).

 <dc:description>  Coordinate descent methods employ random partial updates of decision
variables in order to solve huge-scale convex optimization problems. In this
work, we introduce new adaptive rules for the random selection of their
updates. By adaptive, we mean that our selection rules are based on the dual
residual or the primal-dual gap estimates and can change at each iteration. We
theoretically characterize the performance of our selection rules and
demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art, and extend our theory and
algorithms to general convex objectives. Numerical evidence with hinge-loss
support vector machines and Lasso confirm that the practice follows the theory.

 <dc:description>  We propose an unsupervised method for reference resolution in instructional
videos, where the goal is to temporally link an entity (e.g., &quot;dressing&quot;) to
the action (e.g., &quot;mix yogurt&quot;) that produced it. The key challenge is the
inevitable visual-linguistic ambiguities arising from the changes in both
visual appearance and referring expression of an entity in the video. This
challenge is amplified by the fact that we aim to resolve references with no
supervision. We address these challenges by learning a joint visual-linguistic
model, where linguistic cues can help resolve visual ambiguities and vice
versa. We verify our approach by learning our model unsupervisedly using more
than two thousand unstructured cooking videos from YouTube, and show that our
visual-linguistic model can substantially improve upon state-of-the-art
linguistic only model on reference resolution in instructional videos.

 <dc:description>  Online learning to rank is a core problem in information retrieval and
machine learning. Many provably efficient algorithms have been recently
proposed for this problem in specific click models. The click model is a model
of how the user interacts with a list of documents. Though these results are
significant, their impact on practice is limited, because all proposed
algorithms are designed for specific click models and lack convergence
guarantees in other models. In this work, we propose BatchRank, the first
online learning to rank algorithm for a broad class of click models. The class
encompasses two most fundamental click models, the cascade and position-based
models. We derive a gap-dependent upper bound on the $T$-step regret of
BatchRank and evaluate it on a range of web search queries. We observe that
BatchRank outperforms ranked bandits and is more robust than CascadeKL-UCB, an
existing algorithm for the cascade model.

 <dc:description>  While the costs of human violence have attracted a great deal of attention
from the research community, the effects of the network-on-network (NoN)
violence popularised by Generative Adversarial Networks have yet to be
addressed. In this work, we quantify the financial, social, spiritual,
cultural, grammatical and dermatological impact of this aggression and address
the issue by proposing a more peaceful approach which we term Generative
Unadversarial Networks (GUNs). Under this framework, we simultaneously train
two models: a generator G that does its best to capture whichever data
distribution it feels it can manage, and a motivator M that helps G to achieve
its dream. Fighting is strictly verboten and both models evolve by learning to
respect their differences. The framework is both theoretically and electrically
grounded in game theory, and can be viewed as a winner-shares-all two-player
game in which both players work as a team to achieve the best score.
Experiments show that by working in harmony, the proposed model is able to
claim both the moral and log-likelihood high ground. Our work builds on a rich
history of carefully argued position-papers, published as anonymous YouTube
comments, which prove that the optimal solution to NoN violence is more GUNs.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in computer vision-in the form of deep neural networks-have
made it possible to query increasing volumes of video data with high accuracy.
However, neural network inference is computationally expensive at scale:
applying a state-of-the-art object detector in real time (i.e., 30+ frames per
second) to a single video requires a $4000 GPU. In response, we present
NoScope, a system for querying videos that can reduce the cost of neural
network video analysis by up to three orders of magnitude via
inference-optimized model search. Given a target video, object to detect, and
reference neural network, NoScope automatically searches for and trains a
sequence, or cascade, of models that preserves the accuracy of the reference
network but is specialized to the target video and are therefore far less
computationally expensive. NoScope cascades two types of models: specialized
models that forego the full generality of the reference model but faithfully
mimic its behavior for the target video and object; and difference detectors
that highlight temporal differences across frames. We show that the optimal
cascade architecture differs across videos and objects, so NoScope uses an
efficient cost-based optimizer to search across models and cascades. With this
approach, NoScope achieves two to three order of magnitude speed-ups
(265-15,500x real-time) on binary classification tasks over fixed-angle webcam
and surveillance video while maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of
state-of-the-art neural networks.

 <dc:title>Optical Flow Fields: Dense Correspondence Fields for Highly Accurate
  Large Displacement Optical Flow Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Modern large displacement optical flow algorithms usually use an
initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense
approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of
being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier-prone as
they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar
correspondence. In this article we present a dense correspondence field
approach that is much less outlier-prone and thus much better suited for
optical flow estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach
does not require explicit regularization, smoothing (like median filtering) or
a new data term. Instead we solely rely on patch matching techniques and a
novel multi-scale matching strategy. We also present enhancements for outlier
filtering. We show that our approach is better suited for large displacement
optical flow estimation than modern descriptor matching techniques. We do so by
initializing EpicFlow with our approach instead of their originally used
state-of-the-art descriptor matching technique. We significantly outperform the
original EpicFlow on MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and Middlebury. In this
extended article of our former conference publication we further improve our
approach in matching accuracy as well as runtime and present more experiments
and insights.

 <dc:description>  We study the online learning problem of a bidder who participates in repeated
auctions. With the goal of maximizing his T-period payoff, the bidder
determines the optimal allocation of his budget among his bids for $K$ goods at
each period. As a bidding strategy, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm,
inspired by the dynamic programming approach to the knapsack problem. The
proposed algorithm, referred to as dynamic programming on discrete set (DPDS),
achieves a regret order of $O(\sqrt{T\log{T}})$. By showing that the regret is
lower bounded by $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for any strategy, we conclude that DPDS is
order optimal up to a $\sqrt{\log{T}}$ term. We evaluate the performance of
DPDS empirically in the context of virtual trading in wholesale electricity
markets by using historical data from the New York market. Empirical results
show that DPDS consistently outperforms benchmark heuristic methods that are
derived from machine learning and online learning approaches.

 <dc:description>  Very often features come with their own vectorial descriptions which provide
detailed information about their properties. We refer to these vectorial
descriptions as feature side-information. In the standard learning scenario,
input is represented as a vector of features and the feature side-information
is most often ignored or used only for feature selection prior to model
fitting. We believe that feature side-information which carries information
about features intrinsic property will help improve model prediction if used in
a proper way during learning process. In this paper, we propose a framework
that allows for the incorporation of the feature side-information during the
learning of very general model families to improve the prediction performance.
We control the structures of the learned models so that they reflect features
similarities as these are defined on the basis of the side-information. We
perform experiments on a number of benchmark datasets which show significant
predictive performance gains, over a number of baselines, as a result of the
exploitation of the side-information.

 <dc:description>  Data noising is an effective technique for regularizing neural network
models. While noising is widely adopted in application domains such as vision
and speech, commonly used noising primitives have not been developed for
discrete sequence-level settings such as language modeling. In this paper, we
derive a connection between input noising in neural network language models and
smoothing in $n$-gram models. Using this connection, we draw upon ideas from
smoothing to develop effective noising schemes. We demonstrate performance
gains when applying the proposed schemes to language modeling and machine
translation. Finally, we provide empirical analysis validating the relationship
between noising and smoothing.

 <dc:description>  Recent studies demonstrate that effective healthcare can benefit from using
the human genomic information. For instance, analysis of tumor genomes has
revealed 140 genes whose mutations contribute to cancer. As a result, many
institutions are using statistical analysis of genomic data, which are mostly
based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS analyze genome sequence
variations in order to identify genetic risk factors for diseases. These
studies often require pooling data from different sources together in order to
unravel statistical patterns or relationships between genetic variants and
diseases. In this case, the primary challenge is to fulfill one major
objective: accessing multiple genomic data repositories for collaborative
research in a privacy-preserving manner. Due to the sensitivity and privacy
concerns regarding the genomic data, multi-jurisdictional laws and policies of
cross-border genomic data sharing are enforced among different regions of the
world. In this article, we present SAFETY, a hybrid framework, which can
securely perform GWAS on federated genomic datasets using homomorphic
encryption and recently introduced secure hardware component of Intel Software
Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) to ensure high efficiency and privacy at the same
time. Different experimental settings show the efficacy and applicability of
such hybrid framework in secure conduction of GWAS. To the best of our
knowledge, this hybrid use of homomorphic encryption along with Intel SGX is
not proposed or experimented to this date. Our proposed framework, SAFETY is up
to 4.82 times faster than the best existing secure computation technique.

 <dc:description>  We consider the motion-planning problem of planning a collision-free path of
a robot in the presence of risk zones. The robot is allowed to travel in these
zones but is penalized in a super-linear fashion for consecutive accumulative
time spent there. We suggest a natural cost function that balances path length
and risk-exposure time. Specifically, we consider the discrete setting where we
are given a graph, or a roadmap, and we wish to compute the minimal-cost path
under this cost function. Interestingly, paths defined using our cost function
do not have an optimal substructure. Namely, subpaths of an optimal path are
not necessarily optimal. Thus, the Bellman condition is not satisfied and
standard graph-search algorithms such as Dijkstra cannot be used. We present a
path-finding algorithm, which can be seen as a natural generalization of
Dijkstra's algorithm. Our algorithm runs in $O\left((n_B\cdot n) \log( n_B\cdot
n) + n_B\cdot m\right)$ time, where~$n$ and $m$ are the number of vertices and
edges of the graph, respectively, and $n_B$ is the number of intersections
between edges and the boundary of the risk zone. We present simulations on
robotic platforms demonstrating both the natural paths produced by our cost
function and the computational efficiency of our algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Texture analysis is a well-known research topic in computer vision and image
processing and has many applications. Gradient-based texture methods have
become popular in classification problems. For the first time we extend a
well-known gradient-based method, Co-occurrence Histograms of Oriented
Gradients (CoHOG) to extract texture features from 2D Magnetic Resonance Images
(MRI). Unlike the original CoHOG method, we use the whole image instead of
sub-regions for feature calculation. Also, we use a larger neighborhood size.
Gradient orientations of the image pixels are calculated using Sobel, Gaussian
Derivative (GD) and Local Frequency Descriptor Gradient (LFDG) operators. The
extracted feature vector size is very large and classification using a large
number of similar features does not provide the best results. In our proposed
method, for the first time to our best knowledge, only a minimum number of
significant features are selected using area under the receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) thresholds with &lt;= 0.01. In this paper, we
apply the proposed method to classify Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
patients from the controls. It is observed that selected texture features from
downsampled images are significantly different between patients and controls.
These features are used in a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to
determine the classification accuracy. Optimal sensitivity and specificity are
also calculated. Three different cohort datasets are used in the experiments.
The performance of the proposed method using three gradient operators and two
different neighborhood sizes is analyzed. Region based analysis is performed to
demonstrate that significant changes between patients and controls are limited
to the motor cortex.

 <dc:description>Comment: We found an error in the feature selection part (Sec. 3.3) of the
  proposed approach. In the feature selection part, by mistake, we have used
  both the training and testing data for feature selection. We are working on
  it. We will update the proposed approach as early as possible</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Energy consumption has become a first-class optimization goal in design and
implementation of data-intensive computing systems. This is particularly true
in the design of database management systems (DBMS), which was found to be the
major consumer of energy in the software stack of modern data centers. Among
all database components, the storage system is one of the most power-hungry
elements. In previous work, dynamic power management (DPM) techniques that make
real-time decisions to transition the disks to low-power modes are normally
used to save energy in storage systems. In this paper, we tackle the
limitations of DPM proposals in previous contributions. We introduced a DPM
optimization model integrated with model predictive control (MPC) strategy to
minimize power consumption of the disk-based storage system while satisfying
given performance requirements. It dynamically determines the state of disks
and plans for inter-disk data fragment migration to achieve desirable balance
between power consumption and query response time. Via analyzing our
optimization model to identify structural properties of optimal solutions, we
propose a fast-solution heuristic DPM algorithm that can be integrated in
large-scale disk storage systems for efficient state configuration and data
migration. We evaluate our proposed ideas by running simulations using
extensive set of synthetic workloads based on popular TPC benchmarks. Our
results show that our solution significantly outperforms the best existing
algorithm in both energy savings and response time.

 <dc:description>  We describe the Customer LifeTime Value (CLTV) prediction system deployed at
ASOS.com, a global online fashion retailer. CLTV prediction is an important
problem in e-commerce where an accurate estimate of future value allows
retailers to effectively allocate marketing spend, identify and nurture high
value customers and mitigate exposure to losses. The system at ASOS provides
daily estimates of the future value of every customer and is one of the
cornerstones of the personalised shopping experience. The state of the art in
this domain uses large numbers of handcrafted features and ensemble regressors
to forecast value, predict churn and evaluate customer loyalty. Recently,
domains including language, vision and speech have shown dramatic advances by
replacing handcrafted features with features that are learned automatically
from data. We detail the system deployed at ASOS and show that learning feature
representations is a promising extension to the state of the art in CLTV
modelling. We propose a novel way to generate embeddings of customers, which
addresses the issue of the ever changing product catalogue and obtain a
significant improvement over an exhaustive set of handcrafted features.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, most systems and applications produce log records that are useful
for security and monitoring purposes such as debugging programming errors,
checking system status, and detecting configuration problems or even attacks.
To this end, a log repository becomes necessary whereby logs can be accessed
and visualized in a timely manner. This paper presents Loginson, a
high-performance log centralization system for large-scale log collection and
processing in large IT infrastructures. Besides log collection, Loginson
provides high-level analytics through a visual interface for the purpose of
troubleshooting critical incidents. We note that Loginson outperforms all of
the other log centralization solutions by taking full advantage of the vertical
scalability, and therefore decreasing Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operating
Expense (OPEX) costs for deployment scenarios with a huge volume of log data.

information theoretic objective function. We show that appropriate techniques
for solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes
(Dec-POMDPs) are applicable in such information gathering problems. We quantify
the usefulness of coordinated information gathering through simulation studies,
and demonstrate the feasibility of the method in a real-world target tracking
domain.

 <dc:description>  Here we report on a set of programs developed at the ZMBH Bio-Imaging
Facility for tracking real-life images of cellular processes. These programs
perform 1) automated tracking; 2) quantitative and comparative track analyses
of different images in different groups; 3) different interactive visualization
schemes; and 4) interactive realistic simulation of different cellular
processes for validation and optimal problem-specific adjustment of image
acquisition parameters (tradeoff between speed, resolution, and quality with
feedback from the very final results). The collection of programs is primarily
developed for the common bio-image analysis software ImageJ (as a single Java
Plugin). Some programs are also available in other languages (C++ and
Javascript) and may be run simply with a web-browser; even on a low-end Tablet
or Smartphone. The programs are available at

 <dc:title>Bootstrapped Graph Diffusions: Exposing the Power of Nonlinearity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Buchnik, Eliav</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms predict labels for all
nodes based on provided labels of a small set of seed nodes. Classic methods
capture the graph structure through some underlying diffusion process that
propagates through the graph edges. Spectral diffusion, which includes
personalized page rank and label propagation, propagates through random walks.
Social diffusion propagates through shortest paths. A common ground to these
diffusions is their {\em linearity}, which does not distinguish between
contributions of few &quot;strong&quot; relations and many &quot;weak&quot; relations.
  Recently, non-linear methods such as node embeddings and graph convolutional
networks (GCN) demonstrated a large gain in quality for SSL tasks. These
methods introduce multiple components and greatly vary on how the graph
structure, seed label information, and other features are used.
  We aim here to study the contribution of non-linearity, as an isolated
ingredient, to the performance gain. To do so, we place classic linear graph
diffusions in a self-training framework. Surprisingly, we observe that SSL
using the resulting {\em bootstrapped diffusions} not only significantly
improves over the respective non-bootstrapped baselines but also outperform
state-of-the-art non-linear SSL methods. Moreover, since the self-training
wrapper retains the scalability of the base method, we obtain both higher
quality and better scalability.

 <dc:description>  Training recurrent neural networks to model long term dependencies is
difficult. Hence, we propose to use external linguistic knowledge as an
explicit signal to inform the model which memories it should utilize.
Specifically, external knowledge is used to augment a sequence with typed edges
between arbitrarily distant elements, and the resulting graph is decomposed
into directed acyclic subgraphs. We introduce a model that encodes such graphs
as explicit memory in recurrent neural networks, and use it to model
coreference relations in text. We apply our model to several text comprehension
tasks and achieve new state-of-the-art results on all considered benchmarks,
including CNN, bAbi, and LAMBADA. On the bAbi QA tasks, our model solves 15 out
of the 20 tasks with only 1000 training examples per task. Analysis of the
learned representations further demonstrates the ability of our model to encode
fine-grained entity information across a document.

 <dc:description>  We propose an online convex optimization algorithm (RescaledExp) that
achieves optimal regret in the unconstrained setting without prior knowledge of
any bounds on the loss functions. We prove a lower bound showing an exponential
separation between the regret of existing algorithms that require a known bound
on the loss functions and any algorithm that does not require such knowledge.
RescaledExp matches this lower bound asymptotically in the number of
iterations. RescaledExp is naturally hyperparameter-free and we demonstrate
empirically that it matches prior optimization algorithms that require
hyperparameter optimization.

 <dc:description>  We propose Graph Priority Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for order-based
reservoir sampling from massive streams of graph edges. GPS provides a general
way to weight edge sampling according to auxiliary and/or size variables so as
to accomplish various estimation goals of graph properties. In the context of
subgraph counting, we show how edge sampling weights can be chosen so as to
minimize the estimation variance of counts of specified sets of subgraphs. In
distinction with many prior graph sampling schemes, GPS separates the functions
of edge sampling and subgraph estimation. We propose two estimation frameworks:
(1) Post-Stream estimation, to allow GPS to construct a reference sample of
edges to support retrospective graph queries, and (2) In-Stream estimation, to
allow GPS to obtain lower variance estimates by incrementally updating the
subgraph count estimates during stream processing. Unbiasedness of subgraph
estimators is established through a new Martingale formulation of graph stream
order sampling, which shows that subgraph estimators, written as a product of
constituent edge estimators are unbiased, even when computed at different
points in the stream. The separation of estimation and sampling enables
significant resource savings relative to previous work. We illustrate our
framework with applications to triangle and wedge counting. We perform a
large-scale experimental study on real-world graphs from various domains and
types. GPS achieves high accuracy with less than 1% error for triangle and
wedge counting, while storing a small fraction of the graph with average update
times of a few microseconds per edge. Notably, for a large Twitter graph with
more than 260M edges, GPS accurately estimates triangle counts with less than
1% error, while storing only 40K edges.

 <dc:description>  The gang of bandits (GOB) model \cite{cesa2013gang} is a recent contextual
bandits framework that shares information between a set of bandit problems,
related by a known (possibly noisy) graph. This model is useful in problems
like recommender systems where the large number of users makes it vital to
transfer information between users. Despite its effectiveness, the existing GOB
model can only be applied to small problems due to its quadratic
time-dependence on the number of nodes. Existing solutions to combat the
scalability issue require an often-unrealistic clustering assumption. By
exploiting a connection to Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), we show that
the GOB model can be made to scale to much larger graphs without additional
assumptions. In addition, we propose a Thompson sampling algorithm which uses
the recent GMRF sampling-by-perturbation technique, allowing it to scale to
even larger problems (leading to a &quot;horde&quot; of bandits). We give regret bounds
and experimental results for GOB with Thompson sampling and epoch-greedy
algorithms, indicating that these methods are as good as or significantly
better than ignoring the graph or adopting a clustering-based approach.
Finally, when an existing graph is not available, we propose a heuristic for
learning it on the fly and show promising results.

 <dc:description>  This work provides a comprehensive scaling law based performance analysis for
multi-cell multi-user massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) downlink
systems. Imperfect channel state information (CSI), pilot contamination, and
channel spatial correlation are all considered. First, a sum- rate lower bound
is derived by exploiting the asymptotically deterministic property of the
received signal power, while keeping the random nature of other components in
the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) intact. Via a general
scaling model on important network parameters, including the number of users,
the channel training energy and the data transmission power, with respect to
the number of base station antennas, the asymptotic scaling law of the
effective SINR is obtained, which reveals quantitatively the tradeoff of the
network parameters. More importantly, pilot contamination and pilot
contamination elimination (PCE) are considered in the analytical framework. In
addition, the applicability of the derived asymptotic scaling law in practical
systems with large but finite antenna numbers are discussed. Finally,
sufficient conditions on the parameter scalings for the SINR to be
asymptotically deterministic in the sense of mean square convergence are
provided, which covers existing results on such analysis as special cases and
shows the effect of PCE explicitly.

 <dc:description>  The vast majority of optimization and online learning algorithms today
require some prior information about the data (often in the form of bounds on
gradients or on the optimal parameter value). When this information is not
available, these algorithms require laborious manual tuning of various
hyperparameters, motivating the search for algorithms that can adapt to the
data with no prior information. We describe a frontier of new lower bounds on
the performance of such algorithms, reflecting a tradeoff between a term that
depends on the optimal parameter value and a term that depends on the
gradients' rate of growth. Further, we construct a family of algorithms whose
performance matches any desired point on this frontier, which no previous
algorithm reaches.

 <dc:description>  Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPAD) are affordable photodetectors, capable
to collect extremely fast low-energy events, due to their single-photon
sensibility. This makes them very suitable for time-of-flight-based range
imaging systems, allowing to reduce costs and power requirements, without
sacrifizing much temporal resolution. In this work we describe a computational
model to simulate the behaviour of SPAD sensors, aiming to provide a realistic
camera model for time-resolved light transport simulation, with applications on
prototyping new reconstructions techniques based on SPAD time-of-flight data.
Our model accounts for the major effects of the sensor on the incoming signal.
We compare our model against real-world measurements, and apply it to a variety
of scenarios, including complex multiply-scattered light transport.

 <dc:description>  A tensor $T$, in a given tensor space, is said to be $h$-identifiable if it
admits a unique decomposition as a sum of $h$ rank one tensors. A criterion for
$h$-identifiability is called effective if it is satisfied in a dense, open
subset of the set of rank $h$ tensors. In this paper we give effective
$h$-identifiability criteria for a large class of tensors. We then improve
these criteria for some symmetric tensors. For instance, this allows us to give
a complete set of effective identifiability criteria for ternary quintic
polynomial. Finally, we implement our identifiability algorithms in Macaulay2.

 <dc:description>  A geometrical pattern is a set of points with all pairwise distances (or,
more generally, relative distances) specified. Finding matches to such patterns
has applications to spatial data in seismic, astronomical, and transportation
contexts. For example, a particularly interesting geometric pattern in
astronomy is the Einstein cross, which is an astronomical phenomenon in which a
single quasar is observed as four distinct sky objects (due to gravitational
lensing) when captured by earth telescopes. Finding such crosses, as well as
other geometric patterns, is a challenging problem as the potential number of
sets of elements that compose shapes is exponentially large in the size of the
dataset and the pattern. In this paper, we denote geometric patterns as
constellation queries and propose algorithms to find them in large data
applications. Our methods combine quadtrees, matrix multiplication, and
unindexed join processing to discover sets of points that match a geometric
pattern within some additive factor on the pairwise distances. Our distributed
experiments show that the choice of composition algorithm (matrix
multiplication or nested loops) depends on the freedom introduced in the query
geometry through the distance additive factor. Three clearly identified blocks
of threshold values guide the choice of the best composition algorithm.
Finally, solving the problem for relative distances requires a novel
continuous-to-discrete transformation. To the best of our knowledge this paper
is the first to investigate constellation queries at scale.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating an RF-device's location based on
observations, such as received signal strength, from a set of transmitters with
known locations. We survey the literature on this problem, showing that
previous authors have considered implicitly or explicitly various metrics. We
present a novel Bayesian framework that unifies these works and shows how to
optimize the location estimation with respect to a given metric. We demonstrate
how the framework can incorporate a general class of algorithms, including both
model-based methods and data-driven algorithms such fingerprinting. This is
illustrated by re-deriving the most popular algorithms within this framework.
When used with a data-driven approach, our framework has cognitive
self-improving properties in that it provably improves with increasing data
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we propose using the error-CDF as
a unified way of comparing algorithms based on two methods: (i) stochastic
dominance, and (ii) an upper bound on error-CDFs. We prove that an algorithm
that optimizes any distance based cost function is not stochastically dominated
by any other algorithm. This suggests that in lieu of the search for a
universally best localization algorithm, the community should focus on finding
the best algorithm for a given well-defined objective.

 <dc:title>Realizing the Aerial Robotic Worker for Inspection Operations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alexis, Kostas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This report overviews a set of recent contributions in the field of path
planning that were developed to enable the realization of the autonomous aerial
robotic worker for inspection operations. The specific algorithmic
contributions address several fundamental challenges of robotic inspection and
exploration, and specifically those of optimal coverage planning given an a
priori known model of the structure to be inspected, full coverage, optimized
and fast inspection path planning, as well as efficient exploration of
completely unknown environments and structures. All of the developed path
planners support both holonomic and nonholonomic systems, and respect the
on-board sensor model and constraints. An overview of the achieved results,
followed by an integrating architecture in order to enable fully autonomous and
highly-efficient infrastructure inspection in both known and unknown
environments.

 <dc:description>  After being trained, classifiers must often operate on data that has been
corrupted by noise. In this paper, we consider the impact of such noise on the
features of binary classifiers. Inspired by tools for classifier robustness, we
introduce the same classification probability (SCP) to measure the resulting
distortion on the classifier outputs. We introduce a low-complexity estimate of
the SCP based on quantization and polynomial multiplication. We also study
channel coding techniques based on replication error-correcting codes. In
contrast to the traditional channel coding approach, where error-correction is
meant to preserve the data and is agnostic to the application, our schemes
specifically aim to maximize the SCP (equivalently minimizing the distortion of
the classifier output) for the same redundancy overhead.

 <dc:description>  Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) are non-linear dynamical systems
designed so that their equilibrium points are solutions of the Boolean problem
they solve. In a previous work [Chaos 27, 023107 (2017)] it was argued that
when DMMs support solutions of the associated Boolean problem then strange
attractors cannot coexist with such equilibria. In this work, we demonstrate
such conjecture. In particular, we show that both topological transitivity and
the strongest property of topological mixing are inconsistent with the point
dissipative property of DMMs when equilibrium points are present. This is true
for both the whole phase space and the global attractor. Absence of topological
transitivity is enough to imply absence of chaotic behavior. In a similar vein,
we prove that if DMMs do not have equilibrium points, the only attractors
present are invariant tori/periodic orbits with periods that may possibly
increase with system size (quasi-attractors).

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of learning a causal graph over a set of variables
with interventions. We study the cost-optimal causal graph learning problem:
For a given skeleton (undirected version of the causal graph), design the set
of interventions with minimum total cost, that can uniquely identify any causal
graph with the given skeleton. We show that this problem is solvable in
polynomial time. Later, we consider the case when the number of interventions
is limited. For this case, we provide polynomial time algorithms when the
skeleton is a tree or a clique tree. For a general chordal skeleton, we develop
an efficient greedy algorithm, which can be improved when the causal graph
skeleton is an interval graph.

 <dc:description>  In many machine learning applications, it is important to explain the
predictions of a black-box classifier. For example, why does a deep neural
network assign an image to a particular class? We cast interpretability of
black-box classifiers as a combinatorial maximization problem and propose an
efficient streaming algorithm to solve it subject to cardinality constraints.
By extending ideas from Badanidiyuru et al. [2014], we provide a constant
factor approximation guarantee for our algorithm in the case of random stream
order and a weakly submodular objective function. This is the first such
theoretical guarantee for this general class of functions, and we also show
that no such algorithm exists for a worst case stream order. Our algorithm
obtains similar explanations of Inception V3 predictions $10$ times faster than
the state-of-the-art LIME framework of Ribeiro et al. [2016].

 <dc:description>  Blind Source Separation (BSS) is a challenging matrix factorization problem
that plays a central role in multichannel imaging science. In a large number of
applications, such as astrophysics, current unmixing methods are limited since
real-world mixtures are generally affected by extra instrumental effects like
blurring. Therefore, BSS has to be solved jointly with a deconvolution problem,
which requires tackling a new inverse problem: deconvolution BSS (DBSS). In
this article, we introduce an innovative DBSS approach, called DecGMCA, based
on sparse signal modeling and an efficient alternative projected least square
algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the DecGMCA algorithm performs
very well on simulations. It further highlights the importance of jointly
solving BSS and deconvolution instead of considering these two problems
independently. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed DecGMCA algorithm
is demonstrated on simulated radio-interferometric data.

 <dc:description>  We propose to learn tasks directly from visual demonstrations by learning to
predict the outcome of human and robot actions on an environment. We enable a
robot to physically perform a human demonstrated task without knowledge of the
thought processes or actions of the human, only their visually observable state
transitions. We evaluate our approach on two table-top, object manipulation
tasks and demonstrate generalisation to previously unseen states. Our approach
reduces the priors required to implement a robot task learning system compared
with the existing approaches of Learning from Demonstration, Reinforcement
Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning.

 <dc:description>  This work shows that policies with simple linear and RBF parameterizations
can be trained to solve a variety of continuous control tasks, including the
OpenAI gym benchmarks. The performance of these trained policies are
competitive with state of the art results, obtained with more elaborate
parameterizations such as fully connected neural networks. Furthermore,
existing training and testing scenarios are shown to be very limited and prone
to over-fitting, thus giving rise to only trajectory-centric policies. Training
with a diverse initial state distribution is shown to produce more global
policies with better generalization. This allows for interactive control
scenarios where the system recovers from large on-line perturbations; as shown
in the supplementary video.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel method for structural data recognition using a
large number of graph models. In general, prevalent methods for structural data
recognition have two shortcomings: 1) Only a single model is used to capture
structural variation. 2) Naive recognition methods are used, such as the
nearest neighbor method. In this paper, we propose strengthening the
recognition performance of these models as well as their ability to capture
structural variation. The proposed method constructs a large number of graph
models and trains decision trees using the models. This paper makes two main
contributions. The first is a novel graph model that can quickly perform
calculations, which allows us to construct several models in a feasible amount
of time. The second contribution is a novel approach to structural data
recognition: graph model boosting. Comprehensive structural variations can be
captured with a large number of graph models constructed in a boosting
framework, and a sophisticated classifier can be formed by aggregating the
decision trees. Consequently, we can carry out structural data recognition with
powerful recognition capability in the face of comprehensive structural
variation. The experiments shows that the proposed method achieves impressive
results and outperforms existing methods on datasets of IAM graph database
repository.

architecture for supporting diverse vehicular services in a seamless,
efficient, and cost-effective manner. Firstly, the motivations and challenges
for integration of space-air-ground networks are reviewed. Secondly, a software
defined network architecture with a layered structure is presented. To protect
the legacy services in satellite, aerial, and territorial segments, resources
in each segment are sliced through network slicing to achieve service
isolation. Then, available resources are put into a common and dynamic
space-air-ground resource pool, which is managed by hierarchical controllers to
accommodate vehicular services. Finally, a case study is carried out, followed
by discussion on some open research topics.

 <dc:description>  Record linkage involves merging records in large, noisy databases to remove
duplicate entities. It has become an important area because of its widespread
occurrence in bibliometrics, public health, official statistics production,
political science, and beyond. Traditional linkage methods directly linking
records to one another are computationally infeasible as the number of records
grows. As a result, it is increasingly common for researchers to treat record
linkage as a clustering task, in which each latent entity is associated with
one or more noisy database records. We critically assess performance bounds
using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under a Bayesian record linkage
framework, making connections to Kolchin partition models. We provide an upper
bound using the KL divergence and a lower bound on the minimum probability of
misclassifying a latent entity. We give insights for when our bounds hold using
simulated data and provide practical user guidance.

 <dc:description>  We consider support recovery in the quadratic logistic regression setting -
where the target depends on both p linear terms $x_i$ and up to $p^2$ quadratic
terms $x_i x_j$. Quadratic terms enable prediction/modeling of higher-order
effects between features and the target, but when incorporated naively may
involve solving a very large regression problem. We consider the sparse case,
where at most $s$ terms (linear or quadratic) are non-zero, and provide a new
faster algorithm. It involves (a) identifying the weak support (i.e. all
relevant variables) and (b) standard logistic regression optimization only on
these chosen variables. The first step relies on a novel insight about
correlation tests in the presence of non-linearity, and takes $O(pn)$ time for
$n$ samples - giving potentially huge computational gains over the naive
approach. Motivated by insights from the boolean case, we propose a non-linear
correlation test for non-binary finite support case that involves hashing a
variable and then correlating with the output variable. We also provide
experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper revisits the problem of multi-agent consensus from a graph signal
processing perspective. By defining the graph filter from the consensus
protocol, we establish the direct relation between average consensus of
multi-agent systems and filtering of graph signals. This relation not only
provides new insights of the average consensus, it also turns out to be a
powerful tool to design effective consensus protocols for uncertain networks,
which is difficult to deal with by existing time-domain methods. In this paper,
we consider two cases, one is uncertain networks modeled by an estimated
Laplacian matrix and a fixed eigenvalue bound, the other is connected graphs
with unknown topology. The consensus protocols are designed for both cases
based on the protocol filter. Several numerical examples are given to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

 <dc:description>  Remote Attestation (RA) allows a trusted entity (verifier) to securely
measure internal state of a remote untrusted hardware platform (prover). RA can
be used to establish a static or dynamic root of trust in embedded and
cyber-physical systems. It can also be used as a building block for other
security services and primitives, such as software updates and patches,
verifiable deletion and memory resetting. There are three major classes of RA
designs: hardware-based, software-based, and hybrid, each with its own set of
benefits and drawbacks. This paper presents the first hybrid RA design, called
HYDRA, that builds upon formally verified software components that ensure
memory isolation and protection, as well as enforce access control to memory
and other resources. HYDRA obtains these properties by using the formally
verified seL4 microkernel. (Until now, this was only attainable with purely
hardware-based designs.) Using seL4 requires fewer hardware modifications to
the underlying microprocessor. Building upon a formally verified software
component increases confidence in security of the overall design of HYDRA and
its implementation. We instantiate HYDRA on two commodity hardware platforms
and assess the performance and overhead of performing RA on such platforms via
experimentation; we show that HYDRA can attest 10MB of memory in less than
500msec when using a Speck-based message authentication code (MAC) to compute a
cryptographic checksum over the memory to be attested.

 <dc:description>  Given a graphical model, one essential problem is MAP inference, that is,
finding the most likely configuration of states according to the model.
Although this problem is NP-hard, large instances can be solved in practice. A
major open question is to explain why this is true. We give a natural condition
under which we can provably perform MAP inference in polynomial time. We
require that the number of fractional vertices in the LP relaxation exceeding
the optimal solution is bounded by a polynomial in the problem size. This
resolves an open question by Dimakis, Gohari, and Wainwright. In contrast, for
general LP relaxations of integer programs, known techniques can only handle a
constant number of fractional vertices whose value exceeds the optimal
solution. We experimentally verify this condition and demonstrate how efficient
various integer programming methods are at removing fractional solutions.

 <dc:description>  The facility location problem is widely used for summarizing large datasets
and has additional applications in sensor placement, image retrieval, and
clustering. One difficulty of this problem is that submodular optimization
algorithms require the calculation of pairwise benefits for all items in the
dataset. This is infeasible for large problems, so recent work proposed to only
calculate nearest neighbor benefits. One limitation is that several strong
assumptions were invoked to obtain provable approximation guarantees. In this
paper we establish that these extra assumptions are not necessary---solving the
sparsified problem will be almost optimal under the standard assumptions of the
problem. We then analyze a different method of sparsification that is a better
model for methods such as Locality Sensitive Hashing to accelerate the nearest
neighbor computations and extend the use of the problem to a broader family of
similarities. We validate our approach by demonstrating that it rapidly
generates interpretable summaries.

 <dc:description>  This is paper introduces a new single-pass reservoir weighted-sampling stream
aggregation algorithm, Priority-Based Aggregation (PBA). While order sampling
is a powerful and e cient method for weighted sampling from a stream of
uniquely keyed items, there is no current algorithm that realizes the benefits
of order sampling in the context of stream aggregation over non-unique keys. A
naive approach to order sample regardless of key then aggregate the results is
hopelessly inefficient. In distinction, our proposed algorithm uses a single
persistent random variable across the lifetime of each key in the cache, and
maintains unbiased estimates of the key aggregates that can be queried at any
point in the stream. The basic approach can be supplemented with a Sample and
Hold pre-sampling stage with a sampling rate adaptation controlled by PBA. This
approach represents a considerable reduction in computational complexity
compared with the state of the art in adapting Sample and Hold to operate with
a fixed cache size. Concerning statistical properties, we prove that PBA
provides unbiased estimates of the true aggregates. We analyze the
computational complexity of PBA and its variants, and provide a detailed
evaluation of its accuracy on synthetic and trace data. Weighted relative error
is reduced by 40% to 65% at sampling rates of 5% to 17%, relative to Adaptive
Sample and Hold; there is also substantial improvement for rank queries

 <dc:description>  Instruction set randomization (ISR) was initially proposed with the main goal
of countering code-injection attacks. However, ISR seems to have lost its
appeal since code-injection attacks became less attractive because protection
mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) as well as code-reuse
attacks became more prevalent.
  In this paper, we show that ISR can be extended to also protect against
code-reuse attacks while at the same time offering security guarantees similar
to those of software diversity, control-flow integrity, and information hiding.
We present Scylla, a scheme that deploys a new technique for in-place code
encryption to hide the code layout of a randomized binary, and restricts the
control flow to a benign execution path. This allows us to i) implicitly
restrict control-flow targets to basic block entries without requiring the
extraction of a control-flow graph, ii) achieve execution integrity within
legitimate basic blocks, and iii) hide the underlying code layout under
malicious read access to the program. Our analysis demonstrates that Scylla is
capable of preventing state-of-the-art attacks such as just-in-time
return-oriented programming (JIT-ROP) and crash-resistant oriented programming
(CROP). We extensively evaluate our prototype implementation of Scylla and show
feasible performance overhead. We also provide details on how this overhead can
be significantly reduced with dedicated hardware support.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and improved computation
have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL).
However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap
between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches
fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data
scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g.,
due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H-infinity control
methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test
scenarios can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper
proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we
train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that
applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is
reinforced -- that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We
formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function.
Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah,
Swimmer, Hopper and Walker2d) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a)
improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test
conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the
adversary.

 <dc:description>  Existing object proposal algorithms usually search for possible object
regions over multiple locations and scales separately, which ignore the
interdependency among different objects and deviate from the human perception
procedure. To incorporate global interdependency between objects into object
localization, we propose an effective Tree-structured Reinforcement Learning
(Tree-RL) approach to sequentially search for objects by fully exploiting both
the current observation and historical search paths. The Tree-RL approach
learns multiple searching policies through maximizing the long-term reward that
reflects localization accuracies over all the objects. Starting with taking the
entire image as a proposal, the Tree-RL approach allows the agent to
sequentially discover multiple objects via a tree-structured traversing scheme.
Allowing multiple near-optimal policies, Tree-RL offers more diversity in
search paths and is able to find multiple objects with a single feed-forward
pass. Therefore, Tree-RL can better cover different objects with various scales
which is quite appealing in the context of object proposal. Experiments on
PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 validate the effectiveness of the Tree-RL, which can
achieve comparable recalls with current object proposal algorithms via much
fewer candidate windows.

 <dc:description>  Detecting activities in untrimmed videos is an important but challenging
task. The performance of existing methods remains unsatisfactory, e.g., they
often meet difficulties in locating the beginning and end of a long complex
action. In this paper, we propose a generic framework that can accurately
detect a wide variety of activities from untrimmed videos. Our first
contribution is a novel proposal scheme that can efficiently generate
candidates with accurate temporal boundaries. The other contribution is a
cascaded classification pipeline that explicitly distinguishes between
relevance and completeness of a candidate instance. On two challenging temporal
activity detection datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet, the proposed framework
significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
superior accuracy and strong adaptivity in handling activities with various
temporal structures.

 <dc:description>  One of recent trends [30, 31, 14] in network architec- ture design is
stacking small filters (e.g., 1x1 or 3x3) in the entire network because the
stacked small filters is more ef- ficient than a large kernel, given the same
computational complexity. However, in the field of semantic segmenta- tion,
where we need to perform dense per-pixel prediction, we find that the large
kernel (and effective receptive field) plays an important role when we have to
perform the clas- sification and localization tasks simultaneously. Following
our design principle, we propose a Global Convolutional Network to address both
the classification and localization issues for the semantic segmentation. We
also suggest a residual-based boundary refinement to further refine the ob-
ject boundaries. Our approach achieves state-of-art perfor- mance on two public
benchmarks and significantly outper- forms previous results, 82.2% (vs 80.2%)
on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and 76.9% (vs 71.8%) on Cityscapes dataset.

 <dc:description>  We provide new approximation guarantees for greedy low rank matrix estimation
under standard assumptions of restricted strong convexity and smoothness. Our
novel analysis also uncovers previously unknown connections between the low
rank estimation and combinatorial optimization, so much so that our bounds are
reminiscent of corresponding approximation bounds in submodular maximization.
Additionally, we also provide statistical recovery guarantees. Finally, we
present empirical comparison of greedy estimation with established baselines on
two important real-world problems.

 <dc:description>  DGCC protocol has been shown to achieve good performance on multi-core
in-memory system. However, distributed transactions complicate the dependency
resolution, and therefore, an effective transaction partitioning strategy is
essential to reduce expensive multi-node distributed transactions. During
failure recovery, log must be examined from the last checkpoint onwards and the
affected transactions are re-executed based on the way they are partitioned and
executed. Existing approaches treat both transaction management and recovery as
two separate problems, even though recovery is dependent on the sequence in
which transactions are executed.
  In this paper, we propose to treat the transaction management and recovery
problems as one. We first propose an efficient Distributed Dependency Graph
based Concurrency Control (DistDGCC) protocol for handling transactions
spanning multiple nodes, and propose a new novel and efficient logging protocol
called Dependency Logging that also makes use of dependency graphs for
efficient logging and recovery. DistDGCC optimizes the average cost for each
distributed transaction by processing transactions in batch. Moreover, it also
reduces the effects of thread blocking caused by distributed transactions and
consequently improves the runtime performance. Further, dependency logging
exploits the same data structure that is used by DistDGCC to reduce the logging
overhead, as well as the logical dependency information to improve the recovery
parallelism. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of
our proposed technique against state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental
results show that DistDGCC is efficient and scalable, and dependency logging
supports fast recovery with marginal runtime overhead. Hence, the overall
system performance is significantly improved as a result.

 <dc:description>  Greedy algorithms are widely used for problems in machine learning such as
feature selection and set function optimization. Unfortunately, for large
datasets, the running time of even greedy algorithms can be quite high. This is
because for each greedy step we need to refit a model or calculate a function
using the previously selected choices and the new candidate.
  Two algorithms that are faster approximations to the greedy forward selection
were introduced recently ([Mirzasoleiman et al. 2013, 2015]). They achieve
better performance by exploiting distributed computation and stochastic
evaluation respectively. Both algorithms have provable performance guarantees
for submodular functions.
  In this paper we show that divergent from previously held opinion,
submodularity is not required to obtain approximation guarantees for these two
algorithms. Specifically, we show that a generalized concept of weak
submodularity suffices to give multiplicative approximation guarantees. Our
result extends the applicability of these algorithms to a larger class of
functions. Furthermore, we show that a bounded submodularity ratio can be used
to provide data dependent bounds that can sometimes be tighter also for
submodular functions. We empirically validate our work by showing superior
performance of fast greedy approximations versus several established baselines
on artificial and real datasets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a general framework for tensor singular value
decomposition (tensor SVD), which focuses on the methodology and theory for
extracting the hidden low-rank structure from high-dimensional tensor data.
Comprehensive results are developed on both the statistical and computational
limits for tensor SVD. This problem exhibits three different phases according
to the signal-noise-ratio (SNR). In particular, with strong SNR, we show that
the classical higher order orthogonal iteration achieves the minimax optimal
rate of convergence in estimation; with weak SNR, the information-theoretical
lower bound implies that it is impossible to have consistent estimation in
general; with moderate SNR, we show that the non-convex maximum likelihood
estimation provides optimal solution, but with NP-hard computational cost;
moreover, under the hardness hypothesis of hypergraphic planted clique
detection, there are no polynomial-time algorithms performing consistently in
general.

 <dc:description>  We consider the statistical problem of recovering a hidden &quot;ground truth&quot;
binary labeling for the vertices of a graph G up to low Hamming error from
noisy edge and vertex measurements. We present new algorithms and a sharp
finite-sample analysis for this problem on trees and sparse graphs with poor
expansion properties such as hypergrids and ring lattices. Our method
generalizes and improves over Globerson et al. (2015), who introduced the
problem for two-dimensional grid lattices.
  For trees we provide a simple, efficient, algorithm that infers the ground
truth with optimal Hamming error and implies recovery results for all connected
graphs. Here, the presence of side information is critical to obtain a
non-trivial recovery rate. We then show how to adapt this algorithm to tree
decompositions of edge-subgraphs of certain graph families such as lattices,
resulting in optimal recovery error rates that can be obtained in a highly
efficient manner.
  The thrust of our analysis is to 1) use the tree decomposition along with
edge measurements to produce a small class of viable vertex labelings and 2)
apply fast rate results from statistical learn-ing theory to show that we can
infer the ground truth from this class using vertex measurements. We show the
power of our method by providing several examples including hypergrids, ring
lattices, and the Newman-Watts model for small world graphs. For
two-dimensional grids, our results improve over Globerson et al. (2015) by
obtaining optimal recovery in the constant-height regime.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a hierarchical control scheme for interconnected
systems. The higher layer of the control structure is designed with robust
Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on a reduced order dynamic model of the
overall system and is aimed at optimizing long-term performance, while at the
lower layer local regulators acting at a higher frequency are designed for the
full order models of the subsystems to refine the control action. A simulation
experiment concerning the control of the temperature inside a building is
reported to witness the potentialities of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies a green paradigm for the underlay coexistence of primary
users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) in energy harvesting cognitive radio
networks (EH-CRNs), wherein battery-free SUs capture both the spectrum and the
energy of PUs to enhance spectrum efficiency and green energy utilization. To
lower the transmit powers of SUs, we employ multi-hop transmission with time
division multiple access, by which SUs first harvest energy from the RF signals
of PUs and then transmit data in the allocated time concurrently with PUs, all
in the licensed spectrum. In this way, the available transmit energy of each SU
mainly depends on the harvested energy before the turn to transmit, namely
energy causality. Meanwhile, the transmit powers of SUs must be strictly
controlled to protect PUs from harmful interference. Thus, subject to the
energy causality constraint and the interference power constraint, we study the
end-to-end throughput maximization problem for optimal time and power
allocation. To solve this nonconvex problem, we first equivalently transform it
into a convex optimization problem and then propose the joint optimal time and
power allocation (JOTPA) algorithm that iteratively solves a series of
feasibility problems until convergence. Extensive simulations evaluate the
performance of EH-CRNs with JOTPA in three typical deployment scenarios and
validate the superiority of JOTPA by making comparisons with two other resource
allocation algorithms.

 <dc:title>MSF and Connectivity in Limited Variants of the Congested Clique</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The congested clique is a synchronous, message-passing model of distributed
computing in which each computational unit (node) in each round can send
message of O(log n) bits to each other node of the network, where n is the
number of nodes. This model has been considered under two extreme scanarios:
unicast or broadcast. In the unicast model, a node can send (possibly)
different message to each other node of the network. In contrast, in the
broadcast model each node sends a single (the same) message to all other nodes.
We study the congested clique model parametrized by the range r, the maximum
number of different messages a node can send in one round. Following recent
progress in design of algorihms for graph connectivity and minimum span- ning
forest (MSF) in the unicast congested clique, we study these problems in
limited variants of the congested clique. We present the first sub-logarithmic
algorithm for connected components in the broadcast congested clique. Then, we
show that efficient unicast deterministic algorithm for MSF and randomized
algorithm for connected components can be efficiently imple- mented in the
rcast model with range r = 2, the weakest model of the congested clique above
the broadcast variant (r = 1) in the hierarchy with respect to range. More
importantly, our al- gorithms give the first solutions with optimal capacity of
communication edges, while preserving small round complexity.

 <dc:description>  In a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), data manipulation and representation is a
crucial part and can take a lot of time to be developed from scratch. Although
various visualization tools have been created for certain projects so far,
these tools can only be used in certain scenarios, due to their hard-coded
packet formats and network's properties. To speed up the development process, a
visualization tool which can adapt to any kind of WSN is essentially necessary.
For this purpose, a general-purpose visualization tool - NViz, which can
represent and visualize data for any kind of WSN, is proposed. NViz allows
users to set their network's properties and packet formats through XML files.
Based on properties defined, users can choose the meaning of them and let NViz
represents the data respectively. Furthermore, a better Replay mechanism, which
lets researchers and developers debug their WSN easily, is also integrated in
this tool. NViz is designed based on a layered architecture which allows for
clear and well-defined interrelationships and interfaces between each
component.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Process roles are used to structure complex engineering processes in single
sys-tems development for many years. Typically, each role has specific
responsi-bilities from which certain information demands originate. In the
engineering of variable software, role-specific information demands affect
variability in-formation. To control the access to the variability information,
we suggest us-ing the concepts of an explicit access control model. We
integrate an access control model and a variability modeling language on a
conceptual level. Ad-ditionally, we extend the variability modeling language by
formally defined operations. Based on this extension, we propose a formal
integration of an ac-cess control model and the variability modeling language.
Our solution allows to explicitly define access control to variability
information on a formal basis.

 <dc:description>  The growth of data, the need for scalability and the complexity of models
used in modern machine learning calls for distributed implementations. Yet, as
of today, distributed machine learning frameworks have largely ignored the
possibility of arbitrary (i.e., Byzantine) failures. In this paper, we study
the robustness to Byzantine failures at the fundamental level of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), the heart of most machine learning algorithms. Assuming
a set of $n$ workers, up to $f$ of them being Byzantine, we ask how robust can
SGD be, without limiting the dimension, nor the size of the parameter space.
  We first show that no gradient descent update rule based on a linear
combination of the vectors proposed by the workers (i.e, current approaches)
tolerates a single Byzantine failure. We then formulate a resilience property
of the update rule capturing the basic requirements to guarantee convergence
despite $f$ Byzantine workers. We finally propose Krum, an update rule that
satisfies the resilience property aforementioned. For a $d$-dimensional
learning problem, the time complexity of Krum is $O(n^2 \cdot (d + \log n))$.

 <dc:description>  In this note, a new formulation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework
with no stability-related terminal constraint is proposed and its stability is
proved under mild standard assumptions. The novelty in the formulation lies in
the use of time-varying monotonically increasing stage cost penalty. The main
result is that the $0$-reachability prediction horizon can always be made
stabilizing provided that the increasing rate of the penalty is made
sufficiently high.

 <dc:title>A Long-Term Analysis of Polarization on Twitter</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Social media has played an important role in shaping political discourse over
the last decade. At the same time, it is often perceived to have increased
political polarization, thanks to the scale of discussions and their public
nature.
  In this paper, we try to answer the question of whether political
polarization in the US on Twitter has increased over the last eight years. We
analyze a large longitudinal Twitter dataset of 679,000 users and look at signs
of polarization in their (i) network - how people follow political and media
accounts, (ii) tweeting behavior - whether they retweet content from both
sides, and (iii) content - how partisan the hashtags they use are. Our analysis
shows that online polarization has indeed increased over the past eight years
and that, depending on the measure, the relative change is 10%-20%. Our study
is one of very few with such a long-term perspective, encompassing two US
presidential elections and two mid-term elections, providing a rare
longitudinal analysis.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a framework for automatic synthesis of a control sequence
for multi-agent systems governed by continuous linear dynamics under timed
constraints. First, the motion of the agents in the workspace is abstracted
into individual Transition Systems (TS). Second, each agent is assigned with an
individual formula given in Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and in
parallel, the team of agents is assigned with a collaborative team formula. The
proposed method is based on a correct-by-construction control synthesis method,
and hence guarantees that the resulting closed-loop system will satisfy the
specifications. The specifications considers boolean-valued properties under
real-time. Extended simulations has been performed in order to demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed controllers.

 <dc:description>  We show that, for any graph optimization problem in which the feasible
solutions can be expressed by a formula in monadic second-order logic
describing sets of vertices or edges and in which the goal is to minimize the
sum of the weights in the selected sets, we can find the $k$ best solutions for
$n$-vertex graphs of bounded treewidth in time $\mathcal O(n+k\log n)$. In
particular, this applies to the problem of finding the $k$ shortest simple
paths between given vertices in directed graphs of bounded treewidth, giving an
exponential speedup in the per-path cost over previous algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important for computing systems,
in particular for large scale HPC facilities. In this work we evaluate, from an
user perspective, the use of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
techniques, assisted by the power and energy monitoring capabilities of modern
processors in order to tune applications for energy efficiency. We run selected
kernels and a full HPC application on two high-end processors widely used in
the HPC context, namely an NVIDIA K80 GPU and an Intel Haswell CPU. We evaluate
the available trade-offs between energy-to-solution and time-to-solution,
attempting a function-by-function frequency tuning. We finally estimate the
benefits obtainable running the full code on a HPC multi-GPU node, with respect
to default clock frequency governors. We instrument our code to accurately
monitor power consumption and execution time without the need of any additional
hardware, and we enable it to change CPUs and GPUs clock frequencies while
running. We analyze our results on the different architectures using a simple
energy-performance model, and derive a number of energy saving strategies which
can be easily adopted on recent high-end HPC systems for generic applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows that wirelessly powered backscatter communications is
subject to a fundamental tradeoff between the harvested energy at the tag and
the reliability of the backscatter communication, measured in terms of SNR at
the reader. Assuming the RF transmit signal is a multisine waveform adaptive to
the channel state information, we derive a systematic approach to optimize the
transmit waveform weights (amplitudes and phases) in order to enlarge as much
as possible the SNRenergy region. Performance evaluations confirm the
significant benefits of using multiple frequency components in the adaptive
transmit multisine waveform to exploit the nonlinearity of the rectifier and a
frequency diversity gain.

 <dc:description>  Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention
in the last decade. Recently, channel-adaptive waveforms have been shown to
significantly increase the DC power level at the output of the rectifier.
However the design of those waveforms is generally computationally complex and
does not lend itself easily to practical implementation. We here propose a
low-complexity channel-adaptive multisine waveform design whose performance is
very close to that of the optimal design. Performance evaluations confirm the
benefits of the new design in various rectifier topologies.

 <dc:title>Deep Reservoir Computing Using Cellular Automata</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been a prominent concept within
artificial intelligence. They are inspired by Biological Neural Networks (BNNs)
and provide an intuitive and abstract representation of how BNNs work. Derived
from the more generic Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the recurrent ones are
meant to be used for temporal tasks, such as speech recognition, because they
are capable of memorizing historic input. However, such networks are very time
consuming to train as a result of their inherent nature. Recently, Echo State
Networks and Liquid State Machines have been proposed as possible RNN
alternatives, under the name of Reservoir Computing (RC). RCs are far more easy
to train. In this paper, Cellular Automata are used as reservoir, and are
tested on the 5-bit memory task (a well known benchmark within the RC
community). The work herein provides a method of mapping binary inputs from the
task onto the automata, and a recurrent architecture for handling the
sequential aspects of it. Furthermore, a layered (deep) reservoir architecture
is proposed. Performances are compared towards earlier work, in addition to its
single-layer version. Results show that the single CA reservoir system yields
similar results to state-of-the-art work. The system comprised of two layered
reservoirs do show a noticeable improvement compared to a single CA reservoir.
This indicates potential for further research and provides valuable insight on
how to design CA reservoir systems.

 <dc:description>  Traffic on freeways can be managed by means of ramp meters from Road Traffic
Control rooms. Human operators cannot efficiently manage a network of ramp
meters. To support them, we present an intelligent platform for traffic
management which includes a new ramp metering coordination scheme in the
decision making module, an efficient dashboard for interacting with human
operators, machine learning tools for learning event definitions and Complex
Event Processing tools able to deal with uncertainties inherent to the traffic
use case. Unlike the usual approach, the devised event-driven platform is able
to predict a congestion up to 4 minutes before it really happens. Proactive
decision making can then be established leading to significant improvement of
traffic conditions.

 <dc:description>  This paper is a tutorial on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) and its
applications. FCA is an applied branch of Lattice Theory, a mathematical
discipline which enables formalisation of concepts as basic units of human
thinking and analysing data in the object-attribute form. Originated in early
80s, during the last three decades, it became a popular human-centred tool for
knowledge representation and data analysis with numerous applications. Since
the tutorial was specially prepared for RuSSIR 2014, the covered FCA topics
include Information Retrieval with a focus on visualisation aspects, Machine
Learning, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Text Mining and several others.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new extrinsic calibration of kaleidoscopic imaging
system by estimating normals and distances of the mirrors. The problem to be
solved in this paper is a simultaneous estimation of all mirror parameters
consistent throughout multiple reflections. Unlike conventional methods
utilizing a pair of direct and mirrored images of a reference 3D object to
estimate the parameters on a per-mirror basis, our method renders the
simultaneous estimation problem into solving a linear set of equations. The key
contribution of this paper is to introduce a linear estimation of multiple
mirror parameters from kaleidoscopic 2D projections of a single 3D point of
unknown geometry. Evaluations with synthesized and real images demonstrate the
performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with conventional methods.

 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In our implementation of geometric resolution, the most costly operation is
subsumption testing (or matching): One has to decide for a three-valued,
geometric formula, if this formula is false in a given interpretation. The
formula contains only atoms with variables, equality, and existential
quantifiers. The interpretation contains only atoms with constants. Because the
atoms have no term structure, matching for geometric resolution is hard. We
translate the matching problem into a generalized constraint satisfaction
problem, and discuss several approaches for solving it efficiently, two direct
algorithms and two translations to propositional SAT. After that, we study
filtering techniques based on local consistency checking. Such filtering
techniques can a priori refute a large percentage of generalized constraint
satisfaction problems. Finally, we adapt the matching algorithms in such a way
that they find solutions that use a minimal subset of the interpretation. The
adaptation can be combined with every matching algorithm. The techniques
presented in this paper may have applications in constraint solving.

 <dc:description>  The monadic shallow linear Horn fragment is well-known to be decidable and
has many application, e.g., in security protocol analysis, tree automata, or
abstraction refinement. It was a long standing open problem how to extend the
fragment to the non-Horn case, preserving decidability, that would, e.g.,
enable to express non-determinism in protocols. We prove decidability of the
non-Horn monadic shallow linear fragment via ordered resolution further
extended with dismatching constraints and discuss some applications of the new
decidable fragment.

 <dc:description>  The great success of wearables and smartphone apps for provision of extensive
physical workout instructions boosts a whole industry dealing with consumer
oriented sensors and sports equipment. But with these opportunities there are
also new challenges emerging. The unregulated distribution of instructions
about ambitious exercises enables unexperienced users to undertake demanding
workouts without professional supervision which may lead to suboptimal training
success or even serious injuries. We believe, that automated supervision and
realtime feedback during a workout may help to solve these issues. Therefore we
introduce four fundamental steps for complex human motion assessment and
present SensX, a sensor-based architecture for monitoring, recording, and
analyzing complex and multi-dimensional motion chains. We provide the results
of our preliminary study encompassing 8 different body weight exercises, 20
participants, and more than 9,220 recorded exercise repetitions. Furthermore,
insights into SensXs classification capabilities and the impact of specific

 <dc:description>  Background: It is necessary and essential to discovery protein function from
the novel primary sequences. Wet lab experimental procedures are not only
time-consuming, but also costly, so predicting protein structure and function
reliably based only on amino acid sequence has significant value. TATA-binding
protein (TBP) is a kind of DNA binding protein, which plays a key role in the
transcription regulation. Our study proposed an automatic approach for
identifying TATA-binding proteins efficiently, accurately, and conveniently.
This method would guide for the special protein identification with
computational intelligence strategies. Results: Firstly, we proposed novel
fingerprint features for TBP based on pseudo amino acid composition,
physicochemical properties, and secondary structure. Secondly, hierarchical
features dimensionality reduction strategies were employed to improve the
performance furthermore. Currently, Pretata achieves 92.92% TATA- binding
protein prediction accuracy, which is better than all other existing methods.
Conclusions: The experiments demonstrate that our method could greatly improve
the prediction accuracy and speed, thus allowing large-scale NGS data
prediction to be practical. A web server is developed to facilitate the other
researchers, which can be accessed at http://server.malab.cn/preTata/.

 <dc:title>On the Importance of Correlations in Rational Choice: A Case for

 <dc:description>  The Nash equilibrium paradigm, and Rational Choice Theory in general, rely on
agents acting independently from each other. This note shows how this
assumption is crucial in the definition of Rational Choice Theory. It explains
how a consistent Alternate Rational Choice Theory, as suggested by Jean-Pierre
Dupuy, can be built on the exact opposite assumption, and how it provides a
viable account for alternate, actually observed behavior of rational agents
that is based on correlations between their decisions.
  The end goal of this note is three-fold: (i) to motivate that the Perfect
Prediction Equilibrium, implementing Dupuy's notion of projected time and
previously called &quot;projected equilibrium&quot;, is a reasonable approach in certain
real situations and a meaningful complement to the Nash paradigm, (ii) to
summarize common misconceptions about this equilibrium, and (iii) to give a
concise motivation for future research on non-Nashian game theory.

 <dc:description>  A temporal graph is a data structure, consisting of nodes and edges in which
the edges are associated with time labels. To analyze the temporal graph, the
first step is to find a proper graph dataset/benchmark. While many temporal
graph datasets exist online, none could be found that used the interval labels
in which each edge is associated with a starting and ending time. Therefore we
create a temporal graph data based on Wikipedia reference graph for temporal
analysis. This report aims to provide more details of this graph benchmark to
those who are interested in using it.

 <dc:description>  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can offer timely and cost-effective delivery
of high-quality sensing data. How- ever, deciding when and where to take
measurements in complex environments remains an open challenge. To address this
issue, we introduce a new multiresolution mapping approach for informative path
planning in terrain monitoring using UAVs. Our strategy exploits the spatial
correlation encoded in a Gaussian Process model as a prior for Bayesian data
fusion with probabilistic sensors. This allows us to incorporate
altitude-dependent sensor models for aerial imaging and perform constant-time
measurement updates. The resulting maps are used to plan information-rich
trajectories in continuous 3-D space through a combination of grid search and
evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our framework on the application of
agricultural biomass monitoring. Extensive simulations show that our planner
performs better than existing methods, with mean error reductions of up to 45%
compared to traditional &quot;lawnmower&quot; coverage. We demonstrate proof of concept
using a multirotor to map color in different environments.

 <dc:description>  Divergent word usages reflect differences among people. In this paper, we
present a novel angle for studying word usage divergence -- word
interpretations. We propose an approach that quantifies semantic differences in
interpretations among different groups of people. The effectiveness of our
approach is validated by quantitative evaluations. Experiment results indicate
that divergences in word interpretations exist. We further apply the approach
to two well studied types of differences between people -- gender and region.
The detected words with divergent interpretations reveal the unique features of
specific groups of people. For gender, we discover that certain different
interests, social attitudes, and characters between males and females are
reflected in their divergent interpretations of many words. For region, we find
that specific interpretations of certain words reveal the geographical and
cultural features of different regions.

 <dc:description>  Emojis, as a new way of conveying nonverbal cues, are widely adopted in
computer-mediated communications. In this paper, first from a message sender
perspective, we focus on people's motives in using four types of emojis --
positive, neutral, negative, and non-facial. We compare the willingness levels
of using these emoji types for seven typical intentions that people usually
apply nonverbal cues for in communication. The results of extensive statistical
hypothesis tests not only report the popularities of the intentions, but also
uncover the subtle differences between emoji types in terms of intended uses.
Second, from a perspective of message recipients, we further study the
sentiment effects of emojis, as well as their duplications, on verbal messages.
Different from previous studies in emoji sentiment, we study the sentiments of
emojis and their contexts as a whole. The experiment results indicate that the
powers of conveying sentiment are different between four emoji types, and the
sentiment effects of emojis vary in the contexts of different valences.

 <dc:title>The Half-integral Erd\&quot;os-P\'osa Property for Non-null Cycles</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A Group Labeled Graph is a pair $(G,\Lambda)$ where $G$ is an oriented graph
and $\Lambda$ is a mapping from the arcs of $G$ to elements of a group. A (not
necessarily directed) cycle $C$ is called non-null if for any cyclic ordering
of the arcs in $C$, the group element obtained by `adding' the labels on
forward arcs and `subtracting' the labels on reverse arcs is not the identity
element of the group. Non-null cycles in group labeled graphs generalize
several well-known graph structures, including odd cycles.
  In this paper, we prove that non-null cycles on Group Labeled Graphs have the
half-integral Erd\&quot;os-P\'osa property. That is, there is a function $f:{\mathbb
N}\to {\mathbb N}$ such that for any $k\in {\mathbb N}$, any group labeled
graph $(G,\Lambda)$ has a set of $k$ non-null cycles such that each vertex of
$G$ appears in at most two of these cycles or there is a set of at most $f(k)$
vertices that intersects every non-null cycle. Since it is known that non-null
cycles do not have the integeral Erd\&quot;os-P\'osa property in general, a
half-integral Erd\&quot;os-P\'osa result is the best one could hope for.

 <dc:description>  The paper develops a general framework for constrained clustering which is
based on the close connection of geometric clustering and diagrams. Various new
structural and algorithmic results are proved (and known results generalized
and unified) which show that the approach is computationally efficient and
flexible enough to pursue various conflicting demands.
  The strength of the model is also demonstrated practically on real-world
instances of the electoral district design problem where municipalities of a
state have to be grouped into districts of nearly equal population while
obeying certain politically motivated requirements.

 <dc:description>  Modeling network traffic is gaining importance in order to counter modern
threats of ever increasing sophistication. It is though surprisingly difficult
and costly to construct reliable classifiers on top of telemetry data due to
the variety and complexity of signals that no human can manage to interpret in
full. Obtaining training data with sufficiently large and variable body of
labels can thus be seen as prohibitive problem. The goal of this work is to
detect infected computers by observing their HTTP(S) traffic collected from
network sensors, which are typically proxy servers or network firewalls, while
relying on only minimal human input in model training phase. We propose a
discriminative model that makes decisions based on all computer's traffic
observed during predefined time window (5 minutes in our case). The model is
trained on collected traffic samples over equally sized time window per large
number of computers, where the only labels needed are human verdicts about the
computer as a whole (presumed infected vs. presumed clean). As part of training
the model itself recognizes discriminative patterns in traffic targeted to
individual servers and constructs the final high-level classifier on top of
them. We show the classifier to perform with very high precision, while the
learned traffic patterns can be interpreted as Indicators of Compromise. In the
following we implement the discriminative model as a neural network with
special structure reflecting two stacked multi-instance problems. The main
advantages of the proposed configuration include not only improved accuracy and
ability to learn from gross labels, but also automatic learning of server types
(together with their detectors) which are typically visited by infected
computers.

 <dc:description>  Researchers interested in statistically modeling network data have a
well-established and quickly growing set of approaches from which to choose.
Several of these methods have been regularly applied in research on political
networks, while others have yet to permeate the field. Here, we review the most
prominent methods of inferential network analysis---both for cross-sectionally
and longitudinally observed networks including (temporal) exponential random
graph models, latent space models, the quadratic assignment procedure, and
stochastic actor oriented models. For each method, we summarize its analytic
form, identify prominent published applications in political science and
discuss computational considerations. We conclude with a set of guidelines for
selecting a method for a given application.

 <dc:description>  Software tracing techniques are well-established and used by instrumentation
tools to extract run-time information for program analysis and debugging.
Dynamic binary instrumentation as one tool instruments program binaries to
extract information. Unfortunately, instrumentation causes perturbation that is
unacceptable for time-sensitive applications. Consequently we developed DIME*,
a tool for dynamic binary instrumentation that considers timing constraints.
DIME* uses Pin and a rate-based server approach to extract information only as
long as user-specified constraints are maintained. Due to the large amount of
redundancies in program traces, DIME* reduces the instrumentation overhead by
one to three orders of magnitude compared to native Pin while extracting up to
99% of the information. We instrument VLC and PostgreSQL to demonstrate the
usability of DIME*.

 <dc:description>  MAC address randomization is a privacy technique whereby mobile devices
rotate through random hardware addresses in order to prevent observers from
singling out their traffic or physical location from other nearby devices.
Adoption of this technology, however, has been sporadic and varied across
device manufacturers. In this paper, we present the first wide-scale study of
MAC address randomization in the wild, including a detailed breakdown of
different randomization techniques by operating system, manufacturer, and model
of device.
  We then identify multiple flaws in these implementations which can be
exploited to defeat randomization as performed by existing devices. First, we
show that devices commonly make improper use of randomization by sending
wireless frames with the true, global address when they should be using a
randomized address. We move on to extend the passive identification techniques
of Vanhoef et al. to effectively defeat randomization in ~96% of Android
phones. Finally, we show a method that can be used to track 100% of devices
using randomization, regardless of manufacturer, by exploiting a previously
unknown flaw in the way existing wireless chipsets handle low-level control
frames.

 <dc:description>  Cluster analysis plays an important role in decision making process for many
knowledge-based systems. There exist a wide variety of different approaches for
clustering applications including the heuristic techniques, probabilistic
models, and traditional hierarchical algorithms. In this paper, a novel
heuristic approach based on big bang-big crunch algorithm is proposed for
clustering problems. The proposed method not only takes advantage of heuristic
nature to alleviate typical clustering algorithms such as k-means, but it also
benefits from the memory based scheme as compared to its similar heuristic
techniques. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm is
investigated based on several benchmark test functions as well as on the
well-known datasets. The experimental results show the significant superiority
of the proposed method over the similar algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Categorization is necessary for many decision making tasks. However, the
categorization process may interfere the decision making result and the law of
total probability can be violated in some situations. To predict the
interference effect of categorization, some model based on quantum probability
has been proposed. In this paper, a new quantum dynamic belief (QDB) model is
proposed. Considering the precise decision may not be made during the process,
the concept of uncertainty is introduced in our model to simulate real human
thinking process. Then the interference effect categorization can be predicted
by handling the uncertain information. The proposed model is applied to a
categorization decision-making experiment to explain the interference effect of
categorization. Compared with other models, our model is relatively more
succinct and the result shows the correctness and effectiveness of our model.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units
(GPUs), large scale image localization, classification and retrieval have seen
increased prevalence. Designing scalable software architecture that co-evolves
with such specialized hardware is a challenge in the commercial setting. In
this paper, we describe one such architecture (\textit{Cortexica}) that
leverages scalability of GPUs and sandboxing offered by docker containers. This
allows for the flexibility of mixing different computer architectures as well
as computational algorithms with the security of a trusted environment. We
illustrate the utility of this framework in a commercial setting i.e.,
searching for multiple products in an image by combining image localisation and
retrieval.

 <dc:description>  PID control architectures are widely used in industrial applications. Despite
their low number of open parameters, tuning multiple, coupled PID controllers
can become tedious in practice. In this paper, we extend PILCO, a model-based
policy search framework, to automatically tune multivariate PID controllers
purely based on data observed on an otherwise unknown system. The system's
state is extended appropriately to frame the PID policy as a static state
feedback policy. This renders PID tuning possible as the solution of a finite
horizon optimal control problem without further a priori knowledge. The
framework is applied to the task of balancing an inverted pendulum on a seven
degree-of-freedom robotic arm, thereby demonstrating its capabilities of fast
and data-efficient policy learning, even on complex real world problems.

 <dc:title>Local Equivalence and Intrinsic Metrics between Reeb Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  As graphical summaries for topological spaces and maps, Reeb graphs are
common objects in the computer graphics or topological data analysis
literature. Defining good metrics between these objects has become an important
question for applications, where it matters to quantify the extent by which two
given Reeb graphs differ. Recent contributions emphasize this aspect, proposing
novel distances such as {\em functional distortion} or {\em interleaving} that
are provably more discriminative than the so-called {\em bottleneck distance},
being true metrics whereas the latter is only a pseudo-metric. Their main
drawback compared to the bottleneck distance is to be comparatively hard (if at
all possible) to evaluate. Here we take the opposite view on the problem and
show that the bottleneck distance is in fact good enough {\em locally}, in the
sense that it is able to discriminate a Reeb graph from any other Reeb graph in
a small enough neighborhood, as efficiently as the other metrics do. This
suggests considering the {\em intrinsic metrics} induced by these distances,
which turn out to be all {\em globally} equivalent. This novel viewpoint on the
study of Reeb graphs has a potential impact on applications, where one may not
only be interested in discriminating between data but also in interpolating
between them.

 <dc:description>  Suppose that Alice and Bob are located in distant laboratories, which are
connected by an ideal quantum channel. Suppose further that they share many
copies of a quantum state $\rho_{ABE}$, such that Alice possesses the $A$
systems and Bob the $BE$ systems. In our model, there is an identifiable part
of Bob's laboratory that is insecure: a third party named Eve has infiltrated
Bob's laboratory and gained control of the $E$ systems. Alice, knowing this,
would like use their shared state and the ideal quantum channel to communicate
a message in such a way that Bob, who has access to the whole of his laboratory
($BE$ systems), can decode it, while Eve, who has access only to a sector of
Bob's laboratory ($E$ systems) and the ideal quantum channel connecting Alice
to Bob, cannot learn anything about Alice's transmitted message. We call this
task the conditional one-time pad, and in this paper, we prove that the optimal
rate of secret communication for this task is equal to the conditional quantum
mutual information $I(A;B|E)$ of their shared state. We thus give the
conditional quantum mutual information an operational meaning that is different
from those given in prior works, via state redistribution, conditional erasure,
or state deconstruction. We also generalize the model and method in several
ways, one of which demonstrates that the negative tripartite interaction
information $-I_{3}(A;B;E) = I(A;BE)-I(A;B)-I(A;E)$ of a tripartite state
$\rho_{ABE}$ is an achievable rate for a secret-sharing task, i.e., the case in
which Alice's message should be secure from someone possessing only the $AB$ or
$AE$ systems but should be decodable by someone possessing all systems $A$,
$B$, and $E$.

 <dc:description>  Being able to fall safely is a necessary motor skill for humanoids performing
highly dynamic tasks, such as running and jumping. We propose a new method to
learn a policy that minimizes the maximal impulse during the fall. The
optimization solves for both a discrete contact planning problem and a
continuous optimal control problem. Once trained, the policy can compute the
optimal next contacting body part (e.g. left foot, right foot, or hands),
contact location and timing, and the required joint actuation. We represent the
policy as a mixture of actor-critic neural network, which consists of n control
policies and the corresponding value functions. Each pair of actor-critic is
associated with one of the n possible contacting body parts. During execution,
the policy corresponding to the highest value function will be executed while
the associated body part will be the next contact with the ground. With this
mixture of actor-critic architecture, the discrete contact sequence planning is
solved through the selection of the best critics while the continuous control
problem is solved by the optimization of actors. We show that our policy can
achieve comparable, sometimes even higher, rewards than a recursive search of
the action space using dynamic programming, while enjoying 50 to 400 times of
speed gain during online execution.

 <dc:description>  Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning,
deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several
difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning
(AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small
amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are
notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL
acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods
rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent
advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a
practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional
data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse
existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian
convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques
with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active
learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST dataset, as well as
for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task).

 <dc:description>  Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems with piecewise differentiable
parameters is a class of LPV systems for which no proper analysis conditions
have been obtained so far. To fill this gap, we propose an approach based on
the theory of hybrid systems. The underlying idea is to reformulate the
considered LPV system as an equivalent hybrid system that will incorporate,
through a suitable state augmentation, information on both the dynamics of the
state of the system and the considered class of parameter trajectories. Then,
using a result pertaining on the stability of hybrid systems, two stability
conditions are established and shown to naturally generalize and unify the
well-known quadratic and robust stability criteria together. The obtained
conditions being infinite-dimensional, a relaxation approach based on sum of
squares programming is used in order to obtain tractable finite-dimensional
conditions. The approach is finally illustrated on two examples from the
literature.

 <dc:title>Dropout Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks with Alpha-divergences</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To obtain uncertainty estimates with real-world Bayesian deep learning
models, practical inference approximations are needed. Dropout variational
inference (VI) for example has been used for machine vision and medical
applications, but VI can severely underestimates model uncertainty.
Alpha-divergences are alternative divergences to VI's KL objective, which are
able to avoid VI's uncertainty underestimation. But these are hard to use in
practice: existing techniques can only use Gaussian approximating
distributions, and require existing models to be changed radically, thus are of
limited use for practitioners. We propose a re-parametrisation of the
alpha-divergence objectives, deriving a simple inference technique which,
together with dropout, can be easily implemented with existing models by simply
changing the loss of the model. We demonstrate improved uncertainty estimates
and accuracy compared to VI in dropout networks. We study our model's epistemic
uncertainty far away from the data using adversarial images, showing that these
can be distinguished from non-adversarial images by examining our model's
uncertainty.

it's difficult to know which will suit your personal preferences. Expedia wants
to take the proverbial rabbit hole out of hotel search by providing
personalized hotel recommendations to their users. This is no small task for a
site with hundreds of millions of visitors every month! Currently, Expedia uses
search parameters to adjust their hotel recommendations, but there aren't
enough customer specific data to personalize them for each user. In this
project, we have taken up the challenge to contextualize customer data and
predict the likelihood a user will stay at 100 different hotel groups.

 <dc:description>  The maximum entropy method (MEM) is a well known deconvolution technique in
radio-interferometry. This method solves a non-linear optimization problem with
an entropy regularization term. Other heuristics such as CLEAN are faster but
highly user dependent. Nevertheless, MEM has the following advantages: it is
unsupervised, it has a statistical basis, it has a better resolution and better
image quality under certain conditions. This work presents a high performance
GPU version of non-gridding MEM, which is tested using real and simulated data.
We propose a single-GPU and a multi-GPU implementation for single and
multi-spectral data, respectively. We also make use of the Peer-to-Peer and
Unified Virtual Addressing features of newer GPUs which allows to exploit
transparently and efficiently multiple GPUs. Several ALMA data sets are used to
demonstrate the effectiveness in imaging and to evaluate GPU performance. The
results show that a speedup from 1000 to 5000 times faster than a sequential
version can be achieved, depending on data and image size. This allows to
reconstruct the HD142527 CO(6-5) short baseline data set in 2.1 minutes,

 <dc:description>  We present a transformation-grounded image generation network for novel 3D
view synthesis from a single image. Instead of taking a 'blank slate' approach,
we first explicitly infer the parts of the geometry visible both in the input
and novel views and then re-cast the remaining synthesis problem as image
completion. Specifically, we both predict a flow to move the pixels from the
input to the novel view along with a novel visibility map that helps deal with
occulsion/disocculsion. Next, conditioned on those intermediate results, we
hallucinate (infer) parts of the object invisible in the input image. In
addition to the new network structure, training with a combination of
adversarial and perceptual loss results in a reduction in common artifacts of
novel view synthesis such as distortions and holes, while successfully
generating high frequency details and preserving visual aspects of the input
image. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of synthetic and real examples.
Both qualitative and quantitative results show our method achieves
significantly better results compared to existing methods.

 <dc:description>  Code authorship is a key information in large-scale open source systems.
Among others, it allows maintainers to assess division of work and identify key
collaborators. Interestingly, open-source communities lack guidelines on how to
manage authorship. This could be mitigated by setting to build an empirical
body of knowledge on how authorship-related measures evolve in successful
open-source communities. Towards that direction, we perform a case study on the
Linux kernel. Our results show that: (a) only a small portion of developers (26
%) makes significant contributions to the code base; (b) the distribution of
the number of files per author is highly skewed --- a small group of top
authors (3 %) is responsible for hundreds of files, while most authors (75 %)
are responsible for at most 11 files; (c) most authors (62 %) have a specialist
profile; (d) authors with a high number of co-authorship connections tend to
collaborate with others with less connections.

 <dc:description>  Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) offer individuals suffering from major
disabilities an alternative method to interact with their environment.
Sensorimotor rhythm (SMRs) based BCIs can successfully perform control tasks;
however, the traditional SMR paradigms intuitively disconnect the control and
real task, making them non-ideal for complex control scenarios. In this study,
we design a new, intuitively connected motor imagery (MI) paradigm using
hierarchical common spatial patterns (HCSP) and context information to
effectively predict intended hand grasps from electroencephalogram (EEG) data.
Experiments with 5 participants yielded an aggregate classification
accuracy--intended grasp prediction probability--of 64.5\% for 8 different hand
gestures, more than 5 times the chance level.

 <dc:description>  We prove new upper and lower bounds on the VC-dimension of deep neural
networks with the ReLU activation function. These bounds are tight for almost
the entire range of parameters. Letting $W$ be the number of weights and $L$ be
the number of layers, we prove that the VC-dimension is $O(W L \log(W))$, and
provide examples with VC-dimension $\Omega( W L \log(W/L) )$. This improves
both the previously known upper bounds and lower bounds. In terms of the number
$U$ of non-linear units, we prove a tight bound $\Theta(W U)$ on the
VC-dimension. All of these bounds generalize to arbitrary piecewise linear
activation functions, and also hold for the pseudodimensions of these function
classes.
  Combined with previous results, this gives an intriguing range of
dependencies of the VC-dimension on depth for networks with different
non-linearities: there is no dependence for piecewise-constant, linear
dependence for piecewise-linear, and no more than quadratic dependence for
general piecewise-polynomial.

 <dc:description>  HMMs are widely used in action and gesture recognition due to their
implementation simplicity, low computational requirement, scalability and high
parallelism. They have worth performance even with a limited training set. All
these characteristics are hard to find together in other even more accurate
methods. In this paper, we propose a novel double-stage classification
approach, based on Multiple Stream Discrete Hidden Markov Models (MSD-HMM) and
3D skeleton joint data, able to reach high performances maintaining all
advantages listed above. The approach allows both to quickly classify
pre-segmented gestures (offline classification), and to perform temporal
segmentation on streams of gestures (online classification) faster than real
time. We test our system on three public datasets, MSRAction3D, UTKinect-Action
and MSRDailyAction, and on a new dataset, Kinteract Dataset, explicitly created
for Human Computer Interaction (HCI). We obtain state of the art performances
on all of them.

 <dc:title>Simple synchronization protocols for heterogeneous networks: beyond

 <dc:creator>Proskurnikov, Anton V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mazo Jr, Manuel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Synchronization among autonomous agents via local interactions is one of the
benchmark problems in multi-agent control. Whereas synchronization algorithms
for identical agents have been thoroughly studied, synchronization of
heterogeneous networks still remains a challenging problem. The existing
algorithms primarily use the internal model principle, assigning to each agent
a local copy of some dynamical system (internal model). Synchronization of
heterogeneous agents thus reduces to global synchronization of identical
generators and local synchronization between the agents and their internal
models. The internal model approach imposes a number of restrictions and leads
to sophisticated dynamical (and, in general, nonlinear) controllers. At the
same time, passive heterogeneous agents can be synchronized by a very simple
linear protocol, which is used for consensus of first-order integrators. A
natural question arises whether analogous algorithms are applicable to
synchronization of agents that do not satisfy the passivity condition. In this
paper, we study the synchronization problem for heterogeneous agents that are
not passive but satisfy a weaker input feedforward passivity (IFP) condition.
We show that such agents can also be synchronized by a simple linear protocol,
provided that the interaction graph is strongly connected and the couplings are
sufficiently weak. We demonstrate how stability of cooperative adaptive cruise
control algorithms and some microscopic traffic flow models reduce to
synchronization of heterogeneous IFP agents.

 <dc:description>  Noninvasive brain computer interfaces (BCI), and more specifically
Electroencephalography (EEG) based systems for intent detection need to
compensate for the low signal to noise ratio of EEG signals. In many
applications, the temporal dependency information from consecutive decisions
and contextual data can be used to provide a prior probability for the upcoming
decision. In this study we proposed two probabilistic graphical models (PGMs),
using context information and previously observed EEG evidences to estimate a
probability distribution over the decision space in graph based decision-making
mechanism. In this approach, user moves a pointer to the desired vertex in the
graph in which each vertex represents an action. To select a vertex, a Select
command, or a proposed probabilistic Selection criterion (PSC) can be used to
automatically detect the user intended vertex. Performance of different PGMs
and Selection criteria combinations are compared over a keyboard based on a
graph layout. Based on the simulation results, probabilistic Selection
criterion along with the probabilistic graphical model provides the highest
performance boost for individuals with pour calibration performance and
achieving the same performance for individuals with high calibration
performance.

 <dc:description>  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution and non-invasive
3D imaging of the human retina but is inherently impaired by speckle noise.
This paper introduces a spatio-temporal denoising algorithm for OCT data on a
B-scan level using a novel quantile sparse image (QuaSI) prior. To remove
speckle noise while preserving image structures of diagnostic relevance, we
implement our QuaSI prior via median filter regularization coupled with a Huber
data fidelity model in a variational approach. For efficient energy
minimization, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
scheme using a linearization of median filtering. Our spatio-temporal method
can handle both, denoising of single B-scans and temporally consecutive
B-scans, to gain volumetric OCT data with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Our
algorithm based on 4 B-scans only achieved comparable performance to averaging
13 B-scans and outperformed other current denoising methods.

 <dc:description>  People can learn a wide range of tasks from their own experience, but can
also learn from observing other creatures. This can accelerate acquisition of
new skills even when the observed agent differs substantially from the learning
agent in terms of morphology. In this paper, we examine how reinforcement
learning algorithms can transfer knowledge between morphologically different
agents (e.g., different robots). We introduce a problem formulation where two
agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information. Our
method uses the skills that were learned by both agents to train invariant
feature spaces that can then be used to transfer other skills from one agent to
another. The process of learning these invariant feature spaces can be viewed
as a kind of &quot;analogy making&quot;, or implicit learning of partial correspondences
between two distinct domains. We evaluate our transfer learning algorithm in
two simulated robotic manipulation skills, and illustrate that we can transfer
knowledge between simulated robotic arms with different numbers of links, as
well as simulated arms with different actuation mechanisms, where one robot is
torque-driven while the other is tendon-driven.

 <dc:description>  The increasing quality of smartphone cameras and variety of photo editing
applications, in addition to the rise in popularity of image-centric social
media, have all led to a phenomenal growth in mobile-based photography.
Advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques provide a large
number of cloud-based services with the ability to provide content analysis,
face recognition, and object detection facilities to third parties. These
inferences and analytics might come with undesired privacy risks to the
individuals.
  In this paper, we address a fundamental challenge: Can we utilize the local
processing capabilities of modern smartphones efficiently to provide desired
features to approved analytics services, while protecting against undesired
inference attacks and preserving privacy on the cloud? We propose a hybrid
architecture for a distributed deep learning model between the smartphone and
the cloud. We rely on the Siamese network and machine learning approaches for
providing privacy based on defined privacy constraints. We also use transfer
learning techniques to evaluate the proposed method. Using the latest deep
learning models for Face Recognition, Emotion Detection, and Gender
Classification techniques, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in
providing highly accurate classification results for the desired analytics,
while proving strong privacy guarantees.

lightning-fast execution time as it only stores two integers per node and
processes each edge strictly once. The approach is based on the following
simple observation: if we pick an edge uniformly at random in the network, this
edge is more likely to connect two nodes of the same community than two nodes
of distinct communities. We exploit this idea to build communities by local
changes at each edge arrival. Using theoretical arguments, we relate the
ability of SCoDA to detect communities to usual quality metrics of these
communities like the conductance. Experimental results performed on massive
real-life networks ranging from one million to more than one billion edges
shows that SCoDA runs more than ten times faster than existing algorithms and
leads to similar or better detection scores on the largest graphs.

 <dc:description>  Consider a regression problem where there is no labeled data and the only
observations are the predictions $f_i(x_j)$ of $m$ experts $f_{i}$ over many
samples $x_j$. With no knowledge on the accuracy of the experts, is it still
possible to accurately estimate the unknown responses $y_{j}$? Can one still
detect the least or most accurate experts? In this work we propose a framework
to study these questions, based on the assumption that the $m$ experts have
uncorrelated deviations from the optimal predictor. Assuming the first two
moments of the response are known, we develop methods to detect the best and
worst regressors, and derive U-PCR, a novel principal components approach for
unsupervised ensemble regression. We provide theoretical support for U-PCR and
illustrate its improved accuracy over the ensemble mean and median on a variety
of regression problems.

 <dc:description>  Although many machine learning algorithms involve learning subspaces with
particular characteristics, optimizing a parameter matrix that is constrained
to represent a subspace can be challenging. One solution is to use Riemannian
optimization methods that enforce such constraints implicitly, leveraging the
fact that the feasible parameter values form a manifold. While Riemannian
methods exist for some specific problems, such as learning a single subspace,
there are more general subspace constraints that offer additional flexibility
when setting up an optimization problem, but have not been formulated as a
manifold.
  We propose the partitioned subspace (PS) manifold for optimizing matrices
that are constrained to represent one or more subspaces. Each point on the
manifold defines a partitioning of the input space into mutually orthogonal
subspaces, where the number of partitions and their sizes are defined by the
user. As a result, distinct groups of features can be learned by defining
different objective functions for each partition. We illustrate the properties
of the manifold through experiments on multiple dataset analysis and domain
adaptation.

 <dc:description>  We apply two recently formulated mathematical techniques, Slow-Fast
Decomposition (SFD) and Spectral Submanifold (SSM) reduction, to a von Karman
beam with geometric nonlinearities and viscoelastic damping. SFD identifies a
global slow manifold in the full system which attracts solutions at rates
faster than typical rates within the manifold. An SSM, the smoothest nonlinear
continuation of a linear modal subspace, is then used to further reduce the
beam equations within the slow manifold. This two-stage, mathematically exact
procedure results in a drastic reduction of the finite-element beam model to a
one-degree-of freedom nonlinear oscillator. We also introduce the technique of
spectral quotient analysis, which gives the number of modes relevant for
reduction as output rather than input to the reduction process.

 <dc:description>  The Android market is a place where developers offer paid and-or free apps to
users. Free apps are interesting to users because they can try them immediately
without incurring a monetary cost. However, free apps often have limited
features and-or contain ads when compared to their paid counterparts. Thus,
users may eventually need to pay to get additional features and-or remove ads.
While paid apps have clear market values, their ads-supported versions are not
entirely free because ads have an impact on performance.
  In this paper, first, we perform an exploratory study about ads-supported and
paid apps to understand their differences in terms of implementation and
development process. We analyze 40 Android apps and we observe that (i)
ads-supported apps are preferred by users although paid apps have a better
rating, (ii) developers do not usually offer a paid app without a corresponding
free version, (iii) ads-supported apps usually have more releases and are
released more often than their corresponding paid versions, (iv) there is no a
clear strategy about the way developers set prices of paid apps, (v) paid apps
do not usually include more functionalities than their corresponding
ads-supported versions, (vi) developers do not always remove ad networks in
paid versions of their ads-supported apps, and (vii) paid apps require less
permissions than ads-supported apps. Second, we carry out an experimental study
to compare the performance of ads-supported and paid apps and we propose four
equations to estimate the cost of ads-supported apps. We obtain that (i)
ads-supported apps use more resources than their corresponding paid versions
with statistically significant differences and (ii) paid apps could be
considered a most cost-effective choice for users because their cost can be
amortized in a short period of time, depending on their usage.

 <dc:description>  Exploiting the wealth of imaging and non-imaging information for disease
prediction tasks requires models capable of representing, at the same time,
individual features as well as data associations between subjects from
potentially large populations. Graphs provide a natural framework for such
tasks, yet previous graph-based approaches focus on pairwise similarities
without modelling the subjects' individual characteristics and features. On the
other hand, relying solely on subject-specific imaging feature vectors fails to
model the interaction and similarity between subjects, which can reduce
performance. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCN) for brain analysis in populations, combining
imaging and non-imaging data. We represent populations as a sparse graph where
its vertices are associated with image-based feature vectors and the edges
encode phenotypic information. This structure was used to train a GCN model on
partially labelled graphs, aiming to infer the classes of unlabelled nodes from
the node features and pairwise associations between subjects. We demonstrate
the potential of the method on the challenging ADNI and ABIDE databases, as a
proof of concept of the benefit from integrating contextual information in
classification tasks. This has a clear impact on the quality of the
predictions, leading to 69.5% accuracy for ABIDE (outperforming the current
state of the art of 66.8%) and 77% for ADNI for prediction of MCI conversion,
significantly outperforming standard linear classifiers where only individual
features are considered.

 <dc:title>Beamspace Aware Adaptive Channel Estimation for Single-Carrier
  Time-varying Massive MIMO Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guvensen, Gokhan M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ayanoglu, Ender</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of sequential beam construction and adaptive
channel estimation based on reduced rank (RR) Kalman filtering for
frequency-selective massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
employing single-carrier (SC) in time division duplex (TDD) mode are
considered. In two-stage beamforming, a new algorithm for statistical
pre-beamformer design is proposed for spatially correlated time-varying
wideband MIMO channels under the assumption that the channel is a stationary
Gauss-Markov random process. The proposed algorithm yields a nearly optimal
pre-beamformer whose beam pattern is designed sequentially with low complexity
by taking the user-grouping into account, and exploiting the properties of
Kalman filtering and associated prediction error covariance matrices. The
resulting design, based on the second order statistical properties of the
channel, generates beamspace on which the RR Kalman estimator can be realized
as accurately as possible. It is observed that the adaptive channel estimation
technique together with the proposed sequential beamspace construction shows
remarkable robustness to the pilot interference. This comes with significant
reduction in both pilot overhead and dimension of the pre-beamformer lowering
both hardware complexity and power consumption.

 <dc:description>  A conceptual and computational framework is proposed for modelling of human
sensorimotor control, and is exemplified for the sensorimotor task of steering
a car. The framework emphasises control intermittency, and extends on existing
models by suggesting that the nervous system implements intermittent control
using a combination of (1) motor primitives, (2) prediction of sensory outcomes
of motor actions, and (3) evidence accumulation of prediction errors. It is
shown that approximate but useful sensory predictions in the intermittent
control context can be constructed without detailed forward models, as a
superposition of simple prediction primitives, resembling neurobiologically
observed corollary discharges. The proposed mathematical framework allows
straightforward extension to intermittent behaviour from existing
one-dimensional continuous models in the linear control and ecological
psychology traditions. Empirical observations from a driving simulator provide
support for some of the framework assumptions: It is shown that human steering
control, in routine lane-keeping and in a demanding near-limit task, is better
described as a sequence of discrete stepwise steering adjustments, than as
continuous control. Furthermore, the amplitudes of individual steering
adjustments are well predicted by a compound visual cue signalling steering
error, and even better so if also adjusting for predictions of how the same cue
is affected by previous control. Finally, evidence accumulation is shown to
explain observed covariability between inter-adjustment durations and
adjustment amplitudes, seemingly better so than the type of threshold
mechanisms that are typically assumed in existing models of intermittent
control.

 <dc:description>  The emergence and development of cancer is a consequence of the accumulation
over time of genomic mutations involving a specific set of genes, which
provides the cancer clones with a functional selective advantage. In this work,
we model the order of accumulation of such mutations during the progression,
which eventually leads to the disease, by means of probabilistic graphic
models, i.e., Bayesian Networks (BNs). We investigate how to perform the task
of learning the structure of such BNs, according to experimental evidence,
adopting a global optimization meta-heuristics. In particular, in this work we
rely on Genetic Algorithms, and to strongly reduce the execution time of the
inference -- which can also involve multiple repetitions to collect
statistically significant assessments of the data -- we distribute the
calculations using both multi-threading and a multi-node architecture. The
results show that our approach is characterized by good accuracy and
specificity; we also demonstrate its feasibility, thanks to a 84x reduction of
the overall execution time with respect to a traditional sequential
implementation.

 <dc:description>  Gene and protein networks are very important to model complex large-scale
systems in molecular biology. Inferring or reverseengineering such networks can
be defined as the process of identifying gene/protein interactions from
experimental data through computational analysis. However, this task is
typically complicated by the enormously large scale of the unknowns in a rather
small sample size. Furthermore, when the goal is to study causal relationships
within the network, tools capable of overcoming the limitations of correlation
networks are required. In this work, we make use of Bayesian Graphical Models
to attach this problem and, specifically, we perform a comparative study of
different state-of-the-art heuristics, analyzing their performance in inferring
the structure of the Bayesian Network from breast cancer data.

(SBL). In particular, GGAMP is used to implement the E-step in SBL in place of
matrix inversion, leveraging the fact that GGAMP is guaranteed to converge with
appropriate damping. The resulting GGAMP-SBL algorithm is much more robust to
arbitrary measurement matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ than the standard damped GAMP
algorithm while being much lower complexity than the standard SBL algorithm. We
then extend the approach from the single measurement vector (SMV) case to the
temporally correlated multiple measurement vector (MMV) case, leading to the
GGAMP-TSBL algorithm. We verify the robustness and computational advantages of
the proposed algorithms through numerical experiments.

 <dc:title>Quickest Visibility Queries in Polygonal Domains</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Haitao</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $s$ be a point in a polygonal domain $\mathcal{P}$ of $h-1$ holes and $n$
vertices. We consider a quickest visibility query problem. Given a query point
$q$ in $\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to find a shortest path in $\mathcal{P}$ to
move from $s$ to see $q$ as quickly as possible. Previously, Arkin et al. (SoCG
2015) built a data structure of size $O(n^22^{\alpha(n)}\log n)$ that can
answer each query in $O(K\log^2 n)$ time, where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse
Ackermann function and $K$ is the size of the visibility polygon of $q$ in
$\mathcal{P}$ (and $K$ can be $\Theta(n)$ in the worst case). In this paper, we
present a new data structure of size $O(n\log h + h^2)$ that can answer each
query in $O(h\log h\log n)$ time. Our result improves the previous work when
$h$ is relatively small. In particular, if $h$ is a constant, then our result
even matches the best result for the simple polygon case (i.e., $h=1$), which
is optimal. As a by-product, we also have a new algorithm for a
shortest-path-to-segment query problem. Given a query line segment $\tau$ in
$\mathcal{P}$, the query seeks a shortest path from $s$ to all points of
$\tau$. Previously, Arkin et al. gave a data structure of size
$O(n^22^{\alpha(n)}\log n)$ that can answer each query in $O(\log^2 n)$ time,
and another data structure of size $O(n^3\log n)$ with $O(\log n)$ query time.
We present a data structure of size $O(n)$ with query time $O(h\log
\frac{n}{h})$, which also favors small values of $h$ and is optimal when
$h=O(1)$.

 <dc:description>  Despite progress in visual perception tasks such as image classification and
detection, computers still struggle to understand the interdependency of
objects in the scene as a whole, e.g., relations between objects or their
attributes. Existing methods often ignore global context cues capturing the
interactions among different object instances, and can only recognize a handful
of types by exhaustively training individual detectors for all possible
relationships. To capture such global interdependency, we propose a deep
Variation-structured Reinforcement Learning (VRL) framework to sequentially
discover object relationships and attributes in the whole image. First, a
directed semantic action graph is built using language priors to provide a rich
and compact representation of semantic correlations between object categories,
predicates, and attributes. Next, we use a variation-structured traversal over
the action graph to construct a small, adaptive action set for each step based
on the current state and historical actions. In particular, an ambiguity-aware
object mining scheme is used to resolve semantic ambiguity among object
categories that the object detector fails to distinguish. We then make
sequential predictions using a deep RL framework, incorporating global context
cues and semantic embeddings of previously extracted phrases in the state
vector. Our experiments on the Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) dataset and
the large-scale Visual Genome dataset validate the superiority of VRL, which
can achieve significantly better detection results on datasets involving
thousands of relationship and attribute types. We also demonstrate that VRL is
able to predict unseen types embedded in our action graph by learning
correlations on shared graph nodes.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a general framework for learning interpretable data
representation via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks over
hierarchal graph structures. Instead of learning LSTM models over the pre-fixed
structures, we propose to further learn the intermediate interpretable
multi-level graph structures in a progressive and stochastic way from data
during the LSTM network optimization. We thus call this model the
structure-evolving LSTM. In particular, starting with an initial element-level
graph representation where each node is a small data element, the
structure-evolving LSTM gradually evolves the multi-level graph representations
by stochastically merging the graph nodes with high compatibilities along the
stacked LSTM layers. In each LSTM layer, we estimate the compatibility of two
connected nodes from their corresponding LSTM gate outputs, which is used to
generate a merging probability. The candidate graph structures are accordingly
generated where the nodes are grouped into cliques with their merging
probabilities. We then produce the new graph structure with a
Metropolis-Hasting algorithm, which alleviates the risk of getting stuck in
local optimums by stochastic sampling with an acceptance probability. Once a
graph structure is accepted, a higher-level graph is then constructed by taking
the partitioned cliques as its nodes. During the evolving process,
representation becomes more abstracted in higher-levels where redundant
information is filtered out, allowing more efficient propagation of long-range
data dependencies. We evaluate the effectiveness of structure-evolving LSTM in
the application of semantic object parsing and demonstrate its advantage over
state-of-the-art LSTM models on standard benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a scalable and resilient real-time multi-party
communication architecture for the delivery of mixed media streams, for which
content centric networking, with its intelligent network layer, is chosen for
implementation to address the shortcomings of the current IP-based Internet
architecture. Content centric networking (CCN) represents one of the major
proposals targeting future Internet architecture, and is typically optimized
for non-realtime content delivery. Proposed research in this paper addresses
the architectural challenges for large-scale deployment of CCN to serve
real-time applications from the perspective of a multi-party video conferencing
framework, with the necessary architectural components to support application-
and system-level objectives, in regards to quality of experience, resource
utilization, and scalability. We present an in-depth analysis of the proposed
architecture by first providing an analytical driven study for the system, and
then demonstrating its performance by emulating the architecture over a
test-bed with a large number of participants involved in many-to-many
communication sessions. The results suggest that the proposed architecture can
scale well above 50 participants without incurring significant penalty in
signaling, communication, and computing overheads, with capability to support
100 or more participants.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) inference requires significant amount
of memory and computation, which limits its deployment on embedded devices. To
alleviate these problems to some extent, prior research utilize low precision
fixed-point numbers to represent the CNN weights and activations. However, the
minimum required data precision of fixed-point weights varies across different
networks and also across different layers of the same network. In this work, we
propose using floating-point numbers for representing the weights and
fixed-point numbers for representing the activations. We show that using
floating-point representation for weights is more efficient than fixed-point
representation for the same bit-width and demonstrate it on popular large-scale
CNNs such as AlexNet, SqueezeNet, GoogLeNet and VGG-16. We also show that such
a representation scheme enables compact hardware multiply-and-accumulate (MAC)
unit design. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme reduces the
weight storage by up to 36% and power consumption of the hardware multiplier by
up to 50%.

 <dc:description>  One of the critical issues when adopting Bayesian networks (BNs) to model
dependencies among random variables is to &quot;learn&quot; their structure, given the
huge search space of possible solutions, i.e., all the possible direct acyclic
graphs. This is a well-known NP-hard problem, which is also complicated by
known pitfalls such as the issue of I-equivalence among different structures.
In this work we restrict the investigations on BN structure learning to a
specific class of networks, i.e., those representing the dynamics of phenomena
characterized by the monotonic accumulation of events. Such phenomena allow to
set specific structural constraints based on Suppes' theory of probabilistic
causation and, accordingly, to define constrained BNs, named Suppes-Bayes
Causal Networks (SBCNs). We here investigate the structure learning of SBCNs
via extensive simulations with various state-of-the-art search strategies, such
as canonical local search techniques and Genetic Algorithms. Among the main
results we show that Suppes' constraints deeply simplify the learning task, by
reducing the solution search space and providing a temporal ordering on the
variables.

 <dc:description>  The most recent financial upheavals have cast doubt on the adequacy of some
of the conventional quantitative risk management strategies, such as VaR (Value
at Risk), in many common situations. Consequently, there has been an increasing
need for verisimilar financial stress testings, namely simulating and analyzing
financial portfolios in extreme, albeit rare scenarios. Unlike conventional
risk management which exploits statistical correlations among financial
instruments, here we focus our analysis on the notion of probabilistic
causation, which is embodied by Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs), SBCNs are
probabilistic graphical models that have many attractive features in terms of
more accurate causal analysis for generating financial stress scenarios. In
this paper, we present a novel approach for conducting stress testing of
financial portfolios based on SBCNs in combination with classical machine
learning classification tools. The resulting method is shown to be capable of
correctly discovering the causal relationships among financial factors that
affect the portfolios and thus, simulating stress testing scenarios with a
higher accuracy and lower computational complexity than conventional Monte
Carlo Simulations.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for real-world robotic applications
need a data-efficient learning process and the ability to handle complex,
unknown dynamical systems. These requirements are handled well by model-based
and model-free RL approaches, respectively. In this work, we aim to combine the
advantages of these two types of methods in a principled manner. By focusing on
time-varying linear-Gaussian policies, we enable a model-based algorithm based
on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) that can be integrated into the
model-free framework of path integral policy improvement (PI2). We can further
combine our method with guided policy search (GPS) to train arbitrary
parameterized policies such as deep neural networks. Our simulation and
real-world experiments demonstrate that this method can solve challenging
manipulation tasks with comparable or better performance than model-free
methods while maintaining the sample efficiency of model-based methods. A video

their correlations with degree. Our results show that all degree distributions
have a power-law form, especially, the degree distribution of projects in

neighbors' degree and degree for both developers and projects are observed in
both layers, exhibiting a disassortative mixing pattern. The collaborative
similarity of both developers and projects negatively correlates with degree in

 <dc:description>  Extracting useful entities and attribute values from illicit domains such as
human trafficking is a challenging problem with the potential for widespread
social impact. Such domains employ atypical language models, have `long tails'
and suffer from the problem of concept drift. In this paper, we propose a
lightweight, feature-agnostic Information Extraction (IE) paradigm specifically
designed for such domains. Our approach uses raw, unlabeled text from an
initial corpus, and a few (12-120) seed annotations per domain-specific
attribute, to learn robust IE models for unobserved pages and websites.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach can outperform feature-centric
Conditional Random Field baselines by over 18\% F-Measure on five annotated
sets of real-world human trafficking datasets in both low-supervision and
high-supervision settings. We also show that our approach is demonstrably
robust to concept drift, and can be efficiently bootstrapped even in a serial
computing environment.

 <dc:description>  3D scene understanding is important for robots to interact with the 3D world
in a meaningful way. Most previous works on 3D scene understanding focus on
recognizing geometrical or semantic properties of the scene independently. In
this work, we introduce Data Associated Recurrent Neural Networks (DA-RNNs), a
novel framework for joint 3D scene mapping and semantic labeling. DA-RNNs use a
new recurrent neural network architecture for semantic labeling on RGB-D
videos. The output of the network is integrated with mapping techniques such as
KinectFusion in order to inject semantic information into the reconstructed 3D
scene. Experiments conducted on a real world dataset and a synthetic dataset
with RGB-D videos demonstrate the ability of our method in semantic 3D scene
mapping.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, two robust model predictive control (MPC) schemes are proposed
for tracking control of nonholonomic systems with bounded disturbances:
tube-MPC and nominal robust MPC (NRMPC). In tube-MPC, the control signal
consists of a control action and a nonlinear feedback law based on the
deviation of the actual states from the states of a nominal system. It renders
the actual trajectory within a tube centered along the optimal trajectory of
the nominal system. Recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability are
established and the constraints are ensured by tightening the input domain and
the terminal region. While in NRMPC, an optimal control sequence is obtained by
solving an optimization problem based on the current state, and the first
portion of this sequence is applied to the real system in an open-loop manner
during each sampling period. The state of nominal system model is updated by
the actual state at each step, which provides additional a feedback. By
introducing a robust state constraint and tightening the terminal region,
recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability are guaranteed. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of both strategies proposed.

 <dc:description>  Cognitive radio technology enables improving the utilization efficiency of
the precious and scarce radio spectrum. How to maximize the overall spectrum
efficiency while minimizing the conflicts with primary users is vital to
cognitive radio. The key is to make the right decisions of accessing the
spectrum. Spectrum prediction can be employed to predict the future states of a
spectrum band using previous states of the spectrum band, whereas spectrum
recommendation recommends secondary users a subset of available spectrum bands
based on secondary user's previous experiences of accessing the available
spectrum bands. In this paper, a framework for spectrum decision based on
spectrum prediction and spectrum recommendation is proposed. As a benchmark, a
method based on extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-user spectrum
prediction and a method based on Q-learning for multiple-user spectrum
prediction are proposed. At the stage of spectrum decision, two methods based
on Q-learning andMarkov decision process (MDP), respectively, are also proposed
to enhance the overall performance of spectrum decision. Experimental results
show that the performance of the spectrum decision framework is much better.

 <dc:description>  Increasing evidence suggests that a growing amount of social media content is
generated by autonomous entities known as social bots. In this work we present
a framework to detect such entities on Twitter. We leverage more than a
thousand features extracted from public data and meta-data about users:
friends, tweet content and sentiment, network patterns, and activity time
series. We benchmark the classification framework by using a publicly available
dataset of Twitter bots. This training data is enriched by a manually annotated
collection of active Twitter users that include both humans and bots of varying
sophistication. Our models yield high accuracy and agreement with each other
and can detect bots of different nature. Our estimates suggest that between 9%
and 15% of active Twitter accounts are bots. Characterizing ties among
accounts, we observe that simple bots tend to interact with bots that exhibit
more human-like behaviors. Analysis of content flows reveals retweet and
mention strategies adopted by bots to interact with different target groups.
Using clustering analysis, we characterize several subclasses of accounts,
including spammers, self promoters, and accounts that post content from
connected applications.

 <dc:description>  We study complementary information set codes of length $tn$ and dimension $n$
of order $t$ called ($t-$CIS code for short). Quasi-cyclic and quasi-twisted
$t$-CIS codes are enumerated by using their concatenated structure. Asymptotic
existence results are derived for one-generator and have co-index $n$ by
Artin's conjecture for quasi cyclic and special case for quasi twisted. This
shows that there are infinite families of long QC and QT $t$-CIS codes with
relative distance satisfying a modified Varshamov-Gilbert bound for rate $1/t$
codes.
  Similar results are defined for the new and more general class of
quasi-polycyclic codes introduced recently by Berger and Amrani.

 <dc:description>  We study the cost sharing problem for cooperative games in situations where
the cost function $C$ is not available via oracle queries, but must instead be
derived from data, represented as tuples $(S, C(S))$, for different subsets $S$
of players. We formalize this approach, which we call statistical cost sharing,
and consider the computation of the core and the Shapley value, when the tuples
are drawn from some distribution $\mathcal{D}$.
  Previous work by Balcan et al. in this setting showed how to compute cost
shares that satisfy the core property with high probability for limited classes
of functions. We expand on their work and give an algorithm that computes such
cost shares for any function with a non-empty core. We complement these results
by proving an inapproximability lower bound for a weaker relaxation.
  We then turn our attention to the Shapley value. We first show that when cost
functions come from the family of submodular functions with bounded curvature,
$\kappa$, the Shapley value can be approximated from samples up to a $\sqrt{1 -
\kappa}$ factor, and that the bound is tight. We then define statistical
analogues of the Shapley axioms, and derive a notion of statistical Shapley
value. We show that these can always be approximated arbitrarily well for
general functions over any distribution $\mathcal{D}$.

 <dc:description>  Recommender systems have been actively and extensively studied over past
decades. In the meanwhile, the boom of Big Data is driving fundamental changes
in the development of recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
intention-aware recommender system to better facilitate users to find desirable
products and services. Compare to prior work, our proposal possesses the
following advantages: (1) it takes user intentions and demands into account
through intention mining techniques. By unearthing user intentions from the
historical user-item interactions, and various user digital traces harvested
from social media and Internet of Things, it is capable of delivering more
satisfactory recommendations by leveraging rich online and offline user data;
(2) it embraces the benefits of embedding heterogeneous source information and
shared representations of multiple domains to provide accurate and effective
recommendations comprehensively; (3) it recommends products or services
proactively and timely by capturing the dynamic influences, which can
significantly reduce user involvements and efforts.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the first analytical solution for performance
analysis of proportional fair scheduling (PFS) in downlink non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) systems. Assuming an ideal NOMA system with an arbitrary
number of multiplexed users, we derive a closed-form solution of the optimal
power allocation for PFS and design a low-complexity algorithm for joint power
allocation and user set selection. We develop an analytical model to analyze
the throughput performance of this optimal solution based on stochastic channel
modeling. Our analytical performance is proved to be the upper bound for PFS
and is used to estimate user data rates and overall throughput in practical
NOMA systems. We conduct system-level simulations to evaluate the accuracy of
our data rate estimation. The simulation results verify our analysis on the
upper bound of PFS performance in NOMA and confirm that using the analytical
performance for data rate estimation guarantees high accuracy. The impact of
partial and imperfect channel information on the estimation performance is
investigated as well.

Exact enumeration is performed for indices 2 and 3, and for all indices $t$ for

Asymptotic existence results are derived for the special class of such codes
that are one-generator and have co-index a power of two by means of Dickson

 <dc:description>  We describe a parallel, adaptive, multi-block algorithm for explicit
integration of time dependent partial differential equations on two-dimensional
Cartesian grids. The grid layout we consider consists of a nested hierarchy of
fixed size, non-overlapping, logically Cartesian grids stored as leaves in a
quadtree. Dynamic grid refinement and parallel partitioning of the grids is
done through the use of the highly scalable quadtree/octree library p4est.
Because our concept is multi-block, we are able to easily solve on a variety of
geometries including the cubed sphere. In this paper, we pay special attention
to providing details of the parallel ghost-filling algorithm needed to ensure
that both corner and edge ghost regions around each grid hold valid values.
  We have implemented this algorithm in the ForestClaw code using single-grid
solvers from ClawPack, a software package for solving hyperbolic PDEs using
finite volumes methods. We show weak and strong scalability results for scalar
advection problems on two-dimensional manifold domains on 1 to 64Ki MPI
processes, demonstrating neglible regridding overhead.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of imitation learning from demonstrations of multiple
coordinating agents. One key challenge in this setting is that learning a good
model of coordination can be difficult, since coordination is often implicit in
the demonstrations and must be inferred as a latent variable. We propose a
joint approach that simultaneously learns a latent coordination model along
with the individual policies. In particular, our method integrates unsupervised
structure learning with conventional imitation learning. We illustrate the
power of our approach on a difficult problem of learning multiple policies for
fine-grained behavior modeling in team sports, where different players occupy
different roles in the coordinated team strategy. We show that having a
coordination model to infer the roles of players yields substantially improved
imitation loss compared to conventional baselines.

 <dc:description>  The impacts of climate change are felt by most critical systems, such as
infrastructure, ecological systems, and power-plants. However, contemporary
Earth System Models (ESM) are run at spatial resolutions too coarse for
assessing effects this localized. Local scale projections can be obtained using
statistical downscaling, a technique which uses historical climate observations
to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping. Depending on statistical
modeling choices, downscaled projections have been shown to vary significantly
terms of accuracy and reliability. The spatio-temporal nature of the climate
system motivates the adaptation of super-resolution image processing techniques
to statistical downscaling. In our work, we present DeepSD, a generalized
stacked super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) framework for
statistical downscaling of climate variables. DeepSD augments SRCNN with
multi-scale input channels to maximize predictability in statistical
downscaling. We provide a comparison with Bias Correction Spatial
Disaggregation as well as three Automated-Statistical Downscaling approaches in
downscaling daily precipitation from 1 degree (~100km) to 1/8 degrees (~12.5km)
over the Continental United States. Furthermore, a framework using the NASA
Earth Exchange (NEX) platform is discussed for downscaling more than 20 ESM
models with multiple emission scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Despite recent advances, memory-augmented deep neural networks are still
limited when it comes to life-long and one-shot learning, especially in
remembering rare events. We present a large-scale life-long memory module for
use in deep learning. The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for
efficiency and thus scales to large memory sizes. Except for the
nearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable and trained
end-to-end with no extra supervision. It operates in a life-long manner, i.e.,
without the need to reset it during training.
  Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural
network. To show its versatility we add it to a number of networks, from simple
convolutional ones tested on image classification to deep sequence-to-sequence
and recurrent-convolutional models. In all cases, the enhanced network gains
the ability to remember and do life-long one-shot learning. Our module
remembers training examples shown many thousands of steps in the past and it
can successfully generalize from them. We set new state-of-the-art for one-shot
learning on the Omniglot dataset and demonstrate, for the first time, life-long
one-shot learning in recurrent neural networks on a large-scale machine
translation task.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new model for extracting an interpretable sentence
embedding by introducing self-attention. Instead of using a vector, we use a
2-D matrix to represent the embedding, with each row of the matrix attending on
a different part of the sentence. We also propose a self-attention mechanism
and a special regularization term for the model. As a side effect, the
embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the
sentence are encoded into the embedding. We evaluate our model on 3 different
tasks: author profiling, sentiment classification, and textual entailment.
Results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to
other sentence embedding methods in all of the 3 tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we deal with the performance analysis of full-duplex relaying
in decode-&amp;-forward cooperative networks with multiple-antenna terminals. More
specifically, by analyzing the end-to-end statistics, we derive the accurate
closed-form expressions of the end-to-end outage probability for both transmit
and receive ZFBF scheme over Rayleigh fading environments. Some selected
results show some interesting observations useful for system designers.
Specifically, we observe that the outage performance can be improved by
adopting the joint ZF-based precoding with different antenna configurations.

 <dc:title>Orthogonal Transform Multiplexing with Memoryless Nonlinearity: a
  Possible Alternative to Traditional Coded-Modulation Schemes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhidkov, Sergey V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel joint coding-modulation technique based on
serial concatenation of orthogonal linear transform, such as discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) or Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT), with memoryless
nonlinearity. We demonstrate that such a simple signal construction may exhibit
properties of a random code ensemble, as a result approaching channel capacity.
Our computer simulations confirm that if the decoder relies on a modified
approximate message passing algorithm, the proposed modulation technique
exhibits performance on par with state-of-the-art coded modulation schemes that
use capacity-approaching component codes. The proposed modulation scheme could
be used directly or as a pre-coder for a conventional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) transmitter, resulting in a system possessing all
benefits of OFDM along with reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

 <dc:description>  Autonomous Science is a field of study which aims to extend the autonomy of
exploration robots from low level functionality, such as on-board perception
and obstacle avoidance, to science autonomy, which allows scientists to specify
missions at task level. This will enable more remote and extreme environments
such as deep ocean and other planets to be studied, leading to significant
science discoveries. This paper presents an approach to extend the high level
autonomy of robots by enabling them to model and reason about scientific
knowledge on-board. We achieve this by using Bayesian networks to encode
scientific knowledge and adapting Monte Carlo Tree Search techniques to reason
about the network and plan informative sensing actions. The resulting knowledge
representation and reasoning framework is anytime, handles large state spaces
and robust to uncertainty making it highly applicable to field robotics. We
apply the approach to a Mars exploration mission in which the robot is required
to plan paths and decide when to use its sensing modalities to study a
scientific latent variable of interest. Extensive simulation results show that
our approach has significant performance benefits over alternative methods. We
also demonstrate the practicality of our approach in an analog Martian
environment where our experimental rover, Continuum, plans and executes a
science mission autonomously.

 <dc:description>  We define and study the Functional Aggregate Query (FAQ) problem, which
captures common computational tasks across a very wide range of domains
including relational databases, logic, matrix and tensor computation,
probabilistic graphical models, constraint satisfaction, and signal processing.
Simply put, an FAQ is a declarative way of defining a new function from a
database of input functions.
  We present &quot;InsideOut&quot;, a dynamic programming algorithm, to evaluate an FAQ.
The algorithm rewrites the input query into a set of easier-to-compute FAQ
sub-queries. Each sub-query is then evaluated using a worst-case optimal
relational join algorithm. The topic of designing algorithms to optimally
evaluate the classic multiway join problem has seen exciting developments in
the past few years. Our framework tightly connects these new ideas in database
theory with a vast number of application areas in a coherent manner, showing
potentially that a good database engine can be a general-purpose constraint
solver, relational data store, graphical model inference engine, and
matrix/tensor computation processor all at once.
  The InsideOut algorithm is very simple, as shall be described in this paper.
Yet, in spite of solving an extremely general problem, its runtime either is as
good as or improves upon the best known algorithm for the applications that FAQ
specializes to. These corollaries include computational tasks in graphical
model inference, matrix/tensor operations, relational joins, and logic. Better
yet, InsideOut can be used within any database engine, because it is basically
a principled way of rewriting queries. Indeed, it is already part of the
LogicBlox database engine, helping efficiently answer traditional database
queries, graphical model inference queries, and train a large class of machine
learning models inside the database itself.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper explores the problem of sockpuppet detection in deceptive opinion
spam using authorship attribution and verification approaches. Two methods are
explored. The first is a feature subsampling scheme that uses the KL-Divergence
on stylistic language models of an author to find discriminative features. The
second is a transduction scheme, spy induction that leverages the diversity of
authors in the unlabeled test set by sending a set of spies (positive samples)
from the training set to retrieve hidden samples in the unlabeled test set
using nearest and farthest neighbors. Experiments using ground truth sockpuppet
data show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

 <dc:description>  Based on the distinguishing features of multi-tier millimeter wave (mmWave)
networks such as different transmit powers, different directivity gains from
directional beamforming alignment and path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS)
and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links, we introduce a normalization model to
simplify the analysis of multi-tier mmWave cellular networks. The highlight of
the model is that we convert a multi-tier mmWave cellular network into a
single-tier mmWave network, where all the base stations (BSs) have the same
normalized transmit power 1 and the densities of BSs scaled by LOS or NLOS
scaling factors respectively follow piecewise constant function which has
multiple demarcation points. On this basis, expressions for computing the
coverage probability are obtained in general case with beamforming alignment
errors and the special case with perfect beamforming alignment in the
communication. According to corresponding numerical exploration, we conclude
that the normalization model for multi-tier mmWave cellular networks fully
meets requirements of network performance analysis, and it is simpler and
clearer than the untransformed model. Besides, an unexpected but sensible
finding is that there is an optimal beam width that maximizes coverage
probability in the case with beamforming alignment errors.

 <dc:description>  Remarkable mathematical properties of the integrable nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger
equation (NLSE) can offer advanced solutions for the mitigation of nonlinear
signal distortions in optical fibre links. Fundamental optical soliton,
continuous and discrete eigenvalues of the nonlinear spectrum have already been
considered for transmission of information in fibre-optic channels. Here we
propose to apply signal modulation to the kernel of the
Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equations (GLME) that offers the advantage of a
relatively simple decoder design. First, we describe an approach based on
exploiting the general N-soliton solution of the NLSE for simultaneous coding
of $N$ symbols involving $4\times N$ coding parameters. As a specific elegant
sub-class of the general schemes we introduce a soliton orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (SOFDM) method. This method is based on the choice of
identical imaginary parts of the N-soliton solution eigenvalues, corresponding
to equidistant soliton frequencies making it similar to the conventional OFDM
scheme, thus, allowing use of the efficient fast Fourier transform algorithm to
recover the data. Then, we demonstrate how to use this new approach to control
signal parameters in the case of the continuous spectrum.

 <dc:description>  A person's weight status can have profound implications on their life,
ranging from mental health, to longevity, to financial income. At the societal
level, &quot;fat shaming&quot; and other forms of &quot;sizeism&quot; are a growing concern, while
increasing obesity rates are linked to ever raising healthcare costs. For these
reasons, researchers from a variety of backgrounds are interested in studying
obesity from all angles. To obtain data, traditionally, a person would have to
accurately self-report their body-mass index (BMI) or would have to see a
doctor to have it measured. In this paper, we show how computer vision can be
used to infer a person's BMI from social media images. We hope that our tool,
which we release, helps to advance the study of social aspects related to body
weight.

 <dc:description>  This study proposes behavior-based navigation architecture, named BBFM, to
deal with the problem of navigating the mobile robot in unknown environments in
the presence of obstacles and local minimum regions. In the architecture, the
complex navigation task is split into principal sub-tasks or behaviors. Each
behavior is implemented by a fuzzy controller and executed independently to
deal with a specific problem of navigation. The fuzzy controller is modified to
contain only the fuzzification and inference procedures so that its output is a
membership function representing the behavior's objective. The membership
functions of all controllers are then used as the objective functions for a
multi-objective optimization process to coordinate all behaviors. The result of
this process is an overall control signal, which is Pareto-optimal, used to
control the robot. A number of simulations, comparisons, and experiments were
conducted. The results show that the proposed architecture outperforms some
popular behavior-based architectures in term of accuracy, smoothness, traveled
distance, and time response.

 <dc:description>  According to the DeGroot-Friedkin model of a social network, an individual's
social power evolves as the network discusses individual opinions over a
sequence of issues. Under mild assumptions on the connectivity of the network,
the social power of every individual converges to a constant strictly positive
value as the number of issues discussed increases. If the network has a special
topology, termed &quot;star topology&quot;, then all social power accumulates with the
individual at the centre of the star. This paper studies the strategic
introduction of new individuals and/or interpersonal relationships into a
social network with star topology to reduce the social power of the centre
individual. In fact, several strategies are proposed. For each strategy, we
derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the strength of the new
interpersonal relationships, based on local information, which ensures that the
centre individual no longer has the greatest social power within the social
network. Interpretations of these conditions show that the strategies are
remarkably intuitive and that certain strategies are favourable compared to
others, all of which is sociologically expected.

 <dc:title>A Generalized Zero-Forcing Precoder with Successive Dirty-Paper Coding
  in MISO Broadcast Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hu, Sha</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rusek, Fredrik</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider precoder designs for multiuser
multiple-input-single-output (MISO) broadcasting channels. Instead of using a
traditional linear zero-forcing (ZF) precoder, we propose a generalized ZF
(GZF) precoder in conjunction with successive dirty-paper coding (DPC) for
data-transmissions, namely, the GZF-DP precoder, where the suffix \lq{}DP\rq{}
stands for \lq{}dirty-paper\rq{}. The GZF-DP precoder is designed to generate a
band-shaped and lower-triangular effective channel $\vec{F}$ such that only the
entries along the main diagonal and the $\nu$ first lower-diagonals can take
non-zero values. Utilizing the successive DPC, the known non-causal inter-user
interferences from the other (up to) $\nu$ users are canceled through
successive encoding. We analyze optimal GZF-DP precoder designs both for
sum-rate and minimum user-rate maximizations. Utilizing Lagrange multipliers,
the optimal precoders for both cases are solved in closed-forms in relation to
optimal power allocations. For the sum-rate maximization, the optimal power
allocation can be found through water-filling, but with modified water-levels
depending on the parameter $\nu$. While for the minimum user-rate maximization
that measures the quality of the service (QoS), the optimal power allocation is
directly solved in closed-form which also depends on $\nu$. Moreover, we
propose two low-complexity user-ordering algorithms for the GZF-DP precoder
designs for both maximizations, respectively. We show through numerical results
that, the proposed GZF-DP precoder with a small $\nu$ ($\leq\!3$) renders
significant rate increments compared to the previous precoder designs such as
the linear ZF and user-grouping based DPC (UG-DP) precoders.

minimum distance is computed for infinite families of such codes, as well as
the automorphism group. As a result, some linear codes with better relative
parameters with respect to one-point Hermitian codes are discovered. Classes of
quantum and convolutional codes are provided relying on the constructed AG

 <dc:title>Achievable Rate Region of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems with

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a candidate multiple access scheme
in 5G systems for the simultaneous access of tremendous number of wireless
nodes. On the other hand, RF-enabled wireless energy harvesting is a promising
technology for self-sustainable wireless nodes. In this paper, we consider a
NOMA system where the near user harvests energy from the strong radio signal to
power-on the information decoder. A generalized energy harvesting scheme is
proposed by combining the conventional time switching and power splitting
scheme. The achievable rate region of the proposed scheme is characterized
under both constant and dynamic decoding power consumption models. If the
decoding power is constant, the achievable rate region can be found by solving
two convex optimization subproblems, and the regions for two special cases:
time switching and power splitting, are characterized in closed-form. If the
decoding power is proportional to data rate, the achievable rate region can be
found by exhaustive search algorithm. Numerical results show that the
achievable rate region of the proposed generalized scheme is larger than those
of time switching scheme and power splitting scheme, and rate-dependent decoder
design helps to enlarge the achievable rate region.

 <dc:description>  We investigate a special case of hereditary property that we refer to as {\em
robustness}. A property is {\em robust} in a given graph if it is inherited by
all connected spanning subgraphs of this graph. We motivate this definition in
different contexts, showing that it plays a central role in highly dynamic
networks, although the problem is defined in terms of classical (static) graph
theory. In this paper, we focus on the robustness of {\em maximal independent
sets} (MIS). Following the above definition, a MIS is said to be {\em robust}
(RMIS) if it remains a valid MIS in all connected spanning subgraphs of the
original graph. We characterize the class of graphs in which {\em all} possible
MISs are robust. We show that, in these particular graphs, the problem of
finding a robust MIS is {\em local}; that is, we present an RMIS algorithm
using only a sublogarithmic number of rounds (in the number of nodes $n$) in
the ${\cal LOCAL}$ model. On the negative side, we show that, in general
graphs, the problem is not local. Precisely, we prove a $\Omega(n)$ lower bound
on the number of rounds required for the nodes to decide consistently in some
graphs. This result implies a separation between the RMIS problem and the MIS
problem in general graphs. It also implies that any strategy in this case is
asymptotically (in order) as bad as collecting all the network information at
one node and solving the problem in a centralized manner. Motivated by this
observation, we present a centralized algorithm that computes a robust MIS in a
given graph, if one exists, and rejects otherwise. Significantly, this
algorithm requires only a polynomial amount of local computation time, despite
the fact that exponentially many MISs and exponentially many connected spanning
subgraphs may exist.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new linear algebraic approach to the computation of Tarskian
semantics in logic. We embed a finite model M in first-order logic with N
entities in N-dimensional Euclidean space R^N by mapping entities of M to N
dimensional one-hot vectors and k-ary relations to order-k adjacency tensors
(multi-way arrays). Second given a logical formula F in prenex normal form, we
compile F into a set Sigma_F of algebraic formulas in multi-linear algebra with
a nonlinear operation. In this compilation, existential quantifiers are
compiled into a specific type of tensors, e.g., identity matrices in the case
of quantifying two occurrences of a variable. It is shown that a systematic
evaluation of Sigma_F in R^N gives the truth value, 1(true) or 0(false), of F
in M. Based on this framework, we also propose an unprecedented way of
computing the least models defined by Datalog programs in linear spaces via
matrix equations and empirically show its effectiveness compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into a set of
meaningful regions according to some criteria. Hierarchical segmentation has
emerged as a major trend in this regard as it favors the emergence of important
regions at different scales. On the other hand, many methods allow us to have
prior information on the position of structures of interest in the images. In
this paper, we present a versatile hierarchical segmentation method that takes
into account any prior spatial information and outputs a hierarchical
segmentation that emphasizes the contours or regions of interest while
preserving the important structures in the image. Several applications are
presented that illustrate the method versatility and efficiency.

 <dc:description>  In the orthognathic surgery, dental splints are important and necessary to
help the surgeon reposition the maxilla or mandible. However, the traditional
methods of manual design of dental splints are difficult and time-consuming.
The research on computer-aided design software for dental splints is rarely
reported. Our purpose is to develop a novel special software named EasySplint
to design the dental splints conveniently and efficiently. The design can be
divided into two steps, which are the generation of initial splint base and the
Boolean operation between it and the maxilla-mandibular model. The initial
splint base is formed by ruled surfaces reconstructed using the manually picked
points. Then, a method to accomplish Boolean operation based on the distance
filed of two meshes is proposed. The interference elimination can be conducted
on the basis of marching cubes algorithm and Boolean operation. The accuracy of
the dental splint can be guaranteed since the original mesh is utilized to form
the result surface. Using EasySplint, the dental splints can be designed in
about 10 minutes and saved as a stereo lithography (STL) file for 3D printing
in clinical applications. Three phantom experiments were conducted and the
efficiency of our method was demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  Sparsity is one of the major problems in natural language processing. The
problem becomes even more severe in agglutinating languages that are highly
prone to be inflected. We deal with sparsity in Turkish by adopting
morphological features for part-of-speech tagging. We learn inflectional and
derivational morpheme tags in Turkish by using conditional random fields (CRF)
and we employ the morpheme tags in part-of-speech (PoS) tagging by using hidden
Markov models (HMMs) to mitigate sparsity. Results show that using morpheme
tags in PoS tagging helps alleviate the sparsity in emission probabilities. Our
model outperforms other hidden Markov model based PoS tagging models for small
training datasets in Turkish. We obtain an accuracy of 94.1% in morpheme
tagging and 89.2% in PoS tagging on a 5K training dataset.

 <dc:description>  Query evaluation over probabilistic databases is known to be intractable in
many cases, even in data complexity, i.e., when the query is fixed. Although
some restrictions of the queries [19] and instances [4] have been proposed to
lower the complexity, these known tractable cases usually do not apply to
combined complexity, i.e., when the query is not fixed. This leaves open the
question of which query and instance languages ensure the tractability of
probabilistic query evaluation in combined complexity.
  This paper proposes the first general study of the combined complexity of
conjunctive query evaluation on probabilistic instances over binary signatures,
which we can alternatively phrase as a probabilistic version of the graph
homomorphism problem, or of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) variant. We
study the complexity of this problem depending on whether instances and queries
can use features such as edge labels, disconnectedness, branching, and edges in
both directions. We show that the complexity landscape is surprisingly rich,
using a variety of technical tools: automata-based compilation to d-DNNF
lineages as in [4], \b{eta}-acyclic lineages using [10], the X-property for
tractable CSP from [24], graded DAGs [27] and various coding techniques for
hardness proofs.

 <dc:description>  In this publication, the interactive planning and reconstruction of cranial
3D Implants under the medical prototyping platform MeVisLab as alternative to
commercial planning software is introduced. In doing so, a MeVisLab prototype
consisting of a customized data-flow network and an own C++ module was set up.
As a result, the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software prototype guides a user
through the whole workflow to generate an implant. Therefore, the workflow
begins with loading and mirroring the patients head for an initial curvature of
the implant. Then, the user can perform an additional Laplacian smoothing,
followed by a Delaunay triangulation. The result is an aesthetic looking and
well-fitting 3D implant, which can be stored in a CAD file format, e.g.
STereoLithography (STL), for 3D printing. The 3D printed implant can finally be
used for an in-depth pre-surgical evaluation or even as a real implant for the
patient. In a nutshell, our research and development shows that a customized
MeVisLab software prototype can be used as an alternative to complex commercial
planning software, which may also not be available in every clinic. Finally,
not to conform ourselves directly to available commercial software and look for
other options that might improve the workflow.

 <dc:description>  The goal of compressed sensing is to estimate a vector from an
underdetermined system of noisy linear measurements, by making use of prior
knowledge on the structure of vectors in the relevant domain. For almost all
results in this literature, the structure is represented by sparsity in a
well-chosen basis. We show how to achieve guarantees similar to standard
compressed sensing but without employing sparsity at all. Instead, we suppose
that vectors lie near the range of a generative model $G: \mathbb{R}^k \to
\mathbb{R}^n$. Our main theorem is that, if $G$ is $L$-Lipschitz, then roughly
$O(k \log L)$ random Gaussian measurements suffice for an $\ell_2/\ell_2$
recovery guarantee. We demonstrate our results using generative models from
published variational autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. Our
method can use $5$-$10$x fewer measurements than Lasso for the same accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Internet or things (IoT) is changing our daily life rapidly. Although new
technologies are emerging everyday and expanding their influence in this
rapidly growing area, many classic theories can still find their places. In
this paper, we study the important applications of the classic network coding
theory in two important components of Internet of things, including the IoT
core network, where data is sensed and transmitted, and the distributed cloud
storage, where the data generated by the IoT core network is stored. First we
propose an adaptive network coding (ANC) scheme in the IoT core network to
improve the transmission efficiency. We demonstrate the efficacy of the scheme
and the performance advantage over existing schemes through simulations. %Next
we study the application of network coding in the distributed cloud storage.
Next we introduce the optimal storage allocation problem in the network coding
based distributed cloud storage, which aims at searching for the most reliable
allocation that distributes the $n$ data components into $N$ data centers,
given the failure probability $p$ of each data center. Then we propose a
polynomial-time optimal storage allocation (OSA) scheme to solve the problem.
Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that the storage
reliability could be greatly improved by the OSA scheme.

 <dc:description>  Streaming video is becoming the predominant type of traffic over the Internet
with reports forecasting the video content to account for 80% of all traffic by
2019. With significant investment on Internet backbone, the main bottleneck
remains at the edge servers (e.g., WiFi access points, small cells, etc.). In
this work, we propose and prove the optimality of a multiuser resource
allocation mechanism operating at the edge server that minimizes the
probability of stalling of video streams due to buffer under-flows. Our
proposed policy utilizes Media Presentation Description (MPD) files of clients
that are sent in compliant to Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)
protocol to be cognizant of the deadlines of each of the media file to be
displayed by the clients. Then, the policy schedules the users in the order of
their deadlines. After establishing the optimality of this policy to minimize
the stalling probability for a network with links associated with fixed loss
rates, the utility of the algorithm is verified under realistic network
conditions with detailed NS-3 simulations.

 <dc:description>  Since Lawrence in 2001 proposed the open access (OA) citation advantage, the
potential benefit of OA in relation to the citation impact has been discussed
in depth. The methodology to test this postulate ranges from comparing the
impact factors of OA journals versus traditional ones, to comparing citations
of OA versus non-OA articles published in the same non-OA journals. However,
conclusions are not entirely consistent among fields, and two possible
explications have been suggested in those fields where a citation advantage has
been observed for OA: the early view and the selection bias postulates. In this
study, a longitudinal and multidisciplinary analysis of the gold OA citation
advantage is developed. All research articles in all journals for all subject
categories in the multidisciplinary database Web of Science are considered. A
total of 1,137,634 articles - 86,712 OA articles (7.6%) and 1,050,922 non-OA
articles (92.4%)- published in 2009 are analysed. The citation window
considered goes from 2009 to 2014, and data are aggregated for the 249
disciplines (subject categories). At journal level, we also study the evolution
of journal impact factors for OA and non-OA journals in those disciplines whose
OA prevalence is higher (top 36 subject categories). As the main conclusion,
there is no generalizable gold OA citation advantage, neither at article nor at
journal level.

 <dc:title>Maximum Likelihood Decoder for Index Coded PSK Modulation for Priority

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Index coded PSK modulation over an AWGN broadcast channel, for a given index
coding problem (ICP) is studied. For a chosen index code and an arbitrary
mapping (of broadcast vectors to PSK signal points), we have derived a decision
rule for the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. The message error performance of
a receiver at high SNR is characterized by a parameter called PSK Index Coding
Gain (PSK-ICG). The PSK-ICG of a receiver is determined by a metric called
minimum inter-set distance. For a given ICP with an order of priority among the
receivers, and a chosen $2^N$-PSK constellation we propose an algorithm to find
(index code, mapping) pairs, each of which gives the best performance in terms
of PSK-ICG of the receivers. No other pair of index code (of length $N$ with
$2^N$ broadcast vectors) and mapping can give a better PSK-ICG for the highest
priority receiver. Also, given that the highest priority receiver achieves its
best performance, the next highest priority receiver achieves its maximum gain
possible and so on in the specified order or priority.

 <dc:description>  In the era of big data and Internet of things, massive sensor data are
gathered with Internet of things. Quantity of data captured by sensor networks
are considered to contain highly useful and valuable information. However, for
a variety of reasons, received sensor data often appear abnormal. Therefore,
effective anomaly detection methods are required to guarantee the quality of
data collected by those sensor nodes. Since sensor data are usually correlated
in time and space, not all the gathered data are valuable for further data
processing and analysis. Preprocessing is necessary for eliminating the
redundancy in gathered massive sensor data. In this paper, the proposed work
defines a sensor data preprocessing framework. It is mainly composed of two
parts, i.e., sensor data anomaly detection and sensor data redundancy
elimination. In the first part, methods based on principal statistic analysis
and Bayesian network is proposed for sensor data anomaly detection. Then,
approaches based on static Bayesian network (SBN) and dynamic Bayesian networks
(DBNs) are proposed for sensor data redundancy elimination. Static sensor data
redundancy detection algorithm (SSDRDA) for eliminating redundant data in
static datasets and real-time sensor data redundancy detection algorithm
(RSDRDA) for eliminating redundant sensor data in real-time are proposed. The
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods are validated using
real-world gathered sensor datasets.

 <dc:description>  Caricatures are facial drawings by artists with exaggeration on certain
facial parts. The exaggerations are often beyond realism and yet the
caricatures are still recognizable by humans. With the advent of deep learning,
recognition performances by computers on real-world faces has become comparable
to human performance even under unconstrained situations. However, there is
still a gap in caricature recognition performance between computer and human.
This is mainly due to the lack of publicly available caricature datasets of
large scale. To facilitate the research in caricature recognition, a new
caricature dataset is built. All the caricature images and face images were
collected from the web.Compared with two existing datasets, this dataset is of
larger size and has various artistic styles. We also offer evaluation protocols
and present baseline performances on the dataset. Specifically, four evaluation
protocols are provided: restricted and unrestricted caricature verifications,
caricature to photo and photo to caricature face identifications. Based on the
evaluation protocols, three face alignment methods together with five kinds of
features and nine subspace and metric learning algorithms have been applied to
provide the baseline performances on this dataset. Main conclusion is that
there is still a space for improvement in caricature face recognition.

 <dc:description>  We present a formal measure of argument strength, which combines the ideas
that conclusions of strong arguments are (i) highly probable and (ii) their
uncertainty is relatively precise. Likewise, arguments are weak when their
conclusion probability is low or when it is highly imprecise. We show how the
proposed measure provides a new model of the Ellsberg paradox. Moreover, we
further substantiate the psychological plausibility of our approach by an
experiment (N = 60). The data show that the proposed measure predicts human
inferences in the original Ellsberg task and in corresponding argument strength
tasks. Finally, we report qualitative data taken from structured interviews on
folk psychological conceptions on what argument strength means.

 <dc:description>  We study abductive, causal, and non-causal conditionals in indicative and
counterfactual formulations using probabilistic truth table tasks under
incomplete probabilistic knowledge (N = 80). We frame the task as a
probability-logical inference problem. The most frequently observed response
type across all conditions was a class of conditional event interpretations of
conditionals; it was followed by conjunction interpretations. An interesting
minority of participants neglected some of the relevant imprecision involved in
the premises when inferring lower or upper probability bounds on the target
conditional/counterfactual (&quot;halfway responses&quot;). We discuss the results in the
light of coherence-based probability logic and the new paradigm psychology of
reasoning.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study selected argument forms involving counterfactuals and
indicative conditionals under uncertainty. We selected argument forms to
explore whether people with an Eastern cultural background reason differently
about conditionals compared to Westerners, because of the differences in the
location of negations. In a 2x2 between-participants design, 63 Japanese
university students were allocated to four groups, crossing indicative
conditionals and counterfactuals, and each presented in two random task orders.
The data show close agreement between the responses of Easterners and
Westerners. The modal responses provide strong support for the hypothesis that
conditional probability is the best predictor for counterfactuals and
indicative conditionals. Finally, the grand majority of the responses are
probabilistically coherent, which endorses the psychological plausibility of
choosing coherence-based probability logic as a rationality framework for
psychological reasoning research.

 <dc:description>  Communicating transactions is a form of distributed, non-isolated
transactions which provides a simple construct for building concurrent systems.
In this paper we develop a logical framework to express properties of the
observable behaviour of such systems. This comprises three nominal modal logics
which share standard communication modalities but have distinct past and future
modalities involving transactional commits. All three logics have the same
distinguishing power over systems because their associated weak bisimulations
coincide with contextual equivalence. Furthermore, they are equally expressive
because there are semantics-preserving translations between their formulae.
Using the logics we can clearly exhibit subtle example inequivalences. This
work presents the first property logics for non-isolated transactions.

 <dc:description>  The most popular stability notion in games should be Nash equilibrium under
the rationality of players who maximize their own payoff individually. In
contrast, in many scenarios, players can be (partly) irrational with some
unpredictable factors. Hence a strategy profile can be more robust if it is
resilient against certain irrational behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
stability notion that is resilient against envy. A strategy profile is said to
be envy-proof if each player cannot gain a competitive edge with respect to the
change in utility over the other players by deviation. Together with Nash
equilibrium and another stability notion called immunity, we show how these
separate notions are related to each other, whether they exist in games, and
whether and when a strategy profile satisfying these notions can be efficiently
found. We answer these questions by starting with the general two player game
and extend the discussion for the approximate stability and for the
corresponding fault-tolerance notions in multi-player games.

 <dc:title>Impact of URI Canonicalization on Memento Count</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Quantifying the captures of a URI over time is useful for researchers to
identify the extent to which a Web page has been archived. Memento TimeMaps
provide a format to list mementos (URI-Ms) for captures along with brief
metadata, like Memento-Datetime, for each URI-M. However, when some URI-Ms are
dereferenced, they simply provide a redirect to a different URI-M (instead of a
unique representation at the datetime), often also present in the TimeMap. This
infers that confidently obtaining an accurate count quantifying the number of
non-forwarding captures for a URI-R is not possible using a TimeMap alone and
that the magnitude of a TimeMap is not equivalent to the number of
representations it identifies. In this work we discuss this particular
phenomena in depth. We also perform a breakdown of the dynamics of counting
mementos for a particular URI-R (google.com) and quantify the prevalence of the
various canonicalization patterns that exacerbate attempts at counting using
only a TimeMap. For google.com we found that 84.9% of the URI-Ms result in an
HTTP redirect when dereferenced. We expand on and apply this metric to TimeMaps
for seven other URI-Rs of large Web sites and thirteen academic institutions.
Using a ratio metric DI for the number of URI-Ms without redirects to those
requiring a redirect when dereferenced, five of the eight large web sites' and
two of the thirteen academic institutions' TimeMaps had a ratio of ratio less
than one, indicating that more than half of the URI-Ms in these TimeMaps result
in redirects when dereferenced.

 <dc:description>  There exist two issues among popular lattice reduction (LR) algorithms that
should cause our concern. The first one is Korkine-Zolotarev (KZ) and
Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) algorithms may increase the lengths of basis
vectors. The other is KZ reduction suffers much worse performance than
Minkowski reduction in terms of providing short basis vectors, despite its
superior theoretical upper bounds. To address these limitations, we improve the
size reduction steps in KZ and LLL to set up two new efficient algorithms,
referred to as boosted KZ and LLL, for solving the shortest basis problem (SBP)
with exponential and polynomial complexity, respectively. Both of them offer
better actual performance than their classic counterparts, and the performance
bounds for KZ are also improved. We apply them to designing integer-forcing
(IF) linear receivers for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications. Our
simulations confirm their rate and complexity advantages.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the concept of low rank-width colorings, generalising the notion
of low tree-depth colorings introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez
in [Grad and classes with bounded expansion I. Decompositions. EJC, 2008]. We
say that a class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs admits low rank-width colourings if
there exist functions $N\colon \mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ and $Q\colon
\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $p\in \mathbb{N}$, every
graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$ can be vertex colored with at most $N(p)$ colors such
that the union of any $i\leq p$ color classes induces a subgraph of rank-width
at most $Q(i)$.
  Graph classes admitting low rank-width colorings strictly generalize graph
classes admitting low tree-depth colorings and graph classes of bounded
rank-width. We prove that for every graph class $\mathcal{C}$ of bounded
expansion and every positive integer $r$, the class $\{G^r\colon G\in
\mathcal{C}\}$ of $r$th powers of graphs from $\mathcal{C}$, as well as the
classes of unit interval graphs and bipartite permutation graphs admit low
rank-width colorings. All of these classes have unbounded rank-width and do not
admit low tree-depth colorings. We also show that the classes of interval
graphs and permutation graphs do not admit low rank-width colorings. As
interesting side properties, we prove that every graph class admitting low
rank-width colorings has the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property and is $\chi$-bounded.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the number of related yet distinct
advances in semantic segmentation. Here, we tackle this problem by leveraging
the respective strengths of these advances. That is, we formulate a conditional
random field over a four-connected graph as end-to-end trainable convolutional
and recurrent networks, and estimate them via an adversarial process.
Importantly, our model learns not only unary potentials but also pairwise
potentials, while aggregating multi-scale contexts and controlling higher-order
inconsistencies. We evaluate our model on two standard benchmark datasets for
semantic face segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on both of them.

 <dc:description>  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Exploratory Team meeting,
&quot;Model-Driven Paradigms for Integrated Approaches to Cyber Defense,&quot; was
organized by the NATO Science and Technology Organization's (STO) Information
Systems and Technology (IST) panel and conducted its meetings and electronic
exchanges during 2016. This report describes the proceedings and outcomes of
the team's efforts.
  Many of the defensive activities in the fields of cyber warfare and
information assurance rely on essentially ad hoc techniques. The cyber
community recognizes that comprehensive, systematic, principle-based modeling
and simulation are more likely to produce long-term, lasting, reusable
approaches to defensive cyber operations.
  A model-driven paradigm is predicated on creation and validation of
mechanisms of modeling the organization whose mission is subject to assessment,
the mission (or missions) itself, and the cyber-vulnerable systems that support
the mission. This by any definition is a complex socio-technical system (of
systems), and the level of detail of this class of problems ranges from the
level of host and network events to the systems' functions up to the function
of the enterprise. Solving this class of problems is of medium to high
difficulty and can draw in part on advances in Systems Engineering (SE). Such
model-based approaches and analysis could be used to explore multiple
alternative mitigation and work-around strategies and to select the optimal
course of mitigating actions. Furthermore, the model-driven paradigm applied to
cyber operations is likely to benefit traditional disciplines of cyber defense
such as security, vulnerability analysis, intrusion prevention, intrusion
detection, analysis, forensics, attribution, and recovery.

 <dc:description>  We deal with the problem of maintaining a shortest-path tree rooted at some
process r in a network that may be disconnected after topological changes. The
goal is then to maintain a shortest-path tree rooted at r in its connected
component, V\_r, and make all processes of other components detecting that r is
not part of their connected component. We propose, in the composite atomicity
model, a silent self-stabilizing algorithm for this problem working in
semi-anonymous networks, where edges have strictly positive weights. This
algorithm does not require any a priori knowledge about global parameters of
the network. We prove its correctness assuming the distributed unfair daemon,
the most general daemon. Its stabilization time in rounds is at most 3nmax+D,
where nmax is the maximum number of non-root processes in a connected component
and D is the hop-diameter of V\_r. Furthermore, if we additionally assume that
edge weights are positive integers, then it stabilizes in a polynomial number
of steps: namely, we exhibit a bound in O(maxi nmax^3 n), where maxi is the
maximum weight of an edge and n is the number of processes.

 <dc:description>  Current action recognition methods heavily rely on trimmed videos for model
training. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to acquire a large-scale
trimmed video dataset. This paper presents a new weakly supervised
architecture, called UntrimmedNet, which is able to directly learn action
recognition models from untrimmed videos without the requirement of temporal
annotations of action instances. Our UntrimmedNet couples two important
components, the classification module and the selection module, to learn the
action models and reason about the temporal duration of action instances,
respectively. These two components are implemented with feed-forward networks,
and UntrimmedNet is therefore an end-to-end trainable architecture. We exploit
the learned models for action recognition (WSR) and detection (WSD) on the
untrimmed video datasets of THUMOS14 and ActivityNet. Although our UntrimmedNet
only employs weak supervision, our method achieves performance superior or
comparable to that of those strongly supervised approaches on these two
datasets.

 <dc:description>  For genetic algorithms using a bit-string representation of length~$n$, the
general recommendation is to take $1/n$ as mutation rate. In this work, we
discuss whether this is really justified for multimodal functions. Taking jump
functions and the $(1+1)$ evolutionary algorithm as the simplest example, we
observe that larger mutation rates give significantly better runtimes. For the
$\jump_{m,n}$ function, any mutation rate between $2/n$ and $m/n$ leads to a
speed-up at least exponential in $m$ compared to the standard choice.
  The asymptotically best runtime, obtained from using the mutation rate $m/n$
and leading to a speed-up super-exponential in $m$, is very sensitive to small
changes of the mutation rate. Any deviation by a small $(1 \pm \eps)$ factor
leads to a slow-down exponential in $m$. Consequently, any fixed mutation rate
gives strongly sub-optimal results for most jump functions.
  Building on this observation, we propose to use a random mutation rate
$\alpha/n$, where $\alpha$ is chosen from a power-law distribution. We prove
that the $(1+1)$ EA with this heavy-tailed mutation rate optimizes any
$\jump_{m,n}$ function in a time that is only a small polynomial (in~$m$)
factor above the one stemming from the optimal rate for this $m$.
  Our heavy-tailed mutation operator yields similar speed-ups (over the best
known performance guarantees) for the vertex cover problem in bipartite graphs
and the matching problem in general graphs.
  Following the example of fast simulated annealing, fast evolution strategies,
and fast evolutionary programming, we propose to call genetic algorithms using
a heavy-tailed mutation operator \emph{fast genetic algorithms}.

 <dc:description>  We study a cooperative network with a buffer-aided multi-antenna source,
multiple half-duplex (HD) buffer-aided relays and a single destination. Such a
setup could represent a cellular downlink scenario, in which the source can be
a more powerful wireless device with a buffer and multiple antennas, while a
set of intermediate less powerful devices are used as relays to reach the
destination. The main target is to recover the multiplexing loss of the network
by having the source and a relay to simultaneously transmit their information
to another relay and the destination, respectively. Successive transmissions in
such a cooperative network, however, cause inter-relay interference (IRI).
First, by assuming global channel state information (CSI), we show that the
detrimental effect of IRI can be alleviated by precoding at the source,
mitigating or even fully canceling the interference. A cooperative relaying
policy is proposed that employs a joint precoding design and relay-pair
selection. Note that both fixed rate and adaptive rate transmissions can be
considered. For the case when channel state information is only available at
the receiving side (CSIR), we propose a relay selection policy that employs a
phase alignment technique to reduce the IRI. The performance of the two
proposed relay pair selection policies are evaluated and compared with other
state-of-the-art relaying schemes in terms of outage and throughput. The
results show that the use of a powerful source can provide considerable

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework employing stochastic differential equations to
facilitate the long-term stability analysis of power grids with intermittent
wind power generations. This framework takes into account the discrete dynamics
which play a critical role in the long-term stability analysis, incorporates
the model of wind speed with different probability distributions, and also
develops an approximation methodology (by a deterministic hybrid model) for the
stochastic hybrid model to reduce the computational burden brought about by the
uncertainty of wind power. The theoretical and numerical studies show that a
deterministic hybrid model can provide an accurate trajectory approximation and
stability assessments for the stochastic hybrid model under mild conditions. In
addition, we discuss the critical cases that the deterministic hybrid model
fails and discover that these cases are caused by a violation of the proposed
sufficient conditions. Such discussion complements the proposed framework and
methodology and also reaffirms the importance of the stochastic hybrid model
when the system operates close to its stability limit.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, adaptive non-uniform compressive sampling (ANCS) of
time-varying signals, which are sparse in a proper basis, is introduced. ANCS
employs the measurements of previous time steps to distribute the sensing
energy among coefficients more intelligently. To this aim, a Bayesian inference
method is proposed that does not require any prior knowledge of importance
levels of coefficients or sparsity of the signal. Our numerical simulations
show that ANCS is able to achieve the desired non-uniform recovery of the
signal. Moreover, if the signal is sparse in canonical basis, ANCS can reduce
the number of required measurements significantly.

 <dc:description>  We propose a way of reasoning about minimal and maximal values of the weights
of transitions in a weighted transition system (WTS). This perspective induces
a notion of bisimulation that is coarser than the classic bisimulation: it
relates states that exhibit transitions to bisimulation classes with the
weights within the same boundaries. We propose a customized modal logic that
expresses these numeric boundaries for transition weights by means of
particular modalities. We prove that our logic is invariant under the proposed
notion of bisimulation. We show that the logic enjoys the finite model property
which allows us to prove the decidability of satisfiability and provide an
algorithm for satisfiability checking. Last but not least, we identify a
complete axiomatization for this logic. All our results are proven for a class
of WTSs without the image-finiteness restriction, a fact that makes this
development general and robust.

 <dc:description>  Progress has been achieved recently in object detection given advancements in
deep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of
training data and significant manual effort to label objects. This limits their
applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a large number of
objects and variety of conditions. This work proposes an autonomous process for
training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection and pose
estimation in robotic setups. The focus is on detecting objects placed in
cluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. In
particular, given access to 3D object models, several aspects of the
environment are physically simulated. The models are placed in physically
realistic poses with respect to their environment to generate a labeled
synthetic dataset. To further improve object detection, the network self-trains
over real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimation
process. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existing
datasets and on a dataset collected for this paper with a Motoman robotic arm.
Results show that the proposed approach outperforms popular training processes
relying on synthetic - but not physically realistic - data and manual
annotation. The key contributions are the incorporation of physical reasoning
in the synthetic data generation process and the automation of the annotation
process over real images.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of detecting fallen people lying on the
floor by means of a mobile robot equipped with a 3D depth sensor. In the
proposed algorithm, inspired by semantic segmentation techniques, the 3D scene
is over-segmented into small patches. Fallen people are then detected by means
of two SVM classifiers: the first one labels each patch, while the second one
captures the spatial relations between them. This novel approach showed to be
robust and fast. Indeed, thanks to the use of small patches, fallen people in
real cluttered scenes with objects side by side are correctly detected.
Moreover, the algorithm can be executed on a mobile robot fitted with a
standard laptop making it possible to exploit the 2D environmental map built by
the robot and the multiple points of view obtained during the robot navigation.
Additionally, this algorithm is robust to illumination changes since it does
not rely on RGB data but on depth data. All the methods have been thoroughly
validated on the IASLAB-RGBD Fallen Person Dataset, which is published online
as a further contribution. It consists of several static and dynamic sequences
with 15 different people and 2 different environments.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we suggest a novel data-driven approach to active learning
(AL). The key idea is to train a regressor that predicts the expected error
reduction for a candidate sample in a particular learning state. By formulating
the query selection procedure as a regression problem we are not restricted to
working with existing AL heuristics; instead, we learn strategies based on
experience from previous AL outcomes. We show that a strategy can be learnt
either from simple synthetic 2D datasets or from a subset of domain-specific
data. Our method yields strategies that work well on real data from a wide
range of domains.

 <dc:description>  Complex networks have been found to provide a good representation of the
structure of knowledge, as understood in terms of discoverable concepts and
their relationships. In this context, the discovery process can be modeled as
agents walking in a knowledge space. Recent studies proposed more realistic
dynamics, including the possibility of agents being influenced by others with
higher visibility or by their own memory. However, rather than dealing with
these two concepts separately, as previously approached, in this study we
propose a multi-agent random walk model for knowledge acquisition that
incorporates both concepts. More specifically, we employed the true self
avoiding walk alongside a new dynamics based on jumps, in which agents are
attracted by the influence of others. That was achieved by using a L\'evy
flight influenced by a field of attraction emanating from the agents. In order
to evaluate our approach, we use a set of network models and two real networks,
one generated from Wikipedia and another from the Web of Science. The results
were analyzed globally and by regions. In the global analysis, we found that
most of the dynamics parameters do not significantly affect the discovery
dynamics. The local analysis revealed a substantial difference of performance
depending on the network regions where the dynamics are occurring. In
particular, the dynamics at the core of networks tend to be more effective. The
choice of the dynamics parameters also had no significant impact to the
acquisition performance for the considered knowledge networks, even at the
local scale.

Network architecture which is trained end to end, from scratch, on a limited
dataset. Our semantic segmentation architecture utilizes several recent
innovations in particularly in the combined use of (i) use of atrous
convolutions to increase the effective field of view of the network's receptive
field without increasing the number of parameters, (ii) the use of
network-in-network $1\times1$ convolution layers to add capacity to the network
and (iii) state-of-art super-resolution upsampling of predictions using
subpixel CNN layers. We reported a mean IOU score of 0.642 on the validation

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a hybrid measurement- and model-based method is proposed which
can estimate the dynamic state Jacobian matrix in near real-time. The proposed
method is computationally efficient and robust to the variation of network
topology. A numerical example is given to show that the proposed method is able
to provide good estimation for the dynamic state Jacobian matrix and is
superior to the model-based method under undetectable network topology change.
The proposed method may also help identify big discrepancy in the assumed

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The widespread use of smartphones gives rise to new security and privacy
concerns. Smartphone thefts account for the largest percentage of thefts in
recent crime statistics. Using a victim's smartphone, the attacker can launch
impersonation attacks, which threaten the security of the victim and other
users in the network. Our threat model includes the attacker taking over the
phone after the user has logged on with his password or pin. Our goal is to
design a mechanism for smartphones to better authenticate the current user,
continuously and implicitly, and raise alerts when necessary. In this paper, we
propose a multi-sensors-based system to achieve continuous and implicit
authentication for smartphone users. The system continuously learns the owner's
behavior patterns and environment characteristics, and then authenticates the
current user without interrupting user-smartphone interactions. Our method can
adaptively update a user's model considering the temporal change of user's
patterns. Experimental results show that our method is efficient, requiring
less than 10 seconds to train the model and 20 seconds to detect the abnormal
user, while achieving high accuracy (more than 90%). Also the combination of
more sensors provide better accuracy. Furthermore, our method enables adjusting
the security level by changing the sampling rate.

and particularly by different notions of subjective similarity latent in
targeted user groups. Taking the example of soccer players, we present a
visual-interactive system that learns users' mental models of similarity. In a
visual-interactive interface, users are able to label pairs of soccer players
with respect to their subjective notion of similarity. Our proposed similarity
model automatically learns the respective concept of similarity using an active
learning strategy. A visual-interactive retrieval technique is provided to
validate the model and to execute downstream retrieval tasks for soccer player
analysis. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated in different
evaluation strategies, including usage scenarions and cross-validation tests.

 <dc:description>  Loyalty is an essential component of multi-community engagement. When users
have the choice to engage with a variety of different communities, they often
become loyal to just one, focusing on that community at the expense of others.
However, it is unclear how loyalty is manifested in user behavior, or whether
loyalty is encouraged by certain community characteristics.
  In this paper we operationalize loyalty as a user-community relation: users
loyal to a community consistently prefer it over all others; loyal communities
retain their loyal users over time. By exploring this relation using a large
dataset of discussion communities from Reddit, we reveal that loyalty is
manifested in remarkably consistent behaviors across a wide spectrum of
communities. Loyal users employ language that signals collective identity and
engage with more esoteric, less popular content, indicating they may play a
curational role in surfacing new material. Loyal communities have denser
user-user interaction networks and lower rates of triadic closure, suggesting
that community-level loyalty is associated with more cohesive interactions and
less fragmentation into subgroups. We exploit these general patterns to predict
future rates of loyalty. Our results show that a user's propensity to become
loyal is apparent from their first interactions with a community, suggesting
that some users are intrinsically loyal from the very beginning.

 <dc:description>  Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are popular probabilistic models that
arise in many machine learning tasks, where distributions of diverse sets are
characterized by matrix determinants. In this paper, we develop fast algorithms
to find the most likely configuration (MAP) of large-scale DPPs, which is
NP-hard in general. Due to the submodular nature of the MAP objective, greedy
algorithms have been used with empirical success. Greedy implementations
require computation of log-determinants, matrix inverses or solving linear
systems at each iteration. We present faster implementations of the greedy
algorithms by utilizing the complementary benefits of two log-determinant
approximation schemes: (a) first-order expansions to the matrix log-determinant
function and (b) high-order expansions to the scalar log function with
stochastic trace estimators. In our experiments, our algorithms are orders of
magnitude faster than their competitors, while sacrificing marginal accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the
sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and
applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including
classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of
meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it
can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In
our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a
small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new
task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our
method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this
approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image
classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and
accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural
network policies.

 <dc:description>  The goal of cluster analysis in survival data is to identify clusters that
are decidedly associated with the survival outcome. Previous research has
explored this problem primarily in the medical domain with relatively small
datasets, but the need for such a clustering methodology could arise in other
domains with large datasets, such as social networks. Concretely, we wish to
identify different survival classes in a social network by clustering the users
based on their lifespan in the network. In this paper, we propose a decision
tree based algorithm that uses a global normalization of $p$-values to identify
clusters with significantly different survival distributions. We evaluate the
clusters from our model with the help of a simple survival prediction task and
show that our model outperforms other competing methods.

 <dc:description>  The Wikipedia is a web portal created by users and its simplicity, references
and also the inclusion as insets introductory paragraphs for their pages in
Google search results have made it the go-to place to find out about current
events or people featured in them. Besides, its open application programming
interface (API) allows any user to know about the number of visits some
particular page has. In this paper, after certain events that made Copernicus a
viral meme in Spain, we study the intensity and duration of the increment of
visits to his page and other pages related to the event. Using pages related to
other persons as a comparison, we try to establish a typical duration of
notoriety achieved through social networks, mainly comparing with visits in
previous years in the same dates. We conclude that a 7 day duration is the
statistical mode and that this duration is relatively independent of the
initial increase in the number of visits.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous agents must often detect affordances: the set of behaviors enabled
by a situation. Affordance detection is particularly helpful in domains with
large action spaces, allowing the agent to prune its search space by avoiding
futile behaviors. This paper presents a method for affordance extraction via
word embeddings trained on a Wikipedia corpus. The resulting word vectors are
treated as a common knowledge database which can be queried using linear
algebra. We apply this method to a reinforcement learning agent in a text-only
environment and show that affordance-based action selection improves
performance most of the time. Our method increases the computational complexity
of each learning step but significantly reduces the total number of steps
needed. In addition, the agent's action selections begin to resemble those a
human would choose.

 <dc:description>  We describe a case study with the participation of a Danish veteran suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As part of psychotherapeutic
treatment the participant and therapist have used our novel technique for
instrumenting self-tracking of select aspects of subjective experience using a
one-button wearable device. The instrumentation system is described along with
the specific self-track- ing protocol which defined the participant's
self-tracking of a single symptom, namely the occurrences of a bodily
experienced precursor to hyperarousal. Results from the case study demonstrate
how self-tracking data on a single symptom collected by a patient can provide
valuable input to the therapeutic process. Specifically, it facilitated
identification of crucial details otherwise unavailable from the clinical
assessment and even became decisive in disentangling different symptoms and
their causes.

 <dc:description>  Regularization occurs when the output a learner produces is less variable
than the linguistic data they observed. In an artificial language learning
experiment, we show that there exist at least two independent sources of
regularization bias in cognition: a domain-general source based on cognitive
load and a domain-specific source triggered by linguistic stimuli. Both of
these factors modulate how frequency information is encoded and produced, but
only the production-side modulations result in regularization (i.e. cause
learners to eliminate variation from the observed input). We formalize the
definition of regularization as the reduction of entropy and find that entropy
measures are better at identifying regularization behavior than frequency-based
analyses. We also use a model of cultural transmission to extrapolate from our
experimental data in order to predict the amount of regularization which would
develop in each experimental condition if the artificial language was
transmitted over several generations of learners. Here we find an interaction
between cognitive load and linguistic domain, suggesting that the effect of
cognitive constraints can become more complex when put into the context of
cultural evolution: although learning biases certainly carry information about
the course of language evolution, we should not expect a one-to-one
correspondence between the micro-level processes that regularize linguistic
datasets and the macro-level evolution of linguistic regularity.

 <dc:title>Using Options and Covariance Testing for Long Horizon Off-Policy Policy
  Evaluation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Evaluating a policy by deploying it in the real world can be risky and
costly. Off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) algorithms use historical data
collected from running a previous policy to evaluate a new policy, which
provides a means for evaluating a policy without requiring it to ever be
deployed. Importance sampling is a popular OPE method because it is robust to
partial observability and works with continuous states and actions. However,
the amount of historical data required by importance sampling can scale
exponentially with the horizon of the problem: the number of sequential
decisions that are made. We propose using policies over temporally extended
actions, called options, and show that combining these policies with importance
sampling can significantly improve performance for long-horizon problems. In
addition, we can take advantage of special cases that arise due to
options-based policies to further improve the performance of importance
sampling. We further generalize these special cases to a general covariance
testing rule that can be used to decide which weights to drop in an IS
estimate, and derive a new IS algorithm called Incremental Importance Sampling
that can provide significantly more accurate estimates for a broad class of
domains.

 <dc:description>  In reinforcement learning, the state of the real world is often represented
by feature vectors. However, not all of the features may be pertinent for
solving the current task. We propose Feature Selection Explore and Exploit
(FS-EE), an algorithm that automatically selects the necessary features while
learning a Factored Markov Decision Process, and prove that under mild
assumptions, its sample complexity scales with the in-degree of the dynamics of
just the necessary features, rather than the in-degree of all features. This
can result in a much better sample complexity when the in-degree of the
necessary features is smaller than the in-degree of all features.

 <dc:description>  Today, experiencing virtual reality (VR) is a cumbersome experience which
either requires dedicated infrastructure like infrared cameras to track the
headset and hand-motion controllers (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive), or provides
only 3-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) tracking which severely limits the user
experience (e.g., Samsung Gear). To truly enable VR everywhere, we need
position tracking to be available as a ubiquitous service. This paper presents
WiCapture, a novel approach which leverages commodity WiFi infrastructure,
which is ubiquitous today, for tracking purposes. We prototype WiCapture using
off-the-shelf WiFi radios and show that it achieves an accuracy of 0.88 cm
compared to sophisticated infrared based tracking systems like the Oculus,
while providing much higher range, resistance to occlusion, ubiquity and ease
of deployment.

 <dc:description>  We prove that a particular deep network architecture is more efficient at
approximating radially symmetric functions than the best known 2 or 3 layer
networks. We use this architecture to approximate Gaussian kernel SVMs, and
subsequently improve upon them with further training. The architecture and
initial weights of the Deep Radial Kernel Network are completely specified by
the SVM and therefore sidesteps the problem of empirically choosing an
appropriate deep network architecture.

 <dc:description>  We ask how to defend user ability to plausibly deny their interest in topics
deemed sensitive in the face of search engine learning. We develop a practical
and scalable tool called \PDE{} allowing a user to detect and assess threats to
plausible deniability. We show that threats to plausible deniability of
interest are readily detectable for all topics tested in an extensive testing
program. Of particular concern is observation of threats to deniability of
interest in topics related to health and sexual preferences. We show this
remains the case when attempting to disrupt search engine learning through
noise query injection and click obfuscation. We design a defence technique
exploiting uninteresting, proxy topics and show that it provides a more
effective defence of plausible deniability in our experiments.

 <dc:title>Efficiency Optimizations on Yao's Garbled Circuits and Their Practical
  Applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bi&#xe7;er, Osman</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The advance of cloud computing and big data technologies brings out major
changes in the ways that people make use of information systems. While those
technologies extremely ease our lives, they impose the danger of compromising
privacy and security of data due to performing the computation on an untrusted
remote server. Moreover, there are also many other real-world scenarios
requiring two or more (possibly distrustful) parties to securely compute a
function without leaking their respective inputs to each other. In this
respect, various secure computation mechanisms have been proposed in order to
protect users' data privacy. Yao's garbled circuit protocol is one of the most
powerful solutions for this problem. In this thesis, we first describe the
Yao's protocol in detail, and include the complete list of optimizations over
the Yao's protocol. We also compare their advantages in terms of communication
and computation complexities, and analyse their compatibility with each other.
We also look into generic Yao implementations (including garbled RAM) to
demonstrate the use of this powerful tool in practice. We compare those generic
implementations in terms of their use of garbled circuit optimizations. We also
cover the specific real-world applications for further illustration. Moreover,
in some scenarios, the functionality itself may also need to be kept private
which leads to an ideal solution of secure computation problem. In this
direction, we finally cover the problem of Private Function Evaluation, in
particular for the 2-party case where garbled circuits have an important role.
We finally analyse the generic mechanism of Mohassel et al. and contribute to
it by proposing a new technique for the computation of the number of possible
circuit mappings.

 <dc:title>Enhancing sensitivity in quantum metrology by Hamiltonian extensions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A well-studied scenario in quantum parameter estimation theory arises when
the parameter to be estimated is imprinted on the initial state by a
Hamiltonian of the form $\theta G$. For such &quot;phase shift Hamiltonians&quot; it has
been shown that one cannot improve the channel quantum Fisher information by
adding ancillas and letting the system interact with them. Here we investigate
the general case, where the Hamiltonian is not necessarily a phase shift, and
show that in this case in general it \emph{is} possible to increase the quantum
channel information and to reach an upper bound. This can be done by adding a
term proportional to the derivative of the Hamiltonian, or by subtracting a
term to the original Hamiltonian. Both methods do not make use of any ancillas
and show therefore that for quantum channel estimation with arbitrary
parameter-dependent Hamiltonian, entanglement with an ancillary system is not
necessary to reach the best possible sensitivity. By adding an operator to the
Hamiltonian we can also modify the time scaling of the channel quantum Fisher
information. We illustrate our techniques with NV-center magnetometry and the
estimation of the direction of a magnetic field in a given plane using a single
spin-1 as probe.

 <dc:description>  We introduce and analyze an on-line learning setting where the learner has
the added option of abstaining from making a prediction at the price of a fixed
cost. When the learner abstains, no feedback is provided, and she does not
receive the label associated with the example. We design several algorithms and
derive regret guarantees in both the adversarial and stochastic loss setting.
In the process, we derive a new bound for on-line learning with feedback graphs
that generalizes and extends existing work. We also design a new algorithm for
on-line learning with sleeping experts that takes advantage of time-varying
feedback graphs. We present natural extensions of existing algorithms as a
baseline, and we then design more sophisticated algorithms that explicitly
exploit the structure of our problem. We empirically validate the improvement
of these more sophisticated algorithms on several datasets.

 <dc:title>Combinatorial Auctions with Online XOS Bidders</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In combinatorial auctions, a designer must decide how to allocate a set of
indivisible items amongst a set of bidders. Each bidder has a valuation
function which gives the utility they obtain from any subset of the items. Our
focus is specifically on welfare maximization, where the objective is to
maximize the sum of valuations that the bidders place on the items that they
were allocated (the valuation functions are assumed to be reported truthfully).
We analyze an online problem in which the algorithm is not given the set of
bidders in advance. Instead, the bidders are revealed sequentially in a
uniformly random order, similarly to secretary problems. The algorithm must
make an irrevocable decision about which items to allocate to the current
bidder before the next one is revealed. When the valuation functions lie in the
class $XOS$ (which includes submodular functions), we provide a black box
reduction from offline to online optimization. Specifically, given an
$\alpha$-approximation algorithm for offline welfare maximization, we show how
to create a $(0.199 \alpha)$-approximation algorithm for the online problem.
Our algorithm draws on connections to secretary problems; in fact, we show that
the online welfare maximization problem itself can be viewed as a particular
kind of secretary problem with nonuniform arrival order.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new method for 3D action recognition with skeleton
sequences (i.e., 3D trajectories of human skeleton joints). The proposed method
first transforms each skeleton sequence into three clips each consisting of
several frames for spatial temporal feature learning using deep neural
networks. Each clip is generated from one channel of the cylindrical
coordinates of the skeleton sequence. Each frame of the generated clips
represents the temporal information of the entire skeleton sequence, and
incorporates one particular spatial relationship between the joints. The entire
clips include multiple frames with different spatial relationships, which
provide useful spatial structural information of the human skeleton. We propose
to use deep convolutional neural networks to learn long-term temporal
information of the skeleton sequence from the frames of the generated clips,
and then use a Multi-Task Learning Network (MTLN) to jointly process all frames
of the generated clips in parallel to incorporate spatial structural
information for action recognition. Experimental results clearly show the
effectiveness of the proposed new representation and feature learning method
for 3D action recognition.

 <dc:title>On Optimizing Feedback Interval for Gauss-Markov MIMO Channels With
  Finite-Rate Feedback</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mamat, Kritsada</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), a receiver in a
point-to-point MIMO channel can compute the transmit beamforming vector that
maximizes the transmission rate. For frequency-division duplex, a transmitter
is not able to estimate CSI directly and has to obtain a quantized transmit
beamforming vector from the receiver via a rate-limited feedback channel. We
assume that time evolution of MIMO channels is modeled as a Gauss-Markov
process parameterized by a temporal-correlation coefficient. For a given
feedback rate, we analyze the optimal feedback interval that maximizes the
average transmission rate or received power of systems with two transmit and/or
two receive antennas. For other system sizes, we derive the rate gain in a
large system limit, which is shown to approximate the rate gain of a
finite-size system well. We find that quantizing transmit beamforming with the
optimal feedback interval gives a larger rate than the existing Kalman-filter
scheme does by as much as 10%.

 <dc:title>A Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Half-Pel Interpolation in

 <dc:description>  Motion compensation is a fundamental technology in video coding to remove the
temporal redundancy between video frames. To further improve the coding
efficiency, sub-pel motion compensation has been utilized, which requires
interpolation of fractional samples. The video coding standards usually adopt
fixed interpolation filters that are derived from the signal processing theory.
However, as video signal is not stationary, the fixed interpolation filters may
turn out less efficient. Inspired by the great success of convolutional neural
network (CNN) in computer vision, we propose to design a CNN-based
interpolation filter (CNNIF) for video coding. Different from previous studies,
one difficulty for training CNNIF is the lack of ground-truth since the
fractional samples are actually not available. Our solution for this problem is
to derive the &quot;ground-truth&quot; of fractional samples by smoothing high-resolution
images, which is verified to be effective by the conducted experiments.
Compared to the fixed half-pel interpolation filter for luma in High Efficiency
Video Coding (HEVC), our proposed CNNIF achieves up to 3.2% and on average 0.9%
BD-rate reduction under low-delay P configuration.

 <dc:title>PACO: A System-Level Abstraction for On-Loading Contextual Data to
  Mobile Devices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wendt, Nathaniel</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Spatiotemporal context is crucial in modern mobile applications that utilize
increasing amounts of context to better predict events and user behaviors,
requiring rich records of users' or devices' spatiotemporal histories.
Maintaining these rich histories requires frequent sampling and indexed storage
of spatiotemporal data that pushes the limits of resource-constrained mobile
devices. Today's apps offload processing and storing contextual information,
but this increases response time, often relies on the user's data connection,
and runs the very real risk of revealing sensitive information. In this paper
we motivate the feasibility of on-loading large amounts of context and
introduce PACO (Programming Abstraction for Contextual On-loading), an
architecture for on-loading data that optimizes for location and time while
allowing flexibility in storing additional context. The PACO API's innovations
enable on-loading very dense traces of information, even given devices'
resource constraints. Using real-world traces and our implementation for
Android, we demonstrate that PACO can support expressive application queries
entirely on-device. Our quantitative evaluation assesses PACO's energy
consumption, execution time, and spatiotemporal query accuracy. Further, PACO
facilitates unified contextual reasoning across multiple applications and also
supports user-controlled release of contextual data to other devices or the
cloud; we demonstrate these assets through a proof-of-concept case study.

 <dc:description>  This letter studies the outage performance of cooperative non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) network with the help of an amplify-and-forward relay.
An accurate closed-form approximation for the exact outage probability is
derived. Based on this, the asymptotic outage probability is investigated,
which shows that cooperative NOMA achieves the same diversity order and the
superior coding gain compared to cooperative orthogonal multiple access. It is
also revealed that when the transmit power of relay is smaller than that of the
base station, the outage performance improves as the distance between the relay
and indirect link user decreases.

 <dc:description>  The Single Transferable Vote (STV) is a system of preferential voting
employed in multi-seat elections. Each vote cast by a voter is a (potentially
partial) ranking over a set of candidates. No techniques currently exist for
computing the margin of victory (MOV) in STV elections. The MOV is the smallest
number of vote manipulations (changes, additions, and deletions) required to
bring about a change in the set of elected candidates. Knowledge of the MOV of
an election gives greater insight into both how much time and money should be
spent on the auditing of the election, and whether uncovered mistakes (such as
ballot box losses) throw the election result into doubt---requiring a costly
repeat election---or can be safely ignored. In this paper, we present
algorithms for computing lower and upper bounds on the MOV in STV elections. In
small instances, these algorithms are able to compute exact margins.

 <dc:description>  We address the challenging problem of robotic grasping and manipulation in
the presence of uncertainty. This uncertainty is due to noisy sensing,
inaccurate models and hard-to-predict environment dynamics. We quantify the
importance of continuous, real-time perception and its tight integration with
reactive motion generation methods in dynamic manipulation scenarios. We
compare three different systems that are instantiations of the most common
architectures in the field: (i) a traditional sense-plan-act approach that is
still widely used, (ii) a myopic controller that only reacts to local
environment dynamics and (iii) a reactive planner that integrates feedback
control and motion optimization. All architectures rely on the same components
for real-time perception and reactive motion generation to allow a quantitative
evaluation. We extensively evaluate the systems on a real robotic platform in
four scenarios that exhibit either a challenging workspace geometry or a
dynamic environment. In 333 experiments, we quantify the robustness and
accuracy that is due to integrating real-time feedback at different time scales
in a reactive motion generation system. We also report on the lessons learned
for system building.

 <dc:description>  We present an extension of the ergodic, mixing, and Bernoulli levels of the
ergodic hierarchy for statistical models on curved manifolds, making use of
elements of the information geometry. This extension focuses on the notion of
statistical independence between the microscopical variables of the system.
Moreover, we establish an intimately relationship between statistical models
and family of probability distributions belonging to the canonical ensemble,
which for the case of the quadratic Hamiltonian systems provides a closed form
for the correlations between the microvariables in terms of the temperature of
the heat bath as a power law. From this we obtain an information geometric
method for studying Hamiltonian dynamics in the canonical ensemble. We
illustrate the results with two examples: a pair of interacting harmonic
oscillators presenting phase transitions and the 2x2 Gaussian ensembles. In
both examples the scalar curvature results a global indicator of the dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Adders are key building blocks of many error-tolerant applications.
Leveraging the application-level error tolerance, a number of approximate
adders were proposed recently. Many of them belong to the category of
block-based approximate adders. For approximate circuits, besides normal
metrics such as area and delay, another important metric is the error
measurement. Given the popularity of block-based approximate adders, in this
work, we propose an accurate and efficient method to obtain the error
statistics of these adders. We first show how to calculate the error rates.
Then, we demonstrate an approach to get the exact error distribution, which can
be used to calculate other error characteristics, such as mean error distance
and mean square error.

 <dc:title>Implicit Sensor-based Authentication of Smartphone Users with Smartwatch</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Wei-Han</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Smartphones are now frequently used by end-users as the portals to
cloud-based services, and smartphones are easily stolen or co-opted by an
attacker. Beyond the initial log-in mechanism, it is highly desirable to
re-authenticate end-users who are continuing to access security-critical
services and data, whether in the cloud or in the smartphone. But attackers who
have gained access to a logged-in smartphone have no incentive to
re-authenticate, so this must be done in an automatic, non-bypassable way.
Hence, this paper proposes a novel authentication system, iAuth, for implicit,
continuous authentication of the end-user based on his or her behavioral
characteristics, by leveraging the sensors already ubiquitously built into
smartphones. We design a system that gives accurate authentication using
machine learning and sensor data from multiple mobile devices. Our system can
achieve 92.1% authentication accuracy with negligible system overhead and less
than 2% battery consumption.

 <dc:title>Towards Wi-Fi AP-Assisted Content Prefetching for On-Demand TV Series: A
  Reinforcement Learning Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The emergence of smart Wi-Fi APs (Access Point), which are equipped with huge
storage space, opens a new research area on how to utilize these resources at
the edge network to improve users' quality of experience (QoE) (e.g., a short
startup delay and smooth playback). One important research interest in this
area is content prefetching, which predicts and accurately fetches contents
ahead of users' requests to shift the traffic away during peak periods.
However, in practice, the different video watching patterns among users, and
the varying network connection status lead to the time-varying server load,
which eventually makes the content prefetching problem challenging. To
understand this challenge, this paper first performs a large-scale measurement
study on users' AP connection and TV series watching patterns using
real-traces. Then, based on the obtained insights, we formulate the content
prefetching problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The objective is to
strike a balance between the increased prefetching&amp;storage cost incurred by
incorrect prediction and the reduced content download delay because of
successful prediction. A learning-based approach is proposed to solve this
problem and another three algorithms are adopted as baselines. In particular,
first, we investigate the performance lower bound by using a random algorithm,
and the upper bound by using an ideal offline approach. Then, we present a
heuristic algorithm as another baseline. Finally, we design a reinforcement
learning algorithm that is more practical to work in the online manner. Through
extensive trace-based experiments, we demonstrate the performance gain of our
design. Remarkably, our learning-based algorithm achieves a better precision
and hit ratio (e.g., 80%) with about 70% (resp. 50%) cost saving compared to
the random (resp. heuristic) algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Personalized driver models play a key role in the development of advanced
driver assistance systems and automated driving systems. Traditionally,
physical-based driver models with fixed structures usually lack the flexibility
to describe the uncertainties and high non-linearity of driver behaviors. In
this paper, two kinds of learning-based car-following personalized driver
models were developed using naturalistic driving data collected from the
University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment program. One model is
developed by combining the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Hidden Markov
Model (HMM), and the other one is developed by combining the Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM) and Probability Density Functions (PDF). Fitting results between
the two approaches were analyzed with different model inputs and numbers of GMM
components. Statistical analyses show that both models provide good performance
of fitting while the GMM--PDF approach shows a higher potential to increase the
model accuracy given a higher dimension of training data.

 <dc:description>  Program synthesis from incomplete specifications (e.g. input-output examples)
has gained popularity and found real-world applications, primarily due to its
ease-of-use. Since this technology is often used in an interactive setting,
efficiency and correctness are often the key user expectations from a system
based on such technologies. Ensuring efficiency is challenging since the highly
combinatorial nature of program synthesis algorithms does not fit in a 1-2
second response expectation of a user-facing system. Meeting correctness
expectations is also difficult, given that the specifications provided are
incomplete, and that the users of such systems are typically non-programmers.
  In this paper, we describe how interactivity can be leveraged to develop
efficient synthesis algorithms, as well as to decrease the cognitive burden
that a user endures trying to ensure that the system produces the desired
program. We build a formal model of user interaction along three dimensions:
incremental algorithm, step-based problem formulation, and feedback-based
intent refinement. We then illustrate the effectiveness of each of these forms
of interactivity with respect to synthesis performance and correctness on a set
of real-world case studies.

 <dc:title>Communications that Emerge through Reinforcement Learning Using a
  (Recurrent) Neural Network</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shibata, Katsunari</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Communication is not only an action of choosing a signal, but needs to
consider the context and sensor signals. It also needs to decide what
information is communicated and how it is represented in or understood from
signals. Therefore, communication should be realized comprehensively together
with its purpose and other functions.
  The recent successful results in end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) show
the importance of comprehensive learning and the usefulness of end-to-end RL.
Although little is known, we have shown that a variety of communications emerge
through RL using a (recurrent) neural network (NN). Here, three of them are
introduced.
  In the 1st one, negotiation to avoid conflicts among 4 randomly-picked agents
was learned. Each agent generates a binary signal from the output of its
recurrent NN (RNN), and receives 4 signals from the agents three times. After
learning, each agent made an appropriate final decision after negotiation for
any combination of 4 agents. Differentiation of individuality among the agents
also could be seen.
  The 2nd one focused on discretization of communication signal. A sender agent
perceives the receiver's location and generates a continuous signal twice by
its RNN. A receiver agent receives them sequentially, and moves according to
its RNN's output to reach the sender's location. When noises were added to the
signal, it was binarized through learning and 2-bit communication was
established.
  The 3rd one focused on end-to-end comprehensive communication. A sender
receives 1,785-pixel real camera image on which a real robot can be seen, and
sends two sounds whose frequencies are computed by its NN. A receiver receives
them, and two motion commands for the robot are generated by its NN. After
learning, though some preliminary learning was necessary for the sender, the
robot could reach the goal from any initial location.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new evaluation protocol for cross-media retrieval which
better fits the real-word applications. Both image-text and text-image
retrieval modes are considered. Traditionally, class labels in the training and
testing sets are identical. That is, it is usually assumed that the query falls
into some pre-defined classes. However, in practice, the content of a query
image/text may vary extensively, and the retrieval system does not necessarily
know in advance the class label of a query. Considering the inconsistency
between the real-world applications and laboratory assumptions, we think that
the existing protocol that works under identical train/test classes can be
modified and improved.
  This work is dedicated to addressing this problem by considering the protocol
under an extendable scenario, \ie, the training and testing classes do not
overlap. We provide extensive benchmarking results obtained by the existing
protocol and the proposed new protocol on several commonly used datasets. We
demonstrate a noticeable performance drop when the testing classes are unseen
during training. Additionally, a trivial solution, \ie, directly using the
predicted class label for cross-media retrieval, is tested. We show that the
trivial solution is very competitive in traditional non-extendable retrieval,
but becomes less so under the new settings. The train/test split, evaluation
code, and benchmarking results are publicly available on our website.

 <dc:description>  This paper proves the first super-logarithmic lower bounds on the cell probe
complexity of dynamic boolean (a.k.a. decision) data structure problems, a
long-standing milestone in data structure lower bounds.
  We introduce a new method for proving dynamic cell probe lower bounds and use
it to prove a $\tilde{\Omega}(\log^{1.5} n)$ lower bound on the operational
time of a wide range of boolean data structure problems, most notably, on the
query time of dynamic range counting over $\mathbb{F}_2$ ([Pat07]). Proving an
$\omega(\lg n)$ lower bound for this problem was explicitly posed as one of
five important open problems in the late Mihai P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu's obituary
[Tho13]. This result also implies the first $\omega(\lg n)$ lower bound for the
classical 2D range counting problem, one of the most fundamental data structure
problems in computational geometry and spatial databases. We derive similar
lower bounds for boolean versions of dynamic polynomial evaluation and 2D
rectangle stabbing, and for the (non-boolean) problems of range selection and
range median.
  Our technical centerpiece is a new way of &quot;weakly&quot; simulating dynamic data
structures using efficient one-way communication protocols with small advantage
over random guessing. This simulation involves a surprising excursion to
low-degree (Chebychev) polynomials which may be of independent interest, and
offers an entirely new algorithmic angle on the &quot;cell sampling&quot; method of
Panigrahy et al. [PTW10].

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce and describe the highly concurrent xDFS file
transfer protocol and examine its cross-platform and cross-language
implementation in native code for both Linux and Windows in 32 or 64-bit
multi-core processor architectures. The implemented xDFS protocol based on
xDotGrid.NET framework is fully compared with the Globus GridFTP protocol. We
finally propose the xDFS protocol as a new paradigm of distributed systems for
Internet services, and data-intensive Grid and Cloud applications. Also, we
incrementally consider different developmental methods of the optimum file
transfer systems, and their advantages and disadvantages. The vision of this
paper tries as possible to minimize the overhead concerned with the file
transfer protocol itself and to examine optimal software design patterns of

 <dc:title>High SNR Consistent Compressive Sensing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  High signal to noise ratio (SNR) consistency of model selection criteria in
linear regression models has attracted a lot of attention recently. However,
most of the existing literature on high SNR consistency deals with model order
selection. Further, the limited literature available on the high SNR
consistency of subset selection procedures (SSPs) is applicable to linear
regression with full rank measurement matrices only. Hence, the performance of
SSPs used in underdetermined linear models (a.k.a compressive sensing (CS)
algorithms) at high SNR is largely unknown. This paper fills this gap by
deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for the high SNR consistency of
popular CS algorithms like $l_0$-minimization, basis pursuit de-noising or
LASSO, orthogonal matching pursuit and Dantzig selector. Necessary conditions
analytically establish the high SNR inconsistency of CS algorithms when used
with the tuning parameters discussed in literature. Novel tuning parameters
with SNR adaptations are developed using the sufficient conditions and the
choice of SNR adaptations are discussed analytically using convergence rate
analysis. CS algorithms with the proposed tuning parameters are numerically
shown to be high SNR consistent and outperform existing tuning parameters in
the moderate to high SNR regime.

 <dc:title>Direct Application of the Phase Estimation Algorithm to Find the

 <dc:description>  The eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian, $\mathcal{H}$, can be estimated through the
phase estimation algorithm given the matrix exponential of the Hamiltonian,
$exp(-i\mathcal{H})$. The difficulty of this exponentiation impedes the
applications of the phase estimation algorithm particularly when $\mathcal{H}$
is composed of non-commuting terms. In this paper, we present a method to use
the Hamiltonian matrix directly in the phase estimation algorithm by using an
ancilla based framework: In this framework, we also show how to find the power
of the Hamiltonian matrix-which is necessary in the phase estimation
algorithm-through the successive applications. This may eliminate the necessity
of matrix exponential for the phase estimation algorithm and therefore provide
an efficient way to estimate the eigenvalues of particular Hamiltonians. The
classical and quantum algorithmic complexities of the framework are analyzed
for the Hamiltonians which can be written as a sum of simple unitary matrices
and shown that a Hamiltonian of order $2^n$ written as a sum of $L$ number of
simple terms can be used in the phase estimation algorithm with $(n+1+logL)$
number of qubits and $O(2^anL)$ number of quantum operations, where $a$ is the
number of iterations in the phase estimation. In addition, we use the
Hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule as an example system and present the
simulation results for finding its ground state energy.

 <dc:title>The Densest Subgraph Problem with a Convex/Concave Size Function</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the densest subgraph problem, given an edge-weighted undirected graph
$G=(V,E,w)$, we are asked to find $S\subseteq V$ that maximizes the density,
i.e., $w(S)/|S|$, where $w(S)$ is the sum of weights of the edges in the
subgraph induced by $S$. This problem has often been employed in a wide variety
of graph mining applications. However, the problem has a drawback; it may
happen that the obtained subset is too large or too small in comparison with
the size desired in the application at hand. In this study, we address the size
issue of the densest subgraph problem by generalizing the density of
$S\subseteq V$. Specifically, we introduce the $f$-density of $S\subseteq V$,
which is defined as $w(S)/f(|S|)$, where $f:\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow
\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function. In the
$f$-densest subgraph problem ($f$-DS), we aim to find $S\subseteq V$ that
maximizes the $f$-density $w(S)/f(|S|)$. Although $f$-DS does not explicitly
specify the size of the output subset of vertices, we can handle the above size
issue using a convex/concave size function $f$ appropriately. For $f$-DS with
convex function $f$, we propose a nearly-linear-time algorithm with a provable
approximation guarantee. On the other hand, for $f$-DS with concave function
$f$, we propose an LP-based exact algorithm, a flow-based $O(|V|^3)$-time exact
algorithm for unweighted graphs, and a nearly-linear-time approximation
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Resource discovery is one of the most important services that significantly
affects the efficiency of grid computing systems. The inherent dynamic and
large-scale characteristics of grid environments make their resource discovery
a challenging task. In recent years, different approaches have been proposed
for resource discovery, attempting to tackle the challenges of grid
environments and improve the efficiency. Being aware of these challenges and
approaches is worthwhile in order to choose an appropriate approach according
to the application in different organizations. This study reviews the most
important factors that should be considered and challenges to be tackled in
order to develop an efficient grid resource discovery system.

 <dc:description>  As the world's largest radio telescope, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will
provide radio interferometric data with unprecedented detail. Image
reconstruction algorithms for radio interferometry are challenged to scale well
with TeraByte image sizes never seen before. In this work, we investigate one
such 3D image reconstruction algorithm known as MUFFIN (MUlti-Frequency image
reconstruction For radio INterferometry). In particular, we focus on the
challenging task of automatically finding the optimal regularization parameter
values. In practice, finding the regularization parameters using classical grid
search is computationally intensive and nontrivial due to the lack of ground-
truth. We adopt a greedy strategy where, at each iteration, the optimal
parameters are found by minimizing the predicted Stein unbiased risk estimate
(PSURE). The proposed self-tuned version of MUFFIN involves parallel and
computationally efficient steps, and scales well with large- scale data.
Finally, numerical results on a 3D image are presented to showcase the
performance of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, a big part of people rely on available content in social media in
their decisions (e.g. reviews and feedback on a topic or product). The
possibility that anybody can leave a review provide a golden opportunity for
spammers to write spam reviews about products and services for different
interests. Identifying these spammers and the spam content is a hot topic of
research and although a considerable number of studies have been done recently
toward this end, but so far the methodologies put forth still barely detect
spam reviews, and none of them show the importance of each extracted feature
type. In this study, we propose a novel framework, named NetSpam, which
utilizes spam features for modeling review datasets as heterogeneous
information networks to map spam detection procedure into a classification
problem in such networks. Using the importance of spam features help us to
obtain better results in terms of different metrics experimented on real-world
review datasets from Yelp and Amazon websites. The results show that NetSpam
outperforms the existing methods and among four categories of features;
including review-behavioral, user-behavioral, reviewlinguistic,
user-linguistic, the first type of features performs better than the other
categories.

 <dc:description>  In this work, a deep learning approach has been developed to carry out road
detection using only LIDAR data. Starting from an unstructured point cloud,
top-view images encoding several basic statistics such as mean elevation and
density are generated. By considering a top-view representation, road detection
is reduced to a single-scale problem that can be addressed with a simple and
fast fully convolutional neural network (FCN). The FCN is specifically designed
for the task of pixel-wise semantic segmentation by combining a large receptive
field with high-resolution feature maps. The proposed system achieved excellent
performance and it is among the top-performing algorithms on the KITTI road
benchmark. Its fast inference makes it particularly suitable for real-time
applications.

 <dc:description>  Precoding has been conventionally considered as an effective means of
mitigating the interference and efficiently exploiting the available in the
multiantenna downlink channel, where multiple users are simultaneously served
with independent information over the same channel resources. The early works
in this area were focused on transmitting an individual information stream to
each user by constructing weighted linear combinations of symbol blocks
(codewords). However, more recent works have moved beyond this traditional view
by: i) transmitting distinct data streams to groups of users and ii) applying
precoding on a symbol-per-symbol basis. In this context, the current survey
presents a unified view and classification of precoding techniques with respect
to two main axes: i) the switching rate of the precoding weights, leading to
the classes of block- and symbol-level precoding, ii) the number of users that
each stream is addressed to, hence unicast-/multicast-/broadcast- precoding.
Furthermore, the classified techniques are compared through representative
numerical results to demonstrate their relative performance and uncover
fundamental insights. Finally, a list of open theoretical problems and
practical challenges are presented to inspire further research in this area.

 <dc:description>  The correct estimation of the head pose is a problem of the great importance
for many applications. For instance, it is an enabling technology in automotive
for driver attention monitoring. In this paper, we tackle the pose estimation
problem through a deep learning network working in regression manner.
Traditional methods usually rely on visual facial features, such as facial
landmarks or nose tip position. In contrast, we exploit a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to perform head pose estimation directly from depth data. We
exploit a Siamese architecture and we propose a novel loss function to improve
the learning of the regression network layer. The system has been tested on two
public datasets, Biwi Kinect Head Pose and ICT-3DHP database. The reported
results demonstrate the improvement in accuracy with respect to current
state-of-the-art approaches and the real time capabilities of the overall
framework.

 <dc:description>  Android and iSO are the two mobile platforms present in almost all
smartphones build during last years. Developing an application that targets
both platforms is a challenge. A traditional way is to build two different
apps, one in Java for Android, the other in Objective-C for iOS. Xamarin is a
framework for developing Android and iOS apps which allows developers to share
most of the application code across multiple implementations of the app, each
for a specific platform. In this paper, we present XamForumDB, a database that
stores discussions, questions and answers extracted from the Xamarin forum. We
envision research community could use it for studying, for instance, the
problematic of developing such kind of applications.

 <dc:description>  Training deep neural networks is a highly nontrivial task, involving
carefully selecting appropriate training algorithms, scheduling step sizes and
tuning other hyperparameters. Trying different combinations can be quite
labor-intensive and time consuming. Recently, researchers have tried to use
deep learning algorithms to exploit the landscape of the loss function of the
training problem of interest, and learn how to optimize over it in an automatic
way. In this paper, we propose a new learning-to-learn model and some useful
and practical tricks. Our optimizer outperforms generic, hand-crafted
optimization algorithms and state-of-the-art learning-to-learn optimizers by
DeepMind in many tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on a
number of tasks, including deep MLPs, CNNs, and simple LSTMs.

constituents are combined. Based on the premise that substitution by synonyms
is meaning-preserving, compositionality can be approximated as the semantic
similarity between a phrase and a version of that phrase where words have been
replaced by their synonyms. Different ways of representing such phrases exist
(e.g., vectors [1] or language models [2]), and the choice of representation
affects the measurement of semantic similarity.
  We propose a new compositionality detection method that represents phrases as
ranked lists of term weights. Our method approximates the semantic similarity
between two ranked list representations using a range of well-known distance
and correlation metrics. In contrast to most state-of-the-art approaches in
compositionality detection, our method is completely unsupervised. Experiments
with a publicly available dataset of 1048 human-annotated phrases shows that,
compared to strong supervised baselines, our approach provides superior
measurement of compositionality using any of the distance and correlation
metrics considered.

 <dc:description>  Complex networks can be used to represent complex systems which originate in
the real world. Here we study a transformation of these complex networks into
simplicial complexes, where cliques represent the simplices of the complex. We
extend the concept of node centrality to that of simplicial centrality and
study several mathematical properties of degree, closeness, betweenness,
eigenvector, Katz, and subgraph centrality for simplicial complexes. We study
the degree distributions of these centralities at the different levels. We also
compare and describe the differences between the centralities at the different
levels. Using these centralities we study a method for detecting essential
proteins in PPI networks of cells and explain the varying abilities of the
centrality measures at the different levels in identifying these essential
proteins. The paper is written in a self-contained way, such that it can be
used by practitioners of network theory as a basis for further developments.

 <dc:description>  The practical deployment of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in
future fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems is challenging due
to its high hardware cost and power consumption. One promising solution to
address this challenge is to adopt the low-resolution analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) architecture. However, the practical implementation of such
architecture is challenging due to the required complex signal processing to
compensate the coarse quantization caused by low-resolution ADCs. Therefore,
few high-resolution ADCs are reserved in the recently proposed mixed-ADC
architecture to enable low-complexity transceiver algorithms. In contrast to
previous works over Rayleigh fading channels, we investigate the performance of
mixed-ADC massive MIMO systems over the Rician fading channel, which is more
general for the 5G scenarios like Internet of Things (IoT). Specially, novel
closed-form approximate expressions for the uplink achievable rate are derived
for both cases of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). With
the increasing Rician $K$-factor, the derived results show that the achievable
rate will converge to a fixed value. We also obtain the power-scaling law that
the transmit power of each user can be scaled down proportionally to the
inverse of the number of base station (BS) antennas for both perfect and
imperfect CSI. Moreover, we reveal the trade-off between the achievable rate
and energy efficiency with respect to key system parameters including the
quantization bits, number of BS antennas, Rician $K$-factor, user transmit
power, and CSI quality. Finally, numerical results are provided to show that
the mixed-ADC architecture can achieve a better energy-rate trade-off compared
with the ideal infinite-resolution and low-resolution ADC architectures.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new optimal filter namely past observation-based
extended Kalman filter for the problem of localization of Internet-based mobile
robot in which the control input and the feedback measurement suffer from
communication delay. The filter operates through two phases: the time update
and the data correction. The time update predicts the robot position by
reformulating the kinematics model to be non-memoryless. The correction step
corrects the prediction by extrapolating the delayed measurement to the present
and then incorporating it to the being estimate as there is no delay. The
optimality of the incorporation is ensured by the derivation of a multiplier
that reflects the relevance of past observations to the present. Simulations in
MATLAB and experiments in a real networked robot system confirm the validity of
the proposed approach.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the increasing amount of interconnections between vehicles, the attack
surface of internal vehicle networks is rising steeply. Although these networks
are shielded against external attacks, they often do not have any internal
security to protect against malicious components or adversaries who breach the
network perimeter. To secure the in-vehicle network, all communicating
components must be authenticated, and only authorized components should be
allowed to send and receive messages. This is achieved using an authentication
framework. Cryptography is widely used to authenticate communicating parties
and provide secure communication channels (e.g., Internet communication).
However, the real-time performance requirements of in-vehicle networks restrict
the types of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that may be used. In
particular, asymmetric cryptography is computationally infeasible during
vehicle operation.
  In this work, we address the challenges of designing authentication protocols
for automotive systems. We present Lightweight Authentication for Secure
Automotive Networks (LASAN), a full lifecycle authentication approach. We
describe the core LASAN protocols and show how they protect the internal
vehicle network while complying with the real-time constraints and low
computational resources of this domain. Unlike previous work, we also explain
how this framework can be integrated into all aspects of the automotive
lifecycle, including manufacturing, vehicle maintenance, and software updates.
We evaluate LASAN in two different ways: First, we analyze the security
properties of the protocols using established protocol verification techniques
based on formal methods. Second, we evaluate the timing requirements of LASAN
and compare these to other frameworks using a new highly modular discrete event
simulator for in-vehicle networks, which we have developed for this evaluation.

 <dc:description>  Safety has become of paramount importance in the development lifecycle of the
modern automobile systems. However, the current automotive safety standard ISO
26262 does not specify clearly the methods for safety analysis. Different
methods are recommended for this purpose. FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and FMEA
(Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) are used in the most recent ISO 26262
applications to identify component failures, errors and faults that lead to
specific hazards (in the presence of faults). However, these methods are based
on reliability theory, and they are not adequate to address new hazards caused
by dysfunctional component interactions, software failure or human error. A
holistic approach was developed called STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process
Analysis) which addresses more types of hazards and treats safety as a dynamic
control problem rather than an individual component failure. STPA also
addresses types of hazardous causes in the absence of failure. Accordingly,
there is a need for investigating hazard analysis techniques like STPA. In this
paper, we present a concept on how to use STPA to extend the safety scope of
ISO 26262 and support the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessments (HARA) process.
We applied the proposed concept to a current project of a fully automated
vehicle at Continental. As a result, we identified 24 system- level accidents,
176 hazards, 27 unsafe control actions, and 129 unsafe scenarios. We conclude
that STPA is an effective and efficient approach to derive detailed safety
constraints. STPA can support the functional safety engineers to evaluate the
architectural design of fully automated vehicles and build the functional
safety concept.

 <dc:description>  PixelCNN achieves state-of-the-art results in density estimation for natural
images. Although training is fast, inference is costly, requiring one network
evaluation per pixel; O(N) for N pixels. This can be sped up by caching
activations, but still involves generating each pixel sequentially. In this
work, we propose a parallelized PixelCNN that allows more efficient inference
by modeling certain pixel groups as conditionally independent. Our new PixelCNN
model achieves competitive density estimation and orders of magnitude speedup -
O(log N) sampling instead of O(N) - enabling the practical generation of
512x512 images. We evaluate the model on class-conditional image generation,
text-to-image synthesis, and action-conditional video generation, showing that
our model achieves the best results among non-pixel-autoregressive density
models that allow efficient sampling.

Effectively, we shall see that even with a small amount of training corpus a

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Pilot contamination attack is an important kind of active eavesdropping
activity conducted by a malicious user during channel training phase. In this
paper, motivated by the fact that frequency asynchronism could introduce
divergence of the transmitted pilot signals between intended user and attacker,
we propose a new uncoordinated frequency shift (UFS) scheme for detection of
pilot contamination attack in multiple antenna system. An attack detection
algorithm is further developed based on source enumeration method. Both the
asymptotic detection performance analysis and numerical results are provided to
verify the proposed studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed UFS
scheme can achieve comparable detection performance as the existing
superimposed random sequence based scheme, without sacrifice of legitimate
channel estimation performance.

 <dc:description>  It is known that in general, \emph{frozen equivalent} (Linear
Parameter-Varying) LPV models, \emph{i.e.}, LPV models which have the same
input-output behavior for each constant scheduling signal, might exhibit
different input-output behavior for non-constant scheduling signals. In this
paper, we provide an analytic error bound on the difference between the
input-output behaviors of two LPV models which are frozen equivalent. This
error bound turns out to be a function of both the speed of the change of the
scheduling signal and the discrepancy between the coherent bases of the two LPV
models. In particular, the difference between the outputs of the two models can
be made arbitrarily small by choosing a scheduling signal which changes slowly
enough. An illustrative example is presented to show that the choice of the
scheduling signal can reduce the difference between the input-output behaviors
of frozen-equivalent LPV models.

 <dc:description>  We study the following question dating back to J.E. Littlewood (1885-1977):
Can two lions catch a man in a bounded area with rectifiable lakes? The lions
and the man are all assumed to be points moving with at most unit speed. That
the lakes are rectifiable means that their boundaries are finitely long. This
requirement is necessary to avoid pathological examples where the man survives
forever because any path to the lions is infinitely long.
  We show that three lions have a winning strategy against a man in a bounded
region with finitely many rectifiable lakes. This is &quot;tight&quot; in the sense that
there exists a region $R$ in the plane where the man has a strategy to survive
forever. We give a rigorous description of such a region $R$; a polygonal
region with holes whose exterior and interior boundaries are pairwise disjoint,
simple polygons.
  Finally, we consider the following game played on the entire plane instead of
a compact region: There is any finite number of unit speed lions and one fast
man who can run with speed $1+\varepsilon$ for some value $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Can
the man always survive? We answer the question in the affirmative for any
$\varepsilon&gt;0$. By letting the number of lions tend to infinity, we
furthermore show that the man can survive against any countably infinite set of
lions.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel method to describe battery degradation. We use
the concept of degradation maps to model the incremental charge capacity loss
as a function of discrete battery control actions and state of charge. The maps
can be scaled to represent any battery system in size and power. Their convex
piece-wise affine representations allow for tractable optimal control
formulations and can be used in power system simulations to incorporate battery
degradation. The map parameters for different battery technologies are
published making them an useful basis to benchmark different battery
technologies in case studies.

 <dc:title>On Quantum Decision Trees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kak, Subhash</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quantum decision systems are being increasingly considered for use in
artificial intelligence applications. Classical and quantum nodes can be
distinguished based on certain correlations in their states. This paper
investigates some properties of the states obtained in a decision tree
structure. How these correlations may be mapped to the decision tree is
considered. Classical tree representations and approximations to quantum states
are provided.

 <dc:description>  Dermoscopic skin images are often obtained with different imaging devices,
under varying acquisition conditions. In this work, instead of attempting to
perform intensity and color normalization, we propose to leverage computational
color constancy techniques to build an artificial data augmentation technique
suitable for this kind of images. Specifically, we apply the \emph{shades of
gray} color constancy technique to color-normalize the entire training set of
images, while retaining the estimated illuminants. We then draw one sample from
the distribution of training set illuminants and apply it on the normalized
image. We employ this technique for training two deep convolutional neural
networks for the tasks of skin lesion segmentation and skin lesion
classification, in the context of the ISIC 2017 challenge and without using any
external dermatologic image set. Our results on the validation set are
promising, and will be supplemented with extended results on the hidden test
set when available.

 <dc:title>Quantum reading capacity: General definition and bounds</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Quantum reading refers to the task of reading out classical information
stored in a classical memory. In any such protocol, the transmitter and
receiver are in the same physical location, and the goal of such a protocol is
to use these devices, coupled with a quantum strategy, to read out as much
information as possible from a classical memory, such as a CD or DVD. In this
context, a memory cell is a collection of quantum channels that can be used to
encode a classical message in a memory. The maximum rate at which information
can be read out from a given memory encoded with a memory cell is called the
quantum reading capacity of the memory cell. As a consequence of the physical
setup of quantum reading, the most natural and general definition for quantum
reading capacity should allow for an adaptive operation after each call to the
channel, and this is how we define quantum reading capacity in this paper. In
general, an adaptive strategy can give a significant advantage over a
non-adaptive strategy in the context of quantum channel discrimination, and
this is relevant for quantum reading, due to its close connection with channel
discrimination. In this paper, we provide a general definition of quantum
reading capacity, and we establish several upper bounds on the quantum reading
capacity of a memory cell. We also introduce an environment-parametrized memory
cell, and we deliver second-order and strong converse bounds for its quantum
reading capacity. We calculate the quantum reading capacities for some
exemplary memory cells, including a thermal memory cell, a qudit erasure memory
cell, and a qudit depolarizing memory cell. We finally provide an explicit
example to illustrate the advantage of using an adaptive strategy in the
context of zero-error quantum reading capacity.

 <dc:description>  Our overall program objective is to provide more natural ways for soldiers to
interact and communicate with robots, much like how soldiers communicate with
other soldiers today. We describe how the Wizard-of-Oz (WOz) method can be
applied to multimodal human-robot dialogue in a collaborative exploration task.
While the WOz method can help design robot behaviors, traditional approaches
place the burden of decisions on a single wizard. In this work, we consider two
wizards to stand in for robot navigation and dialogue management software
components. The scenario used to elicit data is one in which a human-robot team
is tasked with exploring an unknown environment: a human gives verbal
instructions from a remote location and the robot follows them, clarifying
possible misunderstandings as needed via dialogue. We found the division of
labor between wizards to be workable, which holds promise for future software
development.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks are among the most accurate supervised learning methods in
use today, but their opacity makes them difficult to trust in critical
applications, especially when conditions in training differ from those in test.
Recent work on explanations for black-box models has produced tools (e.g. LIME)
to show the implicit rules behind predictions, which can help us identify when
models are right for the wrong reasons. However, these methods do not scale to
explaining entire datasets and cannot correct the problems they reveal. We
introduce a method for efficiently explaining and regularizing differentiable
models by examining and selectively penalizing their input gradients, which
provide a normal to the decision boundary. We apply these penalties both based
on expert annotation and in an unsupervised fashion that encourages diverse
models with qualitatively different decision boundaries for the same
classification problem. On multiple datasets, we show our approach generates
faithful explanations and models that generalize much better when conditions
differ between training and test.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we propose an algorithm for recovery of sparse and low rank
components of matrices using an iterative method with adaptive thresholding. In
each iteration, the low rank and sparse components are obtained using a
thresholding operator. This algorithm is fast and can be implemented easily. We
compare it with one of the most common fast methods in which the rank and
sparsity are approximated by $\ell_1$ norm. We also apply it to some real
applications where the noise is not so sparse. The simulation results show that
it has a suitable performance with low run-time.

 <dc:description>  For matrices with displacement structure, basic operations like
multiplication, inversion, and linear system solving can all be expressed in
terms of the following task: evaluate the product $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{B}$, where
$\mathsf{A}$ is a structured $n \times n$ matrix of displacement rank $\alpha$,
and $\mathsf{B}$ is an arbitrary $n\times\alpha$ matrix. Given $\mathsf{B}$ and
a so-called &quot;generator&quot; of $\mathsf{A}$, this product is classically computed
with a cost ranging from $O(\alpha^2 \mathscr{M}(n))$ to $O(\alpha^2
\mathscr{M}(n)\log(n))$ arithmetic operations, depending on the type of
structure of $\mathsf{A}$; here, $\mathscr{M}$ is a cost function for
polynomial multiplication. In this paper, we first generalize classical
displacement operators, based on block diagonal matrices with companion
diagonal blocks, and then design fast algorithms to perform the task above for
this extended class of structured matrices. The cost of these algorithms ranges
from $O(\alpha^{\omega-1} \mathscr{M}(n))$ to $O(\alpha^{\omega-1}
\mathscr{M}(n)\log(n))$, with $\omega$ such that two $n \times n$ matrices over
a field can be multiplied using $O(n^\omega)$ field operations. By combining
this result with classical randomized regularization techniques, we obtain
faster Las Vegas algorithms for structured inversion and linear system solving.

 <dc:description>  What characteristics distinguish liars from truth-tellers? Recent research
has explored &quot;when&quot; and &quot;why&quot; people lie. Yet little is known about &quot;who&quot; lies.
Previous studies have led to mixed results about the effect of gender on
deception, and they have largely neglected the role of other characteristics,
such as age and level of education. To shed light on these questions, here I
report a meta-analysis of 6,508 distinct observations, collected in 50
Deception Game treatments, by 6 research groups. I find that: (i) males are
more likely than females to tell black lies; (ii) males are more likely than
females to tell altruistic white lies; (iii) males are (marginally) more likely
than females to tell Pareto white lies; (iv) age has no effect on the decision
to tell black lies; (v) age has no effect on the decision to tell altruistic
white lies; (vi) age has no effect on the decision to tell Pareto white lies;
(vii) educated subjects are more likely than non-educated subjects to tell
black lies; (viii) the level of education has no effect on the decision to tell
altruistic white lies; (ix) educated subjects are more likely than non-educated
subjects to tell Pareto white lies.

 <dc:description>  The number of events recorded for operational processes is growing every
year. This applies to all domains: from health care and e-government to
production and maintenance. Event data are a valuable source of information for
organizations that need to meet requirements related to compliance, efficiency,
and customer service. Process mining helps to turn these data into real value:
by discovering the real processes, by automatically identifying bottlenecks, by
analyzing deviations and sources of non-compliance, by revealing the actual
behavior of people, etc. Process mining is very different from conventional
data mining and machine learning techniques. ProM is a powerful open-source
process mining tool supporting hundreds of analysis techniques. However, ProM
does not support analysis based on scientific workflows. RapidProM, an
extension of RapidMiner based on ProM, combines the best of both worlds.
Complex process mining workflows can be modeled and executed easily and
subsequently reused for other data sets. Moreover, using RapidProM, one can
benefit from combinations of process mining with other types of analysis
available through the RapidMiner marketplace.

 <dc:title>Opinion-Based Centrality in Multiplex Networks: A Convex Optimization

 <dc:description>  Most people simultaneously belong to several distinct social networks, in
which their relations can be different. They have opinions about certain
topics, which they share and spread on these networks, and are influenced by
the opinions of other persons. In this paper, we build upon this observation to
propose a new nodal centrality measure for multiplex networks. Our measure,
called Opinion centrality, is based on a stochastic model representing opinion
propagation dynamics in such a network. We formulate an optimization problem
consisting in maximizing the opinion of the whole network when controlling an
external influence able to affect each node individually. We find a
mathematical closed form of this problem, and use its solution to derive our
centrality measure. According to the opinion centrality, the more a node is
worth investing external influence, and the more it is central. We perform an
empirical study of the proposed centrality over a toy network, as well as a
collection of real-world networks. Our measure is generally negatively
correlated with existing multiplex centrality measures, and highlights
different types of nodes, accordingly to its definition.

 <dc:description>  The application and analysis of the Cut-and-Choose technique in protocols
secure against quantum adversaries is not a straightforward transposition of
the classical case, among other reasons due to the difficulty to use rewinding
in the quantum realm. We introduce a Quantum Computation Cut-and-Choose (QC-CC)
technique which is a generalisation of the classical Cut-and-Choose in order to
build quantum protocols secure against quantum covert adversaries. Such
adversaries can deviate arbitrarily provided that their deviation is not
detected. As an application of the QC-CC we give a protocol for securely
performing two-party quantum computation with classical input/output. As basis
we use secure delegated quantum computing (Broadbent et al 2009), and in
particular the garbled quantum computation of (Kashefi et al 2016) that is
secure against only a weak specious adversaries, defined in (Dupuis et al
2010). A unique property of these protocols is the separation between classical
and quantum communications and the asymmetry between client and server, which
enables us to sidestep the quantum rewinding issues. This opens the prospect of
using the QC-CC to other quantum protocols with this separation. In our proof
of security we adapt and use (at different parts) two quantum rewinding
techniques, namely Watrous' oblivious q-rewinding (Watrous 2009) and Unruh's
special q-rewinding (Unruh 2012). Our protocol achieves the same functionality
as in previous works (e.g. Dupuis et al 2012), however using the QC-CC
technique on the protocol from (Kashefi et al 2016) leads to the following key
improvements: (i) only one-way offline quantum communication is necessary ,
(ii) only one party (server) needs to have involved quantum technological
abilities, (iii) only minimal extra cryptographic primitives are required,
namely one oblivious transfer for each input bit and quantum-safe commitments.

to discover numbers that are smooth, typically performed by sieving a
polynomial sequence. On a von Neumann architecture, sieving has log-log
amortized time complexity to check each value for smoothness. This work
presents a neuromorphic sieve that achieves a constant time check for
smoothness by exploiting two characteristic properties of neuromorphic
architectures: constant time synaptic integration and massively parallel
computation. The approach is validated by modifying msieve, one of the fastest
publicly available integer factorization implementations, to use the IBM
Neurosynaptic System (NS1e) as a coprocessor for the sieving stage.

 <dc:title>Coping with Construals in Broad-Coverage Semantic Annotation of

 <dc:description>  We consider the semantics of prepositions, revisiting a broad-coverage
annotation scheme used for annotating all 4,250 preposition tokens in a 55,000
word corpus of English. Attempts to apply the scheme to adpositions and case
markers in other languages, as well as some problematic cases in English, have
led us to reconsider the assumption that a preposition's lexical contribution
is equivalent to the role/relation that it mediates. Our proposal is to embrace
the potential for construal in adposition use, expressing such phenomena
directly at the token level to manage complexity and avoid sense proliferation.
We suggest a framework to represent both the scene role and the adposition's
lexical function so they can be annotated at scale---supporting automatic,
statistical processing of domain-general language---and sketch how this
representation would inform a constructional analysis.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary algorithms have recently been used to create a wide range of
artistic work. In this paper, we propose a new approach for the composition of
new images from existing ones, that retain some salient features of the
original images. We introduce evolutionary algorithms that create new images
based on a fitness function that incorporates feature covariance matrices
associated with different parts of the images. This approach is very flexible
in that it can work with a wide range of features and enables targeting
specific regions in the images. For the creation of the new images, we propose
a population-based evolutionary algorithm with mutation and crossover operators
based on random walks. Our experimental results reveal a spectrum of
aesthetically pleasing images that can be obtained with the aid of our
evolutionary process.

 <dc:description>  Ponzi schemes are financial frauds where, under the promise of high profits,
users put their money, recovering their investment and interests only if enough
users after them continue to invest money. Originated in the offline world 150
years ago, Ponzi schemes have since then migrated to the digital world,
approaching first on the Web, and more recently hanging over cryptocurrencies
like Bitcoin. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum have provided a new
opportunity for scammers, who have now the possibility of creating
&quot;trustworthy&quot; frauds that still make users lose money, but at least are
guaranteed to execute &quot;correctly&quot;. We present a comprehensive survey of Ponzi
schemes on Ethereum, analysing their behaviour and their impact from various
viewpoints. Perhaps surprisingly, we identify a remarkably high number of Ponzi
schemes, despite the hosting platform has been operating for less than two
years.

 <dc:description>  Software product lines have recently been presented as one of the best
promising improvements for the efficient software development. Different
research works contribute supportive parameters and negotiations regarding the
problems of producing a perfect software scheme. Traditional approaches or
recycling software are not effective to solve the problems concerning software
competence. Since fast developments with software engineering in the past few
years, studies show that some approaches are getting extensive attention in
both industries and universities. This method is categorized as the software
product line improvement; that supports reusing of software in big
organizations. Different industries are adopting product lines to enhance
efficiency and reduce operational expenses by way of emerging product
developments. This research paper is formed to offer in-depth study regarding
the software engineering issues such as complexity, conformity, changeability,
invisibility, time constraints, budget constraints, and security. We have
conducted various research surveys by visiting different professional software
development organizations and took feedback from the professional software
engineers to analyze the real-time problems that they are facing during the
development process of software systems. Survey results proved that complexity
is a most occurring issue that most software developers face while developing
software applications. Moreover, invisibility is the problem that rarely
happens according to the survey.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the performance of initial access beamforming schemes
in the cases with large but finite number of transmit antennas and users.
Particularly, we develop an efficient beamforming scheme using genetic
algorithms. Moreover, taking the millimeter wave communication characteristics
and different metrics into account, we investigate the effect of various
parameters such as number of antennas/receivers, beamforming resolution as well
as hardware impairments on the system performance. As shown, our proposed
algorithm is generic in the sense that it can be effectively applied with
different channel models, metrics and beamforming methods. Also, our results
indicate that the proposed scheme can reach (almost) the same end-to-end
throughput as the exhaustive search-based optimal approach with considerably
less implementation complexity.

 <dc:description>  Precise patient positioning is fundamental to successful removal of malignant
tumors during treatment of head and neck cancers. Errors in patient positioning
have been known to damage critical organs and cause complications. To better
address issues of patient positioning and motion, we introduce a 3-DOF
neuro-adaptive soft-robot, called Soft-NeuroAdapt to correct deviations along 3
axes. The robot consists of inflatable air bladders that adaptively control
head deviations from target while ensuring patient safety and comfort. The
adaptive-neuro controller combines a state feedback component, a feedforward
regulator, and a neural network that ensures correct adaptation. States are
measured by a 3D vision system. We validate Soft-NeuroAdapt on a 3D printed
head-and-neck dummy, and demonstrate that the controller provides adaptive
actuation that compensates for intrafractional deviations in patient
positioning.

 <dc:description>  Mobile games are extremely popular and engage millions of people every day.
Even if they are often quite simple, their development features a high degree
of difficulty and requires close attention to both achieve a high satisfaction
from users and grant a return to the developers. In this paper we propose a
model that analyzes users' playing session time in order to evaluate and
maximize the longevity of games, even during the first phases of their
development.

 <dc:description>  Exemplar models are a popular class of models used to describe language
change. Here we study how limiting the memory capacity of an individual in
these models affects the system's behaviour. In particular we demonstrate the
effect this change has on the extinction of categories. Previous work in
exemplar dynamics has not addressed this question. In order to investigate
this, we will inspect a simplified exemplar model. We will prove for the
simplified model that all the sound categories but one will always become
extinct, whether memory storage is limited or not. However, computer
simulations show that changing the number of stored memories alters how fast
categories become extinct.

 <dc:description>  Mining for Bitcoins is a high-risk high-reward activity. Miners, seeking to
reduce their variance and earn steadier rewards, collaborate in pooling
strategies where they jointly mine for Bitcoins. Whenever some pool participant
is successful, the earned rewards are appropriately split among all pool
participants. Currently a dozen of different pooling strategies (i.e., methods
for distributing the rewards) are in use for Bitcoin mining.
  We here propose a formal model of utility and social welfare for Bitcoin
mining (and analogous mining systems) based on the theory of discounted
expected utility, and next study pooling strategies that maximize the social
welfare of miners. Our main result shows that one of the pooling strategies
actually employed in practice--the so-called geometric pay pool--achieves the
optimal steady-state utility for miners when its parameters are set
appropriately.
  Our results apply not only to Bitcoin mining pools, but any other form of
pooled mining or crowdsourcing computations where the participants engage in
repeated random trials towards a common goal, and where &quot;partial&quot; solutions can
be efficiently verified.

 <dc:description>  Object detection and recognition is an important task in many computer vision
applications. In this paper an Android application was developed using Eclipse
IDE and OpenCV3 Library. This application is able to detect objects in an image
that is loaded from the mobile gallery, based on its color, shape, or local
features. The image is processed in the HSV color domain for better color
detection. Circular shapes are detected using Circular Hough Transform and
other shapes are detected using Douglas-Peucker algorithm. BRISK (binary robust
invariant scalable keypoints) local features were applied in the developed
Android application for matching an object image in another scene image. The
steps of the proposed detection algorithms are described, and the interfaces of
the application are illustrated. The application is ported and tested on Galaxy
S3, S6, and Note1 Smartphones. Based on the experimental results, the
application is capable of detecting eleven different colors, detecting two
dimensional geometrical shapes including circles, rectangles, triangles, and
squares, and correctly match local features of object and scene images for
different conditions. The application could be used as a standalone
application, or as a part of another application such as Robot systems, traffic
systems, e-learning applications, information retrieval and many others.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $H=(V,E)$ be an edge-weighted hypergraph of rank $r$. Kogan and
Krauthgamer extended Bencz\'{u}r and Karger's random sampling scheme for cut
sparsification from graphs to hypergraphs. The sampling requires an algorithm
for computing the approximate strengths of edges. In this note we extend the
algorithm for graphs to hypergraphs and describe a near-linear time algorithm
to compute approximate strengths of edges; we build on a sparsification result
for hypergraphs from our recent work. Combined with prior results we obtain
faster algorithms for finding $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate mincuts when the rank
of the hypergraph is small.

 <dc:description>  Brain-inspired learning models attempt to mimic the cortical architecture and
computations performed in the neurons and synapses constituting the human brain
to achieve its efficiency in cognitive tasks. In this work, we present
convolutional spike timing dependent plasticity based feature learning with
biologically plausible leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons in Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs). We use shared weight kernels that are trained to encode
representative features underlying the input patterns thereby improving the
sparsity as well as the robustness of the learning model. We demonstrate that
the proposed unsupervised learning methodology learns several visual categories
for object recognition with fewer number of examples and outperforms
traditional fully-connected SNN architectures while yielding competitive
accuracy. Additionally, we observe that the learning model performs out-of-set
generalization further making the proposed biologically plausible framework a
viable and efficient architecture for future neuromorphic applications.

 <dc:description>  We present a probabilistic approach to generate a small, query-able summary
of a dataset for interactive data exploration. Departing from traditional
summarization techniques, we use the Principle of Maximum Entropy to generate a
probabilistic representation of the data that can be used to give approximate
query answers. We develop the theoretical framework and formulation of our
probabilistic representation and show how to use it to answer queries. We then
present solving techniques and give three critical optimizations to improve
preprocessing time and query accuracy. Lastly, we experimentally evaluate our
work using a 5 GB dataset of flights within the United States and a 210 GB
dataset from an astronomy particle simulation. While our current work only
supports linear queries, we show that our technique can successfully answer
queries faster than sampling while introducing, on average, no more error than
sampling and can better distinguish between rare and nonexistent values.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world systems are characterized by stochastic dynamical rules where
a complex network of dependencies among individual elements probabilistically
determines their state. Even with full knowledge of the network structure and
of the stochastic rules of the dynamical process, the ability to predict system
configurations is generally characterized by large uncertainty. Sampling a
fraction of the nodes and deterministically observing their state may help to
reduce the uncertainty about the unobserved nodes. However, choosing these
points of observation with the goal of maximizing predictive power is a highly
nontrivial task, depending on the nature of the stochastic process and on the
structure of the underlying network. Here, we introduce a computationally
efficient algorithm to determine quasi-optimal solutions for arbitrary
stochastic processes defined on generic sparse topologies. We show that the
method is effective for various processes on different substrates. We further
show how the method can be fruitfully used to identify the best nodes to label
in semi-supervised probabilistic classification algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The time to converge to the steady state of a finite Markov chain can be
greatly reduced by a lifting operation, which creates a new Markov chain on an
expanded state space. For a class of quadratic objectives, we show an analogous
behavior where a distributed ADMM algorithm can be seen as a lifting of
Gradient Descent algorithm. This provides a deep insight for its faster
convergence rate under optimal parameter tuning. We conjecture that this gain
is always present, as opposed to the lifting of a Markov chain which sometimes
only provides a marginal speedup.

 <dc:description>  Wikidata, like Wikipedia, is a knowledge base that anyone can edit. This open
collaboration model is powerful in that it reduces barriers to participation
and allows a large number of people to contribute. However, it exposes the
knowledge base to the risk of vandalism and low-quality contributions. In this
work, we build on past work detecting vandalism in Wikipedia to detect
vandalism in Wikidata. This work is novel in that identifying damaging changes
in a structured knowledge-base requires substantially different feature
engineering work than in a text-based wiki like Wikipedia. We also discuss the
utility of these classifiers for reducing the overall workload of vandalism
patrollers in Wikidata. We describe a machine classification strategy that is
able to catch 89% of vandalism while reducing patrollers' workload by 98%, by
drawing lightly from contextual features of an edit and heavily from the
characteristics of the user making the edit.

 <dc:description>  Feature extraction and dimension reduction for networks is critical in a wide
variety of domains. Efficiently and accurately learning features for multiple
graphs has important applications in statistical inference on graphs. We
propose a method to jointly embed multiple undirected graphs. Given a set of
graphs, the joint embedding method identifies a linear subspace spanned by rank
one symmetric matrices and projects adjacency matrices of graphs into this
subspace. The projection coefficients can be treated as features of the graphs.
We also propose a random graph model which generalizes classical random graph
model and can be used to model multiple graphs. We show through theory and
numerical experiments that under the model, the joint embedding method produces
estimates of parameters with small errors. Via simulation experiments, we
demonstrate that the joint embedding method produces features which lead to
state of the art performance in classifying graphs. Applying the joint
embedding method to human brain graphs, we find it extract interpretable
features that can be used to predict individual composite creativity index.

 <dc:description>  We explore the use of Evolution Strategies (ES), a class of black box
optimization algorithms, as an alternative to popular MDP-based RL techniques
such as Q-learning and Policy Gradients. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show
that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the
number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on
common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars,
making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us
to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on
most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several
advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to
action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and
does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques are applied to the problem of
determining the depth from a single camera image (monocular depth). Fully
connected CNN topologies preserve all details of the input images, enabling the
detection of fine details, but miss larger features; networks that employ 2x2,
4x4 and 8x8 max-pooling operators can determine larger features at the expense
of finer details. After designing, training and optimising a set of topologies,
these networks may be combined into a single network topology using graph
optimization techniques. This &quot;Semi Parallel Deep Neural Network (SPDNN)&quot;
eliminates duplicate common network layers, reducing network size and
computational effort significantly, and can be further optimized by retraining
to achieve an improved level of convergence over the individual topologies. In
this study, four models are trained and have been evaluated at 2 stages on the
KITTI dataset. The ground truth images in the first part of the experiment come
from the benchmark, and for the second part, the ground truth images are the
depth map results from applying a state-of-the-art stereo matching method. The
results of this evaluation demonstrate that using post-processing techniques to
refine the target of the network increases the accuracy of depth estimation on
individual mono images. The second evaluation shows that using segmentation
data as the input can improve the depth estimation results to a point where
performance is comparable with stereo depth estimation. The computational time
is also discussed in this study.

 <dc:description>  It is well-known that any admissible unidirectional heuristic search
algorithm must expand all states whose $f$-value is smaller than the optimal
solution cost when using a consistent heuristic. Such states are called &quot;surely
expanded&quot; (s.e.). A recent study characterized s.e. pairs of states for
bidirectional search with consistent heuristics: if a pair of states is s.e.
then at least one of the two states must be expanded. This paper derives a
lower bound, VC, on the minimum number of expansions required to cover all s.e.
pairs, and present a new admissible front-to-end bidirectional heuristic search
algorithm, Near-Optimal Bidirectional Search (NBS), that is guaranteed to do no
more than 2VC expansions. We further prove that no admissible front-to-end
algorithm has a worst case better than 2VC. Experimental results show that NBS
competes with or outperforms existing bidirectional search algorithms, and
often outperforms A* as well.

predict accurately ahead of time, whether a customer will churn in the
foreseeable future is an extremely powerful tool for any marketing team. The
paper describes in depth the application of Deep Learning in the problem of
churn prediction. Using abstract feature vectors, that can generated on any
subscription based company's user event logs, the paper proves that through the
use of the intrinsic property of Deep Neural Networks (learning secondary
features in an unsupervised manner), the complete pipeline can be applied to
any subscription based company with extremely good churn predictive
performance. Furthermore the research documented in the paper was performed for
Framed Data (a company that sells churn prediction as a service for other
companies) in conjunction with the Data Science Institute at Lancaster
University, UK. This paper is the intellectual property of Framed Data.

 <dc:description>  Image matting is a fundamental computer vision problem and has many
applications. Previous algorithms have poor performance when an image has
similar foreground and background colors or complicated textures. The main
reasons are prior methods 1) only use low-level features and 2) lack high-level
context. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based algorithm that
can tackle both these problems. Our deep model has two parts. The first part is
a deep convolutional encoder-decoder network that takes an image and the
corresponding trimap as inputs and predict the alpha matte of the image. The
second part is a small convolutional network that refines the alpha matte
predictions of the first network to have more accurate alpha values and sharper
edges. In addition, we also create a large-scale image matting dataset
including 49300 training images and 1000 testing images. We evaluate our
algorithm on the image matting benchmark, our testing set, and a wide variety
of real images. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our
algorithm over previous methods.

 <dc:description>  A quantum board game is a multi-round protocol between a single quantum
player against the quantum board. Molina and Watrous discovered quantum
hedging. They gave an example for perfect quantum hedging: a board game with
winning probability &lt; 1, such that the player can win with certainty at least
1-out-of-2 quantum board games played in parallel. Here we show that perfect
quantum hedging occurs in a cryptographic protocol - quantum coin flipping. For
this reason, when cryptographic protocols are composed, hedging may introduce
serious challenges into their analysis.
  We also show that hedging cannot occur when playing two-outcome board games
in sequence. This is done by showing a formula for the value of sequential
two-outcome board games, which depends only on the optimal value of a single
board game; this formula applies in a more general setting, in which hedging is
only a special case.

 <dc:description>  The prediction made by L. O. Chua 45+ years ago (see: IEEE Trans. Circuit
Theory (1971) 18:507-519 and also: Proc. IEEE (2012) 100:1920-1927) about the
existence of a passive circuit element (called memristor) that links the charge
and flux variables has been confirmed by the HP lab group in its report (see:
Nature (2008) 453:80-83) on a successful construction of such an element. This
sparked an enormous interest in mem-elements, analysis of their unusual
dynamical properties (i.e. pinched hysteresis loops, memory effects, etc.) and
construction of their emulators. Such topics are also of interest in mechanical
engineering where memdampers (or memory dampers) play the role equivalent to
memristors in electronic circuits. In this paper we discuss certain properties
of the oscillatory memristive circuits, including those with mixed-mode
oscillations. Mathematical models of such circuits can be linked to the
Newton's law $\phi''\!-\!F(t,\phi,\phi')/m=0$, with $\phi$ denoting the flux or
charge variables, $m$ is a positive constant and the nonlinear non-autonomous
function $F(t,\phi,\phi')$ contains memory terms. This leads further to scalar
fourth-order ODEs called the jounce Newtonian equations. The jounce equations
are used to construct the $RC$+op-amp simulation circuits in SPICE. Also, the
linear parallel $G$-$C$ and series $R$-$L$ circuits with sinusoidal inputs are
derived to match the $rms$ values of the memristive periodic circuits.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) applications typically collect and analyse personal
data that can be used to derive sensitive information about individuals.
However, thus far, privacy concerns have not been explicitly considered in
software engineering processes when designing IoT applications. In this paper,
we explore how a Privacy-by-Design (PbD) framework, formulated as a set of
guidelines, can help software engineers to design privacy-aware IoT
applications. We studied the utility of our proposed PbD framework by studying
how software engineers use it to design IoT applications. This user study
highlighted the benefits of providing a framework that helps software engineers
explicitly consider privacy for IoT applications and also surfaced a number of
challenges associated with our approach.

 <dc:title>Antagonism also Flows through Retweets: The Impact of Out-of-Context

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the implications of the commonplace assumption that
most social media studies make with respect to the nature of message shares
(such as retweets) as a predominantly positive interaction. By analyzing two
large longitudinal Brazilian Twitter datasets containing 5 years of
conversations on two polarizing topics - Politics and Sports - we empirically
demonstrate that groups holding antagonistic views can actually retweet each
other more often than they retweet other groups. We show that assuming retweets
as endorsement interactions can lead to misleading conclusions with respect to
the level of antagonism among social communities, and that this apparent
paradox is explained in part by the use of retweets to quote the original
content creator out of the message's original temporal context, for humor and
criticism purposes. As a consequence, messages diffused on online media can
have their polarity reversed over time, what poses challenges for social and
computer scientists aiming to classify and track opinion groups on online
media. On the other hand, we found that the time users take to retweet a
message after it has been originally posted can be a useful signal to infer
antagonism in social platforms, and that surges of out-of-context retweets
correlate with sentiment drifts triggered by real-world events. We also discuss
how such evidences can be embedded in sentiment analysis models.

 <dc:description>  Developers use Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) websites to exchange knowledge and
expertise. Stack Overflow is a popular Q&amp;A website where developers discuss
coding problems and share code examples. Although all Stack Overflow posts are
free to access, code examples on Stack Overflow are governed by the Creative
Commons Attribute-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license that developers should obey
when reusing code from Stack Overflow or posting code to Stack Overflow. In
this paper, we conduct a case study with 399 Android apps, to investigate
whether developers respect license terms when reusing code from Stack Overflow
posts (and the other way around). We found 232 code snippets in 62 Android apps
from our dataset that were potentially reused from Stack Overflow, and 1,226
Stack Overflow posts containing code examples that are clones of code released
in 68 Android apps, suggesting that developers may have copied the code of
these apps to answer Stack Overflow questions. We investigated the licenses of
these pieces of code and observed 1,279 cases of potential license violations
(related to code posting to Stack overflow or code reuse from Stack overflow).
This paper aims to raise the awareness of the software engineering community
about potential unethical code reuse activities taking place on Q&amp;A websites
like Stack Overflow.

 <dc:description>  The core number of a vertex is a basic index depicting cohesiveness of a
graph, and has been widely used in large-scale graph analytics. In this paper,
we study the update of core numbers of vertices in dynamic graphs with edge
insertions/deletions, which is known as the core maintenance problem. Different
from previous approaches that just focus on the case of single-edge
insertion/deletion and sequentially handle the edges when multiple edges are
inserted/deleted, we investigate the parallelism in the core maintenance
procedure. Specifically, we show that if the inserted/deleted edges constitute
a matching, the core number update with respect to each inserted/deleted edge
can be handled in parallel. Based on this key observation, we propose parallel
algorithms for core maintenance in both cases of edge insertions and deletions.
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficiency, stability,
parallelism and scalability of our algorithms on different types of real-world
and synthetic graphs. Comparing with sequential approaches, our algorithms can
improve the core maintenance efficiency significantly.

 <dc:description>  Grid infrastructures that have provided wide integrated use of resources are
becoming the de-facto computing platform for solving large-scale problems in
science, engineering and commerce. In this evolution, desktop grid technologies
allow the grid communities to exploit the idle cycles of pervasive desktop PC
systems to increase the available computing power. In this paper we present
DotGrid, a cross-platform grid software. DotGrid is the first comprehensive
desktop grid software utilising Microsoft's .NET Framework in Windows-based
environments and MONO .NET in Unix-class operating systems to operate. Using
DotGrid services and APIs, grid desktop middleware and applications can be
implemented conveniently. We evaluated our DotGrid's performance by
implementing a set of grid-based applications.

 <dc:description>  DotGrid platform is a Grid infrastructure integrated with a set of open and
standard protocols recently implemented on the top of Microsoft .NET in Windows
and MONO .NET in UNIX/Linux. DotGrid infrastructure along with its proposed
protocols provides a right and solid approach to targeting other platforms,
e.g., the native C/C++ runtime. In this paper, we propose a new file transfer
protocol called DotDFS as a high-throughput distributed file transfer component
for DotGrid. DotDFS introduces some open binary protocols for efficient file
transfers on current Grid infrastructures. DotDFS protocol also provides
mechanisms for multiple file streams to gain high-throughput file transfer
similar to GridFTP protocol, but by proposing and implementing a new parallel
TCP connection-oriented paradigm. In our LAN tests, we have achieved better
results than Globus GridFTP implementation particularly in multiple TCP streams
and directory tree transfers. Our LAN experiences in memory-to-memory tests
show that DotDFS accesses to the 94% bottleneck bandwidth while GridFTP is
accessing 91%. In LAN disk-to-disk tests, comparing DotDFS protocol with
GridFTP protocol unveils a set of interesting and technical problems in GridFTP
for both the nature of the protocol and its implementation by Globus. In the
WAN experimental studies, we propose a new idea for analytical modeling of file
transfer protocols like DotDFS inspired by sampling, experimentation and
mathematical interpolation approaches. The cross-platform and open
standard-based features of DotDFS provide a substantial framework for unifying
data access and resource sharing in real heterogeneous Grid environments.

 <dc:description>  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has shown remarkable progress over the past
few years with production systems now being deployed to end-users. One major
drawback of current architectures is that they are expensive to train,
typically requiring days to weeks of GPU time to converge. This makes
exhaustive hyperparameter search, as is commonly done with other neural network
architectures, prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present the first
large-scale analysis of NMT architecture hyperparameters. We report empirical
results and variance numbers for several hundred experimental runs,
corresponding to over 250,000 GPU hours on the standard WMT English to German
translation task. Our experiments lead to novel insights and practical advice
for building and extending NMT architectures. As part of this contribution, we
release an open-source NMT framework that enables researchers to easily
experiment with novel techniques and reproduce state of the art results.

 <dc:description>  IEEE 802.11 has evolved from 802.11a/b/g/n to 802.11ac to meet rapidly
increasing data rate requirements in WLANs. One important technique adopted in
802.11ac is the channel bonding (CB) scheme that combines multiple 20MHz
channels for a single transmission in 5GHz band. In order to effectively access
channel after a series of contention operations, 802.11ac specifies two
different CB operations: Dynamic Channel Bonding (DCB) and Static Channel
Bonding (SCB). This paper proposes an optimal channel allocation algorithm to
achieve maximal throughputs in DCB WLANs. Specifically, we first adopt a
continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to analyze the equilibrium
throughputs. Based on the throughput analysis, we then construct an integer
nonlinear programming (INLP) model with the target of maximizing system
throughputs. By solving the INLP model, we then propose an optimal channel
allocation algorithm based on the Branch-and-Bound Method (BBM). It turns out
that the maximal throughput performance can be achieved under the channel
allocation scheme with the least overlapped channels among WLANs. Simulations
show that the proposed channel allocation algorithm can achieve the maximal
system throughput under various network settings. Our analysis on the optimal
channel allocation schemes brings new insights into the design and optimization
of future WLANs, especially for those adopting channel bonding technique.

 <dc:description>  In Stackelberg security games, a defender seeks to randomly allocate limited
security resources to protect critical targets from an attack. In this paper,
we study a fundamental, yet underexplored, phenomenon in security games, which
we term the \emph{Curse of Correlation} (CoC). Specifically, we observe that
there are inevitable correlations among the protection status of different
targets. Such correlation is a crucial concern, especially in
\emph{spatio-temporal} domains like conservation area patrolling, where
attackers can surveil patrollers at certain areas and then infer their
patrolling routes using such correlations. To mitigate this issue, we propose
to design entropy-maximizing defending strategies for spatio-temporal security
games, which frequently suffer from CoC. We prove that the problem is \#P-hard
in general. However, it admits efficient algorithms in well-motivated special
settings. Our experiments show significant advantages of max-entropy algorithms
over previous algorithms. A scalable implementation of our algorithm is
currently under pre-deployment testing for integration into FAMS software to
improve the scheduling of US federal air marshals.

model. Previous work on axiom-aware planners focused solely on state- space
search planners. We propose axiom-aware planners based on answer set
programming and integer programming. We evaluate them on PDDL domains with
axioms and show that they can exploit additional expressivity of axioms.

 <dc:description>  Motion ability is one of the most important human properties, including gait
as a basis of human transitional movement. Gait, as a biometric for recognizing
human identities, can be non-intrusively captured signals using wearable or
portable smart devices. In this study gait patterns is collected using a
wireless platform of two sensors located at chest and right ankle of the
subjects. Then the raw data has undergone some preprocessing methods and
segmented into 5 seconds windows. Some time and frequency domain features is
extracted and the performance evaluated by 5 different classifiers. Decision
Tree (with all features) and K-Nearest Neighbors (with 10 selected features)
classifiers reached 99.4% and 100% respectively.

 <dc:description>  Text similarity detection aims at measuring the degree of similarity between
a pair of texts. Corpora available for text similarity detection are designed
to evaluate the algorithms to assess the paraphrase level among documents. In
this paper we present a textual German corpus for similarity detection. The
purpose of this corpus is to automatically assess the similarity between a pair
of texts and to evaluate different similarity measures, both for whole
documents or for individual sentences. Therefore we have calculated several
simple measures on our corpus based on a library of similarity functions.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning applications are increasingly deployed not only to serve
predictions using static models, but also as tightly-integrated components of
feedback loops involving dynamic, real-time decision making. These applications
pose a new set of requirements, none of which are difficult to achieve in
isolation, but the combination of which creates a challenge for existing
distributed execution frameworks: computation with millisecond latency at high
throughput, adaptive construction of arbitrary task graphs, and execution of
heterogeneous kernels over diverse sets of resources. We assert that a new
distributed execution framework is needed for such ML applications and propose
a candidate approach with a proof-of-concept architecture that achieves a 63x
performance improvement over a state-of-the-art execution framework for a
representative application.

 <dc:description>  Tropical diseases like \textit{Chikungunya} and \textit{Zika} have come to
prominence in recent years as the cause of serious, long-lasting,
population-wide health problems. In large countries like Brasil, traditional
disease prevention programs led by health authorities have not been
particularly effective. We explore the hypothesis that monitoring and analysis
of social media content streams may effectively complement such efforts.
Specifically, we aim to identify selected members of the public who are likely
to be sensitive to virus combat initiatives that are organised in local
communities. Focusing on Twitter and on the topic of Zika, our approach
involves (i) training a classifier to select topic-relevant tweets from the
Twitter feed, and (ii) discovering the top users who are actively posting
relevant content about the topic. We may then recommend these users as the
prime candidates for direct engagement within their community. In this short
paper we describe our analytical approach and prototype architecture, discuss
the challenges of dealing with noisy and sparse signal, and present encouraging
preliminary results.

 <dc:description>  Multiscale optimization is an attractive research field recently. For the
most of optimization tools, design parameters should be updated during a close
loop. Therefore, a simple Python code is programmed to obtain effective
properties of Representative Volume Element (RVE) under Periodic Boundary
Conditions (PBCs). It can compute the mechanical properties of a composite with
a periodic structure, in two or three dimensions. The computation method is
based on the Asymptotic Homogenization Theory (AHT). With simple modifications,
the basic Python code may be extended to the computation of the effective
properties of more complex microstructure. Moreover, the code provides a
convenient platform upon the optimization for the material and geometric
composite design. The user may experiment with various algorithms and tackle a
wide range of problems. To verify the effectiveness and reliability of the
code, a three-dimensional case is employed to illuminate the code. Finally
numerical results obtained by the code agree well with the available
theoretical and experimental results

 <dc:description>  Recently, reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to the logical
game of Go, various Atari games, and even a 3D game, Labyrinth, though it
continues to have problems in sparse reward settings. It is difficult to
explore, but also difficult to exploit, a small number of successes when
learning policy. To solve this issue, the subgoal and option framework have
been proposed. However, discovering subgoals online is too expensive to be used
to learn options in large state spaces. We propose Micro-objective learning
(MOL) to solve this problem. The main idea is to estimate how important a state
is while training and to give an additional reward proportional to its
importance. We evaluated our algorithm in two Atari games: Montezuma's Revenge
and Seaquest. With three experiments to each game, MOL significantly improved
the baseline scores. Especially in Montezuma's Revenge, MOL achieved two times
better results than the previous state-of-the-art model.

 <dc:description>  Fertility choices are linked to the different preferences and constraints of
individuals and couples, and vary importantly by socio-economic status, as well
by cultural and institutional context. The meaning of childbearing and
child-rearing, therefore, differs between individuals and across groups. In
this paper, we combine data from Google Correlate and Google Trends for the
U.S. with ground truth data from the American Community Survey to derive new
insights into fertility and its meaning. First, we show that Google Correlate
can be used to illustrate socio-economic differences on the circumstances
around pregnancy and birth: e.g., searches for &quot;flying while pregnant&quot; are
linked to high income fertility, and &quot;paternity test&quot; are linked to non-marital
fertility. Second, we combine several search queries to build predictive models
of regional variation in fertility, explaining about 75% of the variance.
Third, we explore if aggregated web search data can also be used to model
fertility trends.

 <dc:description>  In our overly-connected world, the automatic recognition of virality - the
quality of an image or video to be rapidly and widely spread in social networks
- is of crucial importance, and has recently awaken the interest of the
computer vision community. Concurrently, recent progress in deep learning
architectures showed that global pooling strategies allow the extraction of
activation maps, which highlight the parts of the image most likely to contain
instances of a certain class. We extend this concept by introducing a pooling
layer that learns the size of the support area to be averaged: the learned
top-N average (LENA) pooling. We hypothesize that the latent concepts (feature
maps) describing virality may require such a rich pooling strategy. We assess
the effectiveness of the LENA layer by appending it on top of a convolutional
siamese architecture and evaluate its performance on the task of predicting and
localizing virality. We report experiments on two publicly available datasets
annotated for virality and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches.

 <dc:description>  3D object detection and pose estimation has been studied extensively in
recent decades for its potential applications in robotics. However, there still
remains challenges when we aim at detecting multiple objects while retaining
low false positive rate in cluttered environments. This paper proposes a robust
3D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on RGB-D images, which
can detect multiple objects simultaneously while reducing false positives.
Detection begins with template matching and yields a set of template matches. A
clustering algorithm then groups templates of similar spatial location and
produces multiple-object hypotheses. A scoring function evaluates the
hypotheses using their associated templates and non-maximum suppression is
adopted to remove duplicate results based on the scores. Finally, a combination
of point cloud processing algorithms are used to compute objects' 3D poses.
Existing object hypotheses are verified by computing the overlap between model
and scene points. Experiments demonstrate that our approach provides
competitive results comparable to the state-of-the-arts and can be applied to
robot random bin-picking.

 <dc:description>  Re-configurable modular robotic (RMR) systems are advantageous for their
reconfigurability and versatility. A new modular robot can be built for a
specific task by using modules as building blocks. However, constructing a
kinematic model for a newly conceived robot requires significant work. Due to
the finite size of module-types, models of all module-types can be built
individually and stored in a database beforehand. With this priori knowledge,
the model construction process can be automated by detecting the modules and
their corresponding interconnections. Previous literature proposed theoretical
frameworks for constructing kinematic models of modular robots, assuming that
such information was known a priori. While well-devised mechanisms and built-in
sensors can be employed to detect these parameters automatically, they
significantly complicate the module design and thus are expensive. In this
paper, we propose a vision-based method to identify kinematic chains and
automatically construct robot models for modular robots. Each module is affixed
with augmented reality (AR) tags that are encoded with unique IDs. An image of
a modular robot is taken and the detected modules are recognized by querying a
database that maintains all module information. The poses of detected modules
are used to compute: (i) the connection between modules and (ii) joint angles
of joint-modules. Finally, the robot serial-link chain is identified and the
kinematic model constructed and visualized. Our experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our approach. While implementation with only our RMR is
shown, our method can be applied to other RMRs where self-identification is not
possible.

 <dc:description>  Although various norms for reciprocity-based cooperation have been suggested
that are evolutionarily stable against invasion from free riders, the process
of alternation of norms and the role of diversified norms remain unclear in the
evolution of cooperation. We clarify the co-evolutionary dynamics of norms and
cooperation in indirect reciprocity and also identify the indispensable norms
for the evolution of cooperation. Inspired by the gene knockout method, a
genetic engineering technique, we developed the norm knockout method and
clarified the norms necessary for the establishment of cooperation. The results
of numerical investigations revealed that the majority of norms gradually
transitioned to tolerant norms after defectors are eliminated by strict norms.
Furthermore, no cooperation emerges when specific norms that are intolerant to
defectors are knocked out.

 <dc:title>Generalized Rao Test for Decentralized Detection of an Uncooperative

 <dc:description>  We tackle distributed detection of a non-cooperative target with a Wireless
Sensor Network (WSN). When the target is present, sensors observe an (unknown)
deterministic signal with attenuation depending on the distance between the
sensor and the (unknown) target positions, embedded in symmetricand unimodal
noise. The Fusion Center (FC) receives quantized sensor observations through
error-prone Binary Symmetric Channels (BSCs) and is in charge of performing a
more-accurate global decision. The resulting problem is a two-sided parameter
testing with nuisance parameters (i.e. the target position) present only under
the alternative hypothesis. After introducing the Generalized Likelihood Ratio
Test (GLRT) for the problem, we develop a novel fusion rule corresponding to a
Generalized Rao (G-Rao) test, based on Davies' framework, to reduce the
computational complexity. Also, a rationale for threshold-optimization is
proposed and confirmed by simulations. Finally, the aforementioned rules are
compared in terms of performance and computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  Despite significant recent advances in the field of head pose estimation and
facial expression recognition, raising the cognitive level when analysing human
activity presents serious challenges to current concepts. Motivated by the need
of generating comprehensible visual representations from different sets of
data, we introduce a system capable of monitoring human activity through head
pose and facial expression changes, utilising an affordable 3D sensing
technology (Microsoft Kinect sensor). An approach build on discriminative
random regression forests was selected in order to rapidly and accurately
estimate head pose changes in unconstrained environment. In order to complete
the secondary process of recognising four universal dominant facial expressions
(happiness, anger, sadness and surprise), emotion recognition via facial
expressions (ERFE) was adopted. After that, a lightweight data exchange format
(JavaScript Object Notation-JSON) is employed, in order to manipulate the data
extracted from the two aforementioned settings. Such mechanism can yield a
platform for objective and effortless assessment of human activity within the
context of serious gaming and human-computer interaction.

 <dc:title>Simple interval observers for linear impulsive systems with applications

 <dc:description>  Sufficient conditions for the design of a simple class of interval observers
for linear impulsive systems subject to minimum and range dwell-time
constraints are obtained and formulated in terms of infinite-dimensional linear
programs. The proposed approach is fully constructive in the sense that
suitable observer gains can be extracted from the solution of the optimization
problems and is flexible enough to be extended to include performance
constraints and parametric uncertainties. In order to be solvable, the
infinite-dimensional linear programs are relaxed using a method based on sum of
squares which is known to be asymptotically exact in the present case. Three
examples are given for illustration: the first one pertains on the interval
observation of an impulsive system under a minimum dwell-time constraint, the
second one is about the interval observation of an aperiodic sampled-data
system and the last one is about the interval observation of a linear switched
system.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposed a new explicit nonlinear dimensionality reduction using
neural networks for image retrieval tasks. We first proposed a Quasi-curvature
Locally Linear Embedding (QLLE) for training set. QLLE guarantees the linear
criterion in neighborhood of each sample. Then, a neural method (NM) is
proposed for out-of-sample problem. Combining QLLE and NM, we provide a
explicit nonlinear dimensionality reduction approach for efficient image
retrieval. The experimental results in three benchmark datasets illustrate that
our method can get better performance than other state-of-the-art out-of-sample
methods.

 <dc:description>  We consider the Travelling Salesman Problem with Vertex Requisitions, where
for each position of the tour at most two possible vertices are given. It is
known that the problem is strongly NP-hard. The proposed algorithm for this
problem has less time complexity compared to the previously known one. In
particular, almost all feasible instances of the problem are solvable in O(n)
time using the new algorithm, where n is the number of vertices. The developed
approach also helps in fast enumeration of a neighborhood in the local search
and yields an integer programming model with O(n) binary variables for the
problem.

 <dc:description>  Impedance-based stability analysis is appealing in the case of Single-Input
Single-Output (SISO) systems. However, in the case of grid-tied voltage source
converter (VSC) systems, dq impedances of source and load (VSC) subsystems are
typically Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems in which case the Generalized
Nyquist Criterion (GNC) is required for analyzing the closed loop stability,
which increases the complexity of the analysis. This paper explores further the
coupling between positive and negative sequence impedances, in particular the
dependency and bindings between them. It shows that the couplings in each
subsystem can be compounded into two non-coupled sequence impedances if the
source and load subsystems are viewed as an integrated system instead of as two
separate subsystems. Therefore, two decoupled SISO systems are obtained which
are defined as Augmented Sequence Impedance Networks (ASIN). The stability
analysis of the closed loop system is performed directly on the ASIN with the
principal of Argument. Both numerical and time domain verifications are
presented.

 <dc:title>Capacity Enhancement with Meta-Multiplexing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ji, Chunlin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Ruopeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multiplexing services as a key communication technique to effectively combine
multiple signals into one signal and transmit over a shared medium.
Multiplexing can increase the channel capacity by requiring more resources on
the transmission medium. For instance, the space-division multiplexing
accomplished through the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme achieves
significant capacity increase by the realized parallel channel, but it requires
expensive hardware resources. Here, we present a novel multiplexing
methodology, named meta-multiplexing, which allows ordinary modulated signals
overlap together to form a set of &quot;artificial&quot; parallel channels, meanwhile, it
only requires similar resources as ordinary modulation schemes. We prove the
capacity law for the meta-multiplexing system and disclose that under broad
conditions, the capacity of a single channel increases linearly with the signal
to noise ratio (SNR), which breaks the conventional logarithmic growth of the
capacity over SNR. Numerous simulation studies verify the capacity law and
demonstrate the high efficiency of meta-multiplexing. Through proof-of-concept
hardware experiments, we tested the proposed method in communication practices
and achieved a spectral efficiency of 81.7 bits/s/Hz over a single channel,
which is significantly higher than the efficiency of any existing communication
system.

 <dc:description>  Smart contracts are full-fledged programs that run on blockchains (e.g.,
Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains). In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, a
cryptographic currency like Bitcoin) is the execution fee compensating the
computing resources of miners for running smart contracts. However, we find
that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and
therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct
the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that
it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we
identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose
and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns
by analyzing smart contracts' bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering
3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5%,
90.1% and 80% contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively.

 <dc:description>  Several papers have achieved time $O(\sqrt n m)$ for cardinality matching,
starting from first principles. This results in a long derivation. We simplify
the task by employing well-known concepts for maximum weight matching. We use
Edmonds' algorithm to derive the structure of shortest augmenting paths. We
extend this to a complete algorithm for maximum cardinality matching in time

 <dc:description>  Quora is one of the most popular community Q&amp;A sites of recent times.
However, many question posts on this Q&amp;A site often do not get answered. In
this paper, we quantify various linguistic activities that discriminates an
answered question from an unanswered one. Our central finding is that the way
users use language while writing the question text can be a very effective
means to characterize answerability. This characterization helps us to predict
early if a question remaining unanswered for a specific time period t will
eventually be answered or not and achieve an accuracy of 76.26% (t = 1 month)
and 68.33% (t = 3 months). Notably, features representing the language use
patterns of the users are most discriminative and alone account for an accuracy
of 74.18%. We also compare our method with some of the similar works (Dror et
al., Yang et al.) achieving a maximum improvement of ~39% in terms of accuracy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the waveform design problem for a single-input
single-output (SISO) radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) system
in frequency-selective channels. First, based on the actual non-linear
current-voltage model of the diode at the energy receiver, we derive a
semi-closed-form expression for the deliverable DC voltage in terms of the
incident RF signal and hence obtain the average harvested power. Next, by
adopting a multisine waveform structure for the transmit signal of the energy
transmitter, we jointly design the multisine signal amplitudes and phases
overall frequency tones according to the channel state information (CSI) to
maximize the deliverable DC voltage or harvested power. Although our formulated
problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we propose two suboptimal
solutions to it, based on the frequency-domain maximal ratio transmission (MRT)
principle and the sequential convex optimization (SCP) technique, respectively.
Using various simulations, the performance gain of our solutions over the
existing waveform designs is shown.

 <dc:description>  A key challenge for automatic hate-speech detection on social media is the
separation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. Lexical
detection methods tend to have low precision because they classify all messages
containing particular terms as hate speech and previous work using supervised
learning has failed to distinguish between the two categories. We used a
crowd-sourced hate speech lexicon to collect tweets containing hate speech
keywords. We use crowd-sourcing to label a sample of these tweets into three
categories: those containing hate speech, only offensive language, and those
with neither. We train a multi-class classifier to distinguish between these
different categories. Close analysis of the predictions and the errors shows
when we can reliably separate hate speech from other offensive language and
when this differentiation is more difficult. We find that racist and homophobic
tweets are more likely to be classified as hate speech but that sexist tweets
are generally classified as offensive. Tweets without explicit hate keywords
are also more difficult to classify.

multi-class transportation networks, which accommodate different types of
vehicles with very different characteristics (e.g., cars and trucks).
Leveraging our earlier work on inverse variational inequalities, we develop a
data-driven approach to estimate the travel latency cost functions. Extensive
numerical experiments using benchmark networks, ranging from moderate-sized to
large-sized, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we observe that information theoretical concepts are valuable
tools for extracting information from images and, in particular, information on
image symmetries. It is shown that the problem of detecting reflectional and
rotational symmetries in a two-dimensional image can be reduced to the problem
of detecting point-symmetry and periodicity in one-dimensional negentropy
functions. Based on these findings a detector of reflectional and rotational
global symmetries in greyscale images is constructed. We discuss the importance
of high precision in symmetry detection in applications arising from quality
control and illustrate how the proposed method satisfies this requirement.
Finally, a superior performance of our method to other existing methods,
demonstrated by the results of a rigorous experimental verification, is an
indication that our approach rooted in information theory is a promising
direction in a development of a robust and widely applicable symmetry detector.

 <dc:description>  Learning graphical models from data is an important problem with wide
applications, ranging from genomics to the social sciences. Nowadays datasets
typically have upwards of thousands---sometimes tens or hundreds of
thousands---of variables and far fewer samples. To meet this challenge, we
develop a new R package called sparsebn for learning the structure of large,
sparse graphical models with a focus on Bayesian networks. While there are many
existing packages for this task within the R ecosystem, this package focuses on
the unique setting of learning large networks from high-dimensional data,
possibly with interventions. As such, the methods provided place a premium on
scalability and consistency in a high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, in the
presence of interventions, the methods implemented here achieve the goal of
learning a causal network from data. The sparsebn package is open-source and
available on CRAN.

 <dc:title>The Accuracy of Confidence Intervals for Field Normalised Indicators</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thelwall, Mike</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When comparing the average citation impact of research groups, universities
and countries, field normalisation reduces the influence of discipline and
time. Confidence intervals for these indicators can help with attempts to infer
whether differences between sets of publications are due to chance factors.
Although both bootstrapping and formulae have been proposed for these, their
accuracy is unknown. In response, this article uses simulated data to
systematically compare the accuracy of confidence limits in the simplest
possible case, a single field and year. The results suggest that the MNLCS
(Mean Normalised Log-transformed Citation Score) confidence interval formula is
conservative for large groups but almost always safe, whereas bootstrap MNLCS
confidence intervals tend to be accurate but can be unsafe for smaller world or
group sample sizes. In contrast, bootstrap MNCS (Mean Normalised Citation
Score) confidence intervals can be very unsafe, although their accuracy
increases with sample sizes.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of constructing bearing rigid networks in
arbitrary dimensions. We first show that the bearing rigidity of a network is a
generic property that is critically determined by the underlying graph of the
network. A new notion termed generic bearing rigidity is defined for graphs. If
the underlying graph of a network is generically bearing rigid, then the
network is bearing rigid for almost all configurations; otherwise, the network
is not bearing rigid for any configuration. As a result, the key to construct
bearing rigid networks is to construct generically bearing rigid graphs. The
main contribution of this paper is to prove that Laman graphs, which can be
generated by the Henneberg construction, are generically bearing rigid in
arbitrary dimensions. As a consequence, if the underlying graph of a network is
Laman, the network is bearing rigid for almost all configurations in arbitrary
dimensions.

 <dc:description>  The contraction method is a procedure that allows to establish non-trivial
relations between Lie algebras and has had succesful applications in both
mathematics and theoretical physics. This work deals with generalizations of
the contraction procedure with a main focus in the so called S-expansion method
as it includes most of the other generalized contractions. Basically, the
S-exansion combines a Lie algebra $\mathcal{G}$ with a finite abelian semigroup
$S$ in order to define new S-expanded algebras. After giving a description of
the main ingredients used in this paper, we present a Java library that
automatizes the S-expansion procedure. With this computational tool we are able
to represent Lie algebras and semigroups, so we can perform S-expansions of Lie
algebras using arbitrary semigroups. We explain how the library methods has
been constructed and how they work; then we give a set of example programs
aimed to solve different problems. They are presented so that any user can
easily modify them to perform his own calculations, without being necessarily
an expert in Java. Finally, some comments about further developements and
possible new applications are made.

 <dc:description>  We study data structures for storing a set of polygonal curves in ${\rm R}^d$
such that, given a query curve, we can efficiently retrieve similar curves from
the set, where similarity is measured using the discrete Fr\'echet distance or
the dynamic time warping distance. To this end we devise the first
locality-sensitive hashing schemes for these distance measures. A major
challenge is posed by the fact that these distance measures internally optimize
the alignment between the curves. We give solutions for different types of
alignments including constrained and unconstrained versions. For unconstrained
alignments, we improve over a result by Indyk from 2002 for short curves. Let
$n$ be the number of input curves and let $m$ be the maximum complexity of a
curve in the input. In the particular case where $m \leq \frac{\alpha}{4d} \log
n$, for some fixed $\alpha&gt;0$, our solutions imply an approximate near-neighbor
data structure for the discrete Fr\'echet distance that uses space in
$O(n^{1+\alpha}\log n)$ and achieves query time in $O(n^{\alpha}\log^2 n)$ and
constant approximation factor. Furthermore, our solutions provide a trade-off
between approximation quality and computational performance: for any parameter
$k \in [m]$, we can give a data structure that uses space in $O(2^{2k}m^{k-1} n
\log n + nm)$, answers queries in $O( 2^{2k} m^{k}\log n)$ time and achieves
approximation factor in $O(m/k)$.

 <dc:description>  We investigate and improve self-supervision as a drop-in replacement for
ImageNet pretraining, focusing on automatic colorization as the proxy task.
Self-supervised training has been shown to be more promising for utilizing
unlabeled data than other, traditional unsupervised learning methods. We build
on this success and evaluate the ability of our self-supervised network in
several contexts. On VOC segmentation and classification tasks, we present
results that are state-of-the-art among methods not using ImageNet labels for
pretraining representations.
  Moreover, we present the first in-depth analysis of self-supervision via
colorization, concluding that formulation of the loss, training details and
network architecture play important roles in its effectiveness. This
investigation is further expanded by revisiting the ImageNet pretraining
paradigm, asking questions such as: How much training data is needed? How many
labels are needed? How much do features change when fine-tuned? We relate these
questions back to self-supervision by showing that colorization provides a
similarly powerful supervisory signal as various flavors of ImageNet
pretraining.

 <dc:description>  This study presents the results of the introduction of Twitter in the
educational process. It examines the relationship of the tool s use with the
participants learning outcome through a series of well-organized activities.
Three studies were conducted in the context of 2 academic courses. The
participation in the Twitter activity was voluntarily for the students. In all
3 studies the students who participated in the process had a higher laboratory
grade than the students who did not participated. Students Conscientiousness
and Openness to experience were related to their activity in one study.
However, no relationship between the students personality traits and their
grade was unveiled. Moreover, the students interventions in the activities are
examined as well as the variation in their attitudes towards social media use
in learning. The implications of the conducted studies are discussed
extensively and a comparison with other related studies is presented.

 <dc:description>  Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains,
such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like
crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well
studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with
stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems
target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on
top of database systems, for example banking, finance applications. Multiple
platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned.
However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different
systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can
be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing
platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly
improve their platforms.
  In this paper, we first describe BlockBench, the first evaluation framework
for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for
different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design
choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BlockBench via simple APIs
and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart
contracts. BlockBench measures overall and component-wise performance in terms
of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use
BlockBench to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private
blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate
that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in
traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in
performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices
at different layers of the software stack.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a low-complexity channel estimation for hybrid
millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, where the number of radio frequency (RF)
chains is much less than the number of antennas equipped at each transceiver.
The proposed mmWave channel estimation algorithm first exploits multiple
frequency tones to estimate the strongest angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) at both base
station (BS) and user sides for the design of analog beamforming matrices. Then
all the users transmit orthogonal pilot symbols to the BS along the directions
of the estimated strongest AoAs in order to estimate the channel. The estimated
channel will be adopted to design the digital zero-forcing (ZF) precoder at the
BS for the multi-user downlink transmission. The proposed channel estimation
algorithm is applicable to both nonsparse and sparse mmWave channel
environments. Furthermore, we derive a tight achievable rate upper bound of the
digital ZF precoding with the proposed channel estimation algorithm scheme. Our
analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme obtains a
considerable achievable rate of fully digital systems, where the number of RF
chains equipped at each transceiver is equal to the number of antennas.
Besides, by taking into account the effect of various types of errors, i.e.,
random phase errors, transceiver analog beamforming errors, and equivalent
channel estimation errors, we derive a closed-form approximation for the
achievable rate of the considered scheme. We illustrate the robustness of the
proposed channel estimation and multi-user downlink precoding scheme against
the system imperfection.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a multi-pose face recognition approach using hybrid face
features descriptors (HFFD). The HFFD is a face descriptor containing of rich
discriminant information that is created by fusing some frequency-based
features extracted using both wavelet and DCT analysis of several different
poses of 2D face images. The main aim of this method is to represent the
multi-pose face images using a dominant frequency component with still having
reasonable achievement compared to the recent multi-pose face recognition
methods. The HFFD based face recognition tends to achieve better performance
than that of the recent 2D-based face recognition method. In addition, the
HFFD-based face recognition also is sufficiently to handle large face
variability due to face pose variations .

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an improved receiver based on diversity combining is proposed
to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of layered asymmetrically
clipped optical fast orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-FOFDM) for
intensity-modulated and direct-detected (IM/DD) optical transmission systems.
Layered ACO-FOFDM can compensate the weakness of traditional ACO-FOFDM in low
spectral efficiency, the utilization of discrete cosine transform in FOFDM
system instead of fast Fourier transform in OFDM system can reduce the
computational complexity without any influence on BER performance. The BER
performances of layered ACO-FOFDM system with improved receiver based on
diversity combining and DC-offset FOFDM (DCO-FOFDM) system with optimal DC-bias
are compared at the same spectral efficiency. Simulation results show that
under different optical bit energy to noise power ratios, layered ACO-FOFDM
system with improved receiver has 2.86dB, 5.26dB and 5.72dB BER performance
advantages at forward error correction limit over DCO-FOFDM system when the
spectral efficiencies are 1 bit/s/Hz, 2 bits/s/Hz and 3 bits/s/Hz,
respectively. Layered ACO-FOFDM system with improved receiver based on
diversity combining is suitable for application in the adaptive IM/DD systems
with zero DC-bias.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a method for learning the dynamics of complex nonlinear systems
based on deep generative models over temporal segments of states and actions.
Unlike dynamics models that operate over individual discrete timesteps, we
learn the distribution over future state trajectories conditioned on past
state, past action, and planned future action trajectories, as well as a latent
prior over action trajectories. Our approach is based on convolutional
autoregressive models and variational autoencoders. It makes stable and
accurate predictions over long horizons for complex, stochastic systems,
effectively expressing uncertainty and modeling the effects of collisions,
sensory noise, and action delays. The learned dynamics model and action prior
can be used for end-to-end, fully differentiable trajectory optimization and
model-based policy optimization, which we use to evaluate the performance and
sample-efficiency of our method.

 <dc:description>  Recently, DNN model compression based on network architecture design, e.g.,
SqueezeNet, attracted a lot attention. No accuracy drop on image classification
is observed on these extremely compact networks, compared to well-known models.
An emerging question, however, is whether these model compression techniques
hurt DNN's learning ability other than classifying images on a single dataset.
Our preliminary experiment shows that these compression methods could degrade
domain adaptation (DA) ability, though the classification performance is
preserved. Therefore, we propose a new compact network architecture and
unsupervised DA method in this paper. The DNN is built on a new basic module
Conv-M which provides more diverse feature extractors without significantly
increasing parameters. The unified framework of our DA method will
simultaneously learn invariance across domains, reduce divergence of feature
representations, and adapt label prediction. Our DNN has 4.1M parameters, which
is only 6.7% of AlexNet or 59% of GoogLeNet. Experiments show that our DNN
obtains GoogLeNet-level accuracy both on classification and DA, and our DA
method slightly outperforms previous competitive ones. Put all together, our DA
strategy based on our DNN achieves state-of-the-art on sixteen of total
eighteen DA tasks on popular Office-31 and Office-Caltech datasets.

 <dc:description>  Exploiting full-duplex (FD) technology on base stations (BSs) is a promising
solution to enhancing the system performance. Motivated by this, we revisit a
full-duplex base station (FD-BS) aided OFDMA system, which consists of one BS,
several uplink/downlink users and multiple subcarriers. A joint 3-dimensional
(3D) mapping scheme among subcarriers, down-link users (DUEs), uplink users
(UUEs) is considered as well as an associated power allocation optimization. In
detail, we first decompose the complex 3D mapping problem into three
2-dimensional sub ones and solve them by using the iterative Hungarian method,
respectively. Then based on the Lagrange dual method, we sequentially solve the
power allocation and 3- dimensional mapping problem by fixing a dual point.
Finally, the optimal solution can be obtained by utilizing the sub-gradient
method. Unlike existing work that only solves either 3D mapping or power
allocation problem but with a high computation complexity, we tackle both of
them and have successfully reduced computation complexity from exponential to
polynomial order. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the proposed
scheme.

 <dc:description>  We propose a definition of computable manifold by introducing computability
as a structure that we impose to a given topological manifold, just in the same
way as differentiability or piecewise linearity are defined for smooth and PL
manifolds respectively. Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2
theory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts
needed to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible
computable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\Phi$ defined on a
set $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \tau_\Phi,
\beta_\Phi, \nu_\Phi)$, where $\tau_\Phi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by
$\Phi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes
the computable structure determined by $\Phi$. The concept of computable
submanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold
which satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be
embedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{q}$,
with a computable embedding, where $\mathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual
topology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.

 <dc:description>  A novel deep learning architecture (XmasNet) based on convolutional neural
networks was developed for the classification of prostate cancer lesions, using
the 3D multiparametric MRI data provided by the PROSTATEx challenge. End-to-end
training was performed for XmasNet, with data augmentation done through 3D
rotation and slicing, in order to incorporate the 3D information of the lesion.
XmasNet outperformed traditional machine learning models based on engineered
features, for both train and test data. For the test data, XmasNet outperformed
69 methods from 33 participating groups and achieved the second highest AUC
(0.84) in the PROSTATEx challenge. This study shows the great potential of deep
learning for cancer imaging.

 <dc:description>  3D shape models are naturally parameterized using vertices and faces, \ie,
composed of polygons forming a surface. However, current 3D learning paradigms
for predictive and generative tasks using convolutional neural networks focus
on a voxelized representation of the object. Lifting convolution operators from
the traditional 2D to 3D results in high computational overhead with little
additional benefit as most of the geometry information is contained on the
surface boundary. Here we study the problem of directly generating the 3D shape
surface of rigid and non-rigid shapes using deep convolutional neural networks.
We develop a procedure to create consistent `geometry images' representing the
shape surface of a category of 3D objects. We then use this consistent
representation for category-specific shape surface generation from a parametric
representation or an image by developing novel extensions of deep residual
networks for the task of geometry image generation. Our experiments indicate
that our network learns a meaningful representation of shape surfaces allowing
it to interpolate between shape orientations and poses, invent new shape
surfaces and reconstruct 3D shape surfaces from previously unseen images.

 <dc:title>Research Methods in Computer Science: The Challenges and Issues</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hassani, Hossein</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - General Literature</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Research methods are essential parts in conducting any research project.
Although they have been theorized and summarized based on best practices, every
field of science requires an adaptation of the overall approaches to perform
research activities. In addition, any specific research needs a particular
adjustment to the generalized approach and specializing them to suit the
project in hand. However, unlike most well-established science disciplines,
computing research is not supported by well-defined, globally accepted methods.
This is because of its infancy and ambiguity in its definition, on one hand,
and its extensive coverage and overlap with other fields, on the other hand.
This article discusses the research methods in science and engineering in
general and in computing in particular. It shows that despite several special
parameters that make research in computing rather unique, it still follows the
same steps that any other scientific research would do. The article also shows
the particularities that researchers need to consider when they conduct
research in this field.

 <dc:description>  The ungrammatical sentence &quot;The key to the cabinets are on the table&quot; is
known to lead to an illusion of grammaticality. As discussed in the
meta-analysis by Jaeger et al., 2017, faster reading times are observed at the
verb are in the agreement-attraction sentence above compared to the equally
ungrammatical sentence &quot;The key to the cabinet are on the table&quot;. One
explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account:
the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to
the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis
&amp; Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is
misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion
process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural
marking. We present evidence for yet another explanation for the observed
facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number,
it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to
keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first
sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We
show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite
mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical
Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We
show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding
to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature
percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts.

 <dc:description>  Learning parameters of latent graphical models (GM) is inherently much harder
than that of no-latent ones since the latent variables make the corresponding
log-likelihood non-concave. Nevertheless, expectation-maximization schemes are
popularly used in practice, but they are typically stuck in local optima. In
the recent years, the method of moments have provided a refreshing angle for
resolving the non-convex issue, but it is applicable to a quite limited class
of latent GMs. In this paper, we aim for enhancing its power via enlarging such
a class of latent GMs. To this end, we introduce two novel concepts, coined
marginalization and conditioning, which can reduce the problem of learning a
larger GM to that of a smaller one. More importantly, they lead to a sequential
learning framework that repeatedly increases the learning portion of given
latent GM, and thus covers a significantly broader and more complicated class
of loopy latent GMs which include convolutional and random regular models.

distributed sensor networks at the Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory. The
experimental results were compared with the elliptical method and has been
analyzed in two dimensional data sets acquired from temperature and humidity
sensors across 52 micro controllers. Using the binary classification to
determine the upper and lower boundaries for each series of sensors, it has
been shown that the entropy method are able to detect more number of out
ranging sensor nodes than the elliptical methods. It can be argued that the
better result was mainly due to the lack of elliptical approach which is
requiring certain correlation between two sensor series, while in the entropy
approach each sensor series is treated independently. This is very important in
the current case where both sensor series are not correlated each other.

 <dc:description>  Recent learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods often focus on the
dictionary learning or network training. In this paper, we detailedly discuss a
new SR framework based on local classification instead of traditional
dictionary learning. The proposed efficient and extendible SR framework is
named as local patch classification (LPC) based framework. The LPC framework
consists of a learning stage and a reconstructing stage. In the learning stage,
image patches are classified into different classes by means of the proposed
local patch encoding (LPE), and then a projection matrix is computed for each
class by utilizing a simple constraint. In the reconstructing stage, an input
LR patch can be simply reconstructed by computing its LPE code and then
multiplying corresponding projection matrix. Furthermore, we establish the
relationship between the proposed method and the anchored neighborhood
regression based methods; and we also analyze the extendibility of the proposed
framework. The experimental results on several image sets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

 <dc:description>  The present paper examines the relationship between the students personality,
use of social media and their academic performance and engagement. In specific,
the aim of this study is to examine the relationship of students facebook (fb)
use and personality characteristics using the Big Five Personality Test with
(a) student engagement, (b) time spent preparing for class, (c) time spent in
co-curricular activities and (d) academic performance. Results illustrate that
fb time was significantly positively correlated to student engagement and time
spent preparing for class. Finally, some of the facebook activities and the
students personality characteristics are significantly positively related and
some others significantly negatively related to each one of the dependent
variables of the study. The implications of the study both for instructors and
the students, are also discussed.

 <dc:title>Improving Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks with Semantic

 <dc:description>  Interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is essential since it enables
users to understand the overall strengths and weaknesses of the models, conveys
an understanding of how the models will behave in the future, and how to
diagnose and correct potential problems. However, it is challenging to reason
about what a DNN actually does due to its opaque or black-box nature. To
address this issue, we propose a novel technique to improve the
interpretability of DNNs by leveraging the rich semantic information embedded
in human descriptions. By concentrating on the video captioning task, we first
extract a set of semantically meaningful topics from the human descriptions
that cover a wide range of visual concepts, and integrate them into the model
with an interpretive loss. We then propose a prediction difference maximization
algorithm to interpret the learned features of each neuron. Experimental
results demonstrate its effectiveness in video captioning using the
interpretable features, which can also be transferred to video action
recognition. By clearly understanding the learned features, users can easily
revise false predictions via a human-in-the-loop procedure.

 <dc:description>  Determining the material category of a surface from an image is a demanding
task in perception that is drawing increasing attention. Following the recent
remarkable results achieved for image classification and object detection
utilising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we empirically study material
classification of everyday objects employing these techniques. More
specifically, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of how state-of-the art CNN
architectures compare on a common ground over widely used material databases.
Experimental results on three challenging material databases show that the best
performing CNN architectures can achieve up to 94.99\% mean average precision
when classifying materials.

 <dc:description>  After setting the performance benchmarks for image, video, speech and audio
processing, deep convolutional networks have been core to the greatest advances
in image recognition tasks in recent times. This raises the question of whether
there are any benefit in targeting these remarkable deep architectures with the
unattempted task of recognising human rights violations through digital images.
Under this perspective, we introduce a new, well-sampled human rights-centric
dataset called Human Rights Understanding (HRUN). We conduct a rigorous
evaluation on a common ground by combining this dataset with different
state-of-the-art deep convolutional architectures in order to achieve
recognition of human rights violations. Experimental results on the HRUN
dataset have shown that the best performing CNN architectures can achieve up to
88.10\% mean average precision. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that
increasing the size of the training samples is crucial for achieving an
improvement on mean average precision principally when utilising very deep
networks.

 <dc:description>  We consider the weight spectrum of a class of quasi-perfect binary linear
codes with code distance 4. For example, extended Hamming code and Panchenko
code are the known members of this class. Also, it is known that in many cases
Panchenko code has the minimal number of weight 4 codewords. We give exact
recursive formulas for the weight spectrum of quasi-perfect codes and their
dual codes. As an example of application of the weight spectrum we derive a
lower estimate for the conditional probability of correction of erasure
patterns of high weights (equal to or greater than code distance).

 <dc:description>  Co-occurrence Filter (CoF) is a boundary preserving filter. It is based on
the Bilateral Filter (BF) but instead of using a Gaussian on the range values
to preserve edges it relies on a co-occurrence matrix. Pixel values that
co-occur frequently in the image (i.e., inside textured regions) will have a
high weight in the co-occurrence matrix. This, in turn, means that such pixel
pairs will be averaged and hence smoothed, regardless of their intensity
differences. On the other hand, pixel values that rarely co-occur (i.e., across
texture boundaries) will have a low weight in the co-occurrence matrix. As a
result, they will not be averaged and the boundary between them will be
preserved. The CoF therefore extends the BF to deal with boundaries, not just
edges. It learns co-occurrences directly from the image. We can achieve various
filtering results by directing it to learn the co-occurrence matrix from a part
of the image, or a different image. We give the definition of the filter,
discuss how to use it with color images and show several use cases.

convolutional network architecture for regression of multivariate asynchronous
time series. The model is inspired by standard autoregressive (AR) models and
gating mechanisms used in recurrent neural networks. It involves an AR-like
weighting system, where the final predictor is obtained as a weighted sum of
adjusted regressors, while the weights are data-dependent functions learnt
through a convolutional network. The architecture was designed for applications
on asynchronous time series and is evaluated on such datasets: a hedge fund
proprietary dataset of over 2 million quotes for a credit derivative index, an
artificially generated noisy autoregressive series and household electricity
consumption dataset. The proposed architecture achieves promising results as
compared to convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The code for the
numerical experiments and the architecture implementation is shared online to
make the research reproducible.

 <dc:title>Performance Analysis of Physical Layer Network Coding for Two-way

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Two-way relaying is one of the major applications of broadband communication
satellites, for which an efficient technique is Physical Layer Network Coding
(PLNC). Earlier studies have considered satellites employing PLNC with onboard
processing. This paper investigates the performance of PLNC over
non-regenerative satellites, as a majority of the operational and planned
satellites have no onboard processing. Assuming that the channel magnitudes of
the two users are equal, two operating conditions are considered with
uncoded-QPSK relaying. In the first condition, both users are completely
synchronized in phase and transmit power, and in the second condition, phase is
not synchronized. The peak power constraint imposed by the satellite amplifier
is considered and the error performance bounds are derived for both the
conditions. The simulation results for end-to-end Bit Error Rate (BER) and
throughput are provided. These results shall enable communication system
designers to decide system parameters like power and linearity, and perform
tradeoff analysis between different relaying schemes.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have made unprecedented
progress, achieving the accuracy close to, or even better than human-level
perception in various tasks. There is a timely need to map the latest software
DCNNs to application-specific hardware, in order to achieve orders of magnitude
improvement in performance, energy efficiency and compactness. Stochastic
Computing (SC), as a low-cost alternative to the conventional binary computing
paradigm, has the potential to enable massively parallel and highly scalable
hardware implementation of DCNNs. One major challenge in SC based DCNNs is
designing accurate nonlinear activation functions, which have a significant
impact on the network-level accuracy but cannot be implemented accurately by
existing SC computing blocks. In this paper, we design and optimize SC based
neurons, and we propose highly accurate activation designs for the three most
frequently used activation functions in software DCNNs, i.e, hyperbolic
tangent, logistic, and rectified linear units. Experimental results on LeNet-5
using MNIST dataset demonstrate that compared with a binary ASIC hardware DCNN,
the DCNN with the proposed SC neurons can achieve up to 61X, 151X, and 2X
improvement in terms of area, power, and energy, respectively, at the cost of
small precision degradation.In addition, the SC approach achieves up to 21X and
41X of the area, 41X and 72X of the power, and 198200X and 96443X of the

increased by less than 3.07%. ReLU activation is suggested for future SC based
DCNNs considering its superior performance under a small bit stream length.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural network algorithms are difficult to analyze because they lack
structure allowing to understand the properties of underlying transforms and
invariants. Multiscale hierarchical convolutional networks are structured deep
convolutional networks where layers are indexed by progressively higher
dimensional attributes, which are learned from training data. Each new layer is
computed with multidimensional convolutions along spatial and attribute
variables. We introduce an efficient implementation of such networks where the
dimensionality is progressively reduced by averaging intermediate layers along
attribute indices. Hierarchical networks are tested on CIFAR image data bases
where they obtain comparable precisions to state of the art networks, with much
fewer parameters. We study some properties of the attributes learned from these
databases.

 <dc:description>  In bidirectional relaying using Physical Layer Network Coding (PLNC), it is
generally assumed that users employ same modulation schemes in the Multiple
Access phase. However, as observed by Zhang et al., it may not be desirable for
the users to always use the same modulation schemes, particularly when
user-relay channels are not equally strong. Such a scheme is called
Heterogeneous PLNC. However, the approach in [1] uses the computationally
intensive Closest Neighbour Clustering (CNC) algorithm to find the network
coding maps to be applied at the relay. Also, the treatment is specific to
certain cases of heterogeneous modulations. In this paper, we show that, when
users employ heterogeneous but symmetric PSK modulations, the network coding
maps and the mapping regions in the fade state plane can be obtained
analytically. Performance results are provided in terms of Relay Error Rate
(RER) and Bit Error Rate (BER).

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We would like to present the idea of our Continuous Defect Prediction (CDP)
research and a related dataset that we created and share. Our dataset is
currently a set of more than 11 million data rows, representing files involved
in Continuous Integration (CI) builds, that synthesize the results of CI builds
with data we mine from software repositories. Our dataset embraces 1265
software projects, 30,022 distinct commit authors and several software process
metrics that in earlier research appeared to be useful in software defect
prediction. In this particular dataset we use TravisTorrent as the source of CI
data. TravisTorrent synthesizes commit level information from the Travis CI
server and GitHub open-source projects repositories. We extend this data to a
file change level and calculate the software process metrics that may be used,
for example, as features to predict risky software changes that could break the
build if committed to a repository with CI enabled.

 <dc:description>  We provide a polynomial time reduction from Bayesian incentive compatible
mechanism design to Bayesian algorithm design for welfare maximization
problems. Unlike prior results, our reduction achieves exact incentive
compatibility for problems with multi-dimensional and continuous type spaces.
The key technical barrier preventing exact incentive compatibility in prior
black-box reductions is that repairing violations of incentive constraints
requires understanding the distribution of the mechanism's output. Reductions
that instead estimate the output distribution by sampling inevitably suffer
from sampling error, which typically precludes exact incentive compatibility.
  We overcome this barrier by employing and generalizing the computational
model in the literature on Bernoulli Factories. In a Bernoulli factory problem,
one is given a function mapping the bias of an &quot;input coin&quot; to that of an
&quot;output coin&quot;, and the challenge is to efficiently simulate the output coin
given sample access to the input coin. We generalize this to the &quot;expectations
from samples&quot; computational model, in which an instance is specified by a
function mapping the expected values of a set of input distributions to a
distribution over outcomes. The challenge is to give a polynomial time
algorithm that exactly samples from the distribution over outcomes given only
sample access to the input distributions. In this model, we give a polynomial
time algorithm for the exponential weights: expected values of the input
distributions correspond to the weights of alternatives and we wish to select
an alternative with probability proportional to an exponential function of its
weight. This algorithm is the key ingredient in designing an incentive
compatible mechanism for bipartite matching, which can be used to make the
approximately incentive compatible reduction of Hartline et al. (2015) exactly
incentive compatible.

 <dc:description>  How spiking networks are able to perform probabilistic inference is an
intriguing question, not only for understanding information processing in the
brain, but also for transferring these computational principles to neuromorphic
silicon circuits. A number of computationally powerful spiking network models
have been proposed, but most of them have only been tested, under ideal
conditions, in software simulations. Any implementation in an analog, physical
system, be it in vivo or in silico, will generally lead to distorted dynamics
due to the physical properties of the underlying substrate. In this paper, we
discuss several such distortive effects that are difficult or impossible to
remove by classical calibration routines or parameter training. We then argue
that hierarchical networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons can offer the
required robustness for physical implementation and demonstrate this with both
software simulations and emulation on an accelerated analog neuromorphic
device.

 <dc:description>  Location sensing is a key enabling technology for Ubicomp to support
contextual interaction. However, the laboratories where calibrated testing of
location technologies is done are very different to the domestic situations
where `context' is a problematic social construct. This study reports
measurements of Bluetooth beacons, informed by laboratory studies, but done in
diverse domestic settings. The design of these surveys has been motivated by
the natural environment implied in the Bluetooth beacon standards - relating
the technical environment of the beacon to the function of spaces within the
home. This research method can be considered as a situated, `ethnographic'
technical response to the study of physical infrastructure that arises through
social processes. The results offer insights for the future design of `seamful'
approaches to indoor location sensing, and to the ways that context might be
constructed and interpreted in a seamful manner.

 <dc:title>Any-Angle Pathfinding for Multiple Agents Based on SIPP Algorithm</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of finding conflict-free trajectories for multiple agents of
identical circular shape, operating in shared 2D workspace, is addressed in the
paper and decoupled, e.g., prioritized, approach is used to solve this problem.
Agents' workspace is tessellated into the square grid on which any-angle moves
are allowed, e.g. each agent can move into an arbitrary direction as long as
this move follows the straight line segment whose endpoints are tied to the
distinct grid elements. A novel any-angle planner based on Safe Interval Path
Planning (SIPP) algorithm is proposed to find trajectories for an agent moving
amidst dynamic obstacles (other agents) on a grid. This algorithm is then used
as part of a prioritized multi-agent planner AA-SIPP(m). On the theoretical,
side we show that AA-SIPP(m) is complete under well-defined conditions. On the
experimental side, in simulation tests with up to 200 agents involved, we show
that our planner finds much better solutions in terms of cost (up to 20%)
compared to the planners relying on cardinal moves only.

 <dc:title>Leak Event Identification in Water Systems Using High Order CRF</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Today, detection of anomalous events in civil infrastructures (e.g. water
pipe breaks and leaks) is time consuming and often takes hours or days. Pipe
breakage as one of the most frequent types of failure of water networks often
causes community disruptions ranging from temporary interruptions in services
to extended loss of business and relocation of residents. In this project, we
design and implement a two-phase approach for leak event identification, which
leverages dynamic data from multiple information sources including IoT sensing
data (pressure values and/or flow rates), geophysical data (water systems), and
human inputs (tweets posted on Twitter). In the approach, a high order
Conditional Random Field (CRF) is constructed that enforces predictions based
on IoT observations consistent with human inputs to improve the performance of
event identifications.
  Considering the physical water network as a graph, a CRF model is built and
learned by the Structured Support Vector Machine (SSVM) using node features
such as water pressure and flow rate. After that, we built the high order CRF
system by enforcing twitter leakage detection information. An optimal inference
algorithm is proposed for the adapted high order CRF model. Experimental
results show the effectiveness of our system.

 <dc:description>  Experimental Particle Physics has been at the forefront of analyzing the
worlds largest datasets for decades. The HEP community was the first to develop
suitable software and computing tools for this task. In recent times, new
toolkits and systems collectively called Big Data technologies have emerged to
support the analysis of Petabyte and Exabyte datasets in industry. While the
principles of data analysis in HEP have not changed (filtering and transforming
experiment-specific data formats), these new technologies use different
approaches and promise a fresh look at analysis of very large datasets and
could potentially reduce the time-to-physics with increased interactivity. In
this talk, we present an active LHC Run 2 analysis, searching for dark matter
with the CMS detector, as a testbed for Big Data technologies. We directly
compare the traditional NTuple-based analysis with an equivalent analysis using
Apache Spark on the Hadoop ecosystem and beyond. In both cases, we start the
analysis with the official experiment data formats and produce publication
physics plots. We will discuss advantages and disadvantages of each approach
and give an outlook on further studies needed.

 <dc:description>  Single-user multiple-input / multiple-output (SU-MIMO) communication systems
have been successfully used over the years and have provided a significant
increase on a wireless link's capacity by enabling the transmission of multiple
data streams. Assuming channel knowledge at the transmitter, the maximization
of the mutual information of a MIMO link is achieved by finding the optimal
power allocation under a given sum-power constraint, which is in turn obtained
by the water-filling (WF) algorithm. However, in spectrum sharing setups, such
as Licensed Shared Access (LSA), where a primary link (PL) and a secondary link
(SL) coexist, the power transmitted by the SL transmitter may induce harmful
interference to the PL receiver. While such co-existing links have been
considered extensively in various spectrum sharing setups, the mutual
information of the SL under a constraint on the interference it may cause to
the PL receiver has, quite astonishingly, not been evaluated so far. In this
paper, we solve this problem, find its unique optimal solution and provide the
power allocation policy and corresponding precoding solution that achieves the
optimal capacity under the imposed constraint. The performance of the optimal
solution and the penalty due to the interference constraint are evaluated over
some indicative Rayleigh fading channel conditions and interference thresholds.
We believe that the obtained results are of general nature and that they may
apply, beyond spectrum sharing, to a variety of applications that admit a
similar setup.

 <dc:description>  Structured Peer Learning (SPL) is a form of peer-based supplemental
instruction that focuses on mentoring, guidance, and development of technical,
communication, and social skills in both the students receiving assistance and
the students in teaching roles. This paper explores the methodology, efficacy,
and reasoning behind the practical realization of a SPL program designed to
increase student knowledge and success in undergraduate Computer Science
courses. Students expressed an increased level of comfort when asking for help
from student teachers versus traditional educational resources, historically
showed an increased average grade in lower-level courses, and felt that the
program positively impacted their desire to continue in or switch to a Computer
major. Additionally, results indicated that advances in programming, analytical
thinking, and abstract analysis skills were evident in not only the students
but also the student teachers, suggesting a strong bidirectional flow of
knowledge.

 <dc:title>Why we have switched from building full-fledged taxonomies to simply
  detecting hypernymy relations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Camacho-Collados, Jose</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The study of taxonomies and hypernymy relations has been extensive on the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. However, the evaluation of
taxonomy learning approaches has been traditionally troublesome, as it mainly
relies on ad-hoc experiments which are hardly reproducible and manually
expensive. Partly because of this, current research has been lately focusing on
the hypernymy detection task. In this paper we reflect on this trend, analyzing
issues related to current evaluation procedures. Finally, we propose three
potential avenues for future work so that is-a relations and resources based on
them play a more important role in downstream NLP applications.

 <dc:title>Aerial UAV-IoT Sensing for Ubiquitous Immersive Communication and
  Virtual Human Teleportation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chakareski, Jacob</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider UAV IoT aerial sensing that delivers multiple VR/AR immersive
communication sessions to remote users. The UAV swarm is spatially distributed
over a wide area of interest, and each UAV captures a viewpoint of the scene
below it. The remote users are interested in visual immersive navigation of
specific subareas/scenes of interest, reconstructed on their respective VR/AR
devices from the captured data. The reconstruction quality of the immersive
scene representations at the users will depend on the sampling/sensing rates
associated with each UAV. There is a limit on the aggregate amount of data that
the UAV swarm can sample and send towards the users, stemming from
physical/transmission capacity constraints. Similarly, each VR/AR application
has minimum reconstruction quality requirements for its own session. We propose
an optimization framework that makes three contributions in this context.
First, we select the optimal sampling rates to be used by each UAV, such that
the system and application constraints are not exceed, while the priority
weighted reconstruction quality across all VR/AR sessions is maximized. Then,
we design an optimal scalable source-channel signal representation that
instills into the captured data inherent rate adaptivity, unequal error
protection, and minimum required redundancy. Finally, the UAV transmission
efficiency is enhanced by the use of small-form-factor multi-beam directional
antennas and optimal power/link scheduling across the scalable signal
representation layers. Our experiments demonstrate competitive advantages over
conventional methods for visual sensing. This is a first-of-its-kind study of
an emerging application of prospectively broad societal impact.

 <dc:description>  One of the fundamental applications for a practically useful system of money
is remuneration. Information pertaining to the amount of compensation awarded
to different individuals is often considered sensitive, commanding a certain
degree of privacy. As Bitcoin and similarly designed cryptocurrencies evolve
into a recognized medium of exchange for larger swaths of the world economy, an
increasing number of people will earn income in the form of blockchain-based
payments. The nature of these transactions is such that the minute details of
an affected individuals compensation package and spending habits will be
exposed to public scrutiny. In some cases this violates cultural norms which
respect the confidentiality of salaries, yet in other cases it could be
regarded as providing the benefits associated with greater transparency. In
this work we analyse the Bitcoin blockchain record of periodic payments
accruing to an individual address in exchange for goods or services rendered.
For differing levels of available information we seek to determine the extent
of insights that can be gleaned about the transacting counter-parties and the
privacy implications this entails.

 <dc:description>  Malignant melanoma has one of the most rapidly increasing incidences in the
world and has a considerable mortality rate. Early diagnosis is particularly
important since melanoma can be cured with prompt excision. Dermoscopy images
play an important role in the non-invasive early detection of melanoma [1].
However, melanoma detection using human vision alone can be subjective,
inaccurate and poorly reproducible even among experienced dermatologists. This
is attributed to the challenges in interpreting images with diverse
characteristics including lesions of varying sizes and shapes, lesions that may
have fuzzy boundaries, different skin colors and the presence of hair [2].
Therefore, the automatic analysis of dermoscopy images is a valuable aid for
clinical decision making and for image-based diagnosis to identify diseases
such as melanoma [1-4]. Deep residual networks (ResNets) has achieved
state-of-the-art results in image classification and detection related problems
[5-8]. In this ISIC 2017 skin lesion analysis challenge [9], we propose to
exploit the deep ResNets for robust visual features learning and
representations.

 <dc:description>  While deep learning has led to remarkable advances across diverse
applications, it struggles in domains where the data distribution changes over
the course of learning. In stark contrast, biological neural networks
continually adapt to changing domains, possibly by leveraging complex molecular
machinery to solve many tasks simultaneously. In this study, we introduce
intelligent synapses that bring some of this biological complexity into
artificial neural networks. Each synapse accumulates task relevant information
over time, and exploits this information to rapidly store new memories without
forgetting old ones. We evaluate our approach on continual learning of
classification tasks, and show that it dramatically reduces forgetting while
maintaining computational efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Heretofore the concept of &quot;blockchain&quot; has not been precisely defined.
Accordingly the potential useful applications of this technology have been
largely inflated. This work sidesteps the question of what constitutes a
blockchain as such and focuses on the architectural components of the Bitcoin
cryptocurrency, insofar as possible, in isolation. We consider common problems
inherent in the design of effective supply chain management systems. With each
identified problem we propose a solution that utilizes one or more component
aspects of Bitcoin. This culminates in five design principles for increased
efficiency in supply chain management systems through the application of
incentive mechanisms and data structures native to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency
protocol.

 <dc:title>Virtual Reality over Wireless Networks: Quality-of-Service Model and
  Learning-Based Resource Management</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Mingzhe</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of resource management is studied for a network of
wireless virtual reality (VR) users communicating over heterogeneous small cell
networks (SCNs). In order to capture the VR users' quality-of-service (QoS) in
SCNs, a novel VR model, based on multi-attribute utility theory, is proposed.
This model jointly accounts for VR metrics such as tracking accuracy,
processing delay, and transmission delay. In this model, the small base
stations (SBSs) act as the VR control centers that collect the tracking
information from VR users over the cellular uplink. Once this information is
collected, the SBSs will then send the three dimensional images and
accompanying surround stereo audio to the VR users over the downlink.
Therefore, the resource allocation problem in VR wireless networks must jointly
consider both the uplink and downlink. This problem is then formulated as a
noncooperative game and a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning
framework of echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed to find the solution of
this game. The use of the proposed ESN algorithm enables the SBSs to predict
the VR QoS of each SBS and guarantees the convergence to a mixed-strategy Nash
equilibrium. The analytical result shows that each user's VR QoS jointly
depends on both VR tracking accuracy and wireless resource allocation.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields significant gains,
in terms of total utility value of VR QoS, that reach up to 22% and 38.5%,
respectively, compared to Q-learning and a baseline proportional fair
algorithm. The results also show that the proposed algorithm has a faster
convergence time than Q-learning and can guarantee low delays for VR services.

 <dc:title>Sequential Bayesian Optimisation as a POMDP for Environment Monitoring

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bayesian Optimisation has gained much popularity lately, as a global
optimisation technique for functions that are expensive to evaluate or unknown
a priori. While classical BO focuses on where to gather an observation next, it
does not take into account practical constraints for a robotic system such as
where it is physically possible to gather samples from, nor the sequential
nature of the problem while executing a trajectory. In field robotics and other
real-life situations, physical and trajectory constraints are inherent
problems. This paper addresses these issues by formulating Bayesian
Optimisation for continuous trajectories within a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP) framework. The resulting POMDP is solved using
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which we adapt to using a reward function
balancing exploration and exploitation. Experiments on monitoring a spatial
phenomenon with a UAV illustrate how our BO-POMDP algorithm outperforms
competing techniques.

 <dc:description>  Mining textual patterns in news, tweets, papers, and many other kinds of text
corpora has been an active theme in text mining and NLP research. Previous
studies adopt a dependency parsing-based pattern discovery approach. However,
the parsing results lose rich context around entities in the patterns, and the
process is costly for a corpus of large scale. In this study, we propose a
novel typed textual pattern structure, called meta pattern, which is extended
to a frequent, informative, and precise subsequence pattern in certain context.
We propose an efficient framework, called MetaPAD, which discovers meta
patterns from massive corpora with three techniques: (1) it develops a
context-aware segmentation method to carefully determine the boundaries of
patterns with a learnt pattern quality assessment function, which avoids costly
dependency parsing and generates high-quality patterns; (2) it identifies and
groups synonymous meta patterns from multiple facets---their types, contexts,
and extractions; and (3) it examines type distributions of entities in the
instances extracted by each group of patterns, and looks for appropriate type
levels to make discovered patterns precise. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed framework discovers high-quality typed textual patterns efficiently
from different genres of massive corpora and facilitates information
extraction.

 <dc:description>  Inference of user context information, including user's gender, age, marital
status, location and so on, has been proven to be valuable for building context
aware recommender system. However, prevalent existing studies on user context
inference have two shortcommings: 1. focusing on only a single data source
(e.g. Internet browsing logs, or mobile call records), and 2. ignoring the
interdependence of multiple user contexts (e.g. interdependence between age and
marital status), which have led to poor inference performance. To solve this
problem, in this paper, we first exploit tensor outer product to fuse multiple
data sources in the feature space to obtain an extensional user feature
representation. Following this, by taking this extensional user feature
representation as input, we propose a multiple attribute probabilistic model
called MulAProM to infer user contexts that can take advantage of the
interdependence between them. Our study is based on large telecommunication
datasets from the local mobile operator of Shanghai, China, and consists of two
data sources, 4.6 million call detail records and 7.5 million data traffic
records of 8,000 mobile users, collected in the course of six months. The
experimental results show that our model can outperform other models in terms
of \emph{recall}, \emph{precision}, and the \emph{F1-measure}.

 <dc:description>  Cognitive inference of user demographics, such as gender and age, plays an
important role in creating user profiles for adjusting marketing strategies and
generating personalized recommendations because user demographic data is
usually not available due to data privacy concerns. At present, users can
readily express feedback regarding products or services that they have
purchased. During this process, user demographics are concealed, but the data
has never yet been successfully utilized to contribute to the cognitive
inference of user demographics. In this paper, we investigate the inference
power of user ratings data, and propose a simple yet general cognitive
inference model, called rating to profile (R2P), to infer user demographics
from user provided ratings. In particular, the proposed R2P model can achieve
the following: 1. Correctly integrate user ratings into model training. 2.Infer
multiple demographic attributes of users simultaneously, capturing the
underlying relevance between different demographic attributes. 3. Train its two
components, i.e. feature extractor and classifier, in an integrated manner
under a supervised learning paradigm, which effectively helps to discover
useful hidden patterns from highly sparse ratings data. We introduce how to
incorporate user ratings data into the research field of cognitive inference of
user demographic data, and detail the model development and optimization
process for the proposed R2P. Extensive experiments are conducted on two
real-world ratings datasets against various compared state-of-the-art methods,
and the results from multiple aspects demonstrate that our proposed R2P model
can significantly improve on the cognitive inference performance of user
demographic data.

 <dc:description>  In exploratory tensor mining, a common problem is how to analyze a set of
variables across a set of subjects whose observations do not align naturally.
For example, when modeling medical features across a set of patients, the
number and duration of treatments may vary widely in time, meaning there is no
meaningful way to align their clinical records across time points for analysis
purposes. To handle such data, the state-of-the-art tensor model is the
so-called PARAFAC2, which yields interpretable and robust output and can
naturally handle sparse data. However, its main limitation up to now has been
the lack of efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale datasets.
  In this work, we fill this gap by developing a scalable method to compute the
PARAFAC2 decomposition of large and sparse datasets, called SPARTan. Our method
exploits special structure within PARAFAC2, leading to a novel algorithmic
reformulation that is both fast (in absolute time) and more memory-efficient
than prior work. We evaluate SPARTan on both synthetic and real datasets,
showing 22X performance gains over the best previous implementation and also
handling larger problem instances for which the baseline fails. Furthermore, we
are able to apply SPARTan to the mining of temporally-evolving phenotypes on
data taken from real and medically complex pediatric patients. The clinical
meaningfulness of the phenotypes identified in this process, as well as their
temporal evolution over time for several patients, have been endorsed by
clinical experts.

 <dc:description>  Automatic decision-making approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL),
have been applied to (partially) solve the resource allocation problem
adaptively in the cloud computing system. However, a complete cloud resource
allocation framework exhibits high dimensions in state and action spaces, which
prohibit the usefulness of traditional RL techniques. In addition, high power
consumption has become one of the critical concerns in design and control of
cloud computing systems, which degrades system reliability and increases
cooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should
minimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradation within an
acceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and
power management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system.
Moreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher
dimensions in state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical framework for solving the overall resource allocation and power
management problem in cloud computing systems. The proposed hierarchical
framework comprises a global tier for VM resource allocation to the servers and
a local tier for distributed power management of local servers. The emerging
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, which can deal with complicated
control problems with large state space, is adopted to solve the global tier
problem. Furthermore, an autoencoder and a novel weight sharing structure are
adopted to handle the high-dimensional state space and accelerate the
convergence speed. On the other hand, the local tier of distributed server
power managements comprises an LSTM based workload predictor and a model-free
RL based power manager, operating in a distributed manner.

 <dc:title>New algorithms for matching problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The standard two-sided and one-sided matching problems, and the closely
related school choice problem, have been widely studied from an axiomatic
viewpoint. A small number of algorithms dominate the literature. For two-sided
matching, the Gale-Shapley algorithm; for one-sided matching, (random) Serial
Dictatorship and Probabilistic Serial rule; for school choice, Gale-Shapley and
the Boston mechanisms.
  The main reason for the dominance of these algorithms is their good
(worst-case) axiomatic behaviour with respect to notions of efficiency and
strategyproofness. However if we shift the focus to fairness, social welfare,
tradeoffs between incompatible axioms, and average-case analysis, it is far
from clear that these algorithms are optimal.
  We investigate new algorithms several of which have not appeared (to our
knowledge) in the literature before. We give a unified presentation in which
algorithms for 2-sided matching yield 1-sided matching algorithms in a
systematic way. In addition to axiomatic properties, we investigate agent
welfare using both theoretical and computational approaches. We find that some
of the new algorithms are worthy of consideration for certain applications. In
particular, when considering welfare under truthful preferences, some of the
new algorithms outperform the classic ones.

 <dc:title>Improved approximation algorithms for $k$-connected $m$-dominating set
  problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nutov, Zeev</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A graph is $k$-connected if it has $k$ internally-disjoint paths between
every pair of nodes. A subset $S$ of nodes in a graph $G$ is a $k$-connected
set if the subgraph $G[S]$ induced by $S$ is $k$-connected; $S$ is an
$m$-dominating set if every $v \in V \setminus S$ has at least $m$ neighbors in
$S$. If $S$ is both $k$-connected and $m$-dominating then $S$ is a
$k$-connected $m$-dominating set, or $(k,m)$-cds for short. In the
$k$-Connected $m$-Dominating Set ($(k,m)$-CDS) problem the goal is to find a
minimum weight $(k,m)$-cds in a node-weighted graph. We consider the case $m
\geq k$ and obtain the following approximation ratios. For unit disc-graphs we
obtain ratio $O(k\ln k)$, improving the previous ratio $O(k^2 \ln k)$. For
general graphs we obtain the first non-trivial approximation ratio $O(k^2 \ln
n)$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we look into the problem of planning over hybrid domains, where
change can be both discrete and instantaneous, or continuous over time. In
addition, it is required that each state on the trajectory induced by the
execution of plans complies with a given set of global constraints. We approach
the computation of plans for such domains as the problem of searching over a
deterministic state model. In this model, some of the successor states are
obtained by solving numerically the so-called initial value problem over a set
of ordinary differential equations (ODE) given by the current plan prefix.
These equations hold over time intervals whose duration is determined
dynamically, according to whether zero crossing events take place for a set of
invariant conditions. The resulting planner, FS+, incorporates these features
together with effective heuristic guidance. FS+ does not impose any of the
syntactic restrictions on process effects often found on the existing
literature on Hybrid Planning. A key concept of our approach is that a clear
separation is struck between planning and simulation time steps. The former is
the time allowed to observe the evolution of a given dynamical system before
committing to a future course of action, whilst the later is part of the model
of the environment. FS+ is shown to be a robust planner over a diverse set of
hybrid domains, taken from the existing literature on hybrid planning and
systems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an efficient super-resolution (SR) method based on
deep convolutional neural network (CNN), namely gradual upsampling network
(GUN). Recent CNN based SR methods either preliminarily magnify the low
resolution (LR) input to high resolution (HR) and then reconstruct the HR
input, or directly reconstruct the LR input and then recover the HR result at
the last layer. The proposed GUN utilizes a gradual process instead of these
two kinds of frameworks. The GUN consists of an input layer, multistep
upsampling and convolutional layers, and an output layer. By means of the
gradual process, the proposed network can simplify the difficult direct SR
problem to multistep easier upsampling tasks with very small magnification
factor in each step. Furthermore, a gradual training strategy is presented for
the GUN. In the proposed training process, an initial network can be easily
trained with edge-like samples, and then the weights are gradually tuned with
more complex samples. The GUN can recover fine and vivid results, and is easy
to be trained. The experimental results on several image sets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed network.

 <dc:description>  Learning sophisticated feature interactions behind user behaviors is critical
in maximizing CTR for recommender systems. Despite great progress, existing
methods seem to have a strong bias towards low- or high-order interactions, or
require expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we show that it is
possible to derive an end-to-end learning model that emphasizes both low- and
high-order feature interactions. The proposed model, DeepFM, combines the power
of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature
learning in a new neural network architecture. Compared to the latest Wide \&amp;
Deep model from Google, DeepFM has a shared input to its &quot;wide&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;
parts, with no need of feature engineering besides raw features. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
DeepFM over the existing models for CTR prediction, on both benchmark data and
commercial data.

 <dc:description>  Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is mainly launched by the transmission
requirements between devices for specific applications such as Proximity
Services in Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) networks, and each application
will form a group of devices for the network-covered and network-absent D2D
communications. Although there are many privacy concerns in D2D communication,
they have not been well-addressed in current communication standards. This work
introduces network-covered and network-absent authenticated key exchange
protocols for D2D communications to guarantee accountable group anonymity,
end-to-end security to network operators, as well as traceability and
revocability for accounting and management requirements. We formally prove the
security of those protocols, and also develop an analytic model to evaluate the
quality of authentication protocols by authentication success rate in D2D
communications. Besides, we implement the proposed protocols on android mobile
devices to evaluate the computation costs of the protocols. We also evaluate
the authentication success rate by the proposed analytic model and prove the
correctness of the analytic model via simulation. Those evaluations show that
the proposed protocols are feasible to the performance requirements of D2D
communications.

for multi-target tracking with the standard point target measurements without
using probability generating functionals or functional derivatives. We also
establish the connection with the \delta-generalised labelled multi-Bernoulli
(\delta-GLMB) filter, showing that a \delta-GLMB density represents a
multi-Bernoulli mixture with labelled targets so it can be seen as a special
case of PMBM. In addition, we propose an implementation for linear/Gaussian
dynamic and measurement models and how to efficiently obtain typical estimators
in the literature from the PMBM. The PMBM filter is shown to outperform other
filters in the literature in a challenging scenario.

 <dc:title>Conjugate-Computation Variational Inference : Converting Variational
  Inference in Non-Conjugate Models to Inferences in Conjugate Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khan, Mohammad Emtiyaz</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lin, Wu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Variational inference is computationally challenging in models that contain
both conjugate and non-conjugate terms. Methods specifically designed for
conjugate models, even though computationally efficient, find it difficult to
deal with non-conjugate terms. On the other hand, stochastic-gradient methods
can handle the non-conjugate terms but they usually ignore the conjugate
structure of the model which might result in slow convergence. In this paper,
we propose a new algorithm called Conjugate-computation Variational Inference
(CVI) which brings the best of the two worlds together -- it uses conjugate
computations for the conjugate terms and employs stochastic gradients for the
rest. We derive this algorithm by using a stochastic mirror-descent method in
the mean-parameter space, and then expressing each gradient step as a
variational inference in a conjugate model. We demonstrate our algorithm's
applicability to a large class of models and establish its convergence. Our
experimental results show that our method converges much faster than the
methods that ignore the conjugate structure of the model.

which the learner is allowed to slightly permute the \emph{order} of the loss
functions generated by an adversary. On one hand, this models natural
situations where the exact order of the learner's responses is not crucial, and
on the other hand, might allow better learning and regret performance, by
mitigating highly adversarial loss sequences. Also, with random permutations,
this can be seen as a setting interpolating between adversarial and stochastic
losses. In this paper, we consider the applicability of this setting to convex
online learning with delayed feedback, in which the feedback on the prediction
made in round $t$ arrives with some delay $\tau$. With such delayed feedback,
the best possible regret bound is well-known to be $O(\sqrt{\tau T})$. We prove
that by being able to permute losses by a distance of at most $M$ (for $M\geq
\tau$), the regret can be improved to $O(\sqrt{T}(1+\sqrt{\tau^2/M}))$, using a
Mirror-Descent based algorithm which can be applied for both Euclidean and
non-Euclidean geometries. We also prove a lower bound, showing that for
$M&lt;\tau/3$, it is impossible to improve the standard $O(\sqrt{\tau T})$ regret
bound by more than constant factors. Finally, we provide some experiments
validating the performance of our algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Continuous Deployment (CD) has emerged as a new practice in the software
industry to continuously and automatically deploy software changes into
production. Continuous Deployment Pipeline (CDP) supports CD practice by
transferring the changes from the repository to production. Since most of the
CDP components run in an environment that has several interfaces to the
Internet, these components are vulnerable to various kinds of malicious
attacks. This paper reports our work aimed at designing secure CDP by utilizing
security tactics. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of five security
tactics in designing a secure pipeline by conducting an experiment on two CDPs
- one incorporates security tactics while the other does not. Both CDPs have
been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. We used assurance cases with
goal-structured notations for qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis,
we used penetration tools. Our findings indicate that the applied tactics
improve the security of the major components (i.e., repository, continuous
integration server, main server) of a CDP by controlling access to the
components and establishing secure connections.

 <dc:description>  Social media platforms provide continuous access to user generated content
that enables real-time monitoring of user behavior and of events. The
geographical dimension of such user behavior and events has recently caught a
lot of attention in several domains: mobility, humanitarian, or
infrastructural. While resolving the location of a user can be straightforward,
depending on the affordances of their device and/or of the application they are
using, in most cases, locating a user demands a larger effort, such as
exploiting textual features. On Twitter for instance, only 2% of all tweets are
geo-referenced. In this paper, we present a system for zoomed-in grounding
(below city level) for short messages (e.g., tweets). The system combines
different natural language processing and machine learning techniques to
increase the number of geo-grounded tweets, which is essential to many
applications such as disaster response and real-time traffic monitoring.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an affine generalization of counter automata, and analyze their
ability as well as affine finite automata. Our contributions are as follows. We
show that there is a language that can be recognized by exact realtime affine
counter automata but by neither 1-way deterministic pushdown automata nor
realtime deterministic k-counter automata. We also show that a certain promise
problem, which is conjectured not to be solved by two-way quantum finite
automata in polynomial time, can be solved by Las Vegas affine finite automata.
Lastly, we show that how a counter helps for affine finite automata by showing
that the language MANYTWINS, which is conjectured not to be recognized by
affine, quantum or classical finite state models in polynomial time, can be
recognized by affine counter automata with one-sided bounded-error in realtime.

 <dc:description>  We describe a set of $\Delta -1$ slopes that are universal for 1-bend planar
drawings of planar graphs of maximum degree $\Delta \geq 4$; this establishes a
new upper bound of $\Delta-1$ on the 1-bend planar slope number. By universal
we mean that every planar graph of degree $\Delta$ has a planar drawing with at
most one bend per edge and such that the slopes of the segments forming the
edges belong to the given set of slopes. This improves over previous results in
two ways: Firstly, the best previously known upper bound for the 1-bend planar
slope number was $\frac{3}{2} (\Delta -1)$ (the known lower bound being
$\frac{3}{4} (\Delta -1)$); secondly, all the known algorithms to construct
1-bend planar drawings with $O(\Delta)$ slopes use a different set of slopes
for each graph and can have bad angular resolution, while our algorithm uses a
universal set of slopes, which also guarantees that the minimum angle between
any two edges incident to a vertex is $\frac{\pi}{(\Delta-1)}$.

 <dc:description>  In the last decade, many business applications have moved into the cloud. In
particular, the &quot;database-as-a-service&quot; paradigm has become mainstream. While
existing multi-tenant data management systems focus on single-tenant query
processing, we believe that it is time to rethink how queries can be processed
across multiple tenants in such a way that we do not only gain more valuable
insights, but also at minimal cost. As we will argue in this paper, standard
SQL semantics are insufficient to process cross-tenant queries in an
unambiguous way, which is why existing systems use other, expensive means like
ETL or data integration. We first propose MTSQL, a set of extensions to
standard SQL, which fixes the ambiguity problem. Next, we present MTBase, a
query processing middleware that efficiently processes MTSQL on top of SQL. As
we will see, there is a canonical, provably correct, rewrite algorithm from
MTSQL to SQL, which may however result in poor query execution performance,
even on high-performance database products. We further show that with
carefully-designed optimizations, execution times can be reduced in such ways
that the difference to single-tenant queries becomes marginal.

 <dc:title>Are Comprehensive Quality Models Necessary for Evaluating Software
  Quality?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>D.2.9</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The concept of software quality is very complex and has many facets.
Reflecting all these facets and at the same time measuring everything related
to these facets results in comprehensive but large quality models and extensive
measurements. In contrast, there are also many smaller, focused quality models
claiming to evaluate quality with few measures.
  We investigate if and to what extent it is possible to build a focused
quality model with similar evaluation results as a comprehensive quality model
but with far less measures needed to be collected and, hence, reduced effort.
We make quality evaluations with the comprehensive Quamoco base quality model
and build focused quality models based on the same set of measures and data
from over 2,000 open source systems. We analyse the ability of the focused
model to predict the results of the Quamoco model by comparing them with a
random predictor as a baseline. We calculate the standardised accuracy measure
SA and effect sizes.
  We found that for the Quamoco model and its 378 automatically collected
measures, we can build a focused model with only 10 measures but an accuracy of
61% and a medium to high effect size. We conclude that we can build focused
quality models to get an impression of a system's quality similar to
comprehensive models. However, when including manually collected measures, the
accuracy of the models stayed below 50%. Hence, manual measures seem to have a
high impact and should therefore not be ignored in a focused model.

 <dc:description>  We study the inapproximability of the induced disjoint paths problem on an
arbitrary $n$-node $m$-edge undirected graph, which is to connect the maximum
number of the $k$ source-sink pairs given in the graph via induced disjoint
paths. It is known that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within
$m^{{1\over 2}-\varepsilon}$ for a general $k$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. In this
paper, we prove that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within
$n^{1-\varepsilon}$ for a general $k$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ by giving a
simple reduction from the independent set problem.

 <dc:description>  Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers and each year million cases of
skin cancer are treated. Treating and curing skin cancer is easy, if it is
diagnosed and treated at an early stage. In this work we propose an automatic
technique for skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images which helps in
classifying the skin cancer types. The proposed method comprises of two major
phases (1) preprocessing and (2) segmentation using semi-supervised learning
algorithm. In the preprocessing phase noise are removed using filtering
technique and in the segmentation phase skin lesions are segmented based on
clustering technique. K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the
preprocessed images and skin lesions are filtered from these clusters based on
the color feature. Color of the skin lesions are learned from the training
images using histograms calculations in RGB color space. The training images
were downloaded from the ISIC 2017 challenge website and the experimental
results were evaluated using validation and test sets.

 <dc:description>  Bug triage is an important step in the process of bug fixing. The goal of bug
triage is to assign a new-coming bug to the correct potential developer. The
existing bug triage approaches are based on machine learning algorithms, which
build classifiers from the training sets of bug reports. In practice, these
approaches suffer from the large-scale and low-quality training sets. In this
paper, we propose the training set reduction with both feature selection and
instance selection techniques for bug triage. We combine feature selection with
instance selection to improve the accuracy of bug triage. The feature selection
algorithm, instance selection algorithm Iterative Case Filter, and their
combinations are studied in this paper. We evaluate the training set reduction
on the bug data of Eclipse. For the training set, 70% words and 50% bug reports
are removed after the training set reduction. The experimental results show
that the new and small training sets can provide better accuracy than the
original one.

 <dc:description>  Many people dream to become famous, YouTube video makers also wish their
videos to have a large audience, and product retailers always hope to expose
their products to customers as many as possible. Do these seemingly different
phenomena share a common structure? We find that fame, popularity, or exposure,
could be modeled as a node's discoverability on some properly defined network,
and all of the previously mentioned phenomena can be commonly stated as a
target node wants to be discovered easily by the other nodes in the network. In
this work, we explicitly define a node's discoverability in a network, and
formulate a general node discoverability optimization problem, where the goal
is to create a budgeted set of incoming edges to the target node so as to
optimize the target node's discoverability in the network. Although the
optimization problem is proven to be NP-hard, we find that the defined
discoverability measures have good properties that enable us to use a greedy
algorithm to find provably near-optimal solutions. The computational complexity
of a greedy algorithm is dominated by the time cost of an oracle call, i.e.,
calculating the marginal gain of a node. To scale up the oracle call over large
networks, we propose an estimation-and-refinement approach, that provides a
good trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.
Experiments conducted on real-world networks demonstrate that our method is
thousands of times faster than an exact method using dynamic programming,
thereby allowing us to solve the node discoverability optimization problem on
large networks.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel deep learning architecture for regressing disparity from a
rectified pair of stereo images. We leverage knowledge of the problem's
geometry to form a cost volume using deep feature representations. We learn to
incorporate contextual information using 3-D convolutions over this volume.
Disparity values are regressed from the cost volume using a proposed
differentiable soft argmin operation, which allows us to train our method
end-to-end to sub-pixel accuracy without any additional post-processing or
regularization. We evaluate our method on the Scene Flow and KITTI datasets and
on KITTI we set a new state-of-the-art benchmark, while being significantly
faster than competing approaches.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel technique that allows for both computationally
fast and sufficiently plausible simulation of vehicles with non-deformable
tracks. The method is based on an effect we have called Contact Surface Motion.
A comparison with several other methods for simulation of tracked vehicle
dynamics is presented with the aim to evaluate methods that are available
off-the-shelf or with minimum effort in general-purpose robotics simulators.
The proposed method is implemented as a plugin for the open-source
physics-based simulator Gazebo using the Open Dynamics Engine.

 <dc:description>  Advances in Machine Learning (ML) have led to its adoption as an integral
component in many applications, including banking, medical diagnosis, and
driverless cars. To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services
offered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service
tools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to
adversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the
classifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that
adversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another
classifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different
architectures or are trained on disjoint datasets. This property, which is
known as transferability, opens up the possibility of attacking black-box
systems by generating adversarial examples on a substitute classifier and
transferring the examples to the target classifier. Therefore, the key to
protect black-box learning systems against the adversarial examples is to block
their transferability. To this end, we propose a training method that, as the
input is more perturbed, the classifier smoothly outputs lower confidence on
the original label and instead predicts that the input is &quot;invalid&quot;. In
essence, we augment the output class set with a NULL label and train the
classifier to reject the adversarial examples by classifying them as NULL. In
experiments, we apply a wide range of attacks based on adversarial examples on
the black-box systems. We show that a classifier trained with the proposed
method effectively resists against the adversarial examples, while maintaining
the accuracy on clean data.

 <dc:description>  Given a set $S$ of $n$ line segments in the plane, we say that a region
$\mathcal{R}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ is a {\em stabber} for $S$ if $\mathcal{R}$
contains exactly one endpoint of each segment of $S$. In this paper we provide
optimal or near-optimal algorithms for reporting all combinatorially different
stabbers for several shapes of stabbers. Specifically, we consider the case in
which the stabber can be described as the intersection of axis-parallel
halfplanes (thus the stabbers are halfplanes, strips, quadrants, $3$-sided
rectangles, or rectangles). The running times are $O(n)$ (for the halfplane
case), $O(n\log n)$ (for strips, quadrants, and 3-sided rectangles), and $O(n^2
\log n)$ (for rectangles).

 <dc:description>  This paper describes two supervised baseline systems for the Story Cloze Test
Shared Task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a). We first build a classifier using
features based on word embeddings and semantic similarity computation. We
further implement a neural LSTM system with different encoding strategies that
try to model the relation between the story and the provided endings. Our
experiments show that a model using representation features based on average
word embedding vectors over the given story words and the candidate ending
sentences words, joint with similarity features between the story and candidate
ending representations performed better than the neural models. Our best model
achieves an accuracy of 72.42, ranking 3rd in the official evaluation.

 <dc:description>  The point of this paper is to question typical assumptions in deep learning
and suggest alternatives. A particular contribution is to prove that even if a
Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder is good at reconstructing pictures, it is
not necessarily good at discriminating their classes. When using Auto-Encoders,
intuitively one assumes that features which are good for reconstruction will
also lead to high classification accuracy. Indeed, it became research practice
and is a suggested strategy by introductory books. However, we prove that this
is not always the case. We thoroughly investigate the quality of features
produced by Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoders when trained to reconstruct
their input. In particular, we analyze the relation between the reconstruction
and classification capabilities of the network, if we were to use the same
features for both tasks. Experimental results suggest that in fact, there is no
correlation between the reconstruction score and the quality of features for a
classification task. This means, more formally, that the sub-dimension
representation space learned from the Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder (while
being trained for input reconstruction) is not necessarily better separable
than the initial input space. Furthermore, we show that the reconstruction
error is not a good metric to assess the quality of features, because it is
biased by the decoder quality. We do not question the usefulness of
pre-training, but we conclude that aiming for the lowest reconstruction error
is not necessarily a good idea if afterwards one performs a classification
task.

 <dc:description>  Linear codes with complementary duals (abbreviated LCD) are linear codes
whose intersection with their dual are trivial. When they are binary, they play
an important role in armoring implementations against side-channel attacks and
fault injection attacks. Non-binary LCD codes in characteristic 2 can be
transformed into binary LCD codes by expansion. In this paper, we introduce a
general construction of LCD codes from any linear codes. Further, we show that
any linear code over $\mathbb F_{q} (q&gt;3)$ is equivalent to an Euclidean LCD
code and any linear code over $\mathbb F_{q^2} (q&gt;2)$ is equivalent to a
Hermitian LCD code. Consequently an $[n,k,d]$-linear Euclidean LCD code over
$\mathbb F_q$ with $q&gt;3$ exists if there is an $[n,k,d]$-linear code over
$\mathbb F_q$ and an $[n,k,d]$-linear Hermitian LCD code over $\mathbb F_{q^2}$
with $q&gt;2$ exists if there is an $[n,k,d]$-linear code over $\mathbb F_{q^2}$.
Hence, when $q&gt;3$ (resp.$q&gt;2$) $q$-ary Euclidean (resp. $q^2$-ary Hermitian)
LCD codes possess the same asymptotical bound as $q$-ary linear codes (resp.
$q^2$-ary linear codes). Finally, we present an approach of constructing LCD
codes by extending linear codes.

 <dc:description>  Multi-class segmentation of vertebrae is a non-trivial task mainly due to the
high correlation in the appearance of adjacent vertebrae. Hence, such a task
calls for the consideration of both global and local context. Based on this
motivation, we propose a two-staged approach that, given a computed tomography
dataset of the spine, segments the five lumbar vertebrae and simultaneously
labels them. The first stage employs a multi-layered perceptron performing
non-linear regression for locating the lumbar region using the global context.
The second stage, comprised of a fully-convolutional deep network, exploits the
local context in the localised lumbar region to segment and label the lumbar
vertebrae in one go. Aided with practical data augmentation for training, our
approach is highly generalisable, capable of successfully segmenting both
healthy and abnormal vertebrae (fractured and scoliotic spines). We
consistently achieve an average Dice coefficient of over 90 percent on a
publicly available dataset of the xVertSeg segmentation challenge of MICCAI
2016. This is particularly noteworthy because the xVertSeg dataset is beset
with severe deformities in the form of vertebral fractures and scoliosis.

 <dc:description>  A $K_T \times K_R$ cache-aided wireless interference network, in which both
the transmitters and the receivers are equipped with cache memories is studied.
Each user requests one file from a library of $N$ popular files. The goal is to
design the cache contents without the knowledge of the particular user demands,
such that all possible demand combinations can be satisfied reliably over the
interference channel. The achievable sum degrees-of-freedom ($\mathrm{sDoF}$)
and the normalized delivery time (NDT) are studied for centralized and
decentralized network architectures, respectively. First, using a combination
of interference alignment (IA), zero-forcing (ZF) and interference cancellation
(IC) techniques, a novel caching and transmission scheme for centralized
networks is introduced, and it is shown to improve the $\mathrm{sDoF}$ upon the
state-of-the-art. Then, the NDT is studied when the content placement at the
receiver caches is carried out in a decentralized manner. Our results indicate
that, for this particular network architecture, caches located at the receiver
side are more effective than those at the transmitter side in order to reduce
the NDT.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This study presents a meshless-based local reanalysis (MLR) method. The
purpose of this study is to extend reanalysis methods to the Kriging
interpolation meshless method due to its high efficiency. In this study, two
reanalysis methods: combined approximations CA) and indirect factorization
updating (IFU) methods are utilized. Considering the computational cost of
meshless methods, the reanalysis method improves the efficiency of the full
meshless method significantly. Compared with finite element method (FEM)-based
reanalysis methods, the main superiority of meshless-based reanalysis method is
to break the limitation of mesh connection. The meshless-based reanalysis is
much easier to obtain the stiffness matrix even for solving the mesh distortion
problems. However, compared with the FEM-based reanalysis method, the critical
challenge is to use much more nodes in the influence domain due to high order
interpolation. Therefore, a local reanalysis method which only needs to
calculate the local stiffness matrix in the influence domain is suggested to
improve the efficiency further. Several typical numerical examples are tested
and the performance of the suggested method is verified.

 <dc:title>Toward a Formal Model of Cognitive Synergy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Goertzel, Ben</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  &quot;Cognitive synergy&quot; refers to a dynamic in which multiple cognitive
processes, cooperating to control the same cognitive system, assist each other
in overcoming bottlenecks encountered during their internal processing.
Cognitive synergy has been posited as a key feature of real-world general
intelligence, and has been used explicitly in the design of the OpenCog
cognitive architecture. Here category theory and related concepts are used to
give a formalization of the cognitive synergy concept.
  A series of formal models of intelligent agents is proposed, with increasing
specificity and complexity: simple reinforcement learning agents; &quot;cognit&quot;
agents with an abstract memory and processing model; hypergraph-based agents
(in which &quot;cognit&quot; operations are carried out via hypergraphs); hypergraph
agents with a rich language of nodes and hyperlinks (such as the OpenCog
framework provides); &quot;PGMC&quot; agents whose rich hypergraphs are endowed with
cognitive processes guided via Probabilistic Growth and Mining of Combinations;
and finally variations of the PrimeAGI design, which is currently being built
on top of OpenCog.
  A notion of cognitive synergy is developed for cognitive processes acting
within PGMC agents, based on developing a formal notion of &quot;stuckness,&quot; and
defining synergy as a relationship between cognitive processes in which they
can help each other out when they get stuck. It is proposed that cognitive
processes relating to each other synergetically, associate in a certain way
with functors that map into each other via natural transformations. Cognitive
synergy is proposed to correspond to a certain inequality regarding the
relative costs of different paths through certain commutation diagrams.
  Applications of this notion of cognitive synergy to particular cognitive
phenomena, and specific cognitive processes in the PrimeAGI design, are
discussed.

 <dc:description>  We approach structured output prediction by optimizing a deep value network
(DVN) to precisely estimate the task loss on different output configurations
for a given input. Once the model is trained, we perform inference by gradient
descent on the continuous relaxations of the output variables to find outputs
with promising scores from the value network. When applied to image
segmentation, the value network takes an image and a segmentation mask as
inputs and predicts a scalar estimating the intersection over union between the
input and ground truth masks. For multi-label classification, the DVN's
objective is to correctly predict the F1 score for any potential label
configuration. The DVN framework achieves the state-of-the-art results on
multi-label prediction and image segmentation benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Melanoma, a malignant form of skin cancer is very threatening to life.
Diagnosis of melanoma at an earlier stage is highly needed as it has a very
high cure rate. Benign and malignant forms of skin cancer can be detected by
analyzing the lesions present on the surface of the skin using dermoscopic
images. In this work, an automated skin lesion detection system has been
developed which learns the representation of the image using Google's
pretrained CNN model known as Inception-v3 \cite{cnn}. After obtaining the
representation vector for our input dermoscopic images we have trained two
layer feed forward neural network to classify the images as malignant or
benign. The system also classifies the images based on the cause of the cancer
either due to melanocytic or non-melanocytic cells using a different neural
network. These classification tasks are part of the challenge organized by
International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017. Our system learns to
classify the images based on the model built using the training images given in
the challenge and the experimental results were evaluated using validation and
test sets. Our system has achieved an overall accuracy of 65.8\% for the
validation set.

 <dc:title>Towards Efficient Verification of Population Protocols</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Population protocols are a well established model of computation by
anonymous, identical finite state agents. A protocol is well-specified if from
every initial configuration, all fair executions reach a common consensus. The
central verification question for population protocols is the
well-specification problem: deciding if a given protocol is well-specified.
Esparza et al. have recently shown that this problem is decidable, but with
very high complexity: it is at least as hard as the Petri net reachability
problem, which is EXPSPACE-hard, and for which only algorithms of non-primitive
recursive complexity are currently known.
  In this paper we introduce the class WS3 of well-specified strongly-silent
protocols and we prove that it is suitable for automatic verification. More
precisely, we show that WS3 has the same computational power as general
well-specified protocols, and captures standard protocols from the literature.
Moreover, we show that the membership problem for WS3 reduces to solving
boolean combinations of linear constraints over N. This allowed us to develop
the first software able to automatically prove well-specification for all of
the infinitely many possible inputs.

 <dc:title>Symbol Grounding via Chaining of Morphisms</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new model of symbol grounding is presented, in which the structures of
natural language, logical semantics, perception and action are represented
categorically, and symbol grounding is modeled via the composition of morphisms
between the relevant categories. This model gives conceptual insight into the
fundamentally systematic nature of symbol grounding, and also connects
naturally to practical real-world AI systems in current research and commercial
use. Specifically, it is argued that the structure of linguistic syntax can be
modeled as a certain asymmetric monoidal category, as e.g. implicit in the link
grammar formalism; the structure of spatiotemporal relationships and action
plans can be modeled similarly using &quot;image grammars&quot; and &quot;action grammars&quot;;
and common-sense logical semantic structure can be modeled using
dependently-typed lambda calculus with uncertain truth values. Given these
formalisms, the grounding of linguistic descriptions in spatiotemporal
perceptions and coordinated actions consists of following morphisms from
language to logic through to spacetime and body (for comprehension), and vice
versa (for generation). The mapping is indicated between the spatial
relationships in the Region Connection Calculus and Allen Interval Algebra and
corresponding entries in the link grammar syntax parsing dictionary. Further,
the abstractions introduced here are shown to naturally model the structures
and systems currently being deployed in the context of using the OpenCog
cognitive architecture to control Hanson Robotics humanoid robots.

 <dc:description>  During the past years, psychological diseases related to unhealthy work
environments, such as burnouts, have drawn more and more public attention. One
of the known causes of these affective problems is time pressure. In order to
form a theoretical background for time pressure detection in software
repositories, this paper combines interdisciplinary knowledge by analyzing 1270
papers found on Scopus database and containing terms related to time pressure.
By clustering those papers based on their abstract, we show that time pressure
has been widely studied across different fields, but relatively little in
software engineering. From a literature review of the most relevant papers, we
infer a list of testable hypotheses that we want to verify in future studies in
order to assess the impact of time pressures on software developers mental
health.

achieve a given SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio), whatever the
users locations, on the area covered by the base station. The closed form
expression of the BS transmit power allows to establish quality of service

 <dc:description>  Minimizing non-convex and high-dimensional objective functions is
challenging, especially when training modern deep neural networks. In this
paper, a novel approach is proposed which divides the training process into two
consecutive phases to obtain better generalization performance: Bayesian
sampling and stochastic optimization. The first phase is to explore the energy
landscape and to capture the &quot;fat&quot; modes; and the second one is to fine-tune
the parameter learned from the first phase. In the Bayesian learning phase, we
apply continuous tempering and stochastic approximation into the Langevin
dynamics to create an efficient and effective sampler, in which the temperature
is adjusted automatically according to the designed &quot;temperature dynamics&quot;.
These strategies can overcome the challenge of early trapping into bad local
minima and have achieved remarkable improvements in various types of neural
networks as shown in our theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we study theoretical models of \emph{programmable matter}
systems. The systems under consideration consist of spherical modules, kept
together by magnetic forces and able to perform two minimal mechanical
operations (or movements): \emph{rotate} around a neighbor and \emph{slide}
over a line. In terms of modeling, there are $n$ nodes arranged in a
2-dimensional grid and forming some initial \emph{shape}. The goal is for the
initial shape $A$ to \emph{transform} to some target shape $B$ by a sequence of
movements. Most of the paper focuses on \emph{transformability} questions,
meaning whether it is in principle feasible to transform a given shape to
another. We first consider the case in which only rotation is available to the
nodes. Our main result is that deciding whether two given shapes $A$ and $B$
can be transformed to each other, is in $\mathbf{P}$. We then insist on
rotation only and impose the restriction that the nodes must maintain global
connectivity throughout the transformation. We prove that the corresponding
transformability question is in $\mathbf{PSPACE}$ and study the problem of
determining the minimum \emph{seeds} that can make feasible, otherwise
infeasible transformations. Next we allow both rotations and slidings and prove
universality: any two connected shapes $A,B$ of the same order, can be
transformed to each other without breaking connectivity. The worst-case number
of movements of the generic strategy is $\Omega(n^2)$. We improve this to
$O(n)$ parallel time, by a pipelining strategy, and prove optimality of both by
matching lower bounds. In the last part of the paper, we turn our attention to
distributed transformations. The nodes are now distributed processes able to
perform communicate-compute-move rounds. We provide distributed algorithms for
a general type of transformations.

 <dc:title>Cost-Based Intuitionist Probabilities on Spaces of Graphs, Hypergraphs
  and Theorems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Goertzel, Ben</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A novel partial order is defined on the space of digraphs or hypergraphs,
based on assessing the cost of producing a graph via a sequence of elementary
transformations. Leveraging work by Knuth and Skilling on the foundations of
inference, and the structure of Heyting algebras on graph space, this partial
order is used to construct an intuitionistic probability measure that applies
to either digraphs or hypergraphs. As logical inference steps can be
represented as transformations on hypergraphs representing logical statements,
this also yields an intuitionistic probability measure on spaces of theorems.
The central result is also extended to yield intuitionistic probabilities based
on more general weighted rule systems defined over bicartesian closed
categories.

 <dc:description>  Bayesian optimization has been successful at global optimization of
expensive-to-evaluate multimodal objective functions. However, unlike most
optimization methods, Bayesian optimization typically does not use derivative
information. In this paper we show how Bayesian optimization can exploit
derivative information to decrease the number of objective function evaluations
required for good performance. In particular, we develop a novel Bayesian
optimization algorithm, the derivative-enabled knowledge-gradient (dKG), for
which we show one-step Bayes-optimality, asymptotic consistency, and greater
one-step value of information than is possible in the derivative-free setting.
Our procedure accommodates noisy and incomplete derivative information, comes
in both sequential and batch forms, and can optionally reduce the computational
cost of inference through automatically selected retention of a single
directional derivative. We also compute the d-KG acquisition function and its
gradient using a novel fast discretization-free technique. We show d-KG
provides state-of-the-art performance compared to a wide range of optimization
procedures with and without gradients, on benchmarks including logistic
regression, deep learning, kernel learning, and k-nearest neighbors.

 <dc:description>  Fusion of heterogeneous extroceptive sensors is the most effient and
effective way to representing the environment precisely, as it overcomes
various defects of each homogeneous sensor. The rigid transformation (aka.
extrinsic parameters) of heterogeneous sensory systems should be available
before precisely fusing the multisensor information. Researchers have proposed
several approaches to estimating the extrinsic parameters. These approaches
require either auxiliary objects, like chessboards, or extra help from human to
select correspondences. In this paper, we proposed a novel extrinsic
calibration approach for the extrinsic calibration of range and image sensors.
As far as we know, it is the first automatic approach with no requirement of
auxiliary objects or any human interventions. First, we estimate the initial
extrinsic parameters from the individual motion of the range finder and the
camera. Then we extract lines in the image and point-cloud pairs, to refine the
line feature associations by the initial extrinsic parameters. At the end, we
discussed the degenerate case which may lead to the algorithm failure and

 <dc:description>  To see color, the human visual system combines the response of three types of
cone cells in the retina - a compressive process that discards a significant
amount of spectral information. Here, we present an approach to enhance human
color vision by breaking its inherent binocular redundancy, providing different
spectral content to each eye. We fabricated and tested a set of optical filters
that &quot;splits&quot; the response of the short-wavelength cone between the two eyes in
individuals with typical trichromatic vision, simulating the presence of
approximately four distinct cone types (&quot;tetrachromacy&quot;). Such an increase in
the number of simulated cone types can reduce the prevalence of metamers -
pairs of distinct spectra that resolve to the same perceived color. This
technique may result in an enhancement of spectral perception, with
applications ranging from camouflage detection and anti-counterfeiting to new
types of artwork and data visualization.

 <dc:description>  With the availability of more powerful computers, iterative reconstruction
algorithms are the subject of an ongoing work in the design of more efficient
reconstruction algorithms for X-ray computed tomography. In this work, we show
how two analytical reconstruction algorithms can be improved by correcting the
corresponding reconstructions using a randomized iterative reconstruction
algorithm. The combined analytical reconstruction followed by randomized
iterative reconstruction can also be viewed as a reconstruction algorithm
which, in the experiments we have conducted, uses up to $35\%$ less projection
angles as compared to the analytical reconstruction algorithms and produces the
same results in terms of quality of reconstruction, without increasing the
execution time significantly.

 <dc:description>  Due to the importance of zero-shot learning, the number of proposed
approaches has increased steadily recently. We argue that it is time to take a
step back and to analyze the status quo of the area. The purpose of this paper
is three-fold. First, given the fact that there is no agreed upon zero-shot
learning benchmark, we first define a new benchmark by unifying both the
evaluation protocols and data splits. This is an important contribution as
published results are often not comparable and sometimes even flawed due to,
e.g. pre-training on zero-shot test classes. Second, we compare and analyze a
significant number of the state-of-the-art methods in depth, both in the
classic zero-shot setting but also in the more realistic generalized zero-shot
setting. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current status of the area
which can be taken as a basis for advancing it.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a frequency synchronization scheme for multiuser
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink with a large-scale
uniform linear array (ULA) at base station (BS) by exploiting the angle
information of users. Considering that the incident signal at BS from each user
can be restricted within a certain angular spread, the proposed scheme could
perform carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation for each user individually
through a \textit{joint spatial-frequency alignment} procedure and can be
completed efficiently with the aided of fast Fourier transform (FFT). A
multi-branch receive beamforming is further designed to yield an equivalent
single user transmission model for which the conventional single-user channel
estimation and data detection can be carried out. To make the study complete,
the theoretical performance analysis of the CFO estimation is also conducted.
We further develop a user grouping scheme to deal with the unexpected scenarios
that some users may not be separated well from the spatial domain. Finally,
various numerical results are provided to verify the proposed studies.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a generalization of the recently introduced Successive
Cancellation Flip (SCFlip) decoding of polar codes, characterized by a number
of extra decoding attempts, where one or several positions are flipped from the
standard Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding. To make such an approach
effective, we first introduce the concept of higher-order bit-flips, and
propose a new metric to determine the bit-flips that are more likely to correct
the trajectory of the SC decoding. We then propose a generalized SCFlip
decoding algorithm, referred to as Dynamic-SCFlip (D-SCFlip), which dynamically
builds a list of candidate bit-flips, while guaranteeing that extra decoding
attempts are performed by decreasing probability of success. Simulation results
show that D-SCFlip is an effective alternative to SC-List decoding of polar
codes, by providing very good error correcting performance, with an average
computation complexity close to the one of the SC decoder.

 <dc:description>  Formal languages theory is useful for the study of natural language. In
particular, it is of interest to study the adequacy of the grammatical
formalisms to express syntactic phenomena present in natural language. First,
it helps to draw hypothesis about the nature and complexity of the
speaker-hearer linguistic competence, a fundamental question in linguistics and
other cognitive sciences. Moreover, from an engineering point of view, it
allows the knowledge of practical limitations of applications based on those
formalisms. In this article I introduce the adequacy problem of grammatical
formalisms for natural language, also introducing some formal language theory
concepts required for this discussion. Then, I review the formalisms that have
been proposed in history, and the arguments that have been given to support or
reject their adequacy.

 <dc:description>  The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new preprocessing step in
order to improve local feature descriptors and texture classification.
Preprocessing is implemented by using transformations which help highlight
salient features that play a significant role in texture recognition. We
evaluate and compare four different competing methods: three different
anisotropic diffusion methods including the classical anisotropic Perona-Malik
diffusion and two subsequent regularizations of it and the application of a
Gaussian kernel, which is the classical multiscale approach in texture
analysis. The combination of the transformed images and the original ones are
analyzed. The results show that the use of the preprocessing step does lead to
improved texture recognition.

 <dc:description>  Guetzli is a new JPEG encoder that aims to produce visually indistinguishable
images at a lower bit-rate than other common JPEG encoders. It optimizes both
the JPEG global quantization tables and the DCT coefficient values in each JPEG
block using a closed-loop optimizer. Guetzli uses Butteraugli, our perceptual
distance metric, as the source of feedback in its optimization process. We
reach a 29-45% reduction in data size for a given perceptual distance,
according to Butteraugli, in comparison to other compressors we tried.
Guetzli's computation is currently extremely slow, which limits its
applicability to compressing static content and serving as a proof- of-concept
that we can achieve significant reductions in size by combining advanced
psychovisual models with lossy compression techniques.

 <dc:description>  Higher-order recursion schemes (HORS) have received much attention as a
useful abstraction of higher-order functional programs with a number of new
verification techniques employing HORS model-checking as their centrepiece. We
give an account of the C-SHORe tool, which contributed to the ongoing quest for
a truly scalable model-checker for HORS by offering a different, automata
theoretic perspective. C-SHORe implements the first practical model-checking
algorithm that acts on a generalisation of pushdown automata equi-expressive
with HORS called collapsible pushdown systems (CPDS). At its core is a
backwards saturation algorithm for CPDS. Additionally, it is able to use
information gathered from an approximate forward reachability analysis to guide
its backward search. Moreover, it uses an algorithm that prunes the CPDS prior
to model-checking and a method for extracting counter-examples in negative
instances. We provide an up-to-date comparison of C-SHORe with the
state-of-the-art verification tools for HORS. The tool and additional material
are available from http://cshore.cs.rhul.ac.uk.

 <dc:description>  Network Function Virtualization is considered one of the key technologies for
developing the future mobile networks. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
framework to evaluate the performance of an LTE virtualized Mobility Management
Entity (vMME) hosted in a data center. This theoretical framework consists of
i) a queuing network to model the vMME in a data center, and ii) analytic
expressions to estimate the overall mean system delay and the signaling
workload to be processed by the vMME. We validate our mathematical model by
simulation. One direct use of the proposed model is vMME dimensioning, i.e., to
compute the number of vMME processing instances to provide a target system
delay given the number of users in the system. Additionally, the paper includes
a scalability analysis of the system. In our study, we consider the billing
model and a data center setup of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service, and
estimate experimentally the processing time of MME processing instances for
different LTE control procedures. For the considered setup, our results show
that a vMME is scalable for signaling workloads up to 37000 LTE control
procedures per second for a target mean system delay of 1 ms. The database
performance assumed imposes this limit in the system scalability.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient solver for diffeomorphic image registration problems
in the framework of Large Deformations Diffeomorphic Metric Mappings (LDDMM).
We use an optimal control formulation, in which the velocity field of a
hyperbolic PDE needs to be found such that the distance between the final state
of the system (the transformed/transported template image) and the observation
(the reference image) is minimized. Our solver supports both stationary and
non-stationary (i.e., transient or time-dependent) velocity fields. As
transformation models, we consider both the transport equation (assuming
intensities are preserved during the deformation) and the continuity equation
(assuming mass-preservation).
  We consider the reduced form of the optimal control problem and solve the
resulting unconstrained optimization problem using a discretize-then-optimize
approach. A key contribution is the elimination of the PDE constraint using a
Lagrangian hyperbolic PDE solver. Lagrangian methods rely on the concept of
characteristic curves that we approximate here using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta
method. We also present an efficient algorithm for computing the derivatives of
final state of the system with respect to the velocity field. This allows us to
use fast Gauss-Newton based methods. We present quickly converging iterative
linear solvers using spectral preconditioners that render the overall
optimization efficient and scalable. Our method is embedded into the image
registration framework FAIR and, thus, supports the most commonly used
similarity measures and regularization functionals. We demonstrate the
potential of our new approach using several synthetic and real world test
problems with up to 14.7 million degrees of freedom.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of estimating human pose and body shape from 3D scans
over time. Reliable estimation of 3D body shape is necessary for many
applications including virtual try-on, health monitoring, and avatar creation
for virtual reality. Scanning bodies in minimal clothing, however, presents a
practical barrier to these applications. We address this problem by estimating
body shape under clothing from a sequence of 3D scans. Previous methods that
have exploited body models produce smooth shapes lacking personalized details.
We contribute a new approach to recover a personalized shape of the person. The
estimated shape deviates from a parametric model to fit the 3D scans. We
demonstrate the method using high quality 4D data as well as sequences of
visual hulls extracted from multi-view images. We also make available BUFF, a
new 4D dataset that enables quantitative evaluation
(http://buff.is.tue.mpg.de). Our method outperforms the state of the art in
both pose estimation and shape estimation, qualitatively and quantitatively.

 <dc:title>P?=NP as minimization of degree 4 polynomial, plane or sphere
  intersection with $\{0,1\}^n$, integration or Grassmann number problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Duda, Jarek</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  While the P vs NP problem is mainly approached form the point of view of
discrete mathematics, this paper proposes reformulations into the field of
abstract algebra, geometry, fourier analysis and of continuous global
optimization - which advanced tools might bring new perspectives and approaches
for this question. The first one is equivalence of satisfaction of 3-SAT
problem with the question of reaching zero of a nonnegative degree 4
multivariate polynomial (sum of squares), what could be tested from the
perspective of algebra by using discriminant. It could be also approached as a
continuous global optimization problem inside $[0,1]^n$, for example in
physical realizations like adiabatic quantum computers. However, the number of
local minima usually grows exponentially. Reducing to degree 2 polynomial plus
constraints of being in $\{0,1\}^n$, we get geometric formulations as the
question if plane or sphere intersects with $\{0,1\}^n$. There will be also
presented some non-standard perspectives for the Subset-Sum, like through
convergence of a series, or zeroing of $\int_0^{2\pi} \prod_i \cos(\varphi k_i)
d\varphi $ fourier-type integral for some natural $k_i$. The last discussed
approach is using anti-commuting Grassmann numbers $\theta_i$, making $(A \cdot
\textrm{diag}(\theta_i))^n$ nonzero only if $A$ has a Hamilton cycle. Hence,
the P$\ne$NP assumption implies exponential growth of matrix representation of
Grassmann numbers. There will be also discussed a looking promising
algebraic/geometric approach to the graph isomorphism problem.

 <dc:title>Information geometry, simulation and complexity in Gaussian random
  fields</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Levada, Alexandre L. M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Random fields are useful mathematical objects in the characterization of
non-deterministic complex systems. A fundamental issue in the evolution of
dynamical systems is how intrinsic properties of such structures change in
time. In this paper, we propose to quantify how changes in the spatial
dependence structure affect the Riemannian metric tensor that equips the
model's parametric space. Defining Fisher curves, we measure the variations in
each component of the metric tensor when visiting different entropic states of
the system. Simulations show that the geometric deformations induced by the
metric tensor in case of a decrease in the inverse temperature are not
reversible for an increase of the same amount, provided there is significant
variation in the system entropy: the process of taking a system from a lower
entropy state A to a higher entropy state B and then bringing it back to A,
induces a natural intrinsic one-way direction of evolution. In this context,
Fisher curves resemble mathematical models of hysteresis in which the natural
orientation is pointed by an arrow of time.

 <dc:title>Bicriteria Rectilinear Shortest Paths among Rectilinear Obstacles in the
  Plane</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Haitao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a rectilinear domain $\mathcal{P}$ of $h$ pairwise-disjoint rectilinear
obstacles with a total of $n$ vertices in the plane, we study the problem of
computing bicriteria rectilinear shortest paths between two points $s$ and $t$
in $\mathcal{P}$. Three types of bicriteria rectilinear paths are considered:
minimum-link shortest paths, shortest minimum-link paths, and minimum-cost
paths where the cost of a path is a non-decreasing function of both the number
of edges and the length of the path. The one-point and two-point path queries
are also considered. Algorithms for these problems have been given previously.
Our contributions are threefold. First, we find a critical error in all
previous algorithms. Second, we correct the error in a not-so-trivial way.
Third, we further improve the algorithms so that they are even faster than the
previous (incorrect) algorithms when $h$ is relatively small. For example, for
the minimum-link shortest paths, we obtain the following results. Our algorithm
computes a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path in $O(n+h\log^{3/2} h)$ time. For
the one-point queries, we build a data structure of size $O(n+ h\log h)$ in
$O(n+h\log^{3/2} h)$ time for a source point $s$, such that given any query
point $t$, a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path can be determined in $O(\log
n)$ time. For the two-point queries, with $O(n+h^2\log^2 h)$ time and space
preprocessing, a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path can be determined in
$O(\log n+\log^2 h)$ time for any two query points $s$ and $t$; alternatively,
with $O(n+h^2\cdot \log^{2} h \cdot 4^{\sqrt{\log h}})$ time and $O(n+h^2\cdot
\log h \cdot 4^{\sqrt{\log h}})$ space preprocessing, we can answer each
two-point query in $O(\log n)$ time.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present a compact, modular framework for constructing novel
recurrent neural architectures. Our basic module is a new generic unit, the
Transition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU). In addition to hidden layer
activations, TBRUs have discrete state dynamics that allow network connections
to be built dynamically as a function of intermediate activations. By
connecting multiple TBRUs, we can extend and combine commonly used
architectures such as sequence-to-sequence, attention mechanisms, and
re-cursive tree-structured models. A TBRU can also serve as both an encoder for
downstream tasks and as a decoder for its own task simultaneously, resulting in
more accurate multi-task learning. We call our approach Dynamic Recurrent
Acyclic Graphical Neural Networks, or DRAGNN. We show that DRAGNN is
significantly more accurate and efficient than seq2seq with attention for
syntactic dependency parsing and yields more accurate multi-task learning for
extractive summarization tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the scientometric evaluation of faculty members of 50 Greek
Science and Engineering University Departments is presented. 1978 academics
were examined in total. The number of papers, citations, h-index and i10-index
have been collected for each academic, department, school and university using
Google Scholar and the citations analysis program Publish or Perish. Analysis
of the collected data showed that departments of the same academic discipline
are characterized by significant differences on the scientific outcome. In
addition, in the majority of the evaluated departments a significant difference
in h-index between academics who report scientific activity on the departments
website and those who do not, was observed. Moreover, academics who earned
their PhD title in the USA demonstrate higher indices in comparison to scholars
who obtained their PhD title in Europe or in Greece. Finally, the correlation
between the academic rank and the scholars h-index (or the number of their
citations) is quite low in some departments, which, under specific
circumstances, could be an indication of the lack of meritocracy.

 <dc:description>  We explore inflectional morphology as an example of the relationship of the
discrete and the continuous in linguistics. The grammar requests a form of a
lexeme by specifying a set of feature values, which corresponds to a corner M
of a hypercube in feature value space. The morphology responds to that request
by providing a morpheme, or a set of morphemes, whose vector sum is
geometrically closest to the corner M. In short, the chosen morpheme $\mu$ is
the morpheme (or set of morphemes) that maximizes the inner product of $\mu$
and M.

 <dc:description>  Spambot detection in online social networks is a long-lasting challenge
involving the study and design of detection techniques capable of efficiently
identifying ever-evolving spammers. Recently, a new wave of social spambots has
emerged, with advanced human-like characteristics that allow them to go
undetected even by current state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we show
that efficient spambots detection can be achieved via an in-depth analysis of
their collective behaviors exploiting the digital DNA technique for modeling
the behaviors of social network users. Inspired by its biological counterpart,
in the digital DNA representation the behavioral lifetime of a digital account
is encoded in a sequence of characters. Then, we define a similarity measure
for such digital DNA sequences. We build upon digital DNA and the similarity
between groups of users to characterize both genuine accounts and spambots.
Leveraging such characterization, we design the Social Fingerprinting
technique, which is able to discriminate among spambots and genuine accounts in
both a supervised and an unsupervised fashion. We finally evaluate the
effectiveness of Social Fingerprinting and we compare it with three
state-of-the-art detection algorithms. Among the peculiarities of our approach
is the possibility to apply off-the-shelf DNA analysis techniques to study
online users behaviors and to efficiently rely on a limited number of
lightweight account characteristics.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes an application of reinforcement learning to the mention

detection task, in which a model can flexibly revise past labeling decisions by
grouping together tokens and assigning partial mention labels. We devise a
method to create mention-level episodes and we train a model by rewarding
correctly labeled complete mentions, irrespective of the inner structure
created. The model yields results which are on par with a competitive
supervised counterpart while being more flexible in terms of achieving targeted
behavior through reward modeling and generating internal mention structure,
especially on longer mentions.

 <dc:description>  In modern power systems, the operating point, at which the demand and supply
are balanced, may take different values due to changes in loads and renewable
generation levels. Understanding the dynamics of stressed power systems with a
range of operating points would be essential to assuring their reliable
operation, and possibly allow higher integration of renewable resources. This
letter introduces a non-traditional way to think about the stability assessment
problem of power systems. Instead of estimating the set of initial states
leading to a given operating condition, we characterize the set of operating
conditions that a power grid converges to from a given initial state under
changes in power injections and lines. We term this problem as &quot;inverse
stability&quot;, a problem which is rarely addressed in the control and systems
literature, and hence, poorly understood. Exploiting quadratic approximations
of the system's energy function, we introduce an estimate of the inverse
stability region. Also, we briefly describe three important applications of the
inverse stability notion: (i) robust stability assessment of power systems
w.r.t. different renewable generation levels, (ii) stability-constrained
optimal power flow (sOPF), and (iii) stability-guaranteed corrective action
design.

 <dc:title>Comparison of echo state network output layer classification methods on
  noisy data</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Prater, Ashley</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Echo state networks are a recently developed type of recurrent neural network
where the internal layer is fixed with random weights, and only the output
layer is trained on specific data. Echo state networks are increasingly being
used to process spatiotemporal data in real-world settings, including speech
recognition, event detection, and robot control. A strength of echo state
networks is the simple method used to train the output layer - typically a
collection of linear readout weights found using a least squares approach.
Although straightforward to train and having a low computational cost to use,
this method may not yield acceptable accuracy performance on noisy data.
  This study compares the performance of three echo state network output layer
methods to perform classification on noisy data: using trained linear weights,
using sparse trained linear weights, and using trained low-rank approximations
of reservoir states. The methods are investigated experimentally on both
synthetic and natural datasets. The experiments suggest that using regularized
least squares to train linear output weights is superior on data with low
noise, but using the low-rank approximations may significantly improve accuracy
on datasets contaminated with higher noise levels.

 <dc:description>  The Entity Disambiguation and Linking (EDL) task matches entity mentions in
text to a unique Knowledge Base (KB) identifier such as a Wikipedia or Freebase
id. It plays a critical role in the construction of a high quality information
network, and can be further leveraged for a variety of information retrieval
and NLP tasks such as text categorization and document tagging. EDL is a
complex and challenging problem due to ambiguity of the mentions and real world
text being multi-lingual. Moreover, EDL systems need to have high throughput
and should be lightweight in order to scale to large datasets and run on
off-the-shelf machines. More importantly, these systems need to be able to
extract and disambiguate dense annotations from the data in order to enable an
Information Retrieval or Extraction task running on the data to be more
efficient and accurate. In order to address all these challenges, we present
the Lithium EDL system and algorithm - a high-throughput, lightweight,
language-agnostic EDL system that extracts and correctly disambiguates 75% more
entities than state-of-the-art EDL systems and is significantly faster than
them.

 <dc:description>  The disruptive power of blockchain technologies represents a great
opportunity to re-imagine standard practices of telecommunication networks and
to identify critical areas that can benefit from brand new approaches. As a
starting point for this debate, we look at the current limits of infrastructure
sharing, and specifically at the Small-Cell-as-a-Service trend, asking
ourselves how we could push it to its natural extreme: a scenario in which any
individual home or business user can become a service provider for mobile
network operators, freed from all the scalability and legal constraints that
are inherent to the current modus operandi. We propose the adoption of smart
contracts to implement simple but effective Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
between small cell providers and mobile operators, and present an example
contract template based on the Ethereum blockchain.

 <dc:description>  Arabic language and writing are now facing a resurgence of international
normative solutions that challenge most of their local or network based
operating principles. Even if the multilingual digital coding solutions,
especially those proposed by Unicode, have solved many difficulties of Arabic
writing, the linguistic aspect is still in search of more adapted solutions.
Terminology is one of the sectors in which the Arabic language requires a deep
modernization of its classical productivity models. The normative approach, in
particular that of the ISO TC37, is proposed as one of the solutions that would
allow it to combine with international standards to better integrate the
knowledge society under construction.
  La langue et lecriture arabe sont aujourdhui confrontees a une recrudescence
de solutions normatives internationales qui remettent en cause la plupart de
leurs principes de fonctionnement en site ou sur les reseaux. Meme si les
solutions du codage numerique multilingue, notamment celles proposees par
Unicode, ont resolu beaucoup de difficultes de lecriture arabe, le volet
linguistique est encore en quete de solutions plus adaptees. La terminologie
est lun des secteurs dans lequel la langue arabe necessite une modernisation
profonde de ses modeles classiques de production. La voie normative, notamment
celle du TC37 de ISO, est proposee comme une des solutions qui lui permettrait
de se mettre en synergie avec les referentiels internationaux pour mieux
integrer la societe du savoir en voie de construction.

 <dc:description>  Grading in embedded systems courses typically requires a face-to-face
appointment between the student and the instructor because of experimental
setups that are only available in laboratory facilities. Such a manual grading
process is an impediment to both students and instructors. Students have to
wait for several days to get feedback, and instructors may spend valuable time
evaluating trivial aspects of the assignment. As seen with software courses, an
automated grading system can significantly improve the insights available to
the instructor and encourage students to learn quickly with iterative testing.
We have designed and implemented EmbedInsight, an automated grading system for
embedded system courses that accommodates a wide variety of experimental setups
and is scalable to MOOC-style courses. EmbedInsight employs a modular web
services design that separates the user interface and the experimental setup
that evaluates student assignments. We deployed and evaluated EmbedInsight for
our university embedded systems course. We show that our system scales well to
a large number of submissions, and students are satisfied with their overall
experience.

 <dc:description>  This paper defines a new domain for collaborative systems and technologies
research: inter-organizational lean-interactive systems engineering. It departs
from the problems pertaining to large-scale, technically demanding one-off
construction projects, such as in our case studies, the building of specialized
offshore service vessels. The requirements are unique, as are the explicit
ambitions to be &quot;lean&quot;, in other words, avoid waste and re-engineering by
making sure that the process is customer-driven and rational. Emphasis is on
efficiency rather than effectiveness. This set-up poses new demands to the
collaborative systems and technologies, which we in this paper have addressed
with the design of a new type of Documentation-emtric ERP, which we have called
&quot;Paperstack&quot;. The ambition is to support inter-organizational lean-interactive
systems engineering in an integrated platform, and the next step for our
research, naturally, is to put the systems into factual use. This paper
summarizes the design ideas.

 <dc:description>  The globalization of trade and the organization of work are currently causing
a large migratory flow towards the cities. This growth of cities requires new
urban planning where digital tools take a preponderant place to capture data
and understand and decide in face of changes. These tools however hardly resist
to natural disasters, terrorism, accidents, etc. Based on the expertise of the
CITI laboratory of INSA Lyon and SC3 of the Industrial University of Santander,
we propose to create the ALERT project - Autonomous Liable Emergency service in
Real Time - with decentralized, reliable and efficient services, physically
close to the citizens, taking decisions locally, in a relevant manner without
risk of disconnection with a central authority. These information gathering and
decision-making will involve the population with participatory and social
approaches.

 <dc:description>  The author's own experience as a student and later as a lecturer in
Afghanistan has shown that the methods used in the educational system are not
only flawed, but also do not provide the minimum guidance to students to select
proper course of study before they enter the national university entrance
(Kankor) exam. Thus, it often results in high attrition rates and poor
performance in higher education.
  Based on the studies done in other countries, and by the author of this paper
through online questionnaires distributed to university students in Afghanistan
- it was found that proper procedures and specialized studies in high schools
can help students in selecting their major field of study more systematically.
  Additionally, it has come to be known that there are large amounts of data
available for mining purposes, but the methods that the Ministry of Education
and Ministry of Higher Education use to store and produce their data, only
enable them to achieve simple facts and figures. Furthermore, from the results
it can be concluded that there are potential opportunities for educational data
mining application in the domain of Afghanistan's education systems. Finally,
this study will provide the readers with approaches for using Educational Data
Mining to improve the educational business processes. For instance, predict
proper field of study for high school graduates, or, identify first year
university students who are at high risk of attrition.

 <dc:description>  This paper propose and predict the need for a new line of computer production
that can facilitate and accelerate the improvements of things and systems
towards IoT networks. The proposed computer that is named Computer of Thing,
CoT, will speed up the establishment of smart world in a synchronized way with
similar standards, communication protocols, and hardware and software. Also,
the need for a new standardization body in addition to those who exist is
stated that will motivate governments to invest more on IoT development.
However, to show the importance of proposed CoT, a brief review on IoT present
status is performed and then some terminologies and classification of IoT
networks is presented. This classification helps manufacturers to gain a proper
view for their future products development. Then, observing from production
point of view the need for CoT is highlighted. Finally, as smart systems may
work in different dimensions of applications via internet or intranet
connectivity, the basic specifications of proposed CoT are presented.
Consequently, due to nature of CoTs, a new multi- dimension multi-hierarchy
control strategy is proposed.

 <dc:description>  With the increasing popularity of machine learning techniques, it has become
common to see prediction algorithms operating within some larger process.
However, the criteria by which we train these algorithms often differ from the
ultimate criteria on which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end
approach for learning probabilistic machine learning models in a manner that
directly captures the ultimate task-based objective for which they will be
used, within the context of stochastic programming. We present three
experimental evaluations of the proposed approach: a classical inventory stock
problem, a real-world electrical grid scheduling task, and a real-world energy
storage arbitrage task. We show that the proposed approach can outperform both
traditional modeling and purely black-box policy optimization approaches in
these applications.

 <dc:description>  Relaying on early effort estimation to predict the required number of
resources is not often sufficient, and could lead to under or over estimation.
It is widely acknowledge that that software development process should be
refined regularly and that software prediction made at early stage of software
development is yet kind of guesses. Even good predictions are not sufficient
with inherent uncertainty and risks. The stage-effort estimation allows project
manager to re-allocate correct number of resources, re-schedule project and
control project progress to finish on time and within budget. In this paper we
propose an approach to utilize prior effort records to predict stage effort.
The proposed model combines concepts of Fuzzy set theory and association rule
mining. The results were good in terms of prediction accuracy and have
potential to deliver good stage-effort estimation.

 <dc:description>  Deep reinforcement learning is becoming increasingly popular for robot
control algorithms, with the aim for a robot to self-learn useful feature
representations from unstructured sensory input leading to the optimal
actuation policy. In addition to sensors mounted on the robot, sensors might
also be deployed in the environment, although these might need to be accessed
via an unreliable wireless connection. In this paper, we demonstrate deep
neural network architectures that are able to fuse information coming from
multiple sensors and are robust to sensor failures at runtime. We evaluate our
method on a search and pick task for a robot both in simulation and the real
world.

 <dc:description>  With the increasing of electric vehicle (EV) adoption in recent years, the
impact of EV charging activities to the power grid becomes more and more
significant. In this article, an optimal scheduling algorithm which combines
smart EV charging and V2G gird service is developed to integrate EVs into power
grid as distributed energy resources, with improved system cost performance.
Specifically, an optimization problem is formulated and solved at each EV
charging station according to control signal from aggregated control center and
user charging behavior prediction by mean estimation and linear regression. The
control center collects distributed optimization results and updates the
control signal, periodically. The iteration continues until it converges to
optimal scheduling. Experimental result shows this algorithm helps fill the
valley and shave the peak in electric load profiles within a microgrid, while
the energy demand of individual driver can be satisfied.

 <dc:description>  We use a pretrained fully convolutional neural network to detect clinical
dermoscopic features from dermoscopy skin lesion images. We reformulate the
superpixel classification task as an image segmentation problem, and extend a
neural network architecture originally designed for image classification to
detect dermoscopic features. Specifically, we interpolate the feature maps from
several layers in the network to match the size of the input, concatenate the
resized feature maps, and train the network to minimize a smoothed negative F1
score. Over the public validation leaderboard of the 2017 ISIC/ISBI Lesion
Dermoscopic Feature Extraction Challenge, our approach achieves 89.3% AUROC,
the highest averaged score when compared to the other two entries. Results over
the private test leaderboard are still to be announced.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes a space-time least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (ST-LSPG)
projection method for model reduction of nonlinear dynamical systems. In
contrast to typical nonlinear model-reduction methods that first apply
(Petrov-)Galerkin projection in the spatial dimension and subsequently apply
time integration to numerically resolve the resulting low-dimensional dynamical
system, the proposed method applies projection in space and time
simultaneously. To accomplish this, the method first introduces a
low-dimensional space-time trial subspace, which can be obtained by computing
tensor decompositions of state-snapshot data. The method then computes
discrete-optimal approximations in this space-time trial subspace by minimizing
the residual arising after time discretization over all space and time in a
weighted $\ell^2$-norm. This norm can be defined to enable complexity reduction
(i.e., hyper-reduction) in time, which leads to space-time collocation and
space-time GNAT variants of the ST-LSPG method. Advantages of the approach
relative to typical spatial-projection-based nonlinear model reduction methods
such as Galerkin projection and least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection
include: (1) a reduction of both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the
dynamical system, (2) the removal of spurious temporal modes (e.g., unstable
growth) from the state space, and (3) error bounds that exhibit slower growth
in time. Numerical examples performed on model problems in fluid dynamics
demonstrate the ability of the method to generate orders-of-magnitude
computational savings relative to spatial-projection-based reduced-order models
without sacrificing accuracy.

 <dc:title>Drone Squadron Optimization: a Self-adaptive Algorithm for Global

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes Drone Squadron Optimization, a new self-adaptive
metaheuristic for global numerical optimization which is updated online by a
hyper-heuristic. DSO is an artifact-inspired technique, as opposed to many
algorithms used nowadays, which are nature-inspired. DSO is very flexible
because it is not related to behaviors or natural phenomena. DSO has two core
parts: the semi-autonomous drones that fly over a landscape to explore, and the
Command Center that processes the retrieved data and updates the drones'
firmware whenever necessary. The self-adaptive aspect of DSO in this work is
the perturbation/movement scheme, which is the procedure used to generate
target coordinates. This procedure is evolved by the Command Center during the
global optimization process in order to adapt DSO to the search landscape. DSO
was evaluated on a set of widely employed benchmark functions. The statistical
analysis of the results shows that the proposed method is competitive with the
other methods in the comparison, the performance is promising, but several
future improvements are planned.

 <dc:description>  Despite the predictive performance of Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) in
generating better effort estimates, there is no consensus on how to predict the
best number of analogies, and which adjustment technique produces better
estimates. This paper proposes a new adjusted ABE model based on optimizing and
approximating complex relationships between features and reflects that
approximation on the final estimate. The results show that the predictive
performance of ABE has noticeably been improved, and the number of analogies
was remarkably variable for each test project.

 <dc:title>Analogy-based effort estimation: a new method to discover set of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Analogy-based effort estimation (ABE) is one of the efficient methods for
software effort estimation because of its outstanding performance and
capability of handling noisy datasets. Conventional ABE models usually use the
same number of analogies for all projects in the datasets in order to make good
estimates. The authors' claim is that using same number of analogies may
produce overall best performance for the whole dataset but not necessarily best
performance for each individual project. Therefore there is a need to better
understand the dataset characteristics in order to discover the optimum set of
analogies for each project rather than using a static k nearest projects.
Method: We propose a new technique based on Bisecting k-medoids clustering
algorithm to come up with the best set of analogies for each individual project
before making the prediction. Results &amp; Conclusions: With Bisecting k-medoids
it is possible to better understand the dataset characteristic, and
automatically find best set of analogies for each test project. Performance
figures of the proposed estimation method are promising and better than those
of other regular ABE models

 <dc:description>  Use Case Points (UCP) is a well-known method to estimate the project size,
based on Use Case diagram, at early phases of software development. Although
the Use Case diagram is widely accepted as a de-facto model for analyzing
object oriented software requirements over the world, UCP method did not take
sufficient amount of attention because, as yet, there is no consensus on how to
produce software effort from UCP. This paper aims to study the potential of
using Fuzzy Model Tree to derive effort estimates based on UCP size measure
using a dataset collected for that purpose. The proposed approach has been
validated against Treeboost model, Multiple Linear Regression and classical
effort estimation based on the UCP model. The obtained results are promising
and show better performance than those obtained by classical UCP, Multiple
Linear Regression and slightly better than those obtained by Tree boost model.

 <dc:title>Model tree based adaption strategy for software effort estimation by
  analogy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Azzeh, Mohammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Background: Adaptation technique is a crucial task for analogy based
estimation. Current adaptation techniques often use linear size or linear
similarity adjustment mechanisms which are often not suitable for datasets that
have complex structure with many categorical attributes. Furthermore, the use
of nonlinear adaptation technique such as neural network and genetic algorithms
needs many user interactions and parameters optimization for configuring them
(such as network model, number of neurons, activation functions, training
functions, mutation, selection, crossover, ... etc.). Aims: In response to the
abovementioned challenges, the present paper proposes a new adaptation strategy
using Model Tree based attribute distance to adjust estimation by analogy and
derive new estimates. Using Model Tree has an advantage to deal with
categorical attributes, minimize user interaction and improve efficiency of
model learning through classification. Method: Seven well known datasets have
been used with 3-Fold cross validation to empirically validate the proposed
approach. The proposed method has been investigated using various K analogies
from 1 to 3. Results: Experimental results showed that the proposed approach
produced better results when compared with those obtained by using estimation
by analogy based linear size adaptation, linear similarity adaptation,
'regression towards the mean' and null adaptation. Conclusions: Model Tree
could form a useful extension for estimation by analogy especially for complex
data sets with large number of categorical attributes.

 <dc:description>  Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has been widely used to generate good software
effort estimates. The predictive performance of CBR is a dataset dependent and
subject to extremely large space of configuration possibilities. Regardless of
the type of adaptation technique, deciding on the optimal number of similar
cases to be used before applying CBR is a key challenge. In this paper we
propose a new technique based on Bisecting k-medoids clustering algorithm to
better understanding the structure of a dataset and discovering the the optimal
cases for each individual project by excluding irrelevant cases. Results
obtained showed that understanding of the data characteristic prior prediction
stage can help in automatically finding the best number of cases for each test
project. Performance figures of the proposed estimation method are better than
those of other regular K-based CBR methods.

 <dc:description>  Objective: This paper investigates the potential of ensemble learning for
variants of adjustment methods used in analogy-based effort estimation. The
number k of analogies to be used is also investigated. Method We perform a
large scale comparison study where many ensembles constructed from n out of 40
possible valid variants of adjustment methods are applied to eight datasets.
The performance of each method was evaluated based on standardized accuracy and
effect size. Results: The results have been subjected to statistical
significance testing, and show reasonable significant improvements on the
predictive performance where ensemble methods are applied. Conclusion: Our
conclusions suggest that ensembles of adjustment methods can work well and
achieve good performance, even though they are not always superior to single
methods. We also recommend constructing ensembles from only linear adjustment
methods, as they have shown better performance and were frequently ranked
higher.

 <dc:title>Dataset Quality Assessment: An extension for analogy based effort
  estimation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Azzeh, Mohammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Estimation by Analogy (EBA) is an increasingly active research method in the
area of software engineering. The fundamental assumption of this method is that
the similar projects in terms of attribute values will also be similar in terms
of effort values. It is well recognized that the quality of software datasets
has a considerable impact on the reliability and accuracy of such method.
Therefore, if the software dataset does not satisfy the aforementioned
assumption then it is not rather useful for EBA method. This paper presents a
new method based on Kendall's row-wise rank correlation that enables data
quality evaluation and providing a data preprocessing stage for EBA. The
proposed method provides sound statistical basis and justification for the
process of data quality evaluation. Unlike Analogy-X, our method has the
ability to deal with categorical attributes individually without the need for
partitioning the dataset. Experimental results showed that the proposed method
could form a useful extension for EBA as it enables: dataset quality
evaluation, attribute selection and identifying abnormal observations.

 <dc:description>  Software-based approaches for search over encrypted data are still either
challenged by lack of proper, low-leakage encryption or slow performance.
Existing hardware-based approaches do not scale well due to hardware
limitations and software designs that are not specifically tailored to the
hardware architecture, and are rarely well analyzed for their security (e.g.,
the impact of side channels). Additionally, existing hardware-based solutions
often have a large code footprint in the trusted environment susceptible to
software compromises. In this paper we present HardIDX: a hardware-based
approach, leveraging Intel's SGX, for search over encrypted data. It implements
only the security critical core, i.e., the search functionality, in the trusted
environment and resorts to untrusted software for the remainder. HardIDX is
deployable as a highly performant encrypted database index: it is logarithmic
in the size of the index and searches are performed within a few milliseconds
rather than seconds. We formally model and prove the security of our scheme
showing that its leakage is equivalent to the best known searchable encryption
schemes. Our implementation has a very small code and memory footprint yet
still scales to virtually unlimited search index sizes, i.e., size is limited
only by the general - non-secure - hardware resources.

 <dc:title>Minimizing Maximum Regret in Commitment Constrained Sequential Decision

 <dc:description>  In cooperative multiagent planning, it can often be beneficial for an agent
to make commitments about aspects of its behavior to others, allowing them in
turn to plan their own behaviors without taking the agent's detailed behavior
into account. Extending previous work in the Bayesian setting, we consider
instead a worst-case setting in which the agent has a set of possible
environments (MDPs) it could be in, and develop a commitment semantics that
allows for probabilistic guarantees on the agent's behavior in any of the
environments it could end up facing. Crucially, an agent receives observations
(of reward and state transitions) that allow it to potentially eliminate
possible environments and thus obtain higher utility by adapting its policy to
the history of observations. We develop algorithms and provide theory and some
preliminary empirical results showing that they ensure an agent meets its
commitments with history-dependent policies while minimizing maximum regret
over the possible environments.

 <dc:description>  Correlation Filters (CFs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance in
terms of rapidly tracking objects under challenging photometric and geometric
variations. The strength of the approach comes from its ability to efficiently
learn - &quot;on the fly&quot; - how the object is changing over time. A fundamental
drawback to CFs, however, is that the background of the object is not be
modelled over time which can result in suboptimal results. In this paper we
propose a Background-Aware CF that can model how both the foreground and
background of the object varies over time. Our approach, like conventional CFs,
is extremely computationally efficient - and extensive experiments over
multiple tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superior accuracy and real-time
performance of our method compared to the state-of-the-art trackers including
those based on a deep learning paradigm.

 <dc:description>  High-performance computing systems are more and more often based on
accelerators. Computing applications targeting those systems often follow a
host-driven approach in which hosts offload almost all compute-intensive
sections of the code onto accelerators; this approach only marginally exploits
the computational resources available on the host CPUs, limiting performance
and energy efficiency. The obvious step forward is to run compute-intensive
kernels in a concurrent and balanced way on both hosts and accelerators. In
this paper we consider exactly this problem for a class of applications based
on Lattice Boltzmann Methods, widely used in computational fluid-dynamics. Our
goal is to develop just one program, portable and able to run efficiently on
several different combinations of hosts and accelerators. To reach this goal,
we define common data layouts enabling the code to exploit efficiently the
different parallel and vector options of the various accelerators, and matching
the possibly different requirements of the compute-bound and memory-bound
kernels of the application. We also define models and metrics that predict the
best partitioning of workloads among host and accelerator, and the optimally
achievable overall performance level. We test the performance of our codes and
their scaling properties using as testbeds HPC clusters incorporating different
accelerators: Intel Xeon-Phi many-core processors, NVIDIA GPUs and AMD GPUs.

 <dc:title>Locality and Singularity for Store-Atomic Memory Models</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Robustness is a correctness notion for concurrent programs running under
relaxed consistency models. The task is to check that the relaxed behavior
coincides (up to traces) with sequential consistency (SC). Although
computationally simple on paper (robustness has been shown to be
PSPACE-complete for TSO, PGAS, and Power), building a practical robustness
checker remains a challenge. The problem is that the various relaxations lead
to a dramatic number of computations, only few of which violate robustness.
  In the present paper, we set out to reduce the search space for robustness
checkers. We focus on store-atomic consistency models and establish two
completeness results. The first result, called locality, states that a
non-robust program always contains a violating computation where only one
thread delays commands. The second result, called singularity, is even stronger
but restricted to programs without lightweight fences. It states that there is
a violating computation where a single store is delayed.
  As an application of the results, we derive a linear-size source-to-source
translation of robustness to SC-reachability. It applies to general programs,
regardless of the data domain and potentially with an unbounded number of
threads and with unbounded buffers. We have implemented the translation and
verified, for the first time, PGAS algorithms in a fully automated fashion. For
TSO, our analysis outperforms existing tools.

 <dc:description>  Subspace learning is an important problem, which has many applications in
image and video processing. It can be used to find a low-dimensional
representation of signals and images. But in many applications, the desired
signal is heavily distorted by outliers and noise, which negatively affect the
learned subspace. In this work, we present a novel algorithm for learning a
subspace for signal representation, in the presence of structured outliers and
noise. The proposed algorithm tries to jointly detect the outliers and learn
the subspace for images. We present an alternating optimization algorithm for
solving this problem, which iterates between learning the subspace and finding
the outliers. This algorithm has been trained on a large number of image
patches, and the learned subspace is used for image segmentation, and is shown
to achieve better segmentation results than prior methods, including least
absolute deviation fitting, k-means clustering based segmentation in DjVu, and
shape primitive extraction and coding algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Local descriptors based on the image noise residual have proven extremely
effective for a number of forensic applications, like forgery detection and
localization. Nonetheless, motivated by promising results in computer vision,
the focus of the research community is now shifting on deep learning. In this
paper we show that a class of residual-based descriptors can be actually
regarded as a simple constrained convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, by
relaxing the constraints, and fine-tuning the net on a relatively small
training set, we obtain a significant performance improvement with respect to
the conventional detector.

answering (QA). In this paper, we approach the problems by closely modelling
questions in a neural network framework. We first introduce syntactic
information to help encode questions. We then view and model different types of
questions and the information shared among them as an adaptation task and
proposed adaptation models for them. On the Stanford Question Answering Dataset
(SQuAD), we show that these approaches can help attain better results over a

 <dc:description>  We propose a new algorithm for the reliable detection and localization of
video copy-move forgeries. Discovering well crafted video copy-moves may be
very difficult, especially when some uniform background is copied to occlude
foreground objects. To reliably detect both additive and occlusive copy-moves
we use a dense-field approach, with invariant features that guarantee
robustness to several post-processing operations. To limit complexity, a
suitable video-oriented version of PatchMatch is used, with a multiresolution
search strategy, and a focus on volumes of interest. Performance assessment
relies on a new dataset, designed ad hoc, with realistic copy-moves and a wide
variety of challenging situations. Experimental results show the proposed
method to detect and localize video copy-moves with good accuracy even in
adverse conditions.

 <dc:description>  As we move towards an era of hundreds of cores, the research community has
witnessed the emergence of opto-electronic network on-chip designs based on
nanophotonics, in order to achieve higher network throughput, lower latencies,
and lower dynamic power. However, traditional nanophotonics options face
limitations such as large device footprints compared with electronics, higher
static power due to continuous laser operation, and an upper limit on
achievable data rates due to large device capacitances. Nanoplasmonics is an
emerging technology that has the potential for providing transformative gains
on multiple metrics due to its potential to increase the light-matter
interaction. In this paper, we propose and analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC
that incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical
interconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics. We explore various
opto-electronic network hybridization options by augmenting a mesh network with
HyPPI links, and compare them with the equivalent options afforded by
conventional nanophotonics as well as pure electronics. Our design space
exploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with HyPPI gives a
performance to cost ratio improvement of up to 1.8x. To further validate our
estimates, we conduct trace based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark
suite. These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1.64x, with negligible
energy increase. We then further carry out performance and cost projections for
fully optical NoCs, using HyPPI as well as conventional nanophotonics. These
futuristic projections indicate that all-HyPPI NoCs would be two orders more
energy efficient than electronics, and two orders more area efficient than
all-photonic NoCs.

 <dc:description>  The stream of words produced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems is
typically devoid of punctuations and formatting. Most natural language
processing applications expect segmented and well-formatted texts as input,
which is not available in ASR output. This paper proposes a novel technique of
jointly modeling multiple correlated tasks such as punctuation and
capitalization using bidirectional recurrent neural networks, which leads to
improved performance for each of these tasks. This method could be extended for
joint modeling of any other correlated sequence labeling tasks.

 <dc:description>  Sparse sampling schemes have the potential to dramatically reduce image
acquisition time while simultaneously reducing radiation damage to samples.
However, for a sparse sampling scheme to be useful it is important that we are
able to reconstruct the underlying object with sufficient clarity using the
sparse measurements. In dynamic sampling, each new measurement location is
selected based on information obtained from previous measurements. Therefore,
dynamic sampling schemes have the potential to dramatically reduce the number
of measurements needed for high fidelity reconstructions. However, most
existing dynamic sampling methods for point-wise measurement acquisition tend
to be computationally expensive and are therefore too slow for practical
applications.
  In this paper, we present a framework for dynamic sampling based on machine
learning techniques, which we call a supervised learning approach for dynamic
sampling (SLADS). In each step of SLADS, the objective is to find the pixel
that maximizes the expected reduction in distortion (ERD) given previous
measurements. SLADS is fast because we use a simple regression function to
compute the ERD, and it is accurate because the regression function is trained
using data sets that are representative of the specific application. In
addition, we introduce a method to terminate dynamic sampling at a desired
level of distortion, and we extended the SLADS methodology to sample groups of
pixels at each step. Finally, we present results on computationally-generated
synthetic data and experimentally-collected data to demonstrate a dramatic
improvement over state-of-the-art static sampling methods.

 <dc:title>Optimal Densification for Fast and Accurate Minwise Hashing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shrivastava, Anshumali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Minwise hashing is a fundamental and one of the most successful hashing
algorithm in the literature. Recent advances based on the idea of
densification~\cite{Proc:OneHashLSH_ICML14,Proc:Shrivastava_UAI14} have shown
that it is possible to compute $k$ minwise hashes, of a vector with $d$
nonzeros, in mere $(d + k)$ computations, a significant improvement over the
classical $O(dk)$. These advances have led to an algorithmic improvement in the
query complexity of traditional indexing algorithms based on minwise hashing.
Unfortunately, the variance of the current densification techniques is
unnecessarily high, which leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to
vanilla minwise hashing, especially when the data is sparse. In this paper, we
provide a novel densification scheme which relies on carefully tailored
2-universal hashes. We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal, and
without losing the runtime efficiency, it is significantly more accurate than
existing densification techniques. As a result, we obtain a significantly
efficient hashing scheme which has the same variance and collision probability
as minwise hashing. Experimental evaluations on real sparse and
high-dimensional datasets validate our claims. We believe that given the
significant advantages, our method will replace minwise hashing implementations
in practice.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel object detection pipeline for localization and recognition
in three dimensional environments. Our approach makes use of an RGB-D sensor
and combines state-of-the-art techniques from the robotics and computer vision
communities to create a robust, real-time detection system. We focus
specifically on solving the object detection problem for tabletop scenes, a
common environment for assistive manipulators. Our detection pipeline locates
objects in a point cloud representation of the scene. These clusters are
subsequently used to compute a bounding box around each object in the RGB
space. Each defined patch is then fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
for object recognition. We also demonstrate that our region proposal method can
be used to develop novel datasets that are both large and diverse enough to
train deep learning models, and easy enough to collect that end-users can
develop their own datasets. Lastly, we validate the resulting system through an
extensive analysis of the accuracy and run-time of the full pipeline.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the continuous six degree
of freedom (6-DoF) pose (3D translation and rotation) of an object from a
single RGB image. The approach combines semantic keypoints predicted by a
convolutional network (convnet) with a deformable shape model. Unlike prior
work, we are agnostic to whether the object is textured or textureless, as the
convnet learns the optimal representation from the available training image
data. Furthermore, the approach can be applied to instance- and class-based
pose recovery. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach can accurately
recover the 6-DoF object pose for both instance- and class-based scenarios with
a cluttered background. For class-based object pose estimation,
state-of-the-art accuracy is shown on the large-scale PASCAL3D+ dataset.

 <dc:description>  The fifth generation of mobile communications is anticipated to open up
innovation opportunities for new industries such as vertical markets. However,
these verticals originate myriad use cases with diverging requirements that
future 5G networks have to efficiently support. Network slicing may be a
natural solution to simultaneously accommodate over a common network
infrastructure the wide range of services that vertical-specific use cases will
demand. In this article, we present the network slicing concept, with a
particular focus on its application to 5G systems. We start by summarizing the
key aspects that enable the realization of so-called network slices. Then, we
give a brief overview on the SDN architecture proposed by the ONF and show that
it provides tools to support slicing. We argue that although such architecture
paves the way for network slicing implementation, it lacks some essential
capabilities that can be supplied by NFV. Hence, we analyze a proposal from the
ETSI to incorporate the capabilities of SDN into the NFV architecture.
Additionally, we present an example scenario that combines SDN and NFV
technologies to address the realization of network slices. Finally, we
summarize the open research issues with the purpose of motivating new advances
in this field.

 <dc:description>  We present a computational evaluation of three hypotheses about sources of
deficit in sentence comprehension in aphasia: slowed processing, intermittent
deficiency, and resource reduction. The ACT-R based Lewis and Vasishth (2005)
model is used to implement these three proposals. Slowed processing is
implemented as slowed default production-rule firing time; intermittent
deficiency as increased random noise in activation of chunks in memory; and
resource reduction as reduced goal activation. As data, we considered subject
vs. object rela- tives whose matrix clause contained either an NP or a
reflexive, presented in a self-paced listening modality to 56 individuals with
aphasia (IWA) and 46 matched controls. The participants heard the sentences and
carried out a picture verification task to decide on an interpretation of the
sentence. These response accuracies are used to identify the best parameters
(for each participant) that correspond to the three hypotheses mentioned above.
We show that controls have more tightly clustered (less variable) parameter
values than IWA; specifically, compared to controls, among IWA there are more
individuals with low goal activations, high noise, and slow default action
times. This suggests that (i) individual patients show differential amounts of
deficit along the three dimensions of slowed processing, intermittent
deficient, and resource reduction, (ii) overall, there is evidence for all
three sources of deficit playing a role, and (iii) IWA have a more variable
range of parameter values than controls. In sum, this study contributes a proof
of concept of a quantitative implementation of, and evidence for, these three
accounts of comprehension deficits in aphasia.

 <dc:description>  We study the relationship between performance and practice by analyzing the
activity of many players of a casual online game. We find significant
heterogeneity in the improvement of player performance, given by score, and
address this by dividing players into similar skill levels and segmenting each
player's activity into sessions, i.e., sequence of game rounds without an
extended break. After disaggregating data, we find that performance improves
with practice across all skill levels. More interestingly, players are more
likely to end their session after an especially large improvement, leading to a
peak score in their very last game of a session. In addition, success is
strongly correlated with a lower quitting rate when the score drops, and only
weakly correlated with skill, in line with psychological findings about the
value of persistence and &quot;grit&quot;: successful players are those who persist in
their practice despite lower scores. Finally, we train an epsilon-machine, a
type of hidden Markov model, and find a plausible mechanism of game play that
can predict player performance and quitting the game. Our work raises the
possibility of real-time assessment and behavior prediction that can be used to
optimize human performance.

 <dc:title>On the benefits of output sparsity for multi-label classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The multi-label classification framework, where each observation can be
associated with a set of labels, has generated a tremendous amount of attention
over recent years. The modern multi-label problems are typically large-scale in
terms of number of observations, features and labels, and the amount of labels
can even be comparable with the amount of observations. In this context,
different remedies have been proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality.
In this work, we aim at exploiting the output sparsity by introducing a new
loss, called the sparse weighted Hamming loss. This proposed loss can be seen
as a weighted version of classical ones, where active and inactive labels are
weighted separately. Leveraging the influence of sparsity in the loss function,
we provide improved generalization bounds for the empirical risk minimizer, a
suitable property for large-scale problems. For this new loss, we derive rates
of convergence linear in the underlying output-sparsity rather than linear in
the number of labels. In practice, minimizing the associated risk can be
performed efficiently by using convex surrogates and modern convex optimization
algorithms. We provide experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrating
the pertinence of our approach when compared to non-weighted techniques.

 <dc:title>A fully end-to-end deep learning approach for real-time simultaneous 3D

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous 3D reconstruction and
material recognition and segmentation. Enabling robots to recognise different
materials (concrete, metal etc.) in a scene is important for many tasks, e.g.
robotic interventions in nuclear decommissioning. Previous work on 3D semantic
reconstruction has predominantly focused on recognition of everyday domestic
objects (tables, chairs etc.), whereas previous work on material recognition
has largely been confined to single 2D images without any 3D reconstruction.
Meanwhile, most 3D semantic reconstruction methods rely on computationally
expensive post-processing, using Fully-Connected Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs), to achieve consistent segmentations. In contrast, we propose a deep
learning method which performs 3D reconstruction while simultaneously
recognising different types of materials and labelling them at the pixel level.
Unlike previous methods, we propose a fully end-to-end approach, which does not
require hand-crafted features or CRF post-processing. Instead, we use only
learned features, and the CRF segmentation constraints are incorporated inside
the fully end-to-end learned system. We present the results of experiments, in
which we trained our system to perform real-time 3D semantic reconstruction for
23 different materials in a real-world application. The run-time performance of
the system can be boosted to around 10Hz, using a conventional GPU, which is
enough to achieve real-time semantic reconstruction using a 30fps RGB-D camera.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first real-time end-to-end
system for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and material recognition.

 <dc:description>  We introduce variational obstacle avoidance problems on Riemannian manifolds
and derive necessary conditions for the existence of their normal extremals.
The problem consists of minimizing an energy functional depending on the
velocity and covariant acceleration, among a set of admissible curves, and also
depending on a navigation function used to avoid an obstacle on the workspace,
a Riemannian manifold.
  We study two different scenarios, a general one on a Riemannian manifold and,
a sub-Riemannian problem. By introducing a left-invariant metric on a Lie
group, we also study the variational obstacle avoidance problem on a Lie group.
We apply the results to the obstacle avoidance problem of a planar rigid body
and an unicycle.

 <dc:description>  In the domain of sequence modelling, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have
been capable of achieving impressive results in a variety of application areas
including visual question answering, part-of-speech tagging and machine
translation. However this success in modelling short term dependencies has not
successfully transitioned to application areas such as trajectory prediction,
which require capturing both short term and long term relationships. In this
paper, we propose a Tree Memory Network (TMN) for modelling long term and short
term relationships in sequence-to-sequence mapping problems. The proposed
network architecture is composed of an input module, controller and a memory
module. In contrast to related literature, which models the memory as a
sequence of historical states, we model the memory as a recursive tree
structure. This structure more effectively captures temporal dependencies
across both short term and long term sequences using its hierarchical
structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed TMN
in two practical problems, aircraft trajectory modelling and pedestrian
trajectory modelling in a surveillance setting, and in both cases we outperform
the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we perform an in depth analysis on
the evolution of the memory module content over time and provide visual
evidence on how the proposed TMN is able to map both long term and short term
relationships efficiently via a hierarchical structure.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an energy harvesting scheme for a multi-user
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) secrecy channel with artificial noise
(AN) transmission is investigated. Joint optimization of the transmit
beamforming matrix, the AN covariance matrix, and the power splitting ratio is
conducted to minimize the transmit power under the target secrecy rate, the
total transmit power, and the harvested energy constraints. The original
problem is shown to be non-convex, which is tackled by a two-layer
decomposition approach. The inner layer problem is solved through semi-definite
relaxation, and the outer problem, on the other hand, is shown to be a single-
variable optimization that can be solved by one-dimensional (1- D) line search.
To reduce computational complexity, a sequential parametric convex
approximation (SPCA) method is proposed to find a near-optimal solution. The
work is then extended to the imperfect channel state information case with
norm-bounded channel errors. Furthermore, tightness of the relaxation for the
proposed schemes are validated by showing that the optimal solution of the
relaxed problem is rank-one. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
SPCA method achieves the same performance as the scheme based on 1-D but with
much lower complexity.

 <dc:description>  At present, automatic discourse analysis is a relevant research topic in the
field of NLP. However, discourse is one of the phenomena most difficult to
process. Although discourse parsers have been already developed for several
languages, this tool does not exist for Catalan. In order to implement this
kind of parser, the first step is to develop a discourse segmenter. In this
article we present the first discourse segmenter for texts in Catalan. This
segmenter is based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) for Spanish, and uses
lexical and syntactic information to translate rules valid for Spanish into
rules for Catalan. We have evaluated the system by using a gold standard corpus
including manually segmented texts and results are promising.

 <dc:description>  The first measured results for massive multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO)
performance in a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario with moderate mobility are
presented, with 8 users served by a 100 antenna base Station (BS) at 3.7 GHz.
When such a large number of channels dynamically change, the inherent
propagation and processing delay has a critical relationship with the rate of
change, as the use of outdated channel information can result in severe
detection and precoding inaccuracies. For the downlink (DL) in particular, a
time division duplex (TDD) configuration synonymous with massive MIMO
deployments could mean only the uplink (UL) is usable in extreme cases.
Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the impact of mobility on
massive MIMO performance and consider ways to combat the potential limitations.
In a mobile scenario with moving cars and pedestrians, the correlation of the
MIMO channel vector over time is inspected for vehicles moving up to 29 km/h.
For a 100 antenna system, it is found that the channel state information (CSI)
update rate requirement may increase by 7 times when compared to an 8 antenna
system, whilst the power control update rate could be decreased by at least 5
times relative to a single antenna system.

 <dc:description>  The visual focus of attention (VFOA) has been recognized as a prominent
conversational cue. We are interested in estimating and tracking the VFOAs
associated with multi-party social interactions. We note that in this type of
situations the participants either look at each other or at an object of
interest; therefore their eyes are not always visible. Consequently both gaze
and VFOA estimation cannot be based on eye detection and tracking. We propose a
method that exploits the correlation between eye gaze and head movements. Both
VFOA and gaze are modeled as latent variables in a Bayesian switching
state-space model. The proposed formulation leads to a tractable learning
procedure and to an efficient algorithm that simultaneously tracks gaze and
visual focus. The method is tested and benchmarked using two publicly available
datasets that contain typical multi-party human-robot and human-human
interactions.

 <dc:description>  How can we explain the predictions of a black-box model? In this paper, we
use influence functions -- a classic technique from robust statistics -- to
trace a model's prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its
training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given
prediction. To scale up influence functions to modern machine learning
settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only
oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on
non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down,
approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information.
On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that
influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model
behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating
visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.

 <dc:description>  Urban transportation is being transformed by mobility-on-demand (MoD)
systems. One of the goals of MoD systems is to provide personalized
transportation services to passengers. This process is facilitated by a
centralized operator that coordinates the assignment of vehicles to individual
passengers, based on location data. However, current approaches assume that
accurate positioning information for passengers and vehicles is readily
available. This assumption raises privacy concerns. In this work, we address
this issue by proposing a method that protects passengers' drop-off locations
(i.e., their travel destinations). Formally, we solve a batch assignment
problem that routes vehicles at obfuscated origin locations to passenger
locations (since origin locations correspond to previous drop-off locations),
such that the mean waiting time is minimized. Our main contributions are
two-fold. First, we formalize the notion of privacy for continuous
vehicle-to-passenger assignment in MoD systems, and integrate a privacy
mechanism that provides formal guarantees. Second, we present a scalable
algorithm that takes advantage of superfluous (idle) vehicles in the system,
combining multiple iterations of the Hungarian algorithm to allocate a
redundant number of vehicles to a single passenger. As a result, we are able to
reduce the performance deterioration induced by the privacy mechanism. We
evaluate our methods on a real, large-scale data set consisting of over 11
million taxi rides (specifying vehicle availability and passenger requests),
recorded over a month's duration, in the area of Manhattan, New York. Our work
demonstrates that privacy can be integrated into MoD systems without incurring
a significant loss of performance, and moreover, that this loss can be further
minimized at the cost of deploying additional (redundant) vehicles into the
fleet.

 <dc:description>  Both the ethics of autonomous systems and the problems of their technical
implementation have by now been studied in some detail. Less attention has been
given to the areas in which these two separate concerns meet. This paper,
written by both philosophers and engineers of autonomous systems, addresses a
number of issues in machine ethics that are located at precisely the
intersection between ethics and engineering. We first discuss the main
challenges which, in our view, machine ethics posses to moral philosophy. We
them consider different approaches towards the conceptual design of autonomous
systems and their implications on the ethics implementation in such systems.
Then we examine problematic areas regarding the specification and verification
of ethical behavior in autonomous systems, particularly with a view towards the
requirements of future legislation. We discuss transparency and accountability
issues that will be crucial for any future wide deployment of autonomous
systems in society. Finally we consider the, often overlooked, possibility of
intentional misuse of AI systems and the possible dangers arising out of
deliberately unethical design, implementation, and use of autonomous robots.

 <dc:description>  We describe a simple model of how a publication's citations change over time,
based on pure-birth stochastic processes with a linear cumulative advantage
effect. The model is applied to citation data from the Physical Review corpus
provided by APS. Our model reveals that papers fall into three different
clusters: papers that have rapid initial citations and ultimately high impact
(fast-hi), fast to rise but quick to plateau (fast-flat), or late bloomers
(slow-late), which may either never achieve many citations, or do so many years
after publication. In &quot;fast-hi&quot; and &quot;slow-late&quot;, there is a rich-get-richer
effect: papers that have many citations accumulate additional citations more
rapidly while the &quot;fast-flat&quot; papers do not display this effect. We conclude by
showing that only a few years of post-publication statistics are needed to
identify high impact (&quot;fast-hi&quot;) papers.

 <dc:description>  Voting systems typically treat all voters equally. We argue that perhaps they
should not: Voters who have supported good choices in the past should be given
higher weight than voters who have supported bad ones. To develop a formal
framework for desirable weighting schemes, we draw on no-regret learning.
Specifically, given a voting rule, we wish to design a weighting scheme such
that applying the voting rule, with voters weighted by the scheme, leads to
choices that are almost as good as those endorsed by the best voter in
hindsight. We derive possibility and impossibility results for the existence of
such weighting schemes, depending on whether the voting rule and the weighting
scheme are deterministic or randomized, as well as on the social choice axioms
satisfied by the voting rule.

 <dc:description>  Training deep neural networks generally requires massive amounts of data and
is very computation intensive. We show here that it may be possible to
circumvent the expensive gradient descent procedure and derive the parameters
of a neural network directly from properties of the training data. We show
that, near convergence, the gradient descent equations for layers close to the
input can be linearized and become stochastic equations with noise related to
the covariance of data for each class. We derive the distribution of solutions
to these equations and discover that it is related to a &quot;supervised principal
component analysis.&quot; We implement these results on image datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 and find that, indeed, pretrained layers using our
findings performs comparable or superior to neural networks of the same size
and architecture trained with gradient descent. Moreover, our pretrained layers
can often be calculated using a fraction of the training data, owing to the
quick convergence of the covariance matrix. Thus, our findings indicate that we
can cut the training time both by requiring only a fraction of the data used
for gradient descent, and by eliminating layers in the costly backpropagation
step of the training. Additionally, these findings partially elucidate the
inner workings of deep neural networks and allow us to mathematically calculate
optimal solutions for some stages of classification problems, thus
significantly boosting our ability to solve such problems efficiently.

 <dc:description>  We present an $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with quasi-polynomial
running time for computing the maximum weight independent set of polygons out
of a given set of polygons in the plane (specifically, the running time is
$n^{O( \mathrm{poly}( \log n, 1/\varepsilon))}$). Contrasting this, the best
known polynomial time algorithm for the problem has an approximation ratio
of~$n^{\varepsilon}$. Surprisingly, we can extend the algorithm to the problem
of computing the maximum weight subset of the given set of polygons whose
intersection graph fulfills some sparsity condition. For example, we show that
one can approximate the maximum weight subset of polygons, such that the
intersection graph of the subset is planar or does not contain a cycle of
length $4$ (i.e., $K_{2,2}$). Our algorithm relies on a recursive partitioning
scheme, whose backbone is the existence of balanced cuts with small complexity
that intersect polygons from the optimal solution of a small total weight.
  For the case of large axis-parallel rectangles, we provide a polynomial time
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the maximum weight independent set.
Specifically, we consider the problem where each rectangle has one edge whose
length is at least a constant fraction of the length of the corresponding edge
of the bounding box of all the input elements. This is now the most general
case for which a PTAS is known, and it requires a new and involved partitioning
scheme, which should be of independent interest.

 <dc:title>The Stochastic Container Relocation Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Container Relocation Problem (CRP) is concerned with finding a sequence
of moves of containers that minimizes the number of relocations needed to
retrieve all containers, while respecting a given order of retrieval. However,
the assumption of knowing the full retrieval order of containers is
particularly unrealistic in real operations. This paper studies the stochastic
CRP (SCRP), which relaxes this assumption. A new multi-stage stochastic model,
called the batch model, is introduced, motivated, and compared with an existing
model (the online model). The two main contributions are an optimal algorithm
called Pruning-Best-First-Search (PBFS) and a randomized approximate algorithm
called PBFS-Approximate with a bounded average error. Both algorithms,
applicable in the batch and online models, are based on a new family of lower
bounds for which we show some theoretical properties. Moreover, we introduce
two new heuristics outperforming the best existing heuristics. Algorithms,
bounds and heuristics are tested in an extensive computational section.
Finally, based on strong computational evidence, we conjecture the optimality
of the &quot;Leveling&quot; heuristic in a special &quot;no information&quot; case, where at any
retrieval stage, any of the remaining containers is equally likely to be
retrieved next.

 <dc:description>  We introduce in this work an efficient approach for audio scene
classification using deep recurrent neural networks. An audio scene is firstly
transformed into a sequence of high-level label tree embedding feature vectors.
The vector sequence is then divided into multiple subsequences on which a deep
GRU-based recurrent neural network is trained for sequence-to-label
classification. The global predicted label for the entire sequence is finally
obtained via aggregation of subsequence classification outputs. We will show
that our approach obtains an F1-score of 97.7% on the LITIS Rouen dataset,
which is the largest dataset publicly available for the task. Compared to the
best previously reported result on the dataset, our approach is able to reduce
the relative classification error by 35.3%.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses recursive markerless estimation of a robot's
end-effector using visual observations from its cameras. The problem is
formulated into the Bayesian framework and addressed using Sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) filtering. We use a 3D rendering engine and Computer Aided Design
(CAD) schematics of the robot to virtually create images from the robot's
camera viewpoints. These images are then used to extract information and
estimate the pose of the end-effector. To this aim, we developed a particle
filter for estimating the position and orientation of the robot's end-effector
using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors to capture robust
characteristic features of shapes in both cameras and rendered images. We
implemented the algorithm on the iCub humanoid robot and employed it in a
closed-loop reaching scenario. We demonstrate that the tracking is robust to
clutter, allows compensating for errors in the robot kinematics and servoing
the arm in closed loop using vision.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the strict self-assembly of fractals in one of the
most well-studied models of tile based self-assembling systems known as the
Two-handed Tile Assembly Model (2HAM). We are particularly interested in a
class of fractals called discrete self-similar fractals (a class of fractals
that includes the discrete Sierpinski's carpet). We present a 2HAM system that
strictly self-assembles the discrete Sierpinski's carpet with scale factor 1.
Moreover, the 2HAM system that we give lends itself to being generalized and we
describe how this system can be modified to obtain a 2HAM system that strictly
self-assembles one of any fractal from an infinite set of fractals which we
call 4-sided fractals. The 2HAM systems we give in this paper are the first
examples of systems that strictly self-assemble discrete self-similar fractals
at scale factor 1 in a purely growth model of self-assembly. Finally, we give
an example of a 3-sided fractal (which is not a tree fractal) that cannot be
strictly self-assembled by any 2HAM system.

 <dc:description>  The complexity of a learning task is increased by transformations in the
input space that preserve class identity. Visual object recognition for example
is affected by changes in viewpoint, scale, illumination or planar
transformations. While drastically altering the visual appearance, these
changes are orthogonal to recognition and should not be reflected in the
representation or feature encoding used for learning. We introduce a framework
for weakly supervised learning of image embeddings that are robust to
transformations and selective to the class distribution, using sets of
transforming examples (orbit sets), deep parametrizations and a novel
orbit-based loss. The proposed loss combines a discriminative, contrastive part
for orbits with a reconstruction error that learns to rectify orbit
transformations. The learned embeddings are evaluated in distance metric-based
tasks, such as one-shot classification under geometric transformations, as well
as face verification and retrieval under more realistic visual variability. Our
results suggest that orbit sets, suitably computed or observed, can be used for
efficient, weakly-supervised learning of semantically relevant image
embeddings.

 <dc:description>  In-database analytics is of great practical importance as it avoids the
costly repeated loop data scientists have to deal with on a daily basis: select
features, export the data, convert data format, train models using an external
tool, reimport the parameters. It is also a fertile ground of theoretically
fundamental and challenging problems at the intersection of relational and
statistical data models. This paper introduces a unified framework for training
and evaluating a class of statistical learning models inside a relational
database. This class includes ridge linear regression, polynomial regression,
factorization machines, and principal component analysis. We show that, by
synergizing key tools from relational database theory such as schema
information, query structure, recent advances in query evaluation algorithms,
and from linear algebra such as various tensor and matrix operations, one can
formulate in-database learning problems and design efficient algorithms to
solve them. The algorithms and models proposed in the paper have already been
implemented inside the LogicBlox database engine and used in retail-planning
and forecasting applications, with significant performance benefits over
out-of-database solutions that require the costly data-export loop.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a general method for improving the convergence rate of
gradient-based optimizers that is easy to implement and works well in practice.
We analyze the effectiveness of the method by applying it to stochastic
gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent with Nesterov momentum, and Adam,
showing that it improves upon these commonly used algorithms on a range of
optimization problems; in particular the kinds of objective functions that
arise frequently in deep neural network training. Our method works by
dynamically updating the learning rate during optimization using the gradient
with respect to the learning rate of the update rule itself. Computing this
&quot;hypergradient&quot; needs little additional computation, requires only one extra
copy of the original gradient to be stored in memory, and relies upon nothing
more than what is provided by reverse-mode automatic differentiation.

 <dc:description>  The field of speech recognition is in the midst of a paradigm shift:
end-to-end neural networks are challenging the dominance of hidden Markov
models as a core technology. Using an attention mechanism in a recurrent
encoder-decoder architecture solves the dynamic time alignment problem,
allowing joint end-to-end training of the acoustic and language modeling
components. In this paper we extend the end-to-end framework to encompass
microphone array signal processing for noise suppression and speech enhancement
within the acoustic encoding network. This allows the beamforming components to
be optimized jointly within the recognition architecture to improve the
end-to-end speech recognition objective. Experiments on the noisy speech
benchmarks (CHiME-4 and AMI) show that our multichannel end-to-end system
outperformed the attention-based baseline with input from a conventional
adaptive beamformer.

 <dc:description>  With explosion of data size and limited storage space at a single location,
data are often distributed at different locations. We thus face the challenge
of performing large-scale machine learning from these distributed data through
communication networks. In this paper, we study how the network communication
constraints will impact the convergence speed of distributed machine learning
optimization algorithms. In particular, we give the convergence rate analysis
of the distributed dual coordinate ascent in a general tree structured network.
Furthermore, by considering network communication delays, we optimize the
network-constrained dual coordinate ascent algorithms to maximize its
convergence speed. Our results show that under different network communication
delays, to achieve maximum convergence speed, one needs to adopt
delay-dependent numbers of local and global iterations for distributed dual
coordinate ascent.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates when users create profiles in different social
networks, whether they are redundant expressions of the same persona, or they
are adapted to each platform. Using the personal webpages of 116,998 users on
About.me, we identify and extract matched user profiles on several major social
networks including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. We find evidence
for distinct site-specific norms, such as differences in the language used in
the text of the profile self-description, and the kind of picture used as
profile image. By learning a model that robustly identifies the platform given
a user's profile image (0.657--0.829 AUC) or self-description (0.608--0.847
AUC), we confirm that users do adapt their behaviour to individual platforms in
an identifiable and learnable manner. However, different genders and age groups
adapt their behaviour differently from each other, and these differences are,
in general, consistent across different platforms. We show that differences in
social profile construction correspond to differences in how formal or informal
the platform is.

 <dc:description>  The increasing availability of online and mobile information platforms is
facilitating the development of peer-to-peer collaboration strategies in
large-scale networks. These technologies are being leveraged by networked
robotic systems to provide applications of automated transport, resource
redistribution (collaborative consumption), and location services. Yet,
external observations of the system dynamics may expose sensitive information
about the participants that compose these networks (robots, resources, and
humans). In particular, we are concerned with settings where an adversary gains
access to a snapshot of the dynamic state of the system. We propose a method
that quantifies how easy it is for the adversary to identify the specific type
of any agent (which can be a robot, resource, or human) in the network, based
on this observation. We draw from the theory of differential privacy to propose
a closed-form expression for the leakage of the system when the snapshot is
taken at steady-state, as well as a numerical approach to compute the leakage
when the snapshot is taken at any given time. The novelty of our approach is
that our privacy model builds on a macroscopic description of the system's
state, which allows us to take account of protected entities (network

as a function of the composition and dynamic behavior of the network; they also
indicate design rules for increasing privacy levels.

 <dc:description>  A decade ago, Abdulla et al introduced the elegant concept of decisiveness
for denumerable Markov chains [1]. Roughly decisiveness allows one to lift most
good properties from finite Markov chains to denumerable ones, and therefore to
adapt existing verification algorithms to infinite-state models. Denumerable
Markov chains however do not encompass stochastic real-time systems, and
general stochastic transition systems (STSs) are needed. In this paper, we
provide a framework to perform both the qualitative and the quantitative
analysis of STSs. We first define various notions of decisiveness (inherited
from [1]), notions of fairness and of attractors for STSs, and explicit the
relationships between them. Then we define a notion of abstraction, together
with natural concepts of soundness and completeness, and we give general
transfer properties, which will be central to several verification algorithms
on STSs. Then we focus on qualitative analysis. Beyond (repeated) reachability
properties for which our technics are strongly inspired by [1], we use
abstractions to design algorithms for the qualitative model-checking of
arbitrary omega-regular properties, when the STS admits a denumerable (sound
and complete) abstraction with a finite attractor. We further design generic
approximation procedures for quantitative analysis; in addition to extensions
of [1] for general STSs, we design approximation algorithms for omega-regular
properties (once again by means of specific abstractions). Last we instantiate
our framework with stochastic timed automata and generalized semi-Markov
processes, two models combining dense-time and probabilities. This allows to
derive decidability and approximability results for those models. Some of these
results were known from the literature, but our generic approach permits to
view them in a unified framework. We also derive interesting new
approximability results.

 <dc:description>  Learning to learn has emerged as an important direction for achieving
artificial intelligence. Two of the primary barriers to its adoption are an
inability to scale to larger problems and a limited ability to generalize to
new tasks. We introduce a learned gradient descent optimizer that generalizes
well to new tasks, and which has significantly reduced memory and computation
overhead. We achieve this by introducing a novel hierarchical RNN architecture,
with minimal per-parameter overhead, augmented with additional architectural
features that mirror the known structure of optimization tasks. We also develop
a meta-training ensemble of small, diverse optimization tasks capturing common
properties of loss landscapes. The optimizer learns to outperform RMSProp/ADAM
on problems in this corpus. More importantly, it performs comparably or better
when applied to small convolutional neural networks, despite seeing no neural
networks in its meta-training set. Finally, it generalizes to train Inception
V3 and ResNet V2 architectures on the ImageNet dataset for thousands of steps,
optimization problems that are of a vastly different scale than those it was
trained on. We release an open source implementation of the meta-training
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The Planar Graph Metric Compression Problem is to compactly encode the
distances among $k$ nodes in a planar graph of size $n$. Two na\&quot;ive solutions
are to store the graph using $O(n)$ bits, or to explicitly store the distance
matrix with $O(k^2 \log{n})$ bits. The only lower bounds are from the seminal
work of Gavoille, Peleg, Prennes, and Raz [SODA'01], who rule out compressions
into a polynomially smaller number of bits, for {\em weighted} planar graphs,
but leave a large gap for unweighted planar graphs. For example, when
$k=\sqrt{n}$, the upper bound is $O(n)$ and their constructions imply an
$\Omega(n^{3/4})$ lower bound. This gap is directly related to other major open
questions in labelling schemes, dynamic algorithms, and compact routing.
  Our main result is a new compression of the planar graph metric into
$\tilde{O}(\min (k^2 , \sqrt{k\cdot n}))$ bits, which is optimal up to log
factors. Our data structure breaks an $\Omega(k^2)$ lower bound of Krauthgamer,
Nguyen, and Zondiner [SICOMP'14] for compression using minors, and the lower
bound of Gavoille et al. for compression of weighted planar graphs. This is an
unexpected and decisive proof that weights can make planar graphs inherently
more complex. Moreover, we design a new {\em Subset Distance Oracle} for planar
graphs with $\tilde O(\sqrt{k\cdot n})$ space, and $\tilde O(n^{3/4})$ query
time.
  Our work carries strong messages to related fields. In particular, the famous
$O(n^{1/2})$ vs. $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ gap for distance labelling schemes in planar
graphs {\em cannot} be resolved with the current lower bound techniques.

 <dc:description>  Recent development of large-scale question answering (QA) datasets triggered
a substantial amount of research into end-to-end neural architectures for QA.
Increasingly complex systems have been conceived without comparison to simpler
neural baseline systems that would justify their complexity. In this work, we
propose a simple heuristic that guides the development of neural baseline
systems for the extractive QA task. We find that there are two ingredients
necessary for building a high-performing neural QA system: first, the awareness
of question words while processing the context and second, a composition
function that goes beyond simple bag-of-words modeling, such as recurrent
neural networks. Our results show that FastQA, a system that meets these two
requirements, can achieve very competitive performance compared with existing
models. We argue that this surprising finding puts results of previous systems
and the complexity of recent QA datasets into perspective.

 <dc:description>  Label propagation is a powerful and flexible semi-supervised learning
technique on graphs. Neural networks, on the other hand, have proven track
records in many supervised learning tasks. In this work, we propose a training
framework with a graph-regularised objective, namely &quot;Neural Graph Machines&quot;,
that can combine the power of neural networks and label propagation. This work
generalises previous literature on graph-augmented training of neural networks,
enabling it to be applied to multiple neural architectures (Feed-forward NNs,
CNNs and LSTM RNNs) and a wide range of graphs. The new objective allows the
neural networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data by: (a) allowing the
network to train using labeled data as in the supervised setting, (b) biasing
the network to learn similar hidden representations for neighboring nodes on a
graph, in the same vein as label propagation. Such architectures with the
proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent
and scaled to large graphs, with a runtime that is linear in the number of
edges. The proposed joint training approach convincingly outperforms many
existing methods on a wide range of tasks (multi-label classification on social
graphs, news categorization, document classification and semantic intent
classification), with multiple forms of graph inputs (including graphs with and
without node-level features) and using different types of neural networks.

 <dc:description>  This extended abstract describes the participation of RECOD Titans in parts 1
and 3 of the ISIC Challenge 2017 &quot;Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma
Detection&quot; (ISBI 2017). Although our team has a long experience with melanoma
classification, the ISIC Challenge 2017 was the very first time we worked on
skin-lesion segmentation. For part 1 (segmentation), our final submission used
four of our models: two trained with all 2000 samples, without a validation
split, for 250 and for 500 epochs respectively; and other two trained and
validated with two different 1600/400 splits, for 220 epochs. Those four
models, individually, achieved between 0.780 and 0.783 official validation
scores. Our final submission averaged the output of those four models achieved
a score of 0.793. For part 3 (classification), the submitted test run as well
as our last official validation run were the result from a meta-model that
assembled seven base deep-learning models: three based on Inception-V4 trained
on our largest dataset; three based on Inception trained on our smallest
dataset; and one based on ResNet-101 trained on our smaller dataset. The
results of those component models were stacked in a meta-learning layer based
on an SVM trained on the validation set of our largest dataset.

 <dc:title>Control refinement for DAE systems: A behavioral approach via simulation
  relations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Fei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The controller design of the so-called &quot;difference algebraic equation&quot; (DAE)
systems that are frequently shown in industrial processes, tend to be
challenging because of the combination of algebraic equations and high state
dimensions. In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing control
refinement approaches for DAE systems via the notions of (bi)simulation
relations and approximate simulation relations from computer science. The
quantified refinement accuracy is achieved by defining observation metrics over
a general system framework named transition systems. We employ the behavioral
theory to tackle dynamical systems and control problems in a more general
framework. Due to the difficulty in dealing with a DAE system directly, we
derive another system, which is behaviorally equivalent to the related DAE
system and in standard state space form, to provide ease for further control
refinement. Consequently, well-developed model reduction approaches can be
applied to obtain an abstract simplified system, which can be rewritten into a
DAE system again. Based on the (bi)simulation relations, approximate simulation
relations and the initialization conditions, we show that for any given
well-posed controller of the abstract model, we can always refine it to a
controller for the concrete model such that the two systems have the same
controlled output behavior or the distance between their output behavior is
bounded.

 <dc:description>  Biological and cellular systems are often modeled as graphs in which vertices
represent objects of interest (genes, proteins, drugs) and edges represent
relational ties among these objects (binds-to, interacts-with, regulates). This
approach has been highly successful owing to the theory, methodology and
software that support analysis and learning on graphs. Graphs, however, often
suffer from information loss when modeling physical systems due to their
inability to accurately represent multiobject relationships. Hypergraphs, a
generalization of graphs, provide a framework to mitigate information loss and
unify disparate graph-based methodologies. In this paper, we present a
hypergraph-based approach for modeling physical systems and formulate vertex
classification, edge classification and link prediction problems on
(hyper)graphs as instances of vertex classification on (extended, dual)
hypergraphs in a semi-supervised setting. We introduce a novel kernel method on
vertex- and edge-labeled (colored) hypergraphs for analysis and learning. The
method is based on exact and inexact (via hypergraph edit distances)
enumeration of small simple hypergraphs, referred to as hypergraphlets, rooted
at a vertex of interest. We extensively evaluate this method and show its
potential use in a positive-unlabeled setting to estimate the number of missing
and false positive links in protein-protein interaction networks.

 <dc:description>  Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has long been without an adequate dataset and
ground truth for evaluating OMR systems, which has been a major problem for
establishing a state of the art in the field. Furthermore, machine learning
methods require training data. We analyze how the OMR processing pipeline can
be expressed in terms of gradually more complex ground truth, and based on this
analysis, we design the MUSCIMA++ dataset of handwritten music notation that
addresses musical symbol recognition and notation reconstruction. The MUSCIMA++
dataset version 0.9 consists of 140 pages of handwritten music, with 91255
manually annotated notation symbols and 82261 explicitly marked relationships
between symbol pairs. The dataset allows training and evaluating models for
symbol classification, symbol localization, and notation graph assembly, both
in isolation and jointly. Open-source tools are provided for manipulating the
dataset, visualizing the data and further annotation, and the dataset itself is
made available under an open license.

 <dc:description>  Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the
predicate-argument structure of a sentence. It is typically regarded as an
important step in the standard NLP pipeline. As the semantic representations
are closely related to syntactic ones, we exploit syntactic information in our
model. We propose a version of graph convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent
class of neural networks operating on graphs, suited to model syntactic
dependency graphs. GCNs over syntactic dependency trees are used as sentence
encoders, producing latent feature representations of words in a sentence. We
observe that GCN layers are complementary to LSTM ones: when we stack both GCN
and LSTM layers, we obtain a substantial improvement over an already
state-of-the-art LSTM SRL model, resulting in the best reported scores on the
standard benchmark (CoNLL-2009) both for Chinese and English.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we formulate a solution of the robust linear regression problem
in a general framework of correntropy maximization. Our formulation yields a
unified class of estimators which includes the Gaussian and Laplacian
kernel-based correntropy estimators as special cases. An analysis of the
robustness properties is then provided. The analysis includes a quantitative
characterization of the informativity degree of the regression which is
appropriate for studying the stability of the estimator. Using this tool, a
sufficient condition is expressed under which the parametric estimation error
is shown to be bounded. Explicit expression of the bound is given and
discussion on its numerical computation is supplied. For illustration purpose,
two special cases are numerically studied.

 <dc:description>  This work considers weak deterministic B\&quot;uchi automata reading encodings of
non-negative $d$-vectors of reals in a fixed base. A saturated language is a
language which contains all encoding of elements belonging to a set of
$d$-vectors of reals. A Real Vector Automaton is an automaton which recognizes
a saturated language. It is explained how to decide in quasi-linear time
whether a minimal weak deterministic B\&quot;uchi automaton is a Real Vector
Automaton. The problem is solved both for the two standard encodings of vectors
of numbers: the sequential encoding and the parallel encoding. This algorithm
runs in linear time for minimal weak B\&quot;uchi automata accepting set of reals.
Finally, the same problem is also solved for parallel encoding of automata
reading vectors of relative reals.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an unsupervised face clustering algorithm called
&quot;Proximity-Aware Hierarchical Clustering&quot; (PAHC) that exploits the local
structure of deep representations. In the proposed method, a similarity measure
between deep features is computed by evaluating linear SVM margins. SVMs are
trained using nearest neighbors of sample data, and thus do not require any
external training data. Clusters are then formed by thresholding the similarity
scores. We evaluate the clustering performance using three challenging
unconstrained face datasets, including Celebrity in Frontal-Profile (CFP),
IARPA JANUS Benchmark A (IJB-A), and JANUS Challenge Set 3 (JANUS CS3)
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can
achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we
also show that the proposed clustering algorithm can be applied to curate a set
of large-scale and noisy training dataset while maintaining sufficient amount
of images and their variations due to nuisance factors. The face verification
performance on JANUS CS3 improves significantly by finetuning a DCNN model with
the curated MS-Celeb-1M dataset which contains over three million face images.

 <dc:description>  Several network embedding models have been developed for unsigned networks.
However, these models based on skip-gram cannot be applied to signed networks
because they can only deal with one type of link. In this paper, we present our
signed network embedding model called SNE. Our SNE adopts the log-bilinear
model, uses node representations of all nodes along a given path, and further
incorporates two signed-type vectors to capture the positive or negative
relationship of each edge along the path. We conduct two experiments, node
classification and link prediction, on both directed and undirected signed
networks and compare with four baselines including a matrix factorization
method and three state-of-the-art unsigned network embedding models. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our signed network
embedding.

 <dc:description>  One of the goals of 5G wireless systems stated by the NGMN alliance is to
provide moderate rates (50+ Mbps) everywhere and with very high reliability. We
term this service Ultra-Reliable Ubiquitous-Rate Communication (UR2C). This
paper investigates the role of frequency reuse in supporting UR2C in the
downlink. To this end, two frequency reuse schemes are considered:
user-specific frequency reuse (FRu) and BS-specific frequency reuse (FRb). For
a given unit frequency channel, FRu reduces the number of serving user
equipments (UEs), whereas FRb directly decreases the number of interfering base
stations (BSs). This increases the distance from the interfering BSs and the
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) attains ultra-reliability, e.g. 99% SIR
coverage at a randomly picked UE. The ultra-reliability is, however, achieved
at the cost of the reduced frequency allocation, which may degrade overall
downlink rate. To fairly capture this reliability-rate tradeoff, we propose
ubiquitous rate defined as the maximum downlink rate whose required SIR can be
achieved with ultra-reliability. By using stochastic geometry, we derive
closed-form ubiquitous rate as well as the optimal frequency reuse rules for
UR2C.

 <dc:description>  Parameter settings profoundly impact the performance of machine learning
algorithms and laboratory experiments. The classical grid search or trial-error
methods are exponentially expensive in large parameter spaces, and Bayesian
optimization (BO) offers an elegant alternative for global optimization of
black box functions. In situations where the black box function can be
evaluated at multiple points simultaneously, batch Bayesian optimization is
used. Current batch BO approaches are restrictive in that they fix the number
of evaluations per batch, and this can be wasteful when the number of specified
evaluations is larger than the number of real maxima in the underlying
acquisition function. We present the Budgeted Batch Bayesian Optimization (B3O)
for hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design - we identify the
appropriate batch size for each iteration in an elegant way. To set the batch
size flexible, we use the infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) for
automatically identifying the number of peaks in the underlying acquisition
functions. We solve the intractability of estimating the IGMM directly from the
acquisition function by formulating the batch generalized slice sampling to
efficiently draw samples from the acquisition function. We perform extensive
experiments for both synthetic functions and two real world applications -
machine learning hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design for alloy
hardening. We show empirically that the proposed B3O outperforms the existing
fixed batch BO approaches in finding the optimum whilst requiring a fewer
number of evaluations, thus saving cost and time.

 <dc:description>  This abstract describes the segmentation system used to participate in the
challenge ISIC 2017: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. Several
preprocessing techniques have been tested for three color representations (RGB,
YCbCr and HSV) of 392 images. Results have been used to choose the better
preprocessing for each channel. In each case a neural network is trained to
predict the Jaccard Index based on object characteristics. The system includes
black frames and reference circle detection algorithms but no special treatment
is done for hair removal. Segmentation is performed in two steps first the best
channel to be segmented is chosen by selecting the best neural network output.
If this output does not predict a Jaccard Index over 0.5 a more aggressive
preprocessing is performed using open and close morphological operations and
the segmentation of the channel that obtains the best output from the neural
networks is selected as the lesion.

 <dc:description>  Face recognition has been widely studied due to its importance in different
applications; however, most of the proposed methods fail when face images are
occluded or captured under illumination and pose variations. Recently several
low-rank dictionary learning methods have been proposed and achieved promising
results for noisy observations. While these methods are mostly developed for
single-modality scenarios, recent studies demonstrated the advantages of
feature fusion from multiple inputs. We propose a multi-modal structured
low-rank dictionary learning method for robust face recognition, using raw
pixels of face images and their illumination invariant representation. The
proposed method learns robust and discriminative representations from
contaminated face images, even if there are few training samples with large
intra-class variations. Extensive experiments on different datasets validate
the superior performance and robustness of our method to severe illumination
variations and occlusion.

 <dc:description>  Collaborative filtering (CF) aims to build a model from users' past behaviors
and/or similar decisions made by other users, and use the model to recommend
items for users. Despite of the success of previous collaborative filtering
approaches, they are all based on the assumption that there are sufficient
rating scores available for building high-quality recommendation models. In
real world applications, however, it is often difficult to collect sufficient
rating scores, especially when new items are introduced into the system, which
makes the recommendation task challenging. We find that there are often &quot;short&quot;
texts describing features of items, based on which we can approximate the
similarity of items and make recommendation together with rating scores. In
this paper we &quot;borrow&quot; the idea of vector representation of words to capture
the information of short texts and embed it into a matrix factorization
framework. We empirically show that our approach is effective by comparing it
with state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  Source camera identification is still a hard task in forensics community,

propose a solution to identify the source camera of the small-size images:
content-adaptive fusion network. In order to learn better feature
representation from the input data, content-adaptive convolutional neural
networks(CA-CNN) are constructed. We add a convolutional layer in preprocessing
stage. Moreover, with the purpose of capturing more comprehensive information,
we parallel three CA-CNNs: CA3-CNN, CA5-CNN, CA7-CNN to get the
content-adaptive fusion network. The difference of three CA-CNNs lies in the
convolutional kernel size of pre-processing layer. The experimental results
show that the proposed method is practicable and satisfactory.

 <dc:description>  Non-rigid registration is challenging because it is ill-posed with high
degrees of freedom and is thus sensitive to noise and outliers. We propose a
robust non-rigid registration method using reweighted sparsities on position
and transformation to estimate the deformations between 3-D shapes. We
formulate the energy function with dual sparsities on both the data term and
the smoothness term, and define the smoothness constraint using local rigidity.
The dual-sparsity based non-rigid registration model is enhanced with a
reweighting scheme, and solved by transferring the model into some alternating
optimized subproblems which have exact solutions and guaranteed convergence.
Experimental results on both public datasets and real scanned datasets show
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is more robust to
noise and outliers than conventional non-rigid registration methods.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is widely applied to uncertainty modelling
and knowledge reasoning because of its advantages in dealing with uncertain
information. But some conditions or requirements, such as exclusiveness
hypothesis and completeness constraint, limit the development and application
of that theory to a large extend. To overcome the shortcomings and enhance its
capability of representing the uncertainty, a novel model, called D numbers,
has been proposed recently. However, many key issues, for example how to
implement the combination of D numbers, remain unsolved. In the paper, we have
explored the combination of D Numbers from a perspective of conflict
redistribution, and proposed two combination rules being suitable for different
situations for the fusion of two D numbers. The proposed combination rules can
reduce to the classical Dempster's rule in Dempster-Shafer theory under a
certain conditions. Numerical examples and discussion about the proposed rules
are also given in the paper.

 <dc:description>  Massive Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) adaption is one of the primary
evolving objectives for the next generation high speed train (HST)
communication system. In this paper, we consider how to design an efficient
low-complexity location-aware beamforming for the multi-user (MU) massive MIMO
system in HST scenario. We first put forward a low-complexity beamforming based
on location information, where multiple users are considered. Then, without
considering inter-beam interference, a closed-form solution to maximize the
total service competence of base station (BS) is proposed in this MU HST
scenario. Finally, we present a location-aid searching-based suboptimal
solution to eliminate the inter-beam interference and maximize the BS service
competence. Various simulations are given to exhibit the advantages of our
proposed massive MIMO beamforming method.

However, there is no theoretical quantification for relating the data utility
that is preserved by the anonymization techniques and the data vulnerability
against de-anonymization attacks.
  In this paper, we theoretically analyze the de-anonymization attacks and
provide conditions on the utility of the anonymized data (denoted by anonymized
utility) to achieve successful de-anonymization. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work on quantifying the relationships between anonymized
utility and de-anonymization capability. Unlike previous work, our
quantification analysis requires no assumptions about the graph model, thus
providing a general theoretical guide for developing practical
de-anonymization/anonymization techniques.
  Furthermore, we evaluate state-of-the-art de-anonymization attacks on a
real-world Facebook dataset to show the limitations of previous work. By
comparing these experimental results and the theoretically achievable
de-anonymization capability derived in our analysis, we further demonstrate the
ineffectiveness of previous de-anonymization attacks and the potential of more
powerful de-anonymization attacks in the future.

 <dc:description>  The history of humanhood has included competitive activities of many
different forms. Sports have offered many benefits beyond that of
entertainment. At the time of this article, there exists not a competitive
ecosystem for cyber security beyond that of conventional capture the flag
competitions, and the like. This paper introduces a competitive framework with
a foundation on computer science, and hacking. This proposed competitive
landscape encompasses the ideas underlying information security, software
engineering, and cyber warfare. We also demonstrate the opportunity to rank,
score, &amp; categorize actionable skill levels into tiers of capability.
Physiological metrics are analyzed from participants during gameplay. These
analyses provide support regarding the intricacies required for competitive
play, and analysis of play. We use these intricacies to build a case for an
organized competitive ecosystem. Using previous player behavior from gameplay,
we also demonstrate the generation of an artificial agent purposed with
gameplay at a competitive level.

 <dc:description>  Acquiring the accurate 3-D position of a target person around a robot
provides fundamental and valuable information that is applicable to a wide
range of robotic tasks, including home service, navigation and entertainment.
This paper presents a real-time robotic 3-D human tracking system which
combines a monocular camera with an ultrasonic sensor by the extended Kalman
filter (EKF). The proposed system consists of three sub-modules: monocular
camera sensor tracking model, ultrasonic sensor tracking model and multi-sensor
fusion. An improved visual tracking algorithm is presented to provide partial
location estimation (2-D). The algorithm is designed to overcome severe
occlusions, scale variation, target missing and achieve robust re-detection.
The scale accuracy is further enhanced by the estimated 3-D information. An
ultrasonic sensor array is employed to provide the range information from the
target person to the robot and Gaussian Process Regression is used for partial
location estimation (2-D). EKF is adopted to sequentially process multiple,
heterogeneous measurements arriving in an asynchronous order from the vision
sensor and the ultrasonic sensor separately. In the experiments, the proposed
tracking system is tested in both simulation platform and actual mobile robot
for various indoor and outdoor scenes. The experimental results show the
superior performance of the 3-D tracking system in terms of both the accuracy
and robustness.

 <dc:title>Superposition as memory: unlocking quantum automatic complexity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Imagine a lock with two states, &quot;locked&quot; and &quot;unlocked&quot;, which may be
manipulated using two operations, called 0 and 1. Moreover, the only way to
(with certainty) unlock using four operations is to do them in the sequence
0011, i.e., $0^n1^n$ where $n=2$. In this scenario one might think that the
lock needs to be in certain further states after each operation, so that there
is some memory of what has been done so far. Here we show that this memory can
be entirely encoded in superpositions of the two basic states &quot;locked&quot; and
&quot;unlocked&quot;, where, as dictated by quantum mechanics, the operations are given
by unitary matrices. Moreover, we show using the Jordan--Schur lemma that a
similar lock is not possible for $n=60$.
  We define the semi-classical quantum automatic complexity $Q_{s}(x)$ of a
word $x$ as the infimum in lexicographic order of those pairs of nonnegative
integers $(n,q)$ such that there is a subgroup $G$ of the projective unitary
group PU$(n)$ with $|G|\le q$ and with $U_0,U_1\in G$ such that, in terms of a
standard basis $\{e_k\}$ and with $U_z=\prod_k U_{z(k)}$, we have $U_x e_1=e_2$
and $U_y e_1 \ne e_2$ for all $y\ne x$ with $|y|=|x|$. We show that $Q_s$ is
unbounded and not constant for strings of a given length. In particular, \[
  Q_{s}(0^21^2)\le (2,12) &lt; (3,1) \le Q_{s}(0^{60}1^{60}) \] and
$Q_s(0^{120})\le (2,121)$.

 <dc:title>Sparse Named Entity Classification using Factorization Machines</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hirata, Ai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Komachi, Mamoru</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Named entity classification is the task of classifying text-based elements
into various categories, including places, names, dates, times, and monetary
values. A bottleneck in named entity classification, however, is the data
problem of sparseness, because new named entities continually emerge, making it
rather difficult to maintain a dictionary for named entity classification.
Thus, in this paper, we address the problem of named entity classification
using matrix factorization to overcome the problem of feature sparsity.
Experimental results show that our proposed model, with fewer features and a
smaller size, achieves competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on developing new navigation and reconnaissance
capabilities for cooperative unmanned systems in uncertain environments. The
goal is to design a cooperative multi-vehicle system that can survey an unknown
environment and find the most valuable route for personnel to travel. To
accomplish the goal, the multi-vehicle system first explores spatially diverse
routes and then selects the safest route. In particular, the proposed
cooperative path planner sequentially generates a set of spatially diverse
routes according to a number of factors, including travel distance, ease of
travel, and uncertainty associated with the ease of travel. The planner's
dependence on each of these factors is altered by a weighted score, doing so
changes the criteria for determining an optimum route. To penalize the
selection of same paths by different vehicles, a control gain is used to
increase the cost of paths that lie near the route(s) assigned to other
vehicles. By varying the control gain, the spatial diversity among routes can
be accomplished. By repeatedly searching for different paths cooperatively, an
optimal path can be selected that yields the most valuable route.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of reconstructing the graph of a sparse Gaussian
Graphical Model from independent observations, which is equivalent to finding
non-zero elements of an inverse covariance matrix. For a model of size $p$ and
maximum degree $d$, information theoretic lower bounds established in prior
works require that the number of samples needed for recovering the graph
perfectly is at least $d \log p/\kappa^2$, where $\kappa$ is the minimum
normalized non-zero entry of the inverse covariance matrix. Existing algorithms
require additional assumptions to guarantee perfect graph reconstruction, and
consequently, their sample complexity is dependent on parameters that are not
present in the information theoretic lower bound. We propose an estimator,
called SLICE, that consists of a cardinality constrained least-squares
regression followed by a thresholding procedure. Without any additional
assumptions we show that SLICE attains a sample complexity of
$\frac{64}{\kappa^4}d \log p$, which differs from the lower bound by only a
factor proportional to $1/\kappa^2$ and depends only on parameters present in
the lower bound.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an approach for applying GANs to NMT. We build a
conditional sequence generative adversarial net which comprises of two
adversarial sub models, a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to
generate sentences which are hard to be discriminated from human-translated
sentences ( i.e., the golden target sentences); And the discriminator makes
efforts to discriminate the machine-generated sentences from human-translated
ones. The two sub models play a mini-max game and achieve the win-win situation
when they reach a Nash Equilibrium. Additionally, the static sentence-level
BLEU is utilized as the reinforced objective for the generator, which biases
the generation towards high BLEU points. During training, both the dynamic
discriminator and the static BLEU objective are employed to evaluate the
generated sentences and feedback the evaluations to guide the learning of the
generator. Experimental results show that the proposed model consistently
outperforms the traditional RNNSearch and the newly emerged state-of-the-art
Transformer on English-German and Chinese-English translation tasks.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic variance reduction algorithms have recently become popular for
minimizing the average of a large, but finite number of loss functions. The
present paper proposes a Riemannian stochastic quasi-Newton algorithm with
variance reduction (R-SQN-VR). The key challenges of averaging, adding, and
subtracting multiple gradients are addressed with notions of retraction and
vector transport. We present convergence analyses of R-SQN-VR on both
non-convex and retraction-convex functions under retraction and vector
transport operators. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the Karcher mean
computation on the symmetric positive-definite manifold and the low-rank matrix
completion on the Grassmann manifold. In all cases, the proposed algorithm
outperforms the state-of-the-art Riemannian batch and stochastic gradient
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional
classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational
tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard
curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for
teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with
hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud
computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to
improve the efficiency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript
details recent advances towards using commonly-available cloud computing
services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning
experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benefits (and challenges) of
using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss
the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give
suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for
pedagogy and reproducibility.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyses the DeGroot-Friedkin model for evolution of the
individuals' social powers in a social network when the network topology varies
dynamically (described by dynamic relative interaction matrices). The
DeGroot-Friedkin model describes how individual social power (self-appraisal,
self-weight) evolves as a network of individuals discuss a sequence of issues.
We seek to study dynamically changing relative interactions because
interactions may change depending on the issue being discussed. In order to
explore the problem in detail, two different cases of issue-dependent network
topologies are studied. First, if the topology varies between issues in a
periodic manner, it is shown that the individuals' self-appraisals admit a
periodic solution. Second, if the topology changes arbitrarily, under the
assumption that each relative interaction matrix is doubly stochastic and
irreducible, the individuals' self-appraisals asymptotically converge to a
unique non-trivial equilibrium.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This is the extended version of the paper accepted into 20th IFAC
  World Congress. It contains proofs for the periodic system, and includes
  arbitrarily issue-varying relative interaction matrices which are all doubly
  stochastic</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  One of the most efficient ways for a learning-based robotic arm to learn to
process complex tasks as human, is to directly learn from observing how human
complete those tasks, and then imitate. Our idea is based on success of Deep
Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm according to reinforcement learning, and then extend
to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. We developed a
learning-based method, combining modified DDPG and visual imitation network.
Our approach acquires frames only from a monocular camera, and no need to
either construct a 3D environment or generate actual points. The result we
expected during training, was that robot would be able to move as almost the
same as how human hands did.

 <dc:description>  By capturing statistical patterns in large corpora, machine learning has
enabled significant advances in natural language processing, including in
machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. However, for
agents to intelligently interact with humans, simply capturing the statistical
patterns is insufficient. In this paper we investigate if, and how, grounded
compositional language can emerge as a means to achieve goals in multi-agent
populations. Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment
and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional
language. This language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols
uttered by agents over time, but nonetheless has a coherent structure that
possesses a defined vocabulary and syntax. We also observe emergence of
non-verbal communication such as pointing and guiding when language
communication is unavailable.

 <dc:description>  Recent methods have adapted the well-established AGM and belief base
frameworks for belief change to cover belief revision in logic programs. In
this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic
programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the
rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches
that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the
latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties
for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.
  We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial
meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which
allow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and
support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more
information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones,
but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the
first in the field to the best of our knowledge.
  In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the
revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to
the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the
belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our
operators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a
logic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions
to performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program.
Finally, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision
methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and
generalise the other method.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our approach for the triple scoring task at the WSDM Cup
2017. The task required participants to assign a relevance score for each pair
of entities and their types in a knowledge base in order to enhance the ranking
results in entity retrieval tasks. We propose an approach wherein the outputs
of multiple neural network classifiers are combined using a supervised machine
learning model. The experimental results showed that our proposed method
achieved the best performance in one out of three measures (i.e., Kendall's
tau), and performed competitively in the other two measures (i.e., accuracy and
average score difference).

 <dc:description>  Locating sources of diffusion and spreading from minimum data is a
significant problem in network science with great applied values to the
society. However, a general theoretical framework dealing with optimal source
localization is lacking. Combining the controllability theory for complex
networks and compressive sensing, we develop a framework with high efficiency
and robustness for optimal source localization in arbitrary weighted networks
with arbitrary distribution of sources. We offer a minimum output analysis to
quantify the source locatability through a minimal number of messenger nodes
that produce sufficient measurement for fully locating the sources. When the
minimum messenger nodes are discerned, the problem of optimal source
localization becomes one of sparse signal reconstruction, which can be solved
using compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical
networks demonstrates that sources in homogeneous and denser networks are more
readily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected
network with random link weights and weak noise, a single messenger node is
sufficient for locating any number of sources. The framework deepens our
understanding of the network source localization problem and offers efficient
tools with broad applications.

 <dc:description>  The problem addressed in this paper is the challenge arising in enabling
collaborative learning in the context distance education models. While research
has made quantum leaps in the development of both effective collaborative
pedagogical models as well as online learning environments, the research at the
intersection of these two areas has been scarce. This paper presents the design
for a new collaborative virtual model, named Collaborative Virtual Affinity
Group model (CVAG), which is an extension of the successful Affinity Group
Research (ARG) model. The new model provides an integration of the principles
underlying ARG with the traditional principles of virtual learning
environments. The CVAG model is explored in the context of introductory
Computer Science courses|where students are focused on learning the basic
principles of computer programming.

 <dc:title>Greedy-Merge Degrading has Optimal Power-Law</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kartowsky, Assaf</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tal, Ido</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Consider a channel with a given input alphabet size and a given input
distribution. Our aim is to degrade or upgrade it to a channel with at most L
output letters.
  The paper contains four main results. The first result, from which the paper
title is derived, deals with the so called &quot;greedy-merge&quot; algorithm. We derive
an upper bound on the reduction in mutual information between input and output.
This upper bound is within a constant factor of an algorithm-independent lower
bound. Thus, we establish that greedy-merge is optimal in the power-law sense.
  The other main results deal with upgrading. The second result shows that a
certain sequence of channels that was previously shown to be &quot;hard&quot; for
degrading, displays the same hardness in the context of upgrading. That is,
suppose we are given such a channel and a corresponding input distribution. If
we upgrade (degrade) to a new channel with L output letters, we incur an
increase (decrease) in mutual information between input and output. We show
that a previously derived bound on the decrease in mutual information for the
degrading case is also a lower bound on the increase for the upgrading case.
  The third result is an efficient algorithm for optimal upgrading, in the
binary-input case. That is, we are given a channel and an input distribution.
We must find an upgraded channel with L output letters, for which the increase
in mutual information is minimal. We give a simple characterization of such a
channel, which implies an efficient algorithm.
  The fourth result is an analog of the first result for the upgrading case,
when the input is binary. That is, we first present a sub-optimal algorithm for
the setting considered in the third result. By analyzing the algorithm, we show
that the increase incurred in mutual information is within a constant factor of
the lower bound derived in the second result.

 <dc:description>  We show that for a particular class of quantum channels, which we call
heralded channels, monogamy of squashed entanglement limits the superadditivity
of Holevo capacity. Heralded channels provide a means to understand the quantum
erasure channel composed with an arbitrary other quantum channel, as well as
common situations in experimental quantum information that involve frequent
loss of qubits or failure of trials. We also show how entanglement monogamy
applies to non-classicality in quantum games, and we consider how faithful,
monogamous entanglement measures may bound other entanglement-dependent
quantities in many-party scenarios.

 <dc:title>On the Support Recovery of Jointly Sparse Gaussian Sources using Sparse
  Bayesian Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khanna, Saurabh</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Murthy, Chandra R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we provide non-asymptotic, probabilistic guarantees for
successful sparse support recovery by the multiple sparse Bayesian learning
(M-SBL) algorithm in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) framework. For joint
sparse Gaussian sources, we show that M-SBL perfectly recovers their common
nonzero support with arbitrarily high probability using only finitely many
MMVs. In fact, the support error probability decays exponentially fast with the
number of MMVs, with the decay rate depending on the restricted isometry
property of the self Khatri-Rao product of the measurement matrix. Our analysis
theoretically confirms that M-SBL is capable of recovering supports of size as
high as $\mathcal{O}(m^2)$, where $m$ is the number of measurements per sparse
vector. In contrast, popular MMV algorithms in compressed sensing such as
simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit and row-LASSO can recover only
$\mathcal{O}(m)$ sized supports. In the special case of noiseless measurements,
we show that a single MMV suffices for perfect recovery of the $k$-sparse
support in M-SBL, provided any $k + 1$ columns of the measurement matrix are
linearly independent. Unlike existing support recovery guarantees for M-SBL,
our sufficient conditions are non-asymptotic in nature, and do not require the
orthogonality of the nonzero rows of the joint sparse signals.

 <dc:description>  Despite their overwhelming capacity to overfit, deep learning architectures
tend to generalize relatively well to unseen data, allowing them to be deployed
in practice. However, explaining why this is the case is still an open area of
research. One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e.g. Hochreiter &amp;
Schmidhuber (1997); Keskar et al. (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the
loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good
generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic
for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization.
Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can
exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent
symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models
corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Furthermore, if we allow to
reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically
without affecting its generalization properties.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel policy for device caching that facilitates
popular content exchange through high-rate device-to-device (D2D)
millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication. The D2D-aware caching (DAC) policy
splits the cacheable content into two content groups and distributes it
randomly to the user equipment devices (UEs), with the goal to enable D2D
connections. By exploiting the high bandwidth availability and the
directionality of mmWaves, we ensure high rates for the D2D transmissions,
while mitigating the co-channel interference that limits the throughput gains
of D2D communication in the sub-6 GHz bands. Furthermore, based on a
stochastic-geometry modeling of the network topology, we analytically derive
the offloading gain that is achieved by the proposed policy and the
distribution of the content retrieval delay considering both half- and
full-duplex mode for the D2D communication. The accuracy of the proposed
analytical framework is validated through Monte-Carlo simulations. In addition,
for a wide range of a content popularity indicator the results show that the
proposed policy achieves higher offloading and lower content-retrieval delays
than existing state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a criterion, resilience, which allows properties of a dataset
(such as its mean or best low rank approximation) to be robustly computed, even
in the presence of a large fraction of arbitrary additional data. Resilience is
a weaker condition than most other properties considered so far in the
literature, and yet enables robust estimation in a broader variety of settings.
We provide new information-theoretic results on robust distribution learning,
robust estimation of stochastic block models, and robust mean estimation under
bounded $k$th moments. We also provide new algorithmic results on robust
distribution learning, as well as robust mean estimation in $\ell_p$-norms.
Among our proof techniques is a method for pruning a high-dimensional
distribution with bounded $1$st moments to a stable &quot;core&quot; with bounded $2$nd
moments, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  We consider the complexity of Green's relations when the semigroup is given
by transformations on a finite set. Green's relations can be defined by
reachability in the (right/left/two-sided) Cayley graph. The equivalence
classes then correspond to the strongly connected components. It is not
difficult to show that, in the worst case, the number of equivalence classes is
in the same order of magnitude as the number of elements. Another important
parameter is the maximal length of a chain of components. Our main contribution
is an exponential lower bound for this parameter. There is a simple
construction for an arbitrary set of generators. However, the proof for
constant alphabet is rather involved. Our results also apply to automata and
their syntactic semigroups.

 <dc:description>  Community detection or clustering is a fundamental task in the analysis of
network data. Many real networks have a bipartite structure which makes
community detection challenging. In this paper, we consider a model which
allows for matched communities in the bipartite setting, in addition to node
covariates with information about the matching. We derive a simple fast
algorithm for fitting the model based on variational inference ideas and show
its effectiveness on both simulated and real data. A variation of the model to
allow for degree-correction is also considered, in addition to a novel approach
to fitting such degree-corrected models.

 <dc:description>  The constrained LCS problem asks one to find a longest common subsequence of
two input strings $A$ and $B$ with some constraints. The STR-IC-LCS problem is
a variant of the constrained LCS problem, where the solution must include a
given constraint string $C$ as a substring. Given two strings $A$ and $B$ of
respective lengths $M$ and $N$, and a constraint string $C$ of length at most
$\min\{M, N\}$, the best known algorithm for the STR-IC-LCS problem, proposed
by Deorowicz~({\em Inf. Process. Lett.}, 11:423--426, 2012), runs in $O(MN)$
time. In this work, we present an $O(mN + nM)$-time solution to the STR-IC-LCS
problem, where $m$ and $n$ denote the sizes of the run-length encodings of $A$
and $B$, respectively. Since $m \leq M$ and $n \leq N$ always hold, our
algorithm is always as fast as Deorowicz's algorithm, and is faster when input
strings are compressible via RLE.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we compare the resource allocation fairness of uplink
communications between non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes and
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes. Through characterizing the
contribution of the individual user data rate to the system sum rate, we
analyze the fundamental reasons that NOMA offers a more fair resource
allocation than that of OMA in asymmetric channels. Furthermore, a fairness
indicator metric based on Jain's index is proposed to measure the asymmetry of
multiuser channels. More importantly, the proposed metric provides a selection
criterion for choosing between NOMA and OMA for fair resource allocation. Based
on this discussion, we propose a hybrid NOMA-OMA scheme to further enhance the
users fairness. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the proposed metric
and demonstrate the fairness enhancement of the proposed hybrid NOMA-OMA scheme
compared to the conventional OMA and NOMA schemes.

 <dc:description>  Learning binary representation is essential to large-scale computer vision
tasks. Most existing algorithms require a separate quantization constraint to
learn effective hashing functions. In this work, we present Direct Binary
Embedding (DBE), a simple yet very effective algorithm to learn binary
representation in an end-to-end fashion. By appending an ingeniously designed
DBE layer to the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), DBE learns binary
code directly from the continuous DBE layer activation without quantization
error. By employing the deep residual network (ResNet) as DCNN component, DBE
captures rich semantics from images. Furthermore, in the effort of handling
multilabel images, we design a joint cross entropy loss that includes both
softmax cross entropy and weighted binary cross entropy in consideration of the
correlation and independence of labels, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant superiority of DBE over state-of-the-art methods on
tasks of natural object recognition, image retrieval and image annotation.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an end-to-end pixelwise fully automated segmentation of
the head sectioned images of the Visible Korean Human (VKH) project based on
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). By converting classification
networks into Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), a coarse prediction map,
with smaller size than the original input image, can be created for
segmentation purposes. To refine this map and to obtain a dense pixel-wise
output, standard FCNs use deconvolution layers to upsample the coarse map.
However, upsampling based on deconvolution increases the number of network
parameters and causes loss of detail because of interpolation. On the other
hand, dilated convolution is a new technique introduced recently that attempts
to capture multi-scale contextual information without increasing the network
parameters while keeping the resolution of the prediction maps high. We used
both a standard FCN and a dilated convolution based FCN for semantic
segmentation of the head sectioned images of the VKH dataset. Quantitative
results showed approximately 20% improvement in the segmentation accuracy when
using FCNs with dilated convolutions.

 <dc:title>What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are two major types of uncertainty one can model. Aleatoric uncertainty
captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic
uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be
explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model
epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning
tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs.
aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For
this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent
aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models
under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression
tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss
functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation.
This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art
results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease where early
detection benefits the survival rate. COPD can be quantified by classifying
patches of computed tomography images, and combining patch labels into an
overall diagnosis for the image. As labeled patches are often not available,
image labels are propagated to the patches, incorrectly labeling healthy
patches in COPD patients as being affected by the disease. We approach
quantification of COPD from lung images as a multiple instance learning (MIL)
problem, which is more suitable for such weakly labeled data. We investigate
various MIL assumptions in the context of COPD and show that although a concept
region with COPD-related disease patterns is present, considering the whole
distribution of lung tissue patches improves the performance. The best method
is based on averaging instances and obtains an AUC of 0.742, which is higher
than the previously reported best of 0.713 on the same dataset. Using the full
training set further increases performance to 0.776, which is significantly
higher (DeLong test) than previous results.

 <dc:description>  Supervised learning has been very successful for automatic segmentation of
images from a single scanner. However, several papers report deteriorated
performances when using classifiers trained on images from one scanner to
segment images from other scanners. We propose a transfer learning classifier
that adapts to differences between training and test images. This method uses a
weighted ensemble of classifiers trained on individual images. The weight of
each classifier is determined by the similarity between its training image and
the test image.
  We examine three unsupervised similarity measures, which can be used in
scenarios where no labeled data from a newly introduced scanner or scanning
protocol is available. The measures are based on a divergence, a bag distance,
and on estimating the labels with a clustering procedure. These measures are
asymmetric. We study whether the asymmetry can improve classification. Out of
the three similarity measures, the bag similarity measure is the most robust
across different studies and achieves excellent results on four brain tissue
segmentation datasets and three white matter lesion segmentation datasets,
acquired at different centers and with different scanners and scanning
protocols. We show that the asymmetry can indeed be informative, and that
computing the similarity from the test image to the training images is more
appropriate than the opposite direction.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of \emph{instance label stability} in multiple
instance learning (MIL) classifiers. These classifiers are trained only on
globally annotated images (bags), but often can provide fine-grained
annotations for image pixels or patches (instances). This is interesting for
computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and other medical image analysis tasks for which
only a coarse labeling is provided. Unfortunately, the instance labels may be
unstable. This means that a slight change in training data could potentially
lead to abnormalities being detected in different parts of the image, which is
undesirable from a CAD point of view. Despite MIL gaining popularity in the CAD
literature, this issue has not yet been addressed. We investigate the stability
of instance labels provided by several MIL classifiers on 5 different datasets,
of which 3 are medical image datasets (breast histopathology, diabetic
retinopathy and computed tomography lung images). We propose an unsupervised
measure to evaluate instance stability, and demonstrate that a
performance-stability trade-off can be made when comparing MIL classifiers.

 <dc:description>  Programming by Example (PBE) targets at automatically inferring a computer
program for accomplishing a certain task from sample input and output. In this
paper, we propose a deep neural networks (DNN) based PBE model called Neural
Programming by Example (NPBE), which can learn from input-output strings and
induce programs that solve the string manipulation problems. Our NPBE model has
four neural network based components: a string encoder, an input-output
analyzer, a program generator, and a symbol selector. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NPBE by training it end-to-end to solve some common string
manipulation problems in spreadsheet systems. The results show that our model
can induce string manipulation programs effectively. Our work is one step
towards teaching DNN to generate computer programs.

 <dc:description>  The happy-productive worker thesis states that happy workers are more
productive. Recent research in software engineering supports the thesis, and
the ideal of flourishing happiness among software developers is often expressed
among industry practitioners. However, the literature suggests that a
cost-effective way to foster happiness and productivity among workers could be
to limit unhappiness. Psychological disorders such as job burnout and anxiety
could also be reduced by limiting the negative experiences of software
developers. Simultaneously, a baseline assessment of (un)happiness and
knowledge about how developers experience it are missing. In this paper, we
broaden the understanding of unhappiness among software developers in terms of
(1) the software developer population distribution of (un)happiness, and (2)
the causes of unhappiness while developing software. We conducted a large-scale
quantitative and qualitative survey, incorporating a psychometrically validated
instrument for measuring (un)happiness, with 2220 developers, yielding a rich
and balanced sample of 1318 complete responses. Our results indicate that
software developers are a slightly happy population, but the need for limiting
the unhappiness of developers remains. We also identified 219 factors
representing causes of unhappiness while developing software. Our results,
which are available as open data, can act as guidelines for practitioners in
management positions and developers in general for fostering happiness on the
job. We suggest considering happiness in future studies of both human and
technical aspects in software engineering.

 <dc:description>  In the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture, the baseband signals
from multiple remote radio heads are processed in a centralized baseband unit
(BBU) pool. This architecture allows network operators to adapt the BBU's
computational resources to the aggregate access load experienced at the BBU,
which can change in every air-interface access frame. The degree of savings
that can be achieved by adapting the resources is a tradeoff between savings,
adaptation frequency, and increased queuing time. If the time scale for
adaptation of the resource multiplexing is greater than the access frame
duration, then this may result in additional access latency and limit the
energy savings. In this paper we investigate the tradeoff by considering two
extreme time-scales for the resource multiplexing: (i) long-term, where the
computational resources are adapted over periods much larger than the access
frame durations; (ii) short-term, where the adaption is below the access frame
duration. We develop a general C-RAN queuing model that describes the access
latency and show, for Poisson arrivals, that long-term multiplexing achieves
savings comparable to short-term multiplexing, while offering low
implementation complexity.

 <dc:description>  Zero-shot recognition aims to accurately recognize objects of unseen classes
by using a shared visual-semantic mapping between the image feature space and
the semantic embedding space. This mapping is learned on training data of seen
classes and is expected to have transfer ability to unseen classes. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between
the semantic space manifold and the transfer ability of visual-semantic
mapping. We formalize their connection and cast zero-shot recognition as a
joint optimization problem. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework for
zero-shot recognition, which contains dual visual-semantic mapping paths. Our
analysis shows this framework can not only apply prior semantic knowledge to
infer underlying semantic manifold in the image feature space, but also
generate optimized semantic embedding space, which can enhance the transfer
ability of the visual-semantic mapping to unseen classes. The proposed method
is evaluated for zero-shot recognition on four benchmark datasets, achieving
outstanding results.

 <dc:title>On the Importance of Super-Gaussian Speech Priors for Machine-Learning
  Based Speech Enhancement</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rehr, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gerkmann, Timo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For enhancing noisy signals, machine-learning based single-channel speech
enhancement schemes exploit prior knowledge about typical speech spectral
structures. To ensure a good generalization and to meet requirements in terms
of computational complexity and memory consumption, certain methods restrict
themselves to learning speech spectral envelopes. We refer to these approaches
as machine-learning spectral envelope (MLSE)-based approaches.
  In this paper we show by means of theoretical and experimental analyses that
for MLSE-based approaches, super-Gaussian priors allow for a reduction of noise
between speech spectral harmonics which is not achievable using Gaussian
estimators such as the Wiener filter. For the evaluation, we use a deep neural
network (DNN)-based phoneme classifier and a low-rank nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) framework as examples of MLSE-based approaches. A listening
experiment and instrumental measures confirm that while super-Gaussian priors
yield only moderate improvements for classic enhancement schemes, for
MLSE-based approaches super-Gaussian priors clearly make an important
difference and significantly outperform Gaussian priors.

 <dc:description>  Complexity analysis becomes a common task in supervisory control. However,
many results of interest are spread across different topics. The aim of this

 <dc:description>  We explore multi-round quantum memoryless communication protocols. These are
restricted version of multi-round quantum communication protocols. The
&quot;memoryless&quot; term means that players forget history from previous rounds, and
their behavior is obtained only by input and message from the opposite player.
The model is interesting because this allows us to get lower bounds for models
like automata, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams and streaming algorithms. At
the same time, we can prove stronger results with this restriction. We present
a lower bound for quantum memoryless protocols. Additionally, we show a lower
bound for Disjointness function for this model. % As an application of
communication complexity results, we consider Quantum Ordered Read-$k$-times
Branching Programs ($k$-QOBDD). Our communication complexity result allows us
to get lower bound for $k$-QOBDD and to prove hierarchies for sublinear width
bounded error $k$-QOBDDs, where $k=o(\sqrt{n})$. Furthermore, we prove a
hierarchy for polynomial size bounded error $k$-QOBDDs for constant $k$. This
result differs from the situation with an unbounded error where it is known
that an increase of $k$ does not give any advantage.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Infimal Observable Superlanguages</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The infimal prefix-closed, controllable and observable superlanguage plays an
essential role in the relationship between controllability, observability and
co-observability -- the central notions of supervisory control theory. Existing
algorithms for its computation are exponential and it is not known whether a
polynomial algorithm exists. In this paper, we study the state complexity of
this language. State complexity of a language is the number of states of the
minimal DFA for the language. For a language of state complexity $n$, we show
that the upper-bound state complexity on the infimal prefix-closed and
observable superlanguage is $2^n + 1$ and that this bound is asymptotically
tight. It proves that there is no algorithm computing a DFA of the infimal
prefix-closed and observable superlanguage in polynomial time. Our construction
further shows that such a DFA can be computed in time $O(2^n)$. The
construction involves NFAs and a computation of the supremal prefix-closed
sublanguage. We study the computation of the supremal prefix-closed sublanguage
and show that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that computes an NFA of the
supremal prefix-closed sublanguage of a language given as an NFA even if the
language is unary.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a method to initialize at a feasible point and
unfailingly solve a non-convex optimization problem in which a set-point motion
is planned for a multi-link manipulator under state and control constraints. We
construct an initial feasible solution by analyzing the final time effect for
feasibility problems of flatness based motion planning problems. More
specifically, we first find a feasible time-optimal trajectory under state
constraints without a control constraint by solving a linear programming
problem. Then, we find a feasible trajectory under control constraints by
scaling the trajectory. To evaluate the practical applicability of the proposed
method, we did numerical experiments to solve a multi-link manipulator motion
planning problem by combining the method with recursive inverse dynamics
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Structured output support vector machine (SVM) based tracking algorithms have
shown favorable performance recently. Nonetheless, the time-consuming candidate
sampling and complex optimization limit their real-time applications. In this
paper, we propose a novel large margin object tracking method which absorbs the
strong discriminative ability from structured output SVM and speeds up by the
correlation filter algorithm significantly. Secondly, a multimodal target
detection technique is proposed to improve the target localization precision
and prevent model drift introduced by similar objects or background noise.
Thirdly, we exploit the feedback from high-confidence tracking results to avoid
the model corruption problem. We implement two versions of the proposed tracker
with the representations from both conventional hand-crafted and deep
convolution neural networks (CNNs) based features to validate the strong
compatibility of the algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed tracker performs superiorly against several state-of-the-art
algorithms on the challenging benchmark sequences while runs at speed in excess
of 80 frames per second. The source code and experimental results will be made
publicly available.

 <dc:description>  Directional transforms have recently raised a lot of interest thanks to their
numerous applications in signal compression and analysis. In this letter, we
introduce a generalization of the discrete Fourier transform, called steerable
DFT (SDFT). Since the DFT is used in numerous fields, it may be of interest in
a wide range of applications. Moreover, we also show that the SDFT is highly
related to other well-known transforms, such as the Fourier sine and cosine
transforms and the Hilbert transforms.

 <dc:description>  The question of whether subcubic graphs have finite packing chromatic number
or not is still open although positive responses are known for some subclasses,
including subcubic trees, base-3 Sierpiski graphs and hexagonal lattices. In
this paper, we answer positively to the question for some subcubic outerplanar
graphs. We provide asymptotic bounds depending on structural properties of the
weak dual of the outerplanar graphs and determine sharper bounds on some
classes of subcubic outerplanar graphs.

a key quantity in wireless communications. In the case where the path-loss
function representing signal attenuation is unbounded at the origin, we derive
the exact tail asymptotics of the SIR distribution under an appropriate
sufficient condition. While we show that widely-used models based on a Poisson
point process and on a determinantal point process meet the sufficient
condition, we also give a counterexample violating it. In the case of bounded
path-loss functions, we derive a logarithmically asymptotic upper bound on the
SIR tail distribution for the Poisson-based and $\alpha$-Ginibre-based models.
A logarithmically asymptotic lower bound with the same order as the upper bound
is also obtained for the Poisson-based model.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Fonduer, a knowledge base construction (KBC) framework for
richly formatted information extraction (RFIE), where entity relations and
attributes are conveyed via structural, tabular, visual, and textual
expressions. Fonduer introduces a new programming model for KBC built around a
unified data representation that accounts for three challenging characteristics
of richly formatted data: (1) prevalent document-level relations, (2)
multimodality, and (3) data variety. Fonduer is the first KBC system for richly
formatted data and uses a human-in-the-loop paradigm for training machine
learning systems, referred to as data programming. Data programming softens the
burden of traditional supervision by only asking users to provide lightweight
functions that programmatically assign (potentially noisy) labels to the input
data. Fonduer's unified data model, together with data programming, allows
users to use domain expertise as weak signals of supervision that help guide
the KBC process over richly formatted data. We evaluate Fonduer on four
real-world applications over different domains and achieve an average
improvement of 42 F1 points over the upper bound of state-of-the-art
approaches. In some domains, our users have produced up to 1.87x the number of
correct entires compared to expert-curated public knowledge bases. Fonduer
scales gracefully to millions of documents and is used in both academia and
industry to create knowledge bases for real-world problems in many domains.

 <dc:title>Harmonic Mean Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares for Low-Rank Matrix

 <dc:description>  We propose a new iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm for
the recovery of a matrix $X \in \mathbb{C}^{d_1\times d_2}$ of rank $r
\ll\min(d_1,d_2)$ from incomplete linear observations, solving a sequence of
low complexity linear problems. The easily implementable algorithm, which we
call harmonic mean iteratively reweighted least squares (HM-IRLS), optimizes a
non-convex Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm penalization to promote low-rankness and
carries three major strengths, in particular for the matrix completion setting.
First, the algorithm converges globally to the low-rank matrix for relevant,
interesting cases, for which any other (non-)convex state-of-the-art
optimization approach fails the recovery. Secondly, HM-IRLS exhibits an
empirical recovery probability close to $100\%$ even for a number of
measurements very close to the theoretical lower bound $r (d_1 +d_2 -r)$, i.e.,
already for significantly fewer linear observations than any other tractable
approach in the literature. Thirdly, HM-IRLS exhibits a locally superlinear
rate of convergence (of order $2-p$) if the linear observations fulfill a
suitable null space property. While for the first two properties we have so far
only strong empirical evidence, we prove the third property as our main
theoretical result.

 <dc:description>  Relational program verification is a variant of program verification where
one can reason about two programs and as a special case about two executions of
a single program on different inputs. Relational program verification can be
used for reasoning about a broad range of properties, including equivalence and
refinement, and specialized notions such as continuity, information flow
security or relative cost. In a higher-order setting, relational program
verification can be achieved using relational refinement type systems, a form
of refinement types where assertions have a relational interpretation.
Relational refinement type systems excel at relating structurally equivalent
terms but provide limited support for relating terms with very different
structures.
  We present a logic, called Relational Higher Order Logic (RHOL), for proving
relational properties of a simply typed $\lambda$-calculus with inductive types
and recursive definitions. RHOL retains the type-directed flavour of relational
refinement type systems but achieves greater expressivity through rules which
simultaneously reason about the two terms as well as rules which only
contemplate one of the two terms. We show that RHOL has strong foundations, by
proving an equivalence with higher-order logic (HOL), and leverage this
equivalence to derive key meta-theoretical properties: subject reduction,
admissibility of a transitivity rule and set-theoretical soundness. Moreover,
we define sound embeddings for several existing relational type systems such as
relational refinement types and type systems for dependency analysis and
relative cost, and we verify examples that were out of reach of prior work.

 <dc:description>  Consider the following probabilistic process on a graph $G=(V,E)$. After
initially labeling each vertex $v$ by a real number, say randomly chosen in
$\pm 1$, we repeatedly pick a random edge and replace the values of its
endpoints by their average.
  Suppose the process is run on a graph exhibiting a community structure, such
as two expanders joined by a sparse cut: {\em is there a phase of the process,
in which its state reflects the underlying community structure? Moreover, can
nodes learn that structure via a local procedure?}
  We answer the first question in the affirmative for a class of regular
clustered graphs. Addressing the question above (in this restricted class as
well) requires studying the concentration of the averaging process around its
expectation. In turn, this calls for a deeper understanding of concentration
properties of the product of certain random matrices around its expectation.
These properties (albeit in different flavors) emerge both in the regime in
which the sparsity of the cut is $o(1/\log |V|)$ (with constant expansion
within each community), and when the sparsity is constant. The analysis in the
latter regime is the technically hardest part of this work, because we have to
establish concentration results up to inverse polynomial errors.
  As for the second question, since nodes do not share a common clock, it is
not immediate to translate the above results into distributed clustering
protocols. To this purpose, we show that concentration holds over a long time
window and most nodes are able to select a local time within this window. This
results in the first asynchronous distributed algorithms that require
logarithmic or polylogarithmic work per node (depending on the sparsity of the
cut) and that approximately recover community structure.

 <dc:description>  A revised version of this article is now available at Human Brain Mapping,
see http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23730/full . Deep learning
with convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) has revolutionized computer
vision through end-to-end learning, i.e. learning from the raw data. Now, there
is increasing interest in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis.
However, little is known about many important aspects of how to design and
train ConvNets for end-to-end EEG decoding, and there is still a lack of
techniques to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn.
  Here, we studied deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures,
designed for decoding imagined or executed movements from raw EEG. Our results
show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch
normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training
strategy, boosted the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching or
surpassing that of the widely-used filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP)
decoding algorithm. While FBCSP is designed to use spectral power modulations,
the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for
visualizing the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to
use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta and high gamma frequencies.
These methods also proved useful as a technique for spatially mapping the
learned features, revealing the topography of the causal contributions of
features in different frequency bands to decoding the movement classes.
  Our study thus shows how to design and train ConvNets to decode
movement-related information from the raw EEG without handcrafted features and
highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization
techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.

 <dc:description>  Among the topics discussed in Social Media, some lead to controversy. A
number of recent studies have focused on the problem of identifying controversy
in social media mostly based on the analysis of textual content or rely on
global network structure. Such approaches have strong limitations due to the
difficulty of understanding natural language, and of investigating the global
network structure. In this work we show that it is possible to detect
controversy in social media by exploiting network motifs, i.e., local patterns
of user interaction. The proposed approach allows for a language-independent
and fine- grained and efficient-to-compute analysis of user discussions and
their evolution over time. The supervised model exploiting motif patterns can
achieve 85% accuracy, with an improvement of 7% compared to baseline
structural, propagation-based and temporal network features.

 <dc:description>  We develop an online learning method for prediction, which is important in
problems with large and/or streaming data sets. We formulate the learning
approach using a covariance-fitting methodology, and show that the resulting
predictor has desirable computational and distribution-free properties: It is
implemented online with a runtime that scales linearly in the number of
samples; has a constant memory requirement; avoids local minima problems; and
prunes away redundant feature dimensions without relying on restrictive
assumptions on the data distribution. In conjunction with the split conformal
approach, it also produces distribution-free prediction confidence intervals in
a computationally efficient manner. The method is demonstrated on both real and
synthetic datasets.

 <dc:description>  In computer vision most iterative optimization algorithms, both sparse and
dense, rely on a coarse and reliable dense initialization to bootstrap their
optimization procedure. For example, dense optical flow algorithms profit
massively in speed and robustness if they are initialized well in the basin of
convergence of the used loss function. The same holds true for methods as
sparse feature tracking when initial flow or depth information for new features
at arbitrary positions is needed. This makes it extremely important to have
techniques at hand that allow to obtain from only very few available
measurements a dense but still approximative sketch of a desired 2D structure
(e.g. depth maps, optical flow, disparity maps, etc.). The 2D map is regarded
as sample from a 2D random process. The method presented here exploits the
complete information given by the principal component analysis (PCA) of that
process, the principal basis and its prior distribution. The method is able to
determine a dense reconstruction from sparse measurement. When facing
situations with only very sparse measurements, typically the number of
principal components is further reduced which results in a loss of
expressiveness of the basis. We overcome this problem and inject prior
knowledge in a maximum a posterior (MAP) approach. We test our approach on the
KITTI and the virtual KITTI datasets and focus on the interpolation of depth
maps for driving scenes. The evaluation of the results show good agreement to
the ground truth and are clearly better than results of interpolation by the
nearest neighbor method which disregards statistical information.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditionally, pose estimation is considered as a two step problem. First,
feature correspondences are determined by direct comparison of image patches,
or by associating feature descriptors. In a second step, the relative pose and
the coordinates of corresponding points are estimated, most often by minimizing
the reprojection error (RPE). RPE optimization is based on a loss function that
is merely aware of the feature pixel positions but not of the underlying image
intensities. In this paper, we propose a sparse direct method which introduces
a loss function that allows to simultaneously optimize the unscaled relative
pose, as well as the set of feature correspondences directly considering the
image intensity values. Furthermore, we show how to integrate statistical prior
information on the motion into the optimization process. This constructive
inclusion of a Bayesian bias term is particularly efficient in application
cases with a strongly predictable (short term) dynamic, e.g. in a driving
scenario. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the JET algorithm we propose
outperforms the classical reprojection error optimization on two synthetic
datasets and on the KITTI dataset. The JET algorithm runs in real-time on a
single CPU thread.

making up what is known as a fingerprint, can be collected from browsers by a

what information they make available, and hence their fingerprintability may
also vary. In this paper, we report on the results of experiments examining the
fingerprintable attributes made available by a range of modern browsers. We
tested the most widely used browsers for both desktop and mobile platforms. The
results reveal significant differences between browsers in terms of their
fingerprinting potential, meaning that the choice of browser has significant

 <dc:description>  Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is a widely used compressive sensing (CS)
algorithm for recovering sparse signals in noisy linear regression models. The
performance of OMP depends on its stopping criteria (SC). SC for OMP discussed
in literature typically assumes knowledge of either the sparsity of the signal
to be estimated $k_0$ or noise variance $\sigma^2$, both of which are
unavailable in many practical applications. In this article we develop a
modified version of OMP called tuning free OMP or TF-OMP which does not require
a SC. TF-OMP is proved to accomplish successful sparse recovery under the usual
assumptions on restricted isometry constants (RIC) and mutual coherence of
design matrix. TF-OMP is numerically shown to deliver a highly competitive
performance in comparison with OMP having \textit{a priori} knowledge of $k_0$
or $\sigma^2$. Greedy algorithm for robust de-noising (GARD) is an OMP like
algorithm proposed for efficient estimation in classical overdetermined linear
regression models corrupted by sparse outliers. However, GARD requires the
knowledge of inlier noise variance which is difficult to estimate. We also
produce a tuning free algorithm (TF-GARD) for efficient estimation in the
presence of sparse outliers by extending the operating principle of TF-OMP to
GARD. TF-GARD is numerically shown to achieve a performance comparable to that
of the existing implementation of GARD.

 <dc:description>  Active search (AS) on graphs focuses on collecting certain labeled nodes
(targets) given global knowledge of the network topology and its edge weights
under a query budget. However, in most networks, nodes, topology and edge
weights are all initially unknown. We introduce selective harvesting, a variant
of AS where the next node to be queried must be chosen among the neighbors of
the current queried node set; the available training data for deciding which
node to query is restricted to the subgraph induced by the queried set (and
their node attributes) and their neighbors (without any node or edge
attributes). Therefore, selective harvesting is a sequential decision problem,
where we must decide which node to query at each step. A classifier trained in
this scenario suffers from a tunnel vision effect: without recourse to
independent sampling, the urge to query promising nodes forces classifiers to
gather increasingly biased training data, which we show significantly hurts the
performance of AS methods and standard classifiers. We find that it is possible
to collect a much larger set of targets by using multiple classifiers, not by
combining their predictions as an ensemble, but switching between classifiers
used at each step, as a way to ease the tunnel vision effect. We discover that
switching classifiers collects more targets by (a) diversifying the training
data and (b) broadening the choices of nodes that can be queried next. This
highlights an exploration, exploitation, and diversification trade-off in our
problem that goes beyond the exploration and exploitation duality found in
classic sequential decision problems. From these observations we propose D3TS,
a method based on multi-armed bandits for non-stationary stochastic processes
that enforces classifier diversity, matching or exceeding the performance of
competing methods on seven real network datasets in our evaluation.

 <dc:description>  In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic networks are constructed to represent
the evolution of species in which reticulate events are thought to have
occurred, such as recombination and hybridization. It is therefore useful to
have efficiently computable metrics with which to systematically compare such
networks. Through developing an optimal algorithm to enumerate all trinets
displayed by a level-1 network (a type of network that is slightly more general
than an evolutionary tree), here we propose a cubic-time algorithm to compute
the trinet distance between two level-1 networks. Employing simulations, we
also present a comparison between the trinet metric and the so-called
Robinson-Foulds phylogenetic network metric restricted to level-1 networks. The
algorithms described in this paper have been implemented in JAVA and are freely
available at https://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/TriLoNet.

 <dc:description>  Windowed orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and wavelet OFDM
have been proposed as medium access techniques for broadband communications
over the power line network by the standard IEEE 1901. Windowed OFDM has been
extensively researched and employed in different fields of communication, while
wavelet OFDM, which has been recently recommended for the first time in a
standard, has received less attention. This work is aimed to show that wavelet
OFDM, which basically is an Extended Lapped Transform-based multicarrier
modulation (ELT-MCM), is a viable and attractive alternative for data
transmission in hostile scenarios, such as in-home PLC. To this end, we obtain
theoretical expressions for ELT-MCM of: 1) the useful signal power, 2) the
inter-symbol interference (ISI) power, 3) the inter-carrier interference (ICI)
power, and 4) the noise power at the receiver side. The system capacity and the
achievable throughput are derived from these. This study includes several
computer simulations that show that ELT-MCM is an efficient alternative to
improve data rates in PLC networks.

 <dc:description>  Deciding whether a given graph has a square root is a classical problem that
has been studied extensively both from graph theoretic and from algorithmic
perspectives. The problem is NP-complete in general, and consequently
substantial effort has been dedicated to deciding whether a given graph has a
square root that belongs to a particular graph class. There are both
polynomial-time solvable and NP-complete cases, depending on the graph class.
We contribute with new results in this direction. Given an arbitrary input
graph G, we give polynomial-time algorithms to decide whether G has an
outerplanar square root, and whether G has a square root that is of pathwidth
at most 2.

 <dc:title>A Data Driven Approach for Compound Figure Separation Using
  Convolutional Neural Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tsutsui, Satoshi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Crandall, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A key problem in automatic analysis and understanding of scientific papers is
to extract semantic information from non-textual paper components like figures,
diagrams, tables, etc. Much of this work requires a very first preprocessing
step: decomposing compound multi-part figures into individual subfigures.
Previous work in compound figure separation has been based on manually designed
features and separation rules, which often fail for less common figure types
and layouts. Moreover, few implementations for compound figure decomposition
are publicly available.
  This paper proposes a data driven approach to separate compound figures using
modern deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to train the separator in an
end-to-end manner. CNNs eliminate the need for manually designing features and
separation rules, but require a large amount of annotated training data. We
overcome this challenge using transfer learning as well as automatically
synthesizing training exemplars. We evaluate our technique on the ImageCLEF
Medical dataset, achieving 85.9% accuracy and outperforming previous
techniques. We have released our implementation as an easy-to-use Python
library, aiming to promote further research in scientific figure mining.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies problems on locally stopping distributed consensus
algorithms over networks where each node updates its state by interacting with
its neighbors and decides by itself whether certain level of agreement has been
achieved among nodes. Since an individual node is unable to access the states
of those beyond its neighbors, this problem becomes challenging. In this work,
we first define the stopping problem for generic distributed algorithms. Then,
a distributed algorithm is explicitly provided for each node to stop consensus
updating by exploring the relationship between the so-called local and global
consensus. Finally, we show both in theory and simulation that its
effectiveness depends both on the network size and the structure.

description of the implementation without changing its semantics--that is, the
set of behaviors that it describes. This paper explains rules for adding
history, prophecy, and stuttering variables to TLA+ specifications, ensuring
that the augmented specification is equivalent to the original one. The rules
are explained with toy examples, and they are used to verify the correctness of
a simplified version of a snapshot algorithm due to Afek et al.

 <dc:description>  Code-mixing or code-switching are the effortless phenomena of natural
switching between two or more languages in a single conversation. Use of a
foreign word in a language; however, does not necessarily mean that the speaker
is code-switching because often languages borrow lexical items from other
languages. If a word is borrowed, it becomes a part of the lexicon of a
language; whereas, during code-switching, the speaker is aware that the
conversation involves foreign words or phrases. Identifying whether a foreign
word used by a bilingual speaker is due to borrowing or code-switching is a
fundamental importance to theories of multilingualism, and an essential
prerequisite towards the development of language and speech technologies for
multilingual communities. In this paper, we present a series of novel
computational methods to identify the borrowed likeliness of a word, based on
the social media signals. We first propose context based clustering method to
sample a set of candidate words from the social media data.Next, we propose
three novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users
in different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate
words indicating their borrowed likeliness. We compare these rankings with a
ground truth ranking constructed through a human judgment experiment. The
Spearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the
three metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most
competitive existing baseline reported in the literature. Some other striking
observations are, (i) the correlation is higher for the ground truth data
elicited from the younger participants (age less than 30) than that from the
older participants, and (ii )those participants who use mixed-language for
tweeting the least, provide the best signals of borrowing.

 <dc:description>  Data deduplication is able to effectively identify and eliminate redundant
data and only maintain a single copy of files and chunks. Hence, it is widely
used in cloud storage systems to save storage space and network bandwidth.
However, the occurrence of deduplication can be easily identified by monitoring
and analyzing network traffic, which leads to the risk of user privacy leakage.
The attacker can carry out a very dangerous side channel attack, i.e.,
learn-the-remaining-information (LRI) attack, to reveal users' privacy
information by exploiting the side channel of network traffic in deduplication.
Existing work addresses the LRI attack at the cost of the high bandwidth
efficiency of deduplication. In order to address this problem, we propose a
simple yet effective scheme, called randomized redundant chunk scheme (RRCS),
to significantly mitigate the risk of the LRI attack while maintaining the high
bandwidth efficiency of deduplication. The basic idea behind RRCS is to add
randomized redundant chunks to mix up the real deduplication states of files
used for the LRI attack, which effectively obfuscates the view of the attacker,
who attempts to exploit the side channel of network traffic for the LRI attack.
Our security analysis shows that RRCS could significantly mitigate the risk of
the LRI attack. We implement the RRCS prototype and evaluate it by using three
large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
efficiency and efficacy of RRCS.

 <dc:description>  Many phenomena taking place in the solar photosphere are controlled by plasma
motions. Although the line-of-sight component of the velocity can be estimated
using the Doppler effect, we do not have direct spectroscopic access to the
components that are perpendicular to the line-of-sight. These components are
typically estimated using methods based on local correlation tracking. We have
designed DeepVel, an end-to-end deep neural network that produces an estimation
of the velocity at every single pixel and at every time step and at three
different heights in the atmosphere from just two consecutive continuum images.
We confront DeepVel with local correlation tracking, pointing out that they
give very similar results in the time- and spatially-averaged cases. We use the
network to study the evolution in height of the horizontal velocity field in
fragmenting granules, supporting the buoyancy-braking mechanism for the
formation of integranular lanes in these granules. We also show that DeepVel
can capture very small vortices, so that we can potentially expand the scaling
cascade of vortices to very small sizes and durations.

 <dc:title>An Analysis of a Simple Local Search Algorithm for Graph Colouring</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chalupa, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Vertex Descent is a local search algorithm which forms the basis of a wide
spectrum of tabu search, simulated annealing and hybrid evolutionary algorithms
for graph colouring. These algorithms are usually treated as experimental and
provide strong results on established benchmarks. As a step towards studying
these heuristics analytically, an analysis of the behaviour of Vertex Descent
is provided. It is shown that Vertex Descent is able to find feasible
colourings for several types of instances in expected polynomial time. This
includes 2-colouring of paths and 3-colouring of graphs with maximum degree 3.
The same also holds for 3-colouring of a subset of 3-colourable graphs with
maximum degree 4. As a consequence, Vertex Descent finds a 3-colouring in
expected polynomial time for the smallest graph for which Br\'elaz's heuristic
DSATUR needs 4 colours. On the other hand, Vertex Descent may fail for forests
with maximum degree 3 with high probability.

 <dc:description>  Although block compressive sensing (BCS) makes it tractable to sense
large-sized images and video, its recovery performance has yet to be
significantly improved because its recovered images or video usually suffer
from blurred edges, loss of details, and high-frequency oscillatory artifacts,
especially at a low subrate. This paper addresses these problems by designing a
modified total variation technique that employs multi-block gradient
processing, a denoised Lagrangian multiplier, and patch-based sparse
representation. In the case of video, the proposed recovery method is able to
exploit both spatial and temporal similarities. Simulation results confirm the
improved performance of the proposed method for compressive sensing of images
and video in terms of both objective and subjective qualities.

 <dc:description>  Negotiations are a formalism for describing multiparty distributed
cooperation. Alternatively, they can be seen as a model of concurrency with
synchronized choice as communication primitive. Well-designed negotiations must
be sound, meaning that, whatever its current state, the negotiation can still
be completed. In earlier work, Esparza and Desel have shown that deciding
soundness of a negotiation is Pspace-complete, and in Ptime if the negotiation
is deterministic. They have also extended their polynomial soundness algorithm
to an intermediate class of acyclic, non-deterministic negotiations. However,
they did not analyze the runtime of the extended algorithm, and also left open
the complexity of the soundness problem for the intermediate class. In the
first part of this paper we revisit the soundness problem for deterministic
negotiations, and show that it is Nlogspace-complete, improving on the earlier
algorithm, which requires linear space. In the second part we answer the
question left open by Esparza and Desel. We prove that the soundness problem
can be solved in polynomial time for acyclic, weakly non- deterministic
negotiations, a more general class than the one considered by them. In the
third and final part, we show that the techniques developed in the first two
parts of the paper can be applied to analysis problems other than soundness,
including the problem of detecting race conditions, and several classical
static analysis problems. More specifically, we show that, while these problems
are intractable for arbitrary acyclic deterministic negotiations, they become
tractable in the sound case. So soundness is not only a desirable behavioral
property in itself, but also helps to analyze other properties.

 <dc:description>  This manuscript briefly describes an algorithm developed for the ISIC 2017
Skin Lesion Classification Competition. In this task, participants are asked to
complete two independent binary image classification tasks that involve three
unique diagnoses of skin lesions (melanoma, nevus, and seborrheic keratosis).
In the first binary classification task, participants are asked to distinguish
between (a) melanoma and (b) nevus and seborrheic keratosis. In the second
binary classification task, participants are asked to distinguish between (a)
seborrheic keratosis and (b) nevus and melanoma. The other phases of the
competition are not considered. Our proposed algorithm consists of three steps:
preprocessing, classification using VGG-NET and Random Forests, and calculation
of a final score.

 <dc:description>  For a (possibly infinite) fixed family of graphs F, we say that a graph G
overlays F on a hypergraph H if V(H) is equal to V(G) and the subgraph of G
induced by every hyperedge of H contains some member of F as a spanning
subgraph.While it is easy to see that the complete graph on |V(H)| overlays F
on a hypergraph H whenever the problem admits a solution, the Minimum F-Overlay
problem asks for such a graph with the minimum number of edges.This problem
allows to generalize some natural problems which may arise in practice. For
instance, if the family F contains all connected graphs, then Minimum F-Overlay
corresponds to the Minimum Connectivity Inference problem (also known as Subset
Interconnection Design problem) introduced for the low-resolution
reconstruction of macro-molecular assembly in structural biology, or for the
design of networks.Our main contribution is a strong dichotomy result regarding
the polynomial vs. NP-hard status with respect to the considered family F.
Roughly speaking, we show that the easy cases one can think of (e.g. when
edgeless graphs of the right sizes are in F, or if F contains only cliques) are
the only families giving rise to a polynomial problem: all others are
NP-complete.We then investigate the parameterized complexity of the problem and
give similar sufficient conditions on F that give rise to W[1]-hard, W[2]-hard
or FPT problems when the parameter is the size of the solution.This yields an
FPT/W[1]-hard dichotomy for a relaxed problem, where every hyperedge of H must
contain some member of F as a (non necessarily spanning) subgraph.

 <dc:title>A simulation technique for slurries interacting with moving parts and

 <dc:description>  A numerical method for particle-laden fluids interacting with a deformable
solid domain and mobile rigid parts is proposed and implemented in a full
engineering system. The fluid domain is modeled with a lattice Boltzmann
representation, the particles and rigid parts are modeled with a discrete
element representation, and the deformable solid domain is modeled using a
Lagrangian mesh. The main issue of this work, since separately each of these
methods is a mature tool, is to develop coupling and model-reduction approaches
in order to efficiently simulate coupled problems of this nature, as occur in
various geological and engineering applications. The lattice Boltzmann method
incorporates a large-eddy simulation technique using the Smagorinsky turbulence
model. The discrete element method incorporates spherical and polyhedral
particles for stiff contact interactions. A neo-Hookean hyperelastic model is
used for the deformable solid. We provide a detailed description of how to
couple the three solvers within a unified algorithm. The technique we propose
for rubber modeling/coupling exploits a simplification that prevents having to
solve a finite-element problem each time step. We also develop a technique to
reduce the domain size of the full system by replacing certain zones with
quasi-analytic solutions, which act as effective boundary conditions for the
lattice Boltzmann method. The major ingredients of the routine are are
separately validated. To demonstrate the coupled method in full, we simulate
slurry flows in two kinds of piston-valve geometries. The dynamics of the valve
and slurry are studied and reported over a large range of input parameters.

 <dc:title>A New Unbiased and Efficient Class of LSH-Based Samplers and Estimators

 <dc:description>  Log-linear models are arguably the most successful class of graphical models
for large-scale applications because of their simplicity and tractability.
Learning and inference with these models require calculating the partition
function, which is a major bottleneck and intractable for large state spaces.
Importance Sampling (IS) and MCMC-based approaches are lucrative. However, the
condition of having a &quot;good&quot; proposal distribution is often not satisfied in
practice.
  In this paper, we add a new dimension to efficient estimation via sampling.
We propose a new sampling scheme and an unbiased estimator that estimates the
partition function accurately in sub-linear time. Our samples are generated in
near-constant time using locality sensitive hashing (LSH), and so are
correlated and unnormalized. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach by comparing the accuracy and speed of estimating the partition
function against other state-of-the-art estimation techniques including IS and
the efficient variant of Gumbel-Max sampling. With our efficient sampling
scheme, we accurately train real-world language models using only 1-2% of
computations.

 <dc:description>  Event cameras are a paradigm shift in camera technology. Instead of full
frames, the sensor captures a sparse set of events caused by intensity changes.
Since only the changes are transferred, those cameras are able to capture quick
movements of objects in the scene or of the camera itself. In this work we
propose a novel method to perform camera tracking of event cameras in a
panoramic setting with three degrees of freedom. We propose a direct camera
tracking formulation, similar to state-of-the-art in visual odometry. We show
that the minimal information needed for simultaneous tracking and mapping is
the spatial position of events, without using the appearance of the imaged
scene point. We verify the robustness to fast camera movements and dynamic
objects in the scene on a recently proposed dataset and self-recorded
sequences.

 <dc:description>  The idea to find the &quot;maximal number that can be named&quot; can be traced back to
Archimedes (see his Psammit). From the viewpoint of computation theory the
natural question is &quot;which number can be described by at most n bits&quot;? This
question led to the definition of the so-called &quot;busy beaver&quot; numbers
(introduced by T. Rado). In this note we consider different versions of the
busy beaver-like notions defined in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. We show
that these versions differ depending on the version of complexity used (plain,
prefix, or a priori complexities) and find out how these notions are related,
providing matching lower and upper bounds.

 <dc:description>  The intelligent transportation systems (ITS) framework from European
Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) imposes requirements on the
exchange of periodic safety messages between components of ITS such as
vehicles. In particular, it requires ETSI standardized Decentralized Congestion
Control (DCC) algorithm to regulate the beaconing activity of vehicles based on
wireless channel utilization. However, the DCC state that defines the beaconing
behavior under heavy channel congestion, i.e., the Restrictive state, has a
serious connectivity problem that safety beacons do not reach other vehicles in
safety-critical distances. In this paper, we demonstrate the problem through
analysis, simulation, and on-road measurements. We suggest that DCC change the
transmit power setting for the Restrictive state before a full-scale deployment
of the ETSI ITS framework starts, and we discuss its consequences in terms of
changes in communicability and channel utilization.

 <dc:description>  We propose prototypical networks for the problem of few-shot classification,
where a classifier must generalize to new classes not seen in the training set,
given only a small number of examples of each new class. Prototypical networks
learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing
distances to prototype representations of each class. Compared to recent
approaches for few-shot learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is
beneficial in this limited-data regime, and achieve excellent results. We
provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield
substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated
architectural choices and meta-learning. We further extend prototypical
networks to zero-shot learning and achieve state-of-the-art results on the
CU-Birds dataset.

 <dc:description>  Interoperability is the ability of a programming language to work with
systems based on different languages and paradigms. These days, many widely
used high-level language impementations provide access to external
functionalities. In this paper, we present some ideas on CLR interoperability
focusing on the kind of constructs desirable by a programmer to this regard.

 <dc:description>  Jolie is a service-oriented programming language which comes with the formal
specification of its type system. However, there is no tool to ensure that
programs in Jolie are well-typed. In this paper we provide the results of
building a type checker for Jolie as a part of its syntax and semantics formal
model. We express the type checker as a program with dependent types in Agda
proof assistant which helps to ascertain that the type checker is correct.

 <dc:description>  While humans easily recognize relations between data from different domains
without any supervision, learning to automatically discover them is in general
very challenging and needs many ground-truth pairs that illustrate the
relations. To avoid costly pairing, we address the task of discovering
cross-domain relations given unpaired data. We propose a method based on
generative adversarial networks that learns to discover relations between
different domains (DiscoGAN). Using the discovered relations, our proposed
network successfully transfers style from one domain to another while
preserving key attributes such as orientation and face identity. Source code
for official implementation is publicly available

 <dc:description>  This paper considers secure energy-efficient routing in the presence of
multiple passive eavesdroppers. Previous work in this area has considered
secure routing assuming probabilistic or exact knowledge of the location and
channel-state-information (CSI) of each eavesdropper. In wireless networks,
however, the locations and CSIs of passive eavesdroppers are not known, making
it challenging to guarantee secrecy for any routing algorithm.
  We develop an efficient (in terms of energy consumption and computational
complexity) routing algorithm that does not rely on any information about the
locations and CSIs of the eavesdroppers. Our algorithm guarantees secrecy even
in disadvantaged wireless environments, where multiple eavesdroppers try to
eavesdrop each message, are equipped with directional antennas, or can get
arbitrarily close to the transmitter. The key is to employ additive random
jamming to exploit inherent non-idealities of the eavesdropper's receiver,
which makes the eavesdroppers incapable of recording the messages. We have
simulated our proposed algorithm and compared it with existing secrecy routing
algorithms in both single-hop and multi-hop networks. Our results indicate that
when the uncertainty in the locations of eavesdroppers is high and/or in
disadvantaged wireless environments, our algorithm outperforms existing
algorithms in terms of energy consumption and secrecy.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of testing unateness of functions $f:\{0,1\}^d \to
\mathbb{R}.$ We give a $O(\frac{d}{\epsilon} \cdot
\log\frac{d}{\epsilon})$-query nonadaptive tester and a
$O(\frac{d}{\epsilon})$-query adaptive tester and show that both testers are
optimal for a fixed distance parameter $\epsilon$. Previously known unateness
testers worked only for Boolean functions, and their query complexity had worse
dependence on the dimension both for the adaptive and the nonadaptive case.
Moreover, no lower bounds for testing unateness were known. We also generalize
our results to obtain optimal unateness testers for functions $f:[n]^d \to
\mathbb{R}$.
  Our results establish that adaptivity helps with testing unateness of
real-valued functions on domains of the form $\{0,1\}^d$ and, more generally,
$[n]^d$. This stands in contrast to the situation for monotonicity testing
where there is no adaptivity gap for functions $f:[n]^d \to \mathbb{R}$.

 <dc:title>Fuzzy Rankings: Properties and Applications</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In practice, a ranking of objects with respect to given set of criteria is of
considerable importance. However, due to lack of knowledge, information of time
pressure, decision makers might not be able to provide a (crisp) ranking of
objects from the top to the bottom. Instead, some objects might be ranked
equally, or better than other objects only to some degree. In such cases, a
generalization of crisp rankings to fuzzy rankings can be more useful. The aim
of the article is to introduce the notion of a fuzzy ranking and to discuss its
several properties, namely orderings, similarity and indecisiveness. The
proposed approach can be used both for group decision making or multiple
criteria decision making when uncertainty is involved.

 <dc:title>On Inconsistency Indices and Inconsistency Axioms in Pairwise
  Comparisons</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mazurek, Jiri</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Pairwise comparisons are an important tool of modern (multiple criteria)
decision making. Since human judgments are often inconsistent, many studies
focused on the ways how to express and measure this inconsistency, and several
inconsistency indices were proposed as an alternative to Saaty inconsistency
index and inconsistency ratio for reciprocal pairwise comparisons matrices.
This paper aims to: firstly, introduce a new measure of inconsistency of
pairwise comparisons and to prove its basic properties; secondly, to postulate
an additional axiom, an upper boundary axiom, to an existing set of axioms; and
the last, but not least, the paper provides proofs of satisfaction of this
additional axiom by selected inconsistency indices as well as it provides their
numerical comparison.

 <dc:description>  As renewable wind energy penetration rates continue to increase, one of the
major challenges facing grid operators is the question of how to control
transmission grids in a reliable and a cost-efficient manner. The stochastic
nature of wind forces an alteration of traditional methods for solving
day-ahead and look-ahead unit commitment and dispatch. In particular, the
variability of wind generation increases the risk of unexpected overloads and
cascading events. To address these questions, we present an N-1 Security and
Chance-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCCUC) that includes models of generation
reserves that respond to wind fluctuations and models of tertiary reserves that
respond to single component outages. We formulate the SCCUC as a mixed-integer,
second-order cone problem that limits the probability of failure. We develop a
modified Benders decomposition algorithm to solve the problem to optimality and
present detailed case studies on the IEEE RTS-96 three-area and the IEEE 300
NESTA test systems. The case studies assess the economic impacts of
contingencies and various degrees of wind power penetration and demonstrate the
effectiveness and scalability of the algorithm.

 <dc:title>Transient Response Improvement for Interconnected Linear Systems:
  Low-Dimensional Controller Retrofit Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Dynamical Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a method of designing low-dimensional retrofit
controllers for interconnected linear systems. In the proposed method, by
retrofitting an additional low-dimensional controller to a preexisting control
system, we aim at improving transient responses caused by spatially local state
deflections, which can be regarded as a local fault occurring at a specific
subsystem. It is found that a type of state-space expansion, called
hierarchical state-space expansion, is the key to systematically designing a
low-dimensional retrofit controller, whose action is specialized to controlling
the corresponding subsystem. Furthermore, the state-space expansion enables
theoretical clarification of the fact that the performance index of the
transient response control is improved by appropriately tuning the retrofit
controller. The efficiency of the proposed method is shown through a motivating
example of power system control where we clarify the trade-off relation between
the dimension of a retrofit controller and its control performance.

 <dc:description>  We contribute a general apparatus for dependent tactic-based proof refinement
in the LCF tradition, in which the statements of subgoals may express a
dependency on the proofs of other subgoals; this form of dependency is
extremely useful and can serve as an algorithmic alternative to extensions of
LCF based on non-local instantiation of schematic variables. Additionally, we
introduce a novel behavioral distinction between refinement rules and tactics
based on naturality. Our framework, called Dependent LCF, is already deployed
