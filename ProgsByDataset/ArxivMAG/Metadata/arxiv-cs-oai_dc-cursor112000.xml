 <dc:description>  ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$ is a version of Church's type theory that includes
quotation and evaluation operators that are similar to quote and eval in the
Lisp programming language. With quotation and evaluation it is possible to
reason in ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$ about the interplay of the syntax and semantics
of expressions and, as a result, to formalize syntax-based mathematical
algorithms. We present the syntax and semantics of ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$ as well
as a proof system for ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$. The proof system is shown to be
sound for all formulas and complete for formulas that do not contain
evaluations. We give several examples that illustrate the usefulness of having
quotation and evaluation in ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$.

 <dc:description>  We present space efficient Monte Carlo algorithms that solve Subset Sum and
Knapsack instances with $n$ items using $O^*(2^{0.86n})$ time and polynomial
space, where the $O^*(\cdot)$ notation suppresses factors polynomial in the
input size. Both algorithms assume random read-only access to random bits.
Modulo this mild assumption, this resolves a long-standing open problem in
exact algorithms for NP-hard problems. These results can be extended to solve
Binary Linear Programming on $n$ variables with few constraints in a similar
running time. We also show that for any constant $k\geq 2$, random instances of
$k$-Sum can be solved using $O(n^{k-0.5}polylog(n))$ time and $O(\log n)$
space, without the assumption of random access to random bits.
  Underlying these results is an algorithm that determines whether two given
lists of length $n$ with integers bounded by a polynomial in $n$ share a common
value. Assuming random read-only access to random bits, we show that this
problem can be solved using $O(\log n)$ space significantly faster than the
trivial $O(n^2)$ time algorithm if no value occurs too often in the same list.

 <dc:title>In the transmission of information, the great potential of model-based
  coding with the SP theory of intelligence</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wolff, J Gerard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Model-based coding, described by John Pierce in 1961, has great potential to
reduce the volume of information that needs to be transmitted in moving big
data, without loss of information, from one place to another, or in lossless
communications via the internet. Compared with ordinary compression methods,
this potential advantage of model-based coding in the transmission of data
arises from the fact that both the transmitter (&quot;Alice&quot;) and the receiver
(&quot;Bob&quot;) are equipped with a grammar for the kind of data that is to be
transmitted, which means that, to achieve lossless transmission of a body of
data from Alice and Bob, a relatively small amount of information needs to be
sent. Preliminary trials indicate that, with model-based coding, the volume of
information to be sent from Alice to Bob to achieve lossless transmission of a
given body of data may be less than $6\%$ of the volume of information that
needs to be sent when ordinary compression methods are used.
  Until recently, it has not been feasible to convert John Pierce's vision into
something that may be applied in practice. Now, with the development of the &quot;SP
theory of intelligence&quot; and its realisation in the &quot;SP computer model&quot;, there
is clear potential to realise the three main functions that will be needed:
unsupervised learning of a grammar for the kind of data that is to be
transmitted using a relatively powerful computer that is independent of Alice
and Bob; the encoding by Alice of any one example of such data in terms of the
grammar; and, with the grammar, decoding of the encoding by Bob to retrieve the
given example. It appears now to be feasible, within reasonable timescales, to
bring these capabilities to a level where they may be applied to the
transmission of realistically large bodies of data.

 <dc:title>Safety Verification and Control for Collision Avoidance at Road
  Intersections</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the design of a supervisory algorithm that monitors
safety at road intersections and overrides drivers with a safe input when
necessary. The design of the supervisor consists of two parts: safety
verification and control design. Safety verification is the problem to
determine if vehicles will be able to cross the intersection without colliding
with current drivers' inputs. We translate this safety verification problem
into a jobshop scheduling problem, which minimizes the maximum lateness and
evaluates if the optimal cost is zero. The zero optimal cost corresponds to the
case in which all vehicles can cross each conflict area without collisions.
Computing the optimal cost requires solving a Mixed Integer Nonlinear
Programming (MINLP) problem due to the nonlinear second-order dynamics of the
vehicles. We therefore estimate this optimal cost by formulating two related
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems that assume simpler vehicle
dynamics. We prove that these two MILP problems yield lower and upper bounds of
the optimal cost. We also quantify the worst case approximation errors of these
MILP problems. We design the supervisor to override the vehicles with a safe
control input if the MILP problem that computes the upper bound yields a
positive optimal cost. We theoretically demonstrate that the supervisor keeps
the intersection safe and is non-blocking. Computer simulations further
validate that the algorithms can run in real time for problems of realistic
size.

 <dc:description>  Regression under the &quot;small $n$, large $p$&quot; conditions, of small sample size
$n$ and large number of features $p$ in the learning data set, is a recurring
setting in which learning from data is difficult. With prior knowledge about
relationships of the features, $p$ can effectively be reduced, but explicating
such prior knowledge is difficult for experts. In this paper we introduce a new
method for eliciting expert prior knowledge about the similarity of the roles
of features in the prediction task. The key idea is to use an interactive
multidimensional-scaling (MDS) type scatterplot display of the features to
elicit the similarity relationships, and then use the elicited relationships in
the prior distribution of prediction parameters. Specifically, for learning to
predict a target variable with Bayesian linear regression, the feature
relationships are used to construct a Gaussian prior with a full covariance
matrix for the regression coefficients. Evaluation of our method in experiments
with simulated and real users on text data confirm that prior elicitation of
feature similarities improves prediction accuracy. Furthermore, elicitation
with an interactive scatterplot display outperforms straightforward elicitation
where the users choose feature pairs from a feature list.

proximal gradient descent, coordinate gradient descent, proximal coordinate
gradient, and Newton's methods as well as their Nesterov's accelerated variants
in a unified framework motivated by a natural connection of optimization

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a deep architecture for segmenting 3D objects into
their labeled semantic parts. Our architecture combines image-based Fully
Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and surface-based Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) to yield coherent segmentations of 3D shapes. The image-based FCNs are
used for efficient view-based reasoning about 3D object parts. Through a
special projection layer, FCN outputs are effectively aggregated across
multiple views and scales, then are projected onto the 3D object surfaces.
Finally, a surface-based CRF combines the projected outputs with geometric
consistency cues to yield coherent segmentations. The whole architecture
(multi-view FCNs and CRF) is trained end-to-end. Our approach significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in the currently largest
segmentation benchmark (ShapeNet). Finally, we demonstrate promising
segmentation results on noisy 3D shapes acquired from consumer-grade depth
cameras.

 <dc:description>Comment: This is an updated version of our CVPR 2017 paper. We incorporated
  new experiments that demonstrate ShapePFCN performance under the case of
  consistent *upright* orientation and an additional input channel in our
  rendered images for encoding height from the ground plane (upright axis
  coordinate values). Performance is improved in this setting</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of author identification under
double-blind review setting, which is to identify potential authors given
information of an anonymized paper. Different from existing approaches that
rely heavily on feature engineering, we propose to use network embedding
approach to address the problem, which can automatically represent nodes into
lower dimensional feature vectors. However, there are two major limitations in
recent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose
embedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of
these approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the
heterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two
folds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author
identification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to
the heterogeneity of the network.
  To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and path-augmented
heterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded
as vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly
trained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend
the existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in
heterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The
guidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both
explicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection. Our
experiments demonstrate that by using path-augmented network embedding with
task guidance, our model can obtain significantly better accuracy at
identifying the true authors comparing to existing methods.

 <dc:description>  A multi-way factor analysis model is introduced for tensor-variate data of
any order. Each data item is represented as a (sparse) sum of Kruskal
decompositions, a Kruskal-factor analysis (KFA). KFA is nonparametric and can
infer both the tensor-rank of each dictionary atom and the number of dictionary
atoms. The model is adapted for online learning, which allows dictionary
learning on large data sets. After KFA is introduced, the model is extended to
a deep convolutional tensor-factor analysis, supervised by a Bayesian SVM. The
experiments section demonstrates the improvement of KFA over vectorized
approaches (e.g., BPFA), tensor decompositions, and convolutional neural
networks (CNN) in multi-way denoising, blind inpainting, and image
classification. The improvement in PSNR for the inpainting results over other
methods exceeds 1dB in several cases and we achieve state of the art results on
Caltech101 image classification.

material recognition. Our new approach provides an end-to-end learning
framework, where the inherent visual vocabularies are learned directly from the
loss function. The features, dictionaries and the encoding representation for
the classifier are all learned simultaneously. The representation is orderless
and therefore is particularly useful for material and texture recognition. The
Encoding Layer generalizes robust residual encoders such as VLAD and Fisher
Vectors, and has the property of discarding domain specific information which
makes the learned convolutional features easier to transfer. Additionally,
joint training using multiple datasets of varied sizes and class labels is
supported resulting in increased recognition performance. The experimental
results show superior performance as compared to state-of-the-art methods using
gold-standard databases such as MINC-2500, Flickr Material Database,
KTH-TIPS-2b, and two recent databases 4D-Light-Field-Material and GTOS. The
source code for the complete system are publicly available.

 <dc:title>Exploiting 2D Floorplan for Building-scale Panorama RGBD Alignment</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel algorithm that utilizes a 2D floorplan to align
panorama RGBD scans. While effective panorama RGBD alignment techniques exist,
such a system requires extremely dense RGBD image sampling. Our approach can
significantly reduce the number of necessary scans with the aid of a floorplan
image. We formulate a novel Markov Random Field inference problem as a scan
placement over the floorplan, as opposed to the conventional scan-to-scan
alignment. The technical contributions lie in multi-modal image correspondence
cues (between scans and schematic floorplan) as well as a novel coverage
potential avoiding an inherent stacking bias. The proposed approach has been
evaluated on five challenging large indoor spaces. To the best of our
knowledge, we present the first effective system that utilizes a 2D floorplan
image for building-scale 3D pointcloud alignment. The source code and the data
will be shared with the community to further enhance indoor mapping research.

 <dc:title>Multiscale Projective Coordinates via Persistent Cohomology of Sparse

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Algebraic Topology</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present in this paper a framework which leverages the underlying topology
of a data set, in order to produce appropriate coordinate representations. In
particular, we show how to construct maps to real and complex projective
spaces, given appropriate persistent cohomology classes. An initial map is
obtained in two steps: First, the persistent cohomology of a sparse filtration
is used to compute systems of transition functions for (real and complex) line
bundles over neighborhoods of the data. Next, the transition functions are used
to produce explicit classifying maps for the induced bundles. A framework for
dimensionality reduction in projective space (Principal Projective Components)
is also developed, aimed at decreasing the target dimension of the original
map. Several examples are provided as well as theorems addressing choices in
the construction.

 <dc:description>  Effective SDN control relies on the network data collecting capability as
well as the quality and timeliness of the data. As open programmable data plane
is becoming a reality, we further enhance it with the support of runtime
interactive programming in order to cope with application dynamics, optimize
data plane resource allocation, and reduce control-plane processing pressure.
Based on the latest technologies, we propose the Dynamic Network Probes (DNP)
as a means to support real-time and on-demand network visibility. DNPs serve as
an important building block of an integrated networking data analytics platform
which involves the network data plane as an active component for in-network
computing. In this paper, we show the types of DNPs and their role in the big
picture. We have implemented an NP-based hardware prototype to demonstrate the
feasibility and efficiency of DNPs. We lay out the research challenges and our
future work to realize the omni network visibility based on DNPs.

 <dc:description>  Representations are fundamental to artificial intelligence. The performance
of a learning system depends on the type of representation used for
representing the data. Typically, these representations are hand-engineered
using domain knowledge. More recently, the trend is to learn these
representations through stochastic gradient descent in multi-layer neural
networks, which is called backprop. Learning the representations directly from
the incoming data stream reduces the human labour involved in designing a
learning system. More importantly, this allows in scaling of a learning system
for difficult tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new incremental learning
algorithm called crossprop, which learns incoming weights of hidden units based
on the meta-gradient descent approach, that was previously introduced by Sutton
(1992) and Schraudolph (1999) for learning step-sizes. The final update
equation introduces an additional memory parameter for each of these weights
and generalizes the backprop update equation. From our experiments, we show
that crossprop learns and reuses its feature representation while tackling new
and unseen tasks whereas backprop relearns a new feature representation.

 <dc:title>Fast Fourier single-pixel imaging using binary illumination</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Fourier single-pixel imaging (FSI) has proven capable of reconstructing
high-quality two-dimensional and three-dimensional images. The utilization of
the sparsity of natural images in Fourier domain allows high-resolution images
to be reconstructed from far fewer measurements than effective image pixels.
However, applying original FSI in digital micro-mirror device (DMD) based
high-speed imaging system turns out to be challenging, because the original FSI
uses grayscale Fourier basis patterns for illumination while DMDs generate
grayscale patterns at a relatively low rate. DMDs are a binary device which can
only generate a black-and-white pattern at each instance. In this paper, we
adopt binary Fourier patterns for illumination to achieve DMD-based high-speed
single-pixel imaging. Binary Fourier patterns are generated by upsampling and
then applying error diffusion based dithering to the grayscale patterns.
Experiments demonstrate the proposed technique able to achieve static imaging
with high quality and dynamic imaging in real time. The proposed technique
potentially allows high-quality and high-speed imaging over broad wavebands.

 <dc:description>  Quantum computing has undergone rapid development in recent years. Owing to
limitations on scalability, personal quantum computers still seem slightly
unrealistic in the near future. The first practical quantum computer for
ordinary users is likely to be on the cloud. However, the adoption of cloud
computing is possible only if security is ensured. Homomorphic encryption is a
cryptographic protocol that allows computation to be performed on encrypted
data without decrypting them, so it is well suited to cloud computing. Here, we
first applied homomorphic encryption on IBM's cloud quantum computer platform.
In our experiments, we successfully implemented a quantum algorithm for linear
equations while protecting our privacy. This demonstration opens a feasible
path to the next stage of development of cloud quantum information technology.

 <dc:description>  Accurately identifying hands in images is a key sub-task for human activity
understanding with wearable first-person point-of-view cameras. Traditional
hand segmentation approaches rely on a large corpus of manually labeled data to
generate robust hand detectors. However, these approaches still face challenges
as the appearance of the hand varies greatly across users, tasks, environments
or illumination conditions. A key observation in the case of many wearable
applications and interfaces is that, it is only necessary to accurately detect
the user's hands in a specific situational context. Based on this observation,
we introduce an interactive approach to learn a person-specific hand
segmentation model that does not require any manually labeled training data.
Our approach proceeds in two steps, an interactive bootstrapping step for
identifying moving hand regions, followed by learning a personalized user
specific hand appearance model. Concretely, our approach uses two convolutional
neural networks: (1) a gesture network that uses pre-defined motion information
to detect the hand region; and (2) an appearance network that learns a person
specific model of the hand region based on the output of the gesture network.
During training, to make the appearance network robust to errors in the gesture
network, the loss function of the former network incorporates the confidence of
the gesture network while learning. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of
our approach with an F1 score over 0.8 on all challenging datasets across a
wide range of illumination and hand appearance variations, improving over a
baseline approach by over 10%.

 <dc:description>  Spectrum resources are facing huge demands and cognitive radio (CR) can
improve the spectrum utilization. Recently, power spectral density (PSD) map is
defined to enable the CR to reuse the frequency resources regarding to the
area. For this reason, the sensed PSDs are fused by a Fusion Center (FC) which
the sensed PSDs are collected by the distributed sensors in the area. But, for
a given zone, the sensed PSD by neighbor CR sensors may contain a shared common
component for a while. This component can be exploited in the theory of the
distributed source coding (DSC) to compress sensing data more. In this paper
based on the distributed compressive sensing (DCS) a method is proposed to
compress and reconstruct the PSDs of the sensors when the data transmission is
slightly imperfect. Simulation results show the advantages of using proposed
method in compressing, reducing overhead and also recovering PSDs. % Proposed
method can be used to develop a framework when the holding times of the users
are large in comparison with the rate of the spectrum sensing.

 <dc:description>  Population growth and increasing droughts are creating unprecedented strain
on the continued availability of water resources. Since irrigation is a major
consumer of fresh water, wastage of resources in this sector could have strong
consequences. To address this issue, irrigation water management and prediction
techniques need to be employed effectively and should be able to account for
the variabilities present in the environment. The different techniques surveyed
in this paper can be classified into two categories: computational and
statistical. Computational methods deal with scientific correlations between
physical parameters whereas statistical methods involve specific prediction
algorithms that can be used to automate the process of irrigation water
prediction. These algorithms interpret semantic relationships between the
various parameters of temperature, pressure, evapotranspiration etc. and store
them as numerical precomputed entities specific to the conditions and the area
used as the data for the training corpus used to train it. We focus on
reviewing the computational methods used to determine Evapotranspiration and
its implications. We compare the efficiencies of different data mining and
machine learning methods implemented in this area, such as Logistic Regression,
Decision Tress Classifier, SysFor, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Fuzzy Logic
techniques, Artifical Neural Networks(ANNs) and various hybrids of Genetic
Algorithms (GA) applied to irrigation prediction. We also recommend a possible
technique for the same based on its superior results in other such time series
analysis tasks.

 <dc:description>  A network of independently trained Gaussian processes (StackedGP) is
introduced to obtain predictions of quantities of interest with quantified
uncertainties. The main applications of the StackedGP framework are to
integrate different datasets through model composition, enhance predictions of
quantities of interest through a cascade of intermediate predictions, and to
propagate uncertainties through emulated dynamical systems driven by uncertain
forcing variables. By using analytical first and second-order moments of a
Gaussian process with uncertain inputs using squared exponential and polynomial
kernels, approximated expectations of quantities of interests that require an
arbitrary composition of functions can be obtained. The StackedGP model is
extended to any number of layers and nodes per layer, and it provides
flexibility in kernel selection for the input nodes. The proposed nonparametric
stacked model is validated using synthetic datasets, and its performance in
model composition and cascading predictions is measured in two applications
using real data.

 <dc:description>  The inability of Moore's Law and other figure-of-merits (FOMs) to accurately
explain the technology development of the semiconductor industry demands a
holistic merit to guide the industry. Here we introduce a FOM termed CLEAR that
accurately postdicts technology developments since the 1940's until today, and
predicts photonics as a logical extension to keep-up the pace of
information-handling machines. We show that CLEAR
(Capability-to-Latency-Energy-Amount-Resistance) is multi-hierarchical applying
to the device, interconnect, and system level. Being a holistic FOM, we show
that empirical trends such as Moore's Law and the Makimoto's wave are special
cases of the universal CLEAR merit. Looking ahead, photonic board- and
chip-level technologies are able to continue the observed doubling rate of the
CLEAR value every 12 months, while electronic technologies are unable to keep
pace.

 <dc:title>Principles for Measurability in Protocol Design</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Measurement has become fundamental to the operation of networks and at-scale
services---whether for management, security, diagnostics, optimization, or
simply enhancing our collective understanding of the Internet as a complex
system. Further, measurements are useful across points of view---from end hosts
to enterprise networks and data centers to the wide area Internet. We observe
that many measurements are decoupled from the protocols and applications they
are designed to illuminate. Worse, current measurement practice often involves
the exploitation of side-effects and unintended features of the network, or, in
other words, the artful piling of hacks atop one another. This state of affairs
is a direct result of the relative paucity of diagnostic and measurement
capabilities built into today's network stack.
  Given our modern dependence on ubiquitous measurement, we propose
measurability as an explicit low-level goal of current protocol design, and
argue that measurements should be available to all network protocols throughout
the stack. We seek to generalize the idea of measurement within protocols,
e.g., the way in which TCP relies on measurement to drive its end-to-end
behavior. Rhetorically, we pose the question: what if the stack had been built
with measurability and diagnostic support in mind? We start from a set of
principles for explicit measurability, and define primitives that, were they
supported by the stack, would not only provide a solid foundation for protocol
design going forward, but also reduce the cost and increase the accuracy of
measuring the network.

 <dc:title>Facial Expression Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks: State

 <dc:creator>Pramerdorfer, Christopher</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The ability to recognize facial expressions automatically enables novel
applications in human-computer interaction and other areas. Consequently, there
has been active research in this field, with several recent works utilizing
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and inference.
These works differ significantly in terms of CNN architectures and other
factors. Based on the reported results alone, the performance impact of these
factors is unclear. In this paper, we review the state of the art in
image-based facial expression recognition using CNNs and highlight algorithmic
differences and their performance impact. On this basis, we identify existing
bottlenecks and consequently directions for advancing this research field.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that overcoming one of these bottlenecks - the
comparatively basic architectures of the CNNs utilized in this field - leads to
a substantial performance increase. By forming an ensemble of modern deep CNNs,
we obtain a FER2013 test accuracy of 75.2%, outperforming previous works
without requiring auxiliary training data or face registration.

 <dc:title>GOTM: a Goal-oriented Framework for Capturing Uncertainty of Medical

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It has been widely recognized that uncertainty is an inevitable aspect of
diagnosis and treatment of medical disorders. Such uncertainties hence, need to
be considered in computerized medical models. The existing medical modeling
techniques however, have mainly focused on capturing uncertainty associated
with diagnosis of medical disorders while ignoring uncertainty of treatments.
To tackle this issue, we have proposed using a fuzzy-based modeling and
description technique for capturing uncertainties in treatment plans. We have
further contributed a formal framework which allows for goal-oriented modeling
and analysis of medical treatments.

 <dc:description>  Delaunay has shown that the Delaunay complex of a finite set of points $P$ of
Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^m$ triangulates the convex hull of $P$, provided
that $P$ satisfies a mild genericity property. Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay
complexes can be defined for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. However,
Delaunay's genericity assumption no longer guarantees that the Delaunay complex
will yield a triangulation; stronger assumptions on $P$ are required. A natural
one is to assume that $P$ is sufficiently dense. Although results in this
direction have been claimed, we show that sample density alone is insufficient
to ensure that the Delaunay complex triangulates a manifold of dimension
greater than 2.

 <dc:description>  We discuss the problem of extending data mining approaches to cases in which
data points arise in the form of individual graphs. Being able to find the
intrinsic low-dimensionality in ensembles of graphs can be useful in a variety
of modeling contexts, especially when coarse-graining the detailed graph
information is of interest. One of the main challenges in mining graph data is
the definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs.
We explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on
finding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is
illustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are
obtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the
third example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network
simulation. We further incorporate these approaches with equation free
techniques, demonstrating how such data mining approaches can enhance
scientific computation of network evolution dynamics.

 <dc:title>Metric Distortion of Social Choice Rules: Lower Bounds and Fairness
  Properties</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Goel, Ashish</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  We study social choice rules under the utilitarian distortion framework, with
an additional metric assumption on the agents' costs over the alternatives. In
this approach, these costs are given by an underlying metric on the set of all
agents plus alternatives. Social choice rules have access to only the ordinal
preferences of agents but not the latent cardinal costs that induce them.
Distortion is then defined as the ratio between the social cost (typically the
sum of agent costs) of the alternative chosen by the mechanism at hand, and
that of the optimal alternative chosen by an omniscient algorithm. The
worst-case distortion of a social choice rule is, therefore, a measure of how
close it always gets to the optimal alternative without any knowledge of the
underlying costs. Under this model, it has been conjectured that Ranked Pairs,
the well-known weighted-tournament rule, achieves a distortion of at most 3
[Anshelevich et al. 2015]. We disprove this conjecture by constructing a
sequence of instances which shows that the worst-case distortion of Ranked
Pairs is at least 5. Our lower bound on the worst case distortion of Ranked
Pairs matches a previously known upper bound for the Copeland rule, proving
that in the worst case, the simpler Copeland rule is at least as good as Ranked
Pairs. And as long as we are limited to (weighted or unweighted) tournament
rules, we demonstrate that randomization cannot help achieve an expected
worst-case distortion of less than 3. Using the concept of approximate
majorization within the distortion framework, we prove that Copeland and
Randomized Dictatorship achieve low constant factor fairness-ratios (5 and 3
respectively), which is a considerable generalization of similar results for
the sum of costs and single largest cost objectives. In addition to all of the
above, we outline several interesting directions for further research in this
space.

 <dc:description>  For decades, advances in electronics were directly driven by the scaling of
CMOS transistors according to Moore's law. However, both the CMOS scaling and
the classical computer architecture are approaching fundamental and practical
limits, and new computing architectures based on emerging devices, such as
resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices, are expected to sustain the
exponential growth of computing capability. Here we propose a novel
memory-centric, reconfigurable, general purpose computing platform that is
capable of handling the explosive amount of data in a fast and energy-efficient
manner. The proposed computing architecture is based on a uniform, physical,
resistive, memory-centric fabric that can be optimally reconfigured and
utilized to perform different computing and data storage tasks in a massively
parallel approach. The system can be tailored to achieve maximal energy
efficiency based on the data flow by dynamically allocating the basic computing
fabric for storage, arithmetic, and analog computing including neuromorphic
computing tasks.

 <dc:title>Lower Bounds for Differential Privacy from Gaussian Width</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kattis, Assimakis</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nikolov, Aleksandar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the optimal sample complexity of a given workload of linear queries
under the constraints of differential privacy. The sample complexity of a query
answering mechanism under error parameter $\alpha$ is the smallest $n$ such
that the mechanism answers the workload with error at most $\alpha$ on any
database of size $n$. Following a line of research started by Hardt and Talwar
[STOC 2010], we analyze sample complexity using the tools of asymptotic convex
geometry. We study the sensitivity polytope, a natural convex body associated
with a query workload that quantifies how query answers can change between
neighboring databases. This is the information that, roughly speaking, is
protected by a differentially private algorithm, and, for this reason, we
expect that a &quot;bigger&quot; sensitivity polytope implies larger sample complexity.
Our results identify the mean Gaussian width as an appropriate measure of the
size of the polytope, and show sample complexity lower bounds in terms of this
quantity. Our lower bounds completely characterize the workloads for which the
Gaussian noise mechanism is optimal up to constants as those having
asymptotically maximal Gaussian width.
  Our techniques also yield an alternative proof of Pisier's Volume Number
Theorem which also suggests an approach to improving the parameters of the
theorem.

 <dc:description>  The decentralized cryptocurrency Bitcoin has experienced great success but
also encountered many challenges. One of the challenges has been the long
confirmation time. Another challenge is the lack of incentives at certain steps
of the protocol, raising concerns for transaction withholding, selfish mining,
etc. To address these challenges, we propose Solida, a decentralized blockchain
protocol based on reconfigurable Byzantine consensus augmented by
proof-of-work. Solida improves on Bitcoin in confirmation time, and provides
safety and liveness assuming the adversary control less than (roughly)
one-third of the total mining power.

 <dc:title>MIMO Channel Reconstruction from Lower Dimensional Multiple Antenna
  Measurements</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Aleksiejunas, Rimvydas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A method for reconstructing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel
correlation matrices from lower dimensional channel measurements is presented.
Exploiting the symmetry of correlation matrix structure enables reproducing
higher dimensional MIMO channel matrices from available lower order
measurements. This leads to practically important applications allowing
prediction of higher dimensional MIMO system capacity. In particular, we study
Kronecker-type MIMO channels suitable for reconstructing full channel matrices
from partial information about transmit-receive fading in spatial and
polarimetric domains and analyze validity conditions for such models. One of
the important channel conditions is Doppler frequency related to
non-stationarity in the environment. We present simulations of cluster-type
scattering model using 2x2 MIMO channel correlation matrices to predict
performance of 2x4 MIMO system including recovery of angular power spectrum. An
example of dual circular polarized 2x4 MIMO land mobile satellite measurements
in 2.5 GHz frequency band illustrates applicability of the method to
reconstruct spatial and polarimetric channel correlation matrices for
estimating ergodic channel capacity from single-antenna or uni-polarized
measurements.

 <dc:description>  With the increase in mobile traffic and the bandwidth demand,
Device-to-Device (D2D) communication underlaying Long Term Evolution (LTE)
networks has gained tremendous interest by the researchers, cellular operators
and equipment manufacturers. However, the application of D2D communication has
been limited to emergency services and it needs to be explored in commercial
applications. In this paper, we have introduced a novel commercial D2D
offloading scheme for users who may be at cell edges, inside isolated
environments like basement or large buildings, etc. Our proposed scheme
discovers the available idle D2D neighbors for such poor channel users and
offloads its data to the D2D neighbor, which then relays the data to the eNB.
We have developed a D2D offloading simulation model in MATLAB, have conducted
extensive simulations and have observed that the proposed scheme can provide
better efficiency to the network as well as satisfy the poor channel users
significantly.

 <dc:description>  To provide sustainable digital agro-advisory services to farmers, seamless
flow of information from the farmers to the experts/expert systems, and vice
versa is required. The query generated by the farmers, which may contain
multimedia data regarding disease or pest attack in the crops is required to be
transmitted to the experts for analysis. Further, after analyzing the query, an
alert or advice from the expert system is required to be communicated back to
the farmers within some tolerable delay. However, in a country like India,
network connectivity is extremely poor in several agricultural regions which
makes the end-to-end connectivity between the farmers and the expert system
intermittent. Therefore, providing agro-advisory services to farmers in a
reasonable time becomes a challenge. In this paper, we propose a Delay Tolerant
Network (DTN) based relay application model which enables agro-advisory
services to farmers located in \emph{No-network} or \emph{Poor-network} zones.
In the proposed model, end-to-end communication has been enabled with the help
of Device to Device (D2D) communication and by introducing mobile relay nodes
which can carry the queries (responses), from (to) the poor or no network zones
to (from) the zones where communication is possible. Implementation of this
model has been presented for the tea farmers of West Bengal and Assam, which
can be extended for various other applications in future.

 <dc:description>  The problems of Permutation Routing via Matching and Token Swapping are
reconfiguration problems on graphs. This paper is concerned with the complexity
of those problems and a colored variant. For a given graph where each vertex
has a unique token on it, those problems require to find a shortest way to
modify a token placement into another by swapping tokens on adjacent vertices.
While all pairs of tokens on a matching can be exchanged at once in Permutation
Routing via Matching, Token Swapping allows only one pair of tokens can be
swapped. In the colored version, vertices and tokens are colored and the goal
is to relocate tokens so that each vertex has a token of the same color. We
investigate the time complexity of several restricted cases of those problems
and show when those problems become tractable and remain intractable.

 <dc:description>  We present a series of closed-form maximum entropy upper bounds for the
differential entropy of a continuous univariate random variable and study the
properties of that series. We then show how to use those generic bounds for
upper bounding the differential entropy of Gaussian mixture models. This
requires to calculate the raw moments and raw absolute moments of Gaussian
mixtures in closed-form that may also be handy in statistical machine learning
and information theory. We report on our experiments and discuss on the
tightness of those bounds.

 <dc:description>  Milimeter wave (mmWave) band mobile communications can be a solution to the
continuously increasing traffic demand in modern wireless systems. Even though
mmWave bands are scarcely occupied, the design of a prospect transceiver should
guarantee the efficient coexistence with the incumbent services in these bands.
To that end, in this paper, two underlay cognitive transceiver designs are
proposed that enable the mmWave spectrum access while controlling the
interference to the incumbent users. MmWave systems usually require large
antenna arrays to achieve satisfactory performance and thus, they cannot
support fully digital transceiver designs due to high demands in hardware
complexity and power consumption. Thus, in order to develop efficient
solutions, the proposed approaches are based on a hybrid analog-digital
pre-coding architecture. In such hybrid designs, the overall beamformer can be
factorized in a low dimensional digital counterpart applied in the baseband and
in an analog one applied in the RF domain. The first cognitive solution
developed in this paper designs the cognitive hybrid pre-coder by maximizing
the mutual information between its two ends subject to interference, power and
hardware constraints related to the analog counterpart. The second solution
aims at reduced complexity requirements and thus derives the hybrid pre-coder
by minimizing the Frobenious norm of its difference to the optimal digital only
one. A novel solution for the post-coder at the cognitive receiver part is
further proposed here based on a hardware constrained Minimum Mean Square Error
criterion. Simulations show that the performance of both the proposed hybrid
approaches is very close to the one of the fully digital solution for typical
wireless environments.

 <dc:description>  Network management protocols often require timely and meaningful insight
about per flow network traffic. This paper introduces Randomized Admission
Policy (RAP) - a novel algorithm for the frequency and top-k estimation
problems, which are fundamental in network monitoring. We demonstrate space
reductions compared to the alternatives by a factor of up to 32 on real packet
traces and up to 128 on heavy-tailed workloads. For top-k identification, RAP
exhibits memory savings by a factor of between 4 and 64 depending on the skew
of the workload. These empirical results are backed by formal analysis,
indicating the asymptotic space improvement of our probabilistic admission
approach. Additionally, we present d-Way RAP, a hardware friendly variant of
RAP that empirically maintains its space and accuracy benefits.

 <dc:description>  The vast majority of current machine learning algorithms are designed to
predict single responses or a vector of responses, yet many types of response
are more naturally organized as matrices or higher-order tensor objects where
characteristics are shared across modes. We present a new machine learning
algorithm BaTFLED (Bayesian Tensor Factorization Linked to External Data) that
predicts values in a three-dimensional response tensor using input features for
each of the dimensions. BaTFLED uses a probabilistic Bayesian framework to
learn projection matrices mapping input features for each mode into latent
representations that multiply to form the response tensor. By utilizing a
Tucker decomposition, the model can capture weights for interactions between
latent factors for each mode in a small core tensor. Priors that encourage
sparsity in the projection matrices and core tensor allow for feature selection
and model regularization. This method is shown to far outperform elastic net
and neural net models on 'cold start' tasks from data simulated in a three-mode
structure. Additionally, we apply the model to predict dose-response curves in
a panel of breast cancer cell lines treated with drug compounds that was used
as a Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM)
challenge.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the dune-curvilineargrid module. The module provides the
self-contained, parallel grid manager, as well as the underlying elementary
curvilinear geometry module dune-curvilineargeometry. This work is motivated by
the need for reliable and scalable electromagnetic design of nanooptical
devices. Curvilinear geometries improve both the accuracy of modeling smooth
material boundaries, and the h/p-convergence rate of PDE solutions, reducing
the necessary computational effort. dune-curvilineargrid provides a large
spectrum of features for scalable parallel implementations of Finite Element
and Boundary Integral methods over curvilinear tetrahedral geometries,
including symbolic polynomial mappings and operations, recursive integration,
sparse and dense grid communication, parallel timing and memory footprint
diagnostics utilities. It is written in templated C++ using MPI for
parallelization and ParMETIS for grid partitioning, and is provided as a module
for the DUNE interface. The dune-curvilineargrid grid manager is continuously
developed and improved, and so is this documentation. For the most recent
version of the documentation, as well as the source code, please refer to the
provided repositories and our website.

 <dc:description>  Design paradigms of logic circuits with Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA)
have been extensively studied in the recent past. Unfortunately, due to the
lack of mature fabrication support, QCA-based circuits often suffer from
various types of manufacturing defects and variations, and therefore, are
unreliable and error-prone. QCA-based Exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are frequently
used in the construction of several computing subsystems such as adders, linear
feedback shift registers, parity generators and checkers. However, none of the
existing designs for QCA XOR gates have considered the issue of ensuring
fault-tolerance. Simulation results also show that these designs can hardly
tolerate any fault. We investigate the applicability of various existing
fault-tolerant schemes such as triple modular redundancy (TMR), NAND
multiplexing, and majority multiplexing in the context of practical realization
of QCA XOR gate. Our investigations reveal that these techniques incur
prohibitively large area and delay and hence, they are unsuitable for practical
scenarios. We propose here realistic designs of QCA XOR gates (in terms of area
and delay) with significantly high fault-tolerance against all types of cell
misplacement defects such as cell omission, cell displacement, cell
misalignment and extra/additional cell deposition. Furthermore, the absence of
any crossing in the proposed designs facilitates low-cost fabrication of such
systems.

 <dc:description>  Among the paradigms for parallel and distributed computing, the one
popularized with Linda, and based on tuple spaces, is one of the least used,
despite the fact of being intuitive, easy to understand and to use. A tuple
space is a repository, where processes can add, withdraw or read tuples by
means of atomic operations. Tuples may contain different values, and processes
can inspect their content via pattern matching. The lack of a reference
implementation for this paradigm has prevented its widespread. In this paper,
first we perform an extensive analysis of a number of actual implementations of
the tuple space paradigm and summarise their main features. Then, we select
four such implementations and compare their performances on four different case
studies that aim at stressing different aspects of computing such as
communication, data manipulation, and cpu usage. After reasoning on strengths
and weaknesses of the four implementations, we conclude with some
recommendations for future work towards building an effective implementation of
the tuple space paradigm.

 <dc:description>  We consider a single allocation hub-and-spoke network design problem which
allocates each non-hub node to exactly one of given hub nodes so as to minimize
the total transportation cost. This paper deals with a case in which the hubs
are located in a cycle, which is called a cycle-star hub network design
problem. The problem is essentially equivalent to a cycle-metric labeling
problem. The problem is useful in the design of networks in telecommunications
and airline transportation systems.We propose a $2(1-1/h)$-approximation
algorithm where $h$ denotes the number of hub nodes. Our algorithm solves a
linear relaxation problem and employs a dependent rounding procedure. We
analyze our algorithm by approximating a given cycle-metric matrix by a convex
combination of Monge matrices.

 <dc:description>  The increasing complexity of smartphone applications and services necessitate
high battery consumption but the growth of smartphones' battery capacity is not
keeping pace with these increasing power demands. To overcome this problem,
researchers gave birth to the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) research area. In
this paper we advance on previous ideas, by proposing and implementing the
first known Near Field Communication (NFC)-based computation offloading
framework. This research is motivated by the advantages of NFC's short distance
communication, with its better security, and its low battery consumption. We
design a new NFC communication protocol that overcomes the limitations of the
default protocol; removing the need for constant user interaction, the one-way
communication restraint, and the limit on low data size transfer. We present
experimental results of the energy consumption and the time duration of two
computationally intensive representative applications: (i) RSA key generation
and encryption, and (ii) gaming/puzzles. We show that when the helper device is
more powerful than the device offloading the computations, the execution time
of the tasks is reduced. Finally, we show that devices that offload application
parts considerably reduce their energy consumption due to the low-power NFC
interface and the benefits of offloading.

 <dc:description>  The 2013 National Security Agency revelations of pervasive monitoring have
lead to an &quot;encryption rush&quot; across the computer and Internet industry. To push
back against massive surveillance and protect users privacy, vendors, hosting
and cloud providers have widely deployed encryption on their hardware,
communication links, and applications. As a consequence, the most of web
traffic nowadays is encrypted. However, there is still a significant part of
Internet traffic that is not encrypted. It has been argued that both costs and
complexity associated with obtaining and deploying X.509 certificates are major
barriers for widespread encryption, since these certificates are required to
established encrypted connections. To address these issues, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and the University of Michigan have
set up Let's Encrypt (LE), a certificate authority that provides both free
X.509 certificates and software that automates the deployment of these
certificates. In this paper, we investigate if LE has been successful in
democratizing encryption: we analyze certificate issuance in the first year of
LE and show from various perspectives that LE adoption has an upward trend and
it is in fact being successful in covering the lower-cost end of the hosting
market.

 <dc:description>  Microtask crowdsourcing is the practice of breaking down an overarching task
to be performed into numerous, small, and quick microtasks that are distributed
to an unknown, large set of workers. Microtask crowdsourcing has shown
potential in other disciplines, but with only a handful of approaches explored
to date in software engineering, its potential in our field remains unclear. In
this paper, we explore how microtask crowdsourcing might serve as a means of
fault localization. We particularly take a first step in assessing whether a
crowd of workers can correctly locate known faults in a few lines of code (code
fragments) taken from different open source projects. Through Mechanical Turk,
we collected the answers of hundreds of workers to a pre-determined set of
template questions applied to the code fragments, with a replication factor of
twenty answers per question. Our findings show that a crowd can correctly
distinguish questions that cover lines of code that contain a fault from those
that do not. We also show that various filters can be applied to identify the
most effective subcrowds. Our findings also presented serious limitations in
terms of the proportion of lines of code selected for inspection and the cost
to collect answers. We describe the design of our experiment, discuss the
results, and provide an extensive analysis of different filters and their
effects in terms of speed, cost, and effectiveness. We conclude with a
discussion of limitations and possible future experiments toward more
full-fledged fault localization on a large scale involving more complex faults.

 <dc:description>  Given an unweighted tree $T=(V,E)$ with terminals $K \subset V$, we show how
to obtain a $2$-quality vertex flow and cut sparsifier $H$ with $V_H = K$. We
prove that our result is essentially tight by providing a $2-o(1)$ lower-bound
on the quality of any cut sparsifier for stars. In addition we give improved
results for quasi-bipartite graphs. First, we show how to obtain a $2$-quality
flow sparsifier with $V_H = K$ for such graphs. We then consider the other
extreme and construct exact sparsifiers of size $O(2^{k})$, when the input
graph is unweighted.

 <dc:description>  Selective weeding is one of the key challenges in the field of agriculture
robotics. To accomplish this task, a farm robot should be able to accurately
detect plants and to distinguish them between crop and weeds. Most of the
promising state-of-the-art approaches make use of appearance-based models
trained on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, creating large agricultural
datasets with pixel-level annotations is an extremely time consuming task,
actually penalizing the usage of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we face
this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to
dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and
classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic
training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e.,
crop and weed species, type of soil, light conditions). More specifically, by
tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is
possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial
agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used
to train the model or to supplement real-world images. We validate the proposed
methodology by using as testbed a modern deep learning based image segmentation
architecture. We compare the classification results obtained using both real
and synthetic images as training data. The reported results confirm the
effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach.

 <dc:description>  In this work we present a model for analyzing the combined use of broadcast
polling and piggybacking in Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
(WiMAX) networks. For an accurate analysis of piggybacking, the model focuses
on the realistic case of limited up-link bandwidth and non-trivial queueing
capability at the subscriber stations. We first model the activity of a
subscriber station using a Markov chain and its queue as an M/G/1 system with
vacations in order to facilitate the analysis of the piggyback mechanism. We
then derive a set of fixed point equations that describe not only the
contention process at the network level but also bandwidth allocation to
contending and piggybacked requests. Our model uses a minimal set of
assumptions and is generic in the sense that it is customizable through a set
of parameters. It can also reproduce the system performance in both saturated
and non-saturated conditions. After validating our analysis through extensive
simulations, we shed light on the aspects of the synergy between broadcast
polling and piggybacking and unveil the pros and cons of using the latter.

 <dc:description>  Even with the recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) in
various visual recognition tasks, the state-of-the-art action recognition
system still relies on hand crafted motion feature such as optical flow to
achieve the best performance. We propose a multitask learning model
ActionFlowNet to train a single stream network directly from raw pixels to
jointly estimate optical flow while recognizing actions with convolutional
neural networks, capturing both appearance and motion in a single model. We
additionally provide insights to how the quality of the learned optical flow
affects the action recognition. Our model significantly improves action
recognition accuracy by a large margin 31% compared to state-of-the-art
CNN-based action recognition models trained without external large scale data
and additional optical flow input. Without pretraining on large external
labeled datasets, our model, by well exploiting the motion information,
achieves competitive recognition accuracy to the models trained with large
labeled datasets such as ImageNet and Sport-1M.

 <dc:description>  Many of today's most widely used computing applications utilize social
networking features and allow users to connect, follow each other, share
content, and comment on others' posts. However, despite the widespread adoption
of these features, there is little understanding of the consequences that
social networking has on user retention, engagement, and online as well as
offline behavior. Here, we study how social networks influence user behavior in
a physical activity tracking application. We analyze 791 million online and
offline actions of 6 million users over the course of 5 years, and show that
social networking leads to a significant increase in users' online as well as
offline activities. Specifically, we establish a causal effect of how social
networks influence user behavior. We show that the creation of new social
connections increases user online in-application activity by 30%, user
retention by 17%, and user offline real-world physical activity by 7% (about
400 steps per day). By exploiting a natural experiment we distinguish the
effect of social influence of new social connections from the simultaneous
increase in user's motivation to use the app and take more steps. We show that
social influence accounts for 55% of the observed changes in user behavior,
while the remaining 45% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to
use the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in
the social network lead to significant increases in daily steps. These effects
diminish with each additional edge and vary based on edge attributes and user
demographics. Finally, we utilize these insights to develop a model that
accurately predicts which users will be most influenced by the creation of new
social network connections.

 <dc:description>  Managing patients with multimorbidity often results in polypharmacy: the
prescription of multiple drugs. However, the long-term effects of specific
combinations of drugs and diseases are typically unknown. In particular, drugs
prescribed for one condition may result in adverse effects for the other. To
investigate which types of drugs may affect the further progression of
multimorbidity, we query models of diseases and prescriptions that are learned
from primary care data. State-of-the-art tractable Bayesian network
representations, on which such complex queries can be computed efficiently, are
employed for these large medical networks. Our results confirm that
prescriptions may lead to unintended negative consequences in further
development of multimorbidity in cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, a drug
treatment for one disease group may affect diseases of another group.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an efficient identification algorithm for spatial
multiplexing (SM) and Alamouti (AL) coded orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The cross-correlation between the received signals
from different antennas is exploited to provide a discriminating feature to
identify SM-OFDM and AL-OFDM signals. The proposed algorithm requires neither
estimation of the channel coefficients and noise power, nor the modulation of
the transmitted signal. Moreover, it does not need space-time block code (STBC)
or OFDM block synchronization. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated through extensive simulation experiments in the presence of
diverse transmission impairments, such as time and frequency offsets, Doppler
frequency, and spatially correlated fading.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning is being deployed in a growing number of applications which
demand real-time, accurate, and robust predictions under heavy query load.
However, most machine learning frameworks and systems only address model
training and not deployment.
  In this paper, we introduce Clipper, a general-purpose low-latency prediction
serving system. Interposing between end-user applications and a wide range of
machine learning frameworks, Clipper introduces a modular architecture to
simplify model deployment across frameworks and applications. Furthermore, by
introducing caching, batching, and adaptive model selection techniques, Clipper
reduces prediction latency and improves prediction throughput, accuracy, and
robustness without modifying the underlying machine learning frameworks. We
evaluate Clipper on four common machine learning benchmark datasets and
demonstrate its ability to meet the latency, accuracy, and throughput demands
of online serving applications. Finally, we compare Clipper to the TensorFlow
Serving system and demonstrate that we are able to achieve comparable
throughput and latency while enabling model composition and online learning to
improve accuracy and render more robust predictions.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to shed light on the problem of controlling a
complex network with minimal control energy. We show first that the control
energy depends on the time constant of the modes of the network, and that the
closer the eigenvalues are to the imaginary axis of the complex plane, the less
energy is required for complete controllability. In the limit case of networks
having all purely imaginary eigenvalues (e.g. networks of coupled harmonic
oscillators), several constructive algorithms for minimum control energy driver
node selection are developed. A general heuristic principle valid for any
directed network is also proposed: the overall cost of controlling a network is
reduced when the controls are concentrated on the nodes with highest ratio of
weighted outdegree vs indegree.

 <dc:description>  We consider the following multiplication-based tests to check if a given
function $f: \mathbb{F}_q^n\to \mathbb{F}_q$ is a codeword of the Reed-Muller
code of dimension $n$ and order $d$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ for
prime $q$ (i.e., $f$ is the evaluation of a degree-$d$ polynomial over
$\mathbb{F}_q$ for $q$ prime).
  * $\mathrm{Test}_{e,k}$: Pick $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ independent random degree-$e$
polynomials and accept iff the function $fP_1\cdots P_k$ is the evaluation of a
degree-$(d+ek)$ polynomial (i.e., is a codeword of the Reed-Muller code of
dimension $n$ and order $(d+ek)$).
  We prove the robust soundness of the above tests for large values of $e$,
answering a question of Dinur and Guruswami [Israel Journal of Mathematics,
209:611-649, 2015]. Previous soundness analyses of these tests were known only
for the case when either $e=1$ or $k=1$. Even for the case $k=1$ and $e&gt;1$,
earlier soundness analyses were not robust.
  We also analyze a derandomized version of this test, where (for example) the
polynomials $P_1,\dots,P_k$ can be the same random polynomial $P$. This
generalizes a result of Guruswami et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 46(1):132-159,
2017].
  One of the key ingredients that go into the proof of this robust soundness is
an extension of the standard Schwartz-Zippel lemma over general finite fields
$\mathbb{F}_q$, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Following the gaze of people inside videos is an important signal for
understanding people and their actions. In this paper, we present an approach
for following gaze across views by predicting where a particular person is
looking throughout a scene. We collect VideoGaze, a new dataset which we use as
a benchmark to both train and evaluate models. Given one view with a person in
it and a second view of the scene, our model estimates a density for gaze
location in the second view. A key aspect of our approach is an end-to-end
model that solves the following sub-problems: saliency, gaze pose, and
geometric relationships between views. Although our model is supervised only
with gaze, we show that the model learns to solve these subproblems
automatically without supervision. Experiments suggest that our approach
follows gaze better than standard baselines and produces plausible results for
everyday situations.

 <dc:description>  The first part of this report describes the following result that,
logarithmic approximation factor for hard capacitated set cover can be achieved
from Wolsey's work [9], using a simpler and more intuitive analysis. We further
show in our work, that O(log n) approximation factor can be achieved for the
same problem by applying analysis of general set cover to analyze Wolsey's
algorithm [5]. This work is based on the key observation that we make in Lemma
3 of this report. The second part of the report describes the geometric hitting
set problem, where X is a ground set of points in a plane and S is a set of
axis parallel rectangles. It is shown that epsilon-nets of size O(1/epsilon log
log 1/epsilon) can be computed in polynomial time. Applying Bronnimann and
Goodrich result [3] gives the hitting set of size O(log log OPT) for this
problem.

 <dc:description>  This documents presents the final report of a two-year project to evaluate
the impact of AbuseHUB, a Dutch clearinghouse for acquiring and processing
abuse data on infected machines. The report was commissioned by the Netherlands
Ministry of Economic Affairs, a co-funder of the development of AbuseHUB.
AbuseHUB is the initiative of 9 Internet Service Providers, SIDN (the registry
for the .nl top-level domain) and Surfnet (the national research and education
network operator). The key objective of AbuseHUB is to improve the mitigation
of botnets by its members.
  We set out to assess whether this objective is being reached by analyzing
malware infection levels in the networks of AbuseHUB members and comparing them
to those of other Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Since AbuseHUB members
together comprise over 90 percent of the broadband market in the Netherlands,
it also makes sense to compare how the country as a whole has performed
compared to other countries. This report complements the baseline measurement
report produced in December 2013 and the interim report from March 2015. We are
using the same data sources as in the interim report, which is an expanded set
compared to the earlier baseline report and to our 2011 study into botnet
mitigation in the Netherlands.

 <dc:description>  Software safety is a crucial aspect during the development of modern
safety-critical systems. Software is becoming responsible for most of the
critical functions of systems. Therefore, the software components in the
systems need to be tested extensively against their safety requirements to
ensure a high level of system safety. However, performing testing exhaustively
to test all software behaviours is impossible. Numerous testing approaches
exist. However, they do not directly concern the information derived during the
safety analysis. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a unique safety
analysis approach based on system and control theory, and was developed to
identify unsafe scenarios of a complex system including software. In this
paper, we present a systematic and semi-automatic testing approach based on
STPA to generate test cases from the STPA safety analysis results to help
software and safety engineers to recognize and reduce the associated software
risks. We also provide an open-source safety-based testing tool called STPA
TCGenerator to support the proposed approach. We illustrate the proposed
approach with a prototype of a software of the Adaptive Cruise Control System
(ACC) with a stop-and-go function with a Lego-Mindstorms EV3 robot.

 <dc:description>  The task of reconstructing a low rank matrix from incomplete linear
measurements arises in areas such as machine learning, quantum state tomography
and in the phase retrieval problem. In this note, we study the particular setup
that the measurements are taken with respect to rank one matrices constructed
from the elements of a random tight frame. We consider a convex optimization
approach and show both robustness of the reconstruction with respect to noise
on the measurements as well as stability with respect to passing to
approximately low rank matrices. This is achieved by establishing a version of
the null space property of the corresponding measurement map.

 <dc:description>  Formal verification and testing are complementary approaches which are used
in the development process to verify the functional correctness of software.
However, the correctness of software cannot ensure the safe operation of
safety-critical software systems. The software must be verified against its
safety requirements which are identified by safety analysis, to ensure that
potential hazardous causes cannot occur. The complexity of software makes
defining appropriate software safety requirements with traditional safety
analysis techniques difficult. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Processes Analysis) is a
unique safety analysis approach that has been developed to identify system
hazards, including the software-related hazards. This paper presents a
comprehensive safety engineering approach based on STPA, including software
testing and model checking approaches for the purpose of developing safe
software. The proposed approach can be embedded within a defined software
engineering process or applied to existing software systems, allow software and
safety engineers integrate the analysis of software risks with their
verification. The application of the proposed approach is illustrated with an
automotive software controller.

 <dc:description>  Barab\'asi-Albert's `Scale Free' model is the starting point for much of the
accepted theory of the evolution of real world communication networks. Careful
comparison of the theory with a wide range of real world networks, however,
indicates that the model is in some cases, only a rough approximation to the
dynamical evolution of real networks. In particular, the exponent $\gamma$ of
the power law distribution of degree is predicted by the model to be exactly 3,
whereas in a number of real world networks it has values between 1.2 and 2.9.
In addition, the degree distributions of real networks exhibit cut offs at high
node degree, which indicates the existence of maximal node degrees for these
networks. In this paper we propose a simple extension to the `Scale Free'
model, which offers better agreement with the experimental data. This
improvement is satisfying, but the model still does not explain \emph{why} the
attachment probabilities should favor high degree nodes, or indeed how
constraints arrive in non-physical networks. Using recent advances in the
analysis of the entropy of graphs at the node level we propose a first
principles derivation for the `Scale Free' and `constraints' model from
thermodynamic principles, and demonstrate that both preferential attachment and
constraints could arise as a natural consequence of the second law of
thermodynamics.

 <dc:description>  Bayesian Optimization (BO) has become a core method for solving expensive
black-box optimization problems. While much research focussed on the choice of
the acquisition function, we focus on online length-scale adaption and the
choice of kernel function. Instead of choosing hyperparameters in view of
maximum likelihood on past data, we propose to use the acquisition function to
decide on hyperparameter adaptation more robustly and in view of the future
optimization progress. Further, we propose a particular kernel function that
includes non-stationarity and local anisotropy and thereby implicitly
integrates the efficiency of local convex optimization with global Bayesian
optimization. Comparisons to state-of-the art BO methods underline the
efficiency of these mechanisms on global optimization benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We study properties of some standard network models when the population is
split into two types and the connection pattern between the types is varied.
The studied models are generalizations of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph, the
configuration model and a preferential attachment graph. For the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph and the configuration model, the focus is on the
component structure. We derive expressions for the critical parameter,
indicating when there is a giant component in the graph, and study the size of
the largest component by aid of simulations. When the expected degrees in the
graph are fixed and the connections are shifted so that more edges connect
vertices of different types, we find that the critical parameter decreases. The
size of the largest component in the supercritical regime can be both
increasing and decreasing as the connections change, depending on the
combination of types. For the preferential attachment model, we analyze the
degree distributions of the two types and derive explicit expressions for the
degree exponents. The exponents are confirmed by simulations that also
illustrate other properties of the degree structure.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of instance-level semantic segmentation, which aims at
jointly detecting, segmenting and classifying every individual object in an
image. In this context, existing methods typically propose candidate objects,
usually as bounding boxes, and directly predict a binary mask within each such
proposal. As a consequence, they cannot recover from errors in the object
candidate generation process, such as too small or shifted boxes.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel object segment representation based on
the distance transform of the object masks. We then design an object mask
network (OMN) with a new residual-deconvolution architecture that infers such a
representation and decodes it into the final binary object mask. This allows us
to predict masks that go beyond the scope of the bounding boxes and are thus
robust to inaccurate object candidates. We integrate our OMN into a Multitask
Network Cascade framework, and learn the resulting boundary-aware instance
segmentation (BAIS) network in an end-to-end manner. Our experiments on the
PASCAL VOC 2012 and the Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the benefits of our
approach, which outperforms the state-of-the-art in both object proposal
generation and instance segmentation.

 <dc:description>  We study Generalised Restricted Boltzmann Machines with generic priors for
units and weights, interpolating between Boolean and Gaussian variables. We
present a complete analysis of the replica symmetric phase diagram of these
systems, which can be regarded as Generalised Hopfield models. We underline the
role of the retrieval phase for both inference and learning processes and we
show that retrieval is robust for a large class of weight and unit priors,
beyond the standard Hopfield scenario. Furthermore we show how the paramagnetic
phase boundary is directly related to the optimal size of the training set
necessary for good generalisation in a teacher-student scenario of unsupervised
learning.

 <dc:description>  We provide a dynamic programming algorithm for the monitoring of a fragment
of Timed Propositional Temporal Logic (TPTL) specifications. This fragment of
TPTL, which is more expressive than Metric Temporal Logic, is characterized by
independent time variables which enable the elicitation of complex real-time
requirements. For this fragment, we provide an efficient polynomial time
algorithm for off-line monitoring of finite traces. Finally, we provide
experimental results on a prototype implementation of our tool in order to
demonstrate the feasibility of using our tool in practical applications.

 <dc:description>  While natural beauty is often considered a subjective property of images, in
this paper, we take an objective approach and provide methods for quantifying
and predicting the scenicness of an image. Using a dataset containing hundreds
of thousands of outdoor images captured throughout Great Britain with
crowdsourced ratings of natural beauty, we propose an approach to predict
scenicness which explicitly accounts for the variance of human ratings. We
demonstrate that quantitative measures of scenicness can benefit semantic image
understanding, content-aware image processing, and a novel application of
cross-view mapping, where the sparsity of ground-level images can be addressed
by incorporating unlabeled overhead images in the training and prediction
steps. For each application, our methods for scenicness prediction result in
quantitative and qualitative improvements over baseline approaches.

 <dc:description>  Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting
objects at different scales. But recent deep learning object detectors have
avoided pyramid representations, in part because they are compute and memory
intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal
hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with
marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is
developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This
architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant
improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using FPN
in a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art
single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and
whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the
COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU
and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection.
Code will be made publicly available.

 <dc:description>  Given samples from an unknown multivariate distribution $p$, is it possible
to distinguish whether $p$ is the product of its marginals versus $p$ being far
from every product distribution? Similarly, is it possible to distinguish
whether $p$ equals a given distribution $q$ versus $p$ and $q$ being far from
each other? These problems of testing independence and goodness-of-fit have
received enormous attention in statistics, information theory, and theoretical
computer science, with sample-optimal algorithms known in several interesting
regimes of parameters. Unfortunately, it has also been understood that these
problems become intractable in large dimensions, necessitating exponential
sample complexity.
  Motivated by the exponential lower bounds for general distributions as well
as the ubiquity of Markov Random Fields (MRFs) in the modeling of
high-dimensional distributions, we initiate the study of distribution testing
on structured multivariate distributions, and in particular the prototypical
example of MRFs: the Ising Model. We demonstrate that, in this structured
setting, we can avoid the curse of dimensionality, obtaining sample and time
efficient testers for independence and goodness-of-fit. One of the key
technical challenges we face along the way is bounding the variance of
functions of the Ising model.

 <dc:title>Optimal mean-based algorithms for trace reconstruction</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the (deletion-channel) trace reconstruction problem, there is an unknown
$n$-bit source string $x$. An algorithm is given access to independent traces
of $x$, where a trace is formed by deleting each bit of~$x$ independently with
probability~$\delta$. The goal of the algorithm is to recover~$x$ exactly (with
high probability), while minimizing samples (number of traces) and running
time.
  Previously, the best known algorithm for the trace reconstruction problem was
due to Holenstein~et~al.; it uses $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}))$ samples and
running time for any fixed $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$. It is also what we call a
&quot;mean-based algorithm&quot;, meaning that it only uses the empirical means of the
individual bits of the traces. Holenstein~et~al.~also gave a lower bound,
showing that any mean-based algorithm must use at least $n^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log
n)}$ samples.
  In this paper we improve both of these results, obtaining matching upper and
lower bounds for mean-based trace reconstruction. For any constant deletion
rate $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$, we give a mean-based algorithm that uses
$\exp(O(n^{1/3}))$ time and traces; we also prove that any mean-based algorithm
must use at least $\exp(\Omega(n^{1/3}))$ traces. In fact, we obtain matching
upper and lower bounds even for $\delta$ subconstant and $\rho := 1-\delta$
subconstant: when $(\log^3 n)/n \ll \delta \leq 1/2$ the bound is
$\exp(-\Theta(\delta n)^{1/3})$, and when $1/\sqrt{n} \ll \rho \leq 1/2$ the
bound is $\exp(-\Theta(n/\rho)^{1/3})$.
  Our proofs involve estimates for the maxima of Littlewood polynomials on
complex disks. We show that these techniques can also be used to perform trace
reconstruction with random insertions and bit-flips in addition to deletions.
We also find a surprising result: for deletion probabilities $\delta &gt; 1/2$,
the presence of insertions can actually help with trace reconstruction.

 <dc:title>Budget Feasible Mechanisms on Matroids</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Motivated by many practical applications, in this paper we study {\em budget
feasible mechanisms} where the goal is to procure independent sets from
matroids. More specifically, we are given a matroid
$\mathcal{M}=(E,\mathcal{I})$ where each ground (indivisible) element is a
selfish agent. The cost of each element (i.e., for selling the item or
performing a service) is only known to the element itself. There is a buyer
with a budget having additive valuations over the set of elements $E$. The goal
is to design an incentive compatible (truthful) budget feasible mechanism which
procures an independent set of the matroid under the given budget that yields
the largest value possible to the buyer. Our result is a deterministic,
polynomial-time, individually rational, truthful and budget feasible mechanism
with $4$-approximation to the optimal independent set. Then, we extend our
mechanism to the setting of matroid intersections in which the goal is to
procure common independent sets from multiple matroids. We show that, given a
polynomial time deterministic blackbox that returns $\alpha-$approximation
solutions to the matroid intersection problem, there exists a deterministic,
polynomial time, individually rational, truthful and budget feasible mechanism
with $(3\alpha +1)-$approximation to the optimal common independent set.

 <dc:description>  Blockchain technology enables the execution of collaborative business
processes involving untrusted parties without requiring a central authority.
Specifically, a process model comprising tasks performed by multiple parties
can be coordinated via smart contracts operating on the blockchain. The
consensus mechanism governing the blockchain thereby guarantees that the
process model is followed by each party. However, the cost required for
blockchain use is highly dependent on the volume of data recorded and the
frequency of data updates by smart contracts. This paper proposes an optimized
method for executing business processes on top of commodity blockchain
technology. The paper presents a method for compiling a process model into a
smart contract that encodes the preconditions for executing each task in the
process using a space-optimized data structure. The method is empirically
compared to a previously proposed baseline by replaying execution logs,
including one from a real-life business process, and measuring resource
consumption.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to capture the 3D motion of a group of people engaged
in a social interaction. The core challenges in capturing social interactions
are: (1) occlusion is functional and frequent; (2) subtle motion needs to be
measured over a space large enough to host a social group; (3) human appearance
and configuration variation is immense; and (4) attaching markers to the body
may prime the nature of interactions. The Panoptic Studio is a system organized
around the thesis that social interactions should be measured through the
integration of perceptual analyses over a large variety of view points. We
present a modularized system designed around this principle, consisting of
integrated structural, hardware, and software innovations. The system takes, as
input, 480 synchronized video streams of multiple people engaged in social
activities, and produces, as output, the labeled time-varying 3D structure of
anatomical landmarks on individuals in the space. Our algorithm is designed to
fuse the &quot;weak&quot; perceptual processes in the large number of views by
progressively generating skeletal proposals from low-level appearance cues, and
a framework for temporal refinement is also presented by associating body parts
to reconstructed dense 3D trajectory stream. Our system and method are the
first in reconstructing full body motion of more than five people engaged in
social interactions without using markers. We also empirically demonstrate the
impact of the number of views in achieving this goal.

 <dc:title>On Higher Order Query Languages which on Relational Databases Collapse
  to Second Order Logic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ferrarotti, Flavio</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the framework of computable queries in Database Theory, there are many
examples of queries to (properties of) relational database instances that can
be expressed by simple and elegant third order logic ($\mathrm{TO}$) formulae.
In many of those properties the expressive power of $\mathrm{TO}$ is not
required, but the equivalent second order logic ($\mathrm{SO}$) formulae can be
very complicated or unintuitive. From the point of view of the study of highly
expressive query languages, it is then relevant to identify fragments of
$\mathrm{TO}$ (and, in general, of higher-order logics of order $\geq 3$) which
do have an $\mathrm{SO}$ equivalent formula. In this article we investigate
this precise problem as follows. Firstly, we define a general schema of
$\exists$TO formulas which consists of existentially quantifying a third-order
linear digraph of polynomial length, that is, a sequence of structures that
represents a computation, by explicitly stating which operations are the ones
which can be involved in the construction of a given structure in the sequence,
when applied to the previous one. Then we give a constructive proof of the fact
that all $\exists$TO sub formulas of that schema can be translated into an
equivalent SO formula. Secondly, aiming to formally characterize the fragment
of TO which can be translated to SO, we define a restriction of TO, which we
denote TO$^{P}$, for polynomial TO, and we give a constructive proof on the
fact that it collapses to SO. We define TO$^{P}$ as the fragment of TO where
valuations can assign to TO relation variables only TO relations whose
cardinalities are bounded by a polynomial that depends on the quantifier.
Moreover, we define a similar restriction for every higher order logic of order
$i \geq 4$, which we denote $\mathrm{HO}^{i,P}$, and give a constructive proof
of the fact that for all $i \geq 4$, $\mathrm{HO}^{i,P}$ collapses to SO.

 <dc:description>  This work initiates a systematic investigation of testing {\em
high-dimensional} structured distributions by focusing on testing {\em Bayesian
networks} -- the prototypical family of directed graphical models. A Bayesian
network is defined by a directed acyclic graph, where we associate a random
variable with each node. The value at any particular node is conditionally
independent of all the other non-descendant nodes once its parents are fixed.
Specifically, we study the properties of identity testing and closeness testing
of Bayesian networks. Our main contribution is the first non-trivial efficient
testing algorithms for these problems and corresponding information-theoretic
lower bounds. For a wide range of parameter settings, our testing algorithms
have sample complexity {\em sublinear} in the dimension and are sample-optimal,
up to constant factors.

 <dc:description>  We present a general framework for stochastic online maximization problems
with combinatorial feasibility constraints. The framework establishes prophet
inequalities by constructing price-based online approximation algorithms, a
natural extension of threshold algorithms for settings beyond binary selection.
Our analysis takes the form of an extension theorem: we derive sufficient
conditions on prices when all weights are known in advance, then prove that the
resulting approximation guarantees extend directly to stochastic settings. Our
framework unifies and simplifies much of the existing literature on prophet
inequalities and posted price mechanisms, and is used to derive new and
improved results for combinatorial markets (with and without complements),
multi-dimensional matroids, and sparse packing problems. Finally, we highlight
a surprising connection between the smoothness framework for bounding the price
of anarchy of mechanisms and our framework, and show that many smooth
mechanisms can be recast as posted price mechanisms with comparable performance
guarantees.

 <dc:description>  We show that the square Hellinger distance between two Bayesian networks on
the same directed graph, $G$, is subadditive with respect to the neighborhoods
of $G$. Namely, if $P$ and $Q$ are the probability distributions defined by two
Bayesian networks on the same DAG, our inequality states that the square
Hellinger distance, $H^2(P,Q)$, between $P$ and $Q$ is upper bounded by the
sum, $\sum_v H^2(P_{\{v\} \cup \Pi_v}, Q_{\{v\} \cup \Pi_v})$, of the square
Hellinger distances between the marginals of $P$ and $Q$ on every node $v$ and
its parents $\Pi_v$ in the DAG. Importantly, our bound does not involve the
conditionals but the marginals of $P$ and $Q$. We derive a similar inequality
for more general Markov Random Fields.
  As an application of our inequality, we show that distinguishing whether two
Bayesian networks $P$ and $Q$ on the same (but potentially unknown) DAG satisfy
$P=Q$ vs $d_{\rm TV}(P,Q)&gt;\epsilon$ can be performed from
$\tilde{O}(|\Sigma|^{3/4(d+1)} \cdot n/\epsilon^2)$ samples, where $d$ is the
maximum in-degree of the DAG and $\Sigma$ the domain of each variable of the
Bayesian networks. If $P$ and $Q$ are defined on potentially different and
potentially unknown trees, the sample complexity becomes
$\tilde{O}(|\Sigma|^{4.5} n/\epsilon^2)$, whose dependence on $n, \epsilon$ is
optimal up to logarithmic factors. Lastly, if $P$ and $Q$ are product
distributions over $\{0,1\}^n$ and $Q$ is known, the sample complexity becomes
$O(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$, which is optimal up to constant factors.

 <dc:description>  Application trends, device technologies and the architecture of systems drive
progress in information technologies. However, the former engines of such
progress - Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling - are rapidly reaching the point of
diminishing returns. The time has come for the computing community to boldly
confront a new challenge: how to secure a foundational future for information
technology's continued progress. The computer architecture community engaged in
several visioning exercises over the years. Five years ago, we released a white
paper, 21st Century Computer Architecture, which influenced funding programs in
both academia and industry. More recently, the IEEE Rebooting Computing
Initiative explored the future of computing systems in the architecture,
device, and circuit domains. This report stems from an effort to continue this
dialogue, reach out to the applications and devices/circuits communities, and
understand their trends and vision. We aim to identify opportunities where
architecture research can bridge the gap between the application and device
domains.

 <dc:description>  Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm that provides computing,
storage, and networking resources within the edge of the mobile Radio Access
Network (RAN). MEC servers are deployed on generic computing platform within
the RAN and allow for delay-sensitive and context-aware applications to be
executed in close proximity to the end users. This approach alleviates the
backhaul and core network and is crucial for enabling low-latency,
high-bandwidth, and agile mobile services. This article envisages a real-time,
context-aware collaboration framework that lies at the edge of the RAN,
constituted of MEC servers and mobile devices, and that amalgamates the
heterogeneous resources at the edge. Specifically, we introduce and study three
strong use cases ranging from mobile-edge orchestration, collaborative caching
and processing and multi-layer interference cancellation. We demonstrate the
promising benefits of these approaches in facilitating the evolution to 5G
networks. Finally, we discuss the key technical challenges and open-research
issues that need to be addressed in order to make an efficient integration of
MEC into 5G ecosystem.

 <dc:description>  Optimization problems with rank constraints appear in many diverse fields
such as control, machine learning and image analysis. Since the rank constraint
is non-convex, these problems are often approximately solved via convex
relaxations. Nuclear norm regularization is the prevailing convexifying
technique for dealing with these types of problem. This paper introduces a
family of low-rank inducing norms and regularizers which includes the nuclear
norm as a special case. A posteriori guarantees on solving an underlying rank
constrained optimization problem with these convex relaxations are provided. We
evaluate the performance of the low-rank inducing norms on three matrix
completion problems. In all examples, the nuclear norm heuristic is
outperformed by convex relaxations based on other low-rank inducing norms. For
two of the problems there exist low-rank inducing norms that succeed in
recovering the partially unknown matrix, while the nuclear norm fails. These
low-rank inducing norms are shown to be representable as semi-definite programs
and to have cheaply computable proximal mappings. The latter makes it possible
to also solve problems of large size with the help of scalable first-order
methods. Finally, it is proven that our findings extend to the more general
class of atomic norms. In particular, this allows us to solve corresponding
vector-valued problems, as well as problems with other non-convex constraints.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Variants of the must testing approach have been successfully applied in
Service Oriented Computing for analysing the compliance between (contracts
exposed by) clients and servers or, more generally, between two peers. It has
however been argued that multiparty scenarios call for more permissive notions
of compliance because partners usually do not have full coordination
capabilities. We propose two new testing preorders, which are obtained by
restricting the set of potential observers. For the first preorder, called
uncoordinated, we allow only sets of parallel observers that use different
parts of the interface of a given service and have no possibility of
intercommunication. For the second preorder, that we call individualistic, we
instead rely on parallel observers that perceive as silent all the actions that
are not in the interface of interest. We have that the uncoordinated preorder
is coarser than the classical must testing preorder and finer than the
individualistic one. We also provide a characterisation in terms of decorated
traces for both preorders: the uncoordinated preorder is defined in terms of
must-sets and Mazurkiewicz traces while the individualistic one is described in
terms of classes of filtered traces that only contain designated visible
actions and must-sets.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the interactions among nodes in a complex network is of great
importance, since they disclose how these nodes are cooperatively supporting
the functioning of the network. Scientists have developed numerous methods to
uncover the underlying adjacent physical connectivity based on measurements of
functional quantities of the nodes states. Often, the physical connectivity,
the adjacency matrix, is available. Yet, little is known about how this
adjacent connectivity impacts on the &quot;hidden&quot; flows being exchanged between any
two arbitrary nodes, after travelling longer non-adjacent paths. In this
Letter, we show that hidden physical flows in conservative flow networks, a
quantity that is usually inaccessible to measurements, can be determined by the
interchange of physical flows between any pair of adjacent nodes. Our approach
applies to steady or dynamic state of either linear or non-linear complex
networks that can be modelled by conservative flow networks, such as gas supply
networks, water supply networks and power grids.

 <dc:description>  The discovery of physical laws consistent with empirical observations lies at
the heart of (applied) science and engineering. These laws typically take the
form of nonlinear differential equations depending on parameters, dynamical
systems theory provides, through the appropriate normal forms, an &quot;intrinsic&quot;,
prototypical characterization of the types of dynamical regimes accessible to a
given model. Using an implementation of data-informed geometry learning we
directly reconstruct the relevant &quot;normal forms&quot;: a quantitative mapping from
empirical observations to prototypical realizations of the underlying dynamics.
Interestingly, the state variables and the parameters of these realizations are
inferred from the empirical observations, without prior knowledge or
understanding, they parametrize the dynamics {\em intrinsically}, without
explicit reference to fundamental physical quantities.

 <dc:description>  Smartphone users touch the screen of the phone thousands of times per day.
The inter-touch intervals follow a power-law distribution. We propose a
multi-scale statistical model for those smartphone touches. At short-time
scale, the model is governed by refractory effects, while at longer time
scales, the touching rate is governed by the priority difference between
smartphone tasks and other tasks. We show that both the statistics of the short
intervals as well as the longer intervals are well captured by the model. The
model is described in continuous time and the inter-touch interval distribution
can be computed analytically.

 <dc:description>  In order to meet the constantly increasing demand by mobile terminals for
higher data rates with limited wireless spectrum resource, cognitive radio and
spectrum aggregation technologies have attracted much attention due to its
capacity in improving spectrum efficiency. Combing cognitive relay and spectrum
aggregation technologies, in this paper, we propose a dynamic spectrum
aggregation strategy based on the Markov Prediction of the state of spectrum
for the cooperatively relay networks on a multi-user and multi-relay scenario
aiming at ensuring the user channel capacity and maximizing the network
throughput. The spectrum aggregation strategy is executed through two steps.
First, predict the state of spectrum through Markov prediction. Based on the
prediction results of state of spectrum, a spectrum aggregation strategy is
proposed. Simulation results show that the spectrum prediction process can
observably lower the outage rate, and the spectrum aggregation strategy can
greatly improve the network throughput.

 <dc:description>  Language generation tasks that seek to mimic human ability to use language
creatively are difficult to evaluate, since one must consider creativity,
style, and other non-trivial aspects of the generated text. The goal of this
paper is to develop evaluation methods for one such task, ghostwriting of rap
lyrics, and to provide an explicit, quantifiable foundation for the goals and
future directions of this task. Ghostwriting must produce text that is similar
in style to the emulated artist, yet distinct in content. We develop a novel
evaluation methodology that addresses several complementary aspects of this
task, and illustrate how such evaluation can be used to meaningfully analyze
system performance. We provide a corpus of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated
for stylistic similarity, which allows us to assess the feasibility of manual
evaluation for generated verse.

classifiers that perform classification of the tissue samples as either being

 <dc:description>  In machine learning, error back-propagation in multi-layer neural networks
(deep learning) has been impressively successful in supervised and
reinforcement learning tasks. As a model for learning in the brain, however,
deep learning has long been regarded as implausible, since it relies in its
basic form on a non-local plasticity rule. To overcome this problem,
energy-based models with local contrastive Hebbian learning were proposed and
tested on a classification task with networks of rate neurons. We extended this
work by implementing and testing such a model with networks of leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons. Preliminary results indicate that it is possible to
learn a non-linear regression task with hidden layers, spiking neurons and a
local synaptic plasticity rule.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present a new dataset for computational humor, specifically
comparative humor ranking, which attempts to eschew the ubiquitous binary
approach to humor detection. The dataset consists of tweets that are humorous
responses to a given hashtag. We describe the motivation for this new dataset,
as well as the collection process, which includes a description of our
semi-automated system for data collection. We also present initial experiments
for this dataset using both unsupervised and supervised approaches. Our best
supervised system achieved 63.7% accuracy, suggesting that this task is much
more difficult than comparable humor detection tasks. Initial experiments
indicate that a character-level model is more suitable for this task than a
token-level model, likely due to a large amount of puns that can be captured by
a character-level model.

 <dc:title>Automatic Lymphocyte Detection in H&amp;E Images with Deep Neural Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Automatic detection of lymphocyte in H&amp;E images is a necessary first step in
lots of tissue image analysis algorithms. An accurate and robust automated
lymphocyte detection approach is of great importance in both computer science
and clinical studies. Most of the existing approaches for lymphocyte detection
are based on traditional image processing algorithms and/or classic machine
learning methods. In the recent years, deep learning techniques have
fundamentally transformed the way that a computer interprets images and have
become a matchless solution in various pattern recognition problems. In this
work, we design a new deep neural network model which extends the fully
convolutional network by combining the ideas in several recent techniques, such
as shortcut links. Also, we design a new training scheme taking the prior
knowledge about lymphocytes into consideration. The training scheme not only
efficiently exploits the limited amount of free-form annotations from
pathologists, but also naturally supports efficient fine-tuning. As a
consequence, our model has the potential of self-improvement by leveraging the
errors collected during real applications. Our experiments show that our deep
neural network model achieves good performance in the images of different
staining conditions or different types of tissues.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Scheduling for Delay Guarantees for Heterogeneous Cognitive
  Radio Users</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ewaisha, Ahmed</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tepedelenlioglu, Cihan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study an uplink multi secondary user (SU) system having statistical delay
constraints, and an average interference constraint to the primary user (PU).
SUs with heterogeneous interference channel statistics, to the PU, experience
heterogeneous delay performances since SUs causing low interference are
scheduled more frequently than those causing high interference. We propose a
scheduling algorithm that can provide arbitrary average delay guarantees to SUs
irrespective of their statistical channel qualities. We derive the algorithm
using the Lyapunov technique and show that it yields bounded queues and satisfy
the interference constraints. Using simulations, we show its superiority over
the Max-Weight algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Literature reviews can be time-consuming and tedious to complete. By
cataloging and refactoring three state-of-the-art active learning techniques
from evidence-based medicine and legal electronic discovery, this paper finds
and implements FASTREAD, a faster technique for studying a large corpus of
documents. This paper assesses FASTREAD using datasets generated from existing
SE literature reviews (Hall, Wahono, Radjenovic, Kitchenham et al.). Compared
to manual methods, FASTREAD lets researchers find 95% relevant studies after
reviewing an order of magnitude fewer papers. Compared to other
state-of-the-art automatic methods, FASTREAD reviews 20-50% fewer studies while
finding same number of relevant primary studies in a systematic literature
review.

 <dc:description>  Decision trees have been a very popular class of predictive models for
decades due to their interpretability and good performance on categorical
features. However, they are not always robust and tend to overfit the data.
Additionally, if allowed to grow large, they lose interpretability. In this
paper, we present a novel mixed integer programming formulation to construct
optimal decision trees of specified size. We take special structure of
categorical features into account and allow combinatorial decisions (based on
subsets of values of such a feature) at each node. We show that very good
accuracy can be achieved with small trees using moderately-sized training sets.
The optimization problems we solve are easily tractable with modern solvers.

 <dc:description>  In training speech recognition systems, labeling audio clips can be
expensive, and not all data is equally valuable. Active learning aims to label
only the most informative samples to reduce cost. For speech recognition,
confidence scores and other likelihood-based active learning methods have been
shown to be effective. Gradient-based active learning methods, however, are
still not well-understood. This work investigates the Expected Gradient Length
(EGL) approach in active learning for end-to-end speech recognition. We justify
EGL from a variance reduction perspective, and observe that EGL's measure of
informativeness picks novel samples uncorrelated with confidence scores.
Experimentally, we show that EGL can reduce word errors by 11\%, or
alternatively, reduce the number of samples to label by 50\%, when compared to
random sampling.

 <dc:description>  We study an uplink multi secondary user (SU) cognitive radio system suffering
statistical heterogeneity among SUs' channels. This heterogeneity may result in
differentiated delay performances to these SUs and result in harmful
interference to the PU. We first derive an explicit closed-form expression for
the average delay in terms of an arbitrary power-control policy. Then, we
propose a delay-optimal closed-form scheduling and power-control policy that
can provide the required average delay guarantees to all SUs besides protecting
the PU from harmful interference. We support our findings by extensive system
simulations and show that it outperforms existing policies substantially.

 <dc:description>  With the ever-increasing scientific literature, there is a need on a natural
language interface to bibliographic information retrieval systems to retrieve
related information effectively. In this paper, we propose a natural language
interface, NLI-GIBIR, to a graph-based bibliographic information retrieval
system. In designing NLI-GIBIR, we developed a novel framework that can be
applicable to graph-based bibliographic information retrieval systems. Our
framework integrates algorithms/heuristics for interpreting and analyzing
natural language bibliographic queries. NLI-GIBIR allows users to search for a
variety of bibliographic data through natural language. A series of text- and
linguistic-based techniques are used to analyze and answer natural language
queries, including tokenization, named entity recognition, and syntactic
analysis. We find that our framework can effectively represents and addresses
complex bibliographic information needs. Thus, the contributions of this paper
are as follows: First, to our knowledge, it is the first attempt to propose a
natural language interface to graph-based bibliographic information retrieval.
Second, we propose a novel customized natural language processing framework
that integrates a few original algorithms/heuristics for interpreting and
analyzing natural language bibliographic queries. Third, we show that the
proposed framework and natural language interface provide a practical solution
in building real-world natural language interface-based bibliographic
information retrieval systems. Our experimental results show that the presented
system can correctly answer 39 out of 40 example natural language queries with
varying lengths and complexities.

 <dc:title>The Team Surviving Orienteers Problem: Routing Robots in Uncertain

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the following multi-robot coordination problem: given
a graph, where each edge is weighted by the probability of surviving while
traversing it, find a set of paths for $K$ robots that maximizes the expected
number of nodes collectively visited, subject to constraints on the probability
that each robot survives to its destination. We call this problem the Team
Surviving Orienteers (TSO) problem. The TSO problem is motivated by scenarios
where a team of robots must traverse a dangerous, uncertain environment, such
as aid delivery in disaster or war zones. We present the TSO problem formally
along with several variants, which represent &quot;survivability-aware&quot; counterparts
for a wide range of multi-robot coordination problems such as vehicle routing,
patrolling, and informative path planning. We propose an approximate greedy
approach for selecting paths, and prove that the value of its output is bounded
within a factor $1-e^{-p_s/\lambda}$ of the optimum where $p_s$ is the
per-robot survival probability threshold, and $1/\lambda \le 1$ is the
approximation factor of an oracle routine for the well-known orienteering
problem. Our approach has linear time complexity in the team size and
polynomial complexity in the graph size. Using numerical simulations, we verify
that our approach is close to the optimum in practice and that it scales to
problems with hundreds of nodes and tens of robots.

 <dc:description>  Co-localization is the problem of localizing objects of the same class using
only the set of images that contain them. This is a challenging task because
the object detector must be built without negative examples that can lead to
more informative supervision signals. The main idea of our method is to cluster
the feature space of a generically pre-trained CNN, to find a set of CNN
features that are consistently and highly activated for an object category,
which we call category-consistent CNN features. Then, we propagate their
combined activation map using superpixel geodesic distances for
co-localization. In our first set of experiments, we show that the proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three related benchmarks:
PASCAL 2007, PASCAL-2012, and the Object Discovery dataset. We also show that
our method is able to detect and localize truly unseen categories, on six
held-out ImageNet categories with accuracy that is significantly higher than
previous state-of-the-art. Our intuitive approach achieves this success without
any region proposals or object detectors, and can be based on a CNN that was
pre-trained purely on image classification tasks without further fine-tuning.

 <dc:description>  We consider the stabilization of an unstable discrete-time linear system that
is observed over a channel corrupted by continuous multiplicative noise. Our
main result shows that if the system growth is large enough, then the system
cannot be stabilized in a second-moment sense. This is done by showing that the
probability that the state magnitude remains bounded must go to zero with time.
Our proof technique recursively bounds the conditional density of the system
state (instead of focusing on the second moment) to bound the progress the
controller can make. This sidesteps the difficulty encountered in using the
standard data-rate theorem style approach; that approach does not work because
the mutual information per round between the system state and the observation
is potentially unbounded.
  It was known that a system with multiplicative observation noise can be
stabilized using a simple memoryless linear strategy if the system growth is
suitably bounded. In this paper, we show that while memory cannot improve the
performance of a linear scheme, a simple non-linear scheme that uses one-step
memory can do better than the best linear scheme.

 <dc:title>Impacts of Bad ESP (Early Size Predictions) on Software Effort
  Estimation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mathew, George</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Menzies, Tim</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hihn, Jairus</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Context: Early size predictions (ESP) can lead to errors in effort
predictions for software projects. This problem is particular acute in
parametric effort models that give extra weight to size factors (for example,
the COCOMO model assumes that effort is exponentially proportional to project
size).
  Objective: Are effort estimates crippled by bad ESP?
  Method: Document inaccuracies in early size estimates. Using those error
sizes to determine the implications of those inaccuracies via an Monte Carlo
perturbation analysis of effort models and an analysis of the equations used in
those effort models.
  Results: While many projects have errors in ESP of up to +/- 100%, those
errors add very little to the overall effort estimate error. Specifically, we
find no statistically significant difference in the estimation errors seen
after increasing ESP errors from 0 to +/- 100%. An analysis of effort
estimation models explains why this is so: the net additional impact of ESP
error is relatively small compared to the other sources of error associated
within estimation models.
  Conclusion: ESP errors effect effort estimates by a relatively minor amount.
As soon as a model uses a size estimate and other factors to predict project
effort, then ESP errors are not crippling to the process of estimation.

 <dc:description>  Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging
problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples
generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning
of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid
object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks
(StackGAN) to generate 256x256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text
descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems
through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive
shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding
Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text
descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with
photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and
add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of
the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we
introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages
smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and
comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic
images conditioned on text descriptions.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of planning paths for a team of robots for visually
monitoring an environment. Our work is motivated by surveillance and persistent
monitoring applications. We are given a set of target points in a polygonal
environment that must be monitored using robots with cameras. The goal is to
compute paths for all robots such that every target is visible from at least
one path. In its general form, this problem is NP-hard as it generalizes the
Art Gallery Problem and the Watchman Route Problem. We study two versions: (i)
a geometric version in \emph{street polygons} for which we give a polynomial
time $4$--approximation algorithm; and (ii) a general version for which we
present a practical solution that finds the optimal solution in possibly
exponential time. In addition to theoretical proofs, we also present results
from simulation studies.

 <dc:title>Parameter Estimation of a Nonlinear Burgers Model using Nanoindentation
  and Finite Element-based Inverse Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Nanoindentation involves probing a hard diamond tip into a material, where
the load and the displacement experienced by the tip is recorded continuously.
This load-displacement data is a direct function of material's innate
stress-strain behavior. Thus, theoretically it is possible to extract
mechanical properties of a material through nanoindentation. However, due to
various nonlinearities associated with nanoindentation the process of
interpreting load-displacement data into material properties is difficult.
Although, simple elastic behavior can be characterized easily, a method to
characterize complicated material behavior such as nonlinear viscoelasticity is
still lacking. In this study, a nanoindentation-based material characterization
technique is developed to characterize soft materials exhibiting nonlinear
viscoelasticity. Nanoindentation experiment was modeled in finite element
analysis software (ABAQUS), where a nonlinear viscoelastic behavior was
incorporated using user-defined subroutine (UMAT). The model parameters were
calibrated using a process called inverse analysis. In this study, a surrogate
model-based approach was used for the inverse analysis. The different factors
affecting the surrogate model performance are analyzed in order to optimize the
performance with respect to the computational cost.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by recent research, we explore ways to model the highly
morphological Finnish language at the level of characters while maintaining the
performance of word-level models. We propose a new
Character-to-Word-to-Character (C2W2C) compositional language model that uses
characters as input and output while still internally processing word level
embeddings. Our preliminary experiments, using the Finnish Europarl V7 corpus,
indicate that C2W2C can respond well to the challenges of morphologically rich
languages such as high out of vocabulary rates, the prediction of novel words,
and growing vocabulary size. Notably, the model is able to correctly score
inflectional forms that are not present in the training data and sample
grammatically and semantically correct Finnish sentences character by
character.

 <dc:description>  We present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network architecture which serves as a
generic image-to-image regressor that can be trained end-to-end without any
further machinery. Our proposed architecture: the Recursively Branched
Deconvolutional Network (RBDN) develops a cheap multi-context image
representation very early on using an efficient recursive branching scheme with
extensive parameter sharing and learnable upsampling. This multi-context
representation is subjected to a highly non-linear locality preserving
transformation by the remainder of our network comprising of a series of
convolutions/deconvolutions without any spatial downsampling. The RBDN
architecture is fully convolutional and can handle variable sized images during
inference. We provide qualitative/quantitative results on $3$ diverse tasks:
relighting, denoising and colorization and show that our proposed RBDN
architecture obtains comparable results to the state-of-the-art on each of
these tasks when used off-the-shelf without any post processing or
task-specific architectural modifications.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system equipped with a base station (BS) that uses one-bit quantization
and investigates the energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE)
trade-off. We first propose a new precoding scheme and downlink power
allocation strategy that results in uplink-downlink SINR duality for one-bit
MIMO systems. Taking into account the effect of the imperfect channel state
information, we obtain approximate closed-form expressions for the uplink and
downlink achievable rates under duality with maximum ratio
combining/matched-filter and zero-forcing processing. We then focus on joint
optimization of the competing SE and EE objectives over the number of users,
pilot training duration and operating power, using the weighted product method
to obtain the EE/SE Pareto boundary. Numerical results are presented to verify
our analytical resultsand demonstrate the fundamental tradeoff between EE and
SE for different parameter settings.

 <dc:title>Towards an Automated Image De-fencing Algorithm Using Sparsity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Conventional approaches to image de-fencing suffer from non-robust fence
detection and are limited to processing images of static scenes. In this
position paper, we propose an automatic de-fencing algorithm for images of
dynamic scenes. We divide the problem of image de-fencing into the tasks of
automated fence detection, motion estimation and fusion of data from multiple
frames of a captured video of the dynamic scene. Fences are detected
automatically using two approaches, namely, employing Gabor filter and a
machine learning method. We cast the fence removal problem in an optimization
framework, by modeling the formation of the degraded observations. The inverse
problem is solved using split Bregman technique assuming total variation of the
de-fenced image as the regularization constraint.

 <dc:description>  Understanding and analyzing big data is firmly recognized as a powerful and
strategic priority. For deeper interpretation of and better intelligence with
big data, it is important to transform raw data (unstructured, semi-structured
and structured data sources, e.g., text, video, image data sets) into curated
data: contextualized data and knowledge that is maintained and made available
for use by end-users and applications. In particular, data curation acts as the
glue between raw data and analytics, providing an abstraction layer that
relieves users from time consuming, tedious and error prone curation tasks. In
this context, the data curation process becomes a vital analytics asset for
increasing added value and insights.
  In this paper, we identify and implement a set of curation APIs and make them
available (on GitHub) to researchers and developers to assist them transforming
their raw data into curated data. The curation APIs enable developers to easily
add features - such as extracting keyword, part of speech, and named entities
such as Persons, Locations, Organizations, Companies, Products, Diseases,
Drugs, etc.; providing synonyms and stems for extracted information items
leveraging lexical knowledge bases for the English language such as WordNet;
linking extracted entities to external knowledge bases such as Google Knowledge
Graph and Wikidata; discovering similarity among the extracted information
items, such as calculating similarity between string, number, date and time
data; classifying, sorting and categorizing data into various types, forms or
any other distinct class; and indexing structured and unstructured data - into
their applications.

 <dc:description>  In this article we present a construction of error correcting codes, that
have representation as very sparse matrices and belong to the class of Low
Density Parity Check Codes. LDPC codes are in the classical Hamming metric.
They are very close to well known Shannon bound. The ability to use graphs for
code construction was first discussed by Tanner in 1981 and has been used in a
number of very effective implementations. We describe how to construct such
codes by using special a family of graphs introduced by Ustimenko and Woldar.
Graphs that we used are bipartite, bi-regular, very sparse and do not have
short cycles C 4 . Due to the very low density of such graphs, the obtained
codes are fast decodable. We describe how to choose parameters to obtain a
desired code rate. We also show results of computer simulations of BER (bit
error rate) of the obtained codes in order to compare them with other known
LDPC codes.

 <dc:description>  Random walks are ubiquitous in the sciences, and they are interesting from
both theoretical and practical perspectives. They are one of the most
fundamental types of stochastic processes; can be used to model numerous
phenomena, including diffusion, interactions, and opinions among humans and
animals; and can be used to extract information about important entities or
dense groups of entities in a network. Random walks have been studied for many
decades on both regular lattices and (especially in the last couple of decades)
on networks with a variety of structures. In the present article, we survey the
theory and applications of random walks on networks, restricting ourselves to
simple cases of single and non-adaptive random walkers. We distinguish three
main types of random walks: discrete-time random walks, node-centric
continuous-time random walks, and edge-centric continuous-time random walks. We
first briefly survey random walks on a line, and then we consider random walks
on various types of networks. We extensively discuss applications of random
walks, including ranking of nodes (e.g., PageRank), community detection,
respondent-driven sampling, and opinion models such as voter models.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we establish a novel bottom-up cue named Convex Hull Overlap
(CHO), and then propose an effective approach to detect salient regions using
the combination of the CHO cue and global contrast cue. Our scheme
significantly differs from other earlier work in: 1) The hierarchical
segmentation model based on Normalized Graph-Cut fits the splitting and merging
processes in human visual perception; 2) Previous work only focuses on color
and texture cues, while our CHO cue makes up the obvious gap between the
spatial region covering and the region saliency. CHO is a kind of improved and
enhanced Gestalt cue, while other popular figure-ground cues such as convexity
and surroundedness can be regarded as the special cases of CHO. Our experiments
on a large number of public data have obtained very positive results.

 <dc:creator>Waltman, Ludo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this comment, I discuss the use of statistical inference in citation
analysis. In a recent paper, Williams and Bornmann argue in favor of the use of
statistical inference in citation analysis. I present a critical analysis of
their arguments and of similar arguments provided elsewhere in the literature.
My conclusion is that the use of statistical inference in citation analysis
involves major conceptual difficulties and, consequently, that the usefulness
of statistical inference in citation analysis is highly questionable.

 <dc:description>  We present a compressed data structure to store free trajectories of moving
objects (ships over the sea, for example) allowing spatio-temporal queries. Our
method, GraCT, uses a $k^2$-tree to store the absolute positions of all objects
at regular time intervals (snapshots), whereas the positions between snapshots
are represented as logs of relative movements compressed with Re-Pair. Our
experimental evaluation shows important savings in space and time with respect
to a fair baseline.

 <dc:description>  Android, the most popular mobile OS, has around 78% of the mobile market
share. Due to its popularity, it attracts many malware attacks. In fact, people
have discovered around one million new malware samples per quarter, and it was
reported that over 98% of these new malware samples are in fact &quot;derivatives&quot;
(or variants) from existing malware families. In this paper, we first show that
runtime behaviors of malware's core functionalities are in fact similar within
a malware family. Hence, we propose a framework to combine &quot;runtime behavior&quot;
with &quot;static structures&quot; to detect malware variants. We present the design and
implementation of MONET, which has a client and a backend server module. The
client module is a lightweight, in-device app for behavior monitoring and
signature generation, and we realize this using two novel interception
techniques. The backend server is responsible for large scale malware
detection. We collect 3723 malware samples and top 500 benign apps to carry out
extensive experiments of detecting malware variants and defending against
malware transformation. Our experiments show that MONET can achieve around 99%
accuracy in detecting malware variants. Furthermore, it can defend against 10
different obfuscation and transformation techniques, while only incurs around
7% performance overhead and about 3% battery overhead. More importantly, MONET
will automatically alert users with intrusion details so to prevent further
malicious behaviors.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the need to reason about hybrid systems, we study limits in
categories of coalgebras whose underlying functor is a Vietoris polynomial one
- intuitively, the topological analogue of a Kripke polynomial functor. Among
other results, we prove that every Vietoris polynomial functor admits a final
coalgebra if it respects certain conditions concerning separation axioms and
compactness. When the functor is restricted to some of the categories induced
by these conditions the resulting categories of coalgebras are even complete.
As a practical application, we use these developments in the specification and
analysis of non-deterministic hybrid systems, in particular to obtain suitable
notions of stability, and behaviour.

 <dc:description>  Prediction in a small-sized sample with a large number of covariates, the
&quot;small n, large p&quot; problem, is challenging. This setting is encountered in
multiple applications, such as precision medicine, where obtaining additional
samples can be extremely costly or even impossible, and extensive research
effort has recently been dedicated to finding principled solutions for accurate
prediction. However, a valuable source of additional information, domain
experts, has not yet been efficiently exploited. We formulate knowledge
elicitation generally as a probabilistic inference process, where expert
knowledge is sequentially queried to improve predictions. In the specific case
of sparse linear regression, where we assume the expert has knowledge about the
values of the regression coefficients or about the relevance of the features,
we propose an algorithm and computational approximation for fast and efficient
interaction, which sequentially identifies the most informative features on
which to query expert knowledge. Evaluations of our method in experiments with
simulated and real users show improved prediction accuracy already with a small
effort from the expert.

 <dc:description>  We consider the following single-machine scheduling problem, which is often
denoted $1||\sum f_{j}$: we are given $n$ jobs to be scheduled on a single
machine, where each job $j$ has an integral processing time $p_j$, and there is
a nondecreasing, nonnegative cost function $f_j(C_{j})$ that specifies the cost
of finishing $j$ at time $C_{j}$; the objective is to minimize $\sum_{j=1}^n
f_j(C_j)$. Bansal \&amp; Pruhs recently gave the first constant approximation
algorithm with a performance guarantee of 16. We improve on this result by
giving a primal-dual pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm based on the recently
introduced knapsack-cover inequalities. The algorithm finds a schedule of cost
at most four times the constructed dual solution. Although we show that this
bound is tight for our algorithm, we leave open the question of whether the
integrality gap of the LP is less than 4. Finally, we show how the technique
can be adapted to yield, for any $\epsilon &gt;0$, a $(4+\epsilon )$-approximation
algorithm for this problem.

 <dc:description>  We present a deterministic oblivious LIFO (Stack), FIFO, double-ended and
double-ended priority queue as well as an oblivious mergesort and quicksort
algorithm. Our techniques and ideas include concatenating queues end-to-end,
size balancing of multiple arrays, several multi-level partitionings of an
array. Our queues are the first to enable executions of pop and push operations
without any change of the data structure (controlled by a parameter). This
enables interesting applications in computing on encrypted data such as hiding
confidential expressions. Mergesort becomes practical using our LIFO queue, ie.
it improves prior work (STOC '14) by a factor of (more than) 1000 in terms of
comparisons for all practically relevant queue sizes. We are the first to
present double-ended (priority) and LIFO queues as well as oblivious quicksort
which is asymptotically optimal. Aside from theortical analysis, we also
provide an empirical evaluation of all queues.

 <dc:title>Obfuscation using Encryption</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Protecting source code against reverse engineering and theft is an important
problem. The goal is to carry out computations using confidential algorithms on
an untrusted party while ensuring confidentiality of algorithms. This problem
has been addressed for Boolean circuits known as `circuit privacy'. Circuits
corresponding to real-world programs are impractical. Well-known obfuscation
techniques are highly practicable, but provide only limited security, e.g., no
piracy protection. In this work, we modify source code yielding programs with
adjustable performance and security guarantees ranging from
indistinguishability obfuscators to (non-secure) ordinary obfuscation. The idea
is to artificially generate `misleading' statements. Their results are combined
with the outcome of a confidential statement using encrypted \emph{selector
variables}. Thus, an attacker must `guess' the encrypted selector variables to
disguise the confidential source code. We evaluated our method using more than
ten programmers as well as pattern mining across open source code repositories
to gain insights of (micro-)coding patterns that are relevant for generating
misleading statements. The evaluation reveals that our approach is effective in
that it successfully preserves source code confidentiality.

 <dc:description>  The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a common
optimization tool for solving constrained and non-differentiable problems. We
provide an empirical study of the practical performance of ADMM on several
nonconvex applications, including l0 regularized linear regression, l0
regularized image denoising, phase retrieval, and eigenvector computation. Our
experiments suggest that ADMM performs well on a broad class of non-convex
problems. Moreover, recently proposed adaptive ADMM methods, which
automatically tune penalty parameters as the method runs, can improve algorithm
efficiency and solution quality compared to ADMM with a non-tuned penalty.

 <dc:description>  Modeling an ontology is a hard and time-consuming task. Although
methodologies are useful for ontologists to create good ontologies, they do not
help with the task of evaluating the quality of the ontology to be reused. For
these reasons, it is imperative to evaluate the quality of the ontology after
constructing it or before reusing it. Few studies usually present only a set of
criteria and questions, but no guidelines to evaluate the ontology. The effort
to evaluate an ontology is very high as there is a huge dependence on the
evaluator's expertise to understand the criteria and questions in depth.
Moreover, the evaluation is still very subjective. This study presents a novel
methodology for ontology evaluation, taking into account three fundamental
principles: i) it is based on the Goal, Question, Metric approach for empirical
evaluation; ii) the goals of the methodologies are based on the roles of
knowledge representations combined with specific evaluation criteria; iii) each
ontology is evaluated according to the type of ontology. The methodology was
empirically evaluated using different ontologists and ontologies of the same
domain. The main contributions of this study are: i) defining a step-by-step
approach to evaluate the quality of an ontology; ii) proposing an evaluation
based on the roles of knowledge representations; iii) the explicit difference
of the evaluation according to the type of the ontology iii) a questionnaire to
evaluate the ontologies; iv) a statistical model that automatically calculates
the quality of the ontologies.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We analyze limited feedback in systems where a multiple-antenna transmitter
sends signals to single-antenna receivers with finite-bit ADCs. If channel
state information (CSI) is not available with high resolution at the
transmitter and the precoding is not well designed, the inter-user interference
is a big decoding challenge for receivers with low-resolution quantization. In
this paper, we derive achievable rates with finite-bit ADCs and finite-bit CSI
feedback. The performance loss compared to the case with perfect CSI is then
analyzed. The results show that the number of bits per feedback should increase
linearly with the ADC resolution to restrict the loss.

 <dc:description>  Molecular Communication (MC) is a communication strategy that uses molecules
as carriers of information, and is widely used by biological cells. As an
interdisciplinary topic, it has been studied by biologists, communication
theorists and a growing number of information theorists. This paper aims to
specifically bring MC to the attention of information theorists. To do this, we
first highlight the unique mathematical challenges of studying the capacity of
molecular channels. Addressing these problems require use of known, or
development of new mathematical tools. Toward this goal, we review a subjective
selection of the existing literature on information theoretic aspect of
molecular communication. The emphasis here is on the mathematical techniques
used, rather than on the setup or modeling of a specific paper. Finally, as an
example, we propose a concrete information theoretic problem that was motivated
by our study of molecular communication.

 <dc:description>  Images typically are represented as uniformly sampled data in the form of
matrix of pixels/voxels. Therefore, matrix multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) forms
the core of most state-of-the-art image analysis algorithms. While digital
implementation of MAC has generally been the preferred approach, high power
consumption is an impediment to adopting it for medical image analysis. In this
work, we present a time-domain signal processing architecture which performs
MAC operations with 7bit accuracy while consuming 400X lower energy than
digital implementation. The proposed architecture performs analog computation
using mostly digital circuits and is suitable for scaled CMOS technologies. The
proposed time-domain MAC architecture is expected to play a central role in
empowering the advancement of various on-chip image analysis operations.

 <dc:description>  Understanding community structure in social media is critical due to its
broad applications such as friend recommendations, link predictions and
collaborative filtering. However, there is no widely accepted definition of
community in literature. Existing work use structure related metrics such as
modularity and function related metrics such as ground truth to measure the
performance of community detection algorithms, while ignoring an important
metric, size of the community. [1] suggests that the size of community with
strong ties in social media should be limited to 150. As we discovered in this
paper, the majority of the communities obtained by many popular community
detection algorithms are either very small or very large. Too small communities
don't have practical value and too large communities contain weak connections
therefore not stable. In this paper, we compare various community detection
algorithms considering the following metrics: size of the communities, coverage
of the communities, extended modularity, triangle participation ratio, and user
interest in the same community. We also propose a simple clique based algorithm
for community detection as a baseline for the comparison. Experimental results
show that both our proposed algorithm and the well-accepted disjoint algorithm
InfoMap perform well in all the metrics.

 <dc:description>  We introduce two information-theoretical invariants for the projective
unitary group acting on a finite-dimensional complex Hilbert space: PVM- and
POVM-dynamical (quantum) entropies. They quantify the randomness of the
successive quantum measurement results in the case where the evolution of the
system between each two consecutive measurements is described by a given
unitary operator. We study the class of chaotic unitaries, i.e., the ones of
maximal entropy or, equivalently, such that they can be represented by suitably
rescaled complex Hadamard matrices in some orthonormal bases. We provide
necessary conditions for a unitary operator to be chaotic, which become also
sufficient for qubits and qutrits. These conditions are expressed in terms of
the relation between the trace and the determinant of the operator. We also
compute the volume of the set of chaotic unitaries in dimensions two and three,
and the average PVM-dynamical entropy over the unitary group in dimension two.
We prove that this mean value behaves as the logarithm of the dimension of the
Hilbert space, which implies that the probability that the dynamical entropy of
a unitary is almost as large as possible approaches unity as the dimension
tends to infinity.

 <dc:description>  Sparsity-constrained optimization is an important and challenging problem
that has wide applicability in data mining, machine learning, and statistics.
In this paper, we focus on sparsity-constrained optimization in cases where the
cost function is a general nonlinear function and, in particular, the sparsity
constraint is defined by a graph-structured sparsity model. Existing methods
explore this problem in the context of sparse estimation in linear models. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present an efficient
approximation algorithm, namely, Graph-structured Matching Pursuit (Graph-Mp),
to optimize a general nonlinear function subject to graph-structured
constraints. We prove that our algorithm enjoys the strong guarantees analogous
to those designed for linear models in terms of convergence rate and
approximation accuracy. As a case study, we specialize Graph-Mp to optimize a
number of well-known graph scan statistic models for the connected subgraph
detection task, and empirical evidence demonstrates that our general algorithm
performs superior over state-of-the-art methods that are designed specifically
for the task of connected subgraph detection.

 <dc:description>  Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a form of weakly supervised learning
where training instances are arranged in sets, called bags, and a label is
provided for the entire bag. This formulation is gaining interest because it
naturally fits various problems and allows to leverage weakly labeled data.
Consequently, it has been used in diverse application fields such as computer
vision and document classification. However, learning from bags raises
important challenges that are unique to MIL. This paper provides a
comprehensive survey of the characteristics which define and differentiate the
types of MIL problems. Until now, these problem characteristics have not been
formally identified and described. As a result, the variations in performance
of MIL algorithms from one data set to another are difficult to explain. In
this paper, MIL problem characteristics are grouped into four broad categories:
the composition of the bags, the types of data distribution, the ambiguity of
instance labels, and the task to be performed. Methods specialized to address
each category are reviewed. Then, the extent to which these characteristics
manifest themselves in key MIL application areas are described. Finally,
experiments are conducted to compare the performance of 16 state-of-the-art MIL
methods on selected problem characteristics. This paper provides insight on how
the problem characteristics affect MIL algorithms, recommendations for future
benchmarking and promising avenues for research.

 <dc:description>  In recent years governments have shown themselves willing to impose blackouts
to shut off key communication infrastructure during times of civil strife, and
to surveil citizen communications whenever possible. However, it is exactly
during such strife that citizens need reliable and anonymous communications the
most. In this paper, we present Rangzen, a system for anonymous broadcast
messaging during network blackouts. Rangzen is distinctive in both aim and
design. Our aim is to provide an anonymous, one-to-many messaging layer that
requires only users' smartphones and can withstand network-level attacks. Our
design is a delay-tolerant mesh network which deprioritizes adversarial
messages by means of a social graph while preserving user anonymity. We built a
complete implementation that runs on Android smartphones, present benchmarks of
its performance and battery usage, and present simulation results suggesting
Rangzen's efficacy at scale.

 <dc:description>  There is a trend to acquire high accuracy land-cover maps using multi-source
classification methods, most of which are based on data fusion, especially
pixel- or feature-level fusions. A probabilistic graphical model (PGM) approach
is proposed in this research for 30 m resolution land-cover mapping with
multi-temporal Landsat and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) data. Independent classifiers were applied to two single-date Landsat 8
scenes and the MODIS time-series data, respectively, for probability
estimation. A PGM was created for each pixel in Landsat 8 data. Conditional
probability distributions were computed based on data quality and reliability
by using information selectively. Using the administrative territory of Beijing
City (Area-1) and a coastal region of Shandong province, China (Area-2) as
study areas, multiple land-cover maps were generated for comparison.
Quantitative results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall
accuracies promoted from 74.0% (maps acquired from single-temporal Landsat
images) to 81.8% (output of the PGM) for Area-1. Improvements can also be seen
when using MODIS data and only a single-temporal Landsat image as input
(overall accuracy: 78.4% versus 74.0% for Area-1, and 86.8% versus 83.0% for
Area-2). Information from MODIS data did not help much when the PGM was applied
to cloud free regions of. One of the advantages of the proposed method is that
it can be applied where multi-temporal data cannot be simply stacked as a
multi-layered image.

 <dc:title>A Novel Motion Detection Method Resistant to Severe Illumination Changes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently, there has been a considerable attention given to the motion
detection problem due to the explosive growth of its applications in video
analysis and surveillance systems. While the previous approaches can produce
good results, an accurate detection of motion remains a challenging task due to
the difficulties raised by illumination variations, occlusion, camouflage,
burst physical motion, dynamic texture, and environmental changes such as those
on climate changes, sunlight changes during a day, etc. In this paper, we
propose a novel per-pixel motion descriptor for both motion detection and
dynamic texture segmentation which outperforms the current methods in the
literature particularly in severe scenarios. The proposed descriptor is based
on two complementary three-dimensional-discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) and
three-dimensional wavelet leader. In this approach, a feature vector is
extracted for each pixel by applying a novel three dimensional wavelet-based
motion descriptor. Then, the extracted features are clustered by a clustering
method such as well-known k-means algorithm or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method
compared to the other motion detection approaches from the literature. The
application of the proposed method and additional experimental results for the
different datasets are available at
(http://dspl.ce.sharif.edu/motiondetector.html).

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a significant improvement of Quick Hypervolume
algorithm, one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for calculating exact
hypervolume of the space dominated by a set of d-dimensional points. This value
is often used as a quality indicator in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms

indicator is of crucial importance especially in the case of large sets or many
dimensional objective spaces. We use a similar divide and conquer scheme as in
the original Quick Hypervolume algorithm, but in our algorithm we split the
problem into smaller sub-problems in a different way. Through both theoretical
analysis and computational study we show that our approach improves
computational complexity of the algorithm and practical running times.

 <dc:description>  Spectral dimensionality reduction algorithms are widely used in numerous
domains, including for recognition, segmentation, tracking and visualization.
However, despite their popularity, these algorithms suffer from a major
limitation known as the &quot;repeated Eigen-directions&quot; phenomenon. That is, many
of the embedding coordinates they produce typically capture the same direction
along the data manifold. This leads to redundant and inefficient
representations that do not reveal the true intrinsic dimensionality of the
data. In this paper, we propose a general method for avoiding redundancy in
spectral algorithms. Our approach relies on replacing the orthogonality
constraints underlying those methods by unpredictability constraints.
Specifically, we require that each embedding coordinate be unpredictable (in
the statistical sense) from all previous ones. We prove that these constraints
necessarily prevent redundancy, and provide a simple technique to incorporate
them into existing methods. As we illustrate on challenging high-dimensional
scenarios, our approach produces significantly more informative and compact
representations, which improve visualization and classification tasks.

dataset of high-resolution images. The computational cost of the sensitivity
analysis process can be very high, because the process requires processing the
input dataset several times to systematically evaluate how output varies when
input parameters are varied. Thus, high performance computing techniques are
required to quickly execute the sensitivity analysis process.
  Results: We carried out an empirical evaluation of the proposed method on
high performance computing clusters with multi-core CPUs and co-processors
(GPUs and Intel Xeon Phis). Our results show that (1) the framework achieves
excellent scalability and efficiency on a high performance computing cluster --
execution efficiency remained above 85% in all experiments; (2) the parameter
auto-tuning methods are able to converge by visiting only a small fraction
(0.0009%) of the search space with limited impact to the algorithm output
(0.56% on average).
  Conclusions: The sensitivity analysis framework provides a range of
strategies for the efficient exploration of the parameter space, as well as
multiple indexes to evaluate the effect of parameter modification to outputs or
even correlation between parameters. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of
performing sensitivity analyses, parameter studies, and auto-tuning with large
datasets with the use of high-performance systems and techniques. The proposed
technologies will enable the quantification of error estimations and output
variations in these pipelines, which may be used in application specific ways
to assess uncertainty of conclusions extracted from data generated by these
image analysis pipelines.

 <dc:title>A Model of Multi-Agent Consensus for Vague and Uncertain Beliefs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Consensus formation is investigated for multi-agent systems in which agents'
beliefs are both vague and uncertain. Vagueness is represented by a third truth
state meaning \emph{borderline}. This is combined with a probabilistic model of
uncertainty. A belief combination operator is then proposed which exploits
borderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach a
compromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out in which agents
apply this operator in pairwise interactions, under the bounded confidence
restriction that the two agents' beliefs must be sufficiently consistent with
each other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying the consensus
operator in isolation we also investigate scenarios in which agents are
influenced either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the
former we conduct simulations which combine consensus formation with belief
updating based on evidence. For the latter we investigate the effect of
assuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible
they are in the consensus building process. In all cases applying the consensus
operators results in the population converging to a single shared belief which
is both crisp and certain. Furthermore, simulations which combine consensus
formation with evidential updating converge faster to a shared opinion which is
closer to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only
changed as a result of directly receiving new evidence. Finally, if agent
interactions are guided by belief quality measured as similarity to the true
state of the world, then applying the consensus operator alone results in the
population converging to a high quality shared belief.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic gradient descent~(SGD) and its variants have attracted much
attention in machine learning due to their efficiency and effectiveness for
optimization. To handle large-scale problems, researchers have recently
proposed several lock-free strategy based parallel SGD~(LF-PSGD) methods for
multi-core systems. However, existing works have only proved the convergence of
these LF-PSGD methods for convex problems. To the best of our knowledge, no
work has proved the convergence of the LF-PSGD methods for non-convex problems.
In this paper, we provide the theoretical proof about the convergence of two
representative LF-PSGD methods, Hogwild! and AsySVRG, for non-convex problems.
Empirical results also show that both Hogwild! and AsySVRG are convergent on
non-convex problems, which successfully verifies our theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) MAC protocols are known to suffer from
the hidden station (HS) problem. The complete mathematical analysis of CSMA
networks with HSs is still an open problem, even for broadcast communication
with a simple linear network topology. In this paper we address this challenge
by introducing a MAC layer modeling methodology based on time- and space-domain
Markov processes. Using this methodology we derive the closed-form solution for
the steady-state performance in infinite one-dimensional (1-D) CSMA networks
with HSs. The analytical results are validated by simulation and establish
that: 1) under the assumption of fixed frame duration, if the conditional
channel access probability at each station exceeds a certain threshold, the
CSMA system enters the status of &quot;synchronized transmissions&quot;, where a large
number of adjacent stations transmit in overlap and interfere each other
resulting in null system goodput. 2) The maximum system goodput of CSMA
broadcast communication increases with increased station density but becomes
increasingly sensitive to the conditional channel access probability. In [25]
we validate the analytical results gained in this paper by simulation of a
multi-lane highway scenario, and provide quantitative guidance for congestion
control algorithms in vehicular networks.

 <dc:description>  The Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) algorithms specified in ETSI ITS
standards [1] address the IEEE 802.11p MAC and provide reliability of periodic
broadcast messages at high density of vehicles. However, the deterministic
relation between controllable parameters, e.g. transmit power, frame duration,
frame transmit rate and channel clear assessment threshold, and the effects of
DCC algorithms, e.g. channel busy duration, frame interference-free reception
probability and frame channel access delay, is still unknown since a correct
mathematical analysis of the hidden station problem in CSMA networks is
lacking. In this work, the hidden station problem in a linear IEEE 802.11p
broadcast network is analyzed based on analytical results developed in [18]
employing a modified MAC protocol model based on [3]. Simulation results
validate the new analytical model for linear IEEE 802.11p networks w.r.t
reliability and latency performances of Cooperative Awareness Message
broadcast. Evidence is given that the model not only is valid for single-lane
highways but also provides good approximate results for multi-lane highway
scenarios. Our MAC layer analytical model of IEEE 802.11p broadcast reveals the
quantitative relation between DCC parameters and congestion control effects in
closed-form solution for linear vehicular networks.

 <dc:description>  Sparsity-based subspace clustering algorithms have attracted significant
attention thanks to their excellent performance in practical applications. A
prominent example is the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm by
Elhamifar and Vidal, which performs spectral clustering based on an adjacency
matrix obtained by sparsely representing each data point in terms of all the
other data points via the Lasso. When the number of data points is large or the
dimension of the ambient space is high, the computational complexity of SSC
quickly becomes prohibitive. Dyer et al. observed that SSC-OMP obtained by
replacing the Lasso by the greedy orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm
results in significantly lower computational complexity, while often yielding
comparable performance. The central goal of this paper is an analytical
performance characterization of SSC-OMP for noisy data. Moreover, we introduce
and analyze the SSC-MP algorithm, which employs matching pursuit (MP) in lieu
of OMP. Both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are proven to succeed even when the subspaces
intersect and when the data points are contaminated by severe noise. The
clustering conditions we obtain for SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are similar to those for
SSC and for the thresholding-based subspace clustering (TSC) algorithm due to
Heckel and B\&quot;olcskei. Analytical results in combination with numerical results
indicate that both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP with a data-dependent stopping criterion
automatically detect the dimensions of the subspaces underlying the data.
Moreover, experiments on synthetic and real data show that SSC-MP compares very
favorably to SSC, SSC-OMP, TSC, and the nearest subspace neighbor (NSN)
algorithm, both in terms of clustering performance and running time. In
addition, we find that, in contrast to SSC-OMP, the performance of SSC-MP is
very robust with respect to the choice of parameters in the stopping criteria.

 <dc:description>  The explosive wireless data service requirement accompanied with carbon
dioxide emission and consumption of traditional energy has put pressure on both
industry and academia. Wireless networks powered with the uneven and
intermittent generated renewable energy have been widely researched and lead to
a new research paradigm called green communication. In this paper, we
comprehensively consider the total generated renewable energy, QoS requirement
and channel quality, then propose a utility based renewable energy allocation
policy. The utility here means the satisfaction degree of users with a certain
amount allocated renewable energy. The energy allocation problem is formulated
as a constraint optimization problem and a heuristic algorithm with low
complexity is derived to solve the raised problem. Numerical results show that
the renewable energy allocation policy is applicable for any situation. When
the renewable energy is very scarce, only users with good channel quality can
achieve allocated energy.

 <dc:description>  We consider rate-distortion with two decoders, each with distinct side
information. This problem is well understood when the side information at the
decoders satisfies a certain degradedness condition. We consider cases in which
this degradedness condition is violated but the source and the side information
consist of jointly Gaussian vectors. We provide a hierarchy of four lower
bounds on the optimal rate. These bounds are then used to determine the optimal
rate for several classes of instances.

 <dc:description>  We study discrete logarithms in the setting of group actions. Suppose that
$G$ is a group that acts on a set $S$. When $r,s \in S$, a solution $g \in G$
to $r^g = s$ can be thought of as a kind of logarithm. In this paper, we study
the case where $G = S_n$, and develop analogs to the Shanks baby-step /
giant-step procedure for ordinary discrete logarithms. Specifically, we compute
two sets $A, B \subseteq S_n$ such that every permutation of $S_n$ can be
written as a product $ab$ of elements $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Our
deterministic procedure is optimal up to constant factors, in the sense that
$A$ and $B$ can be computed in optimal asymptotic complexity, and $|A|$ and
$|B|$ are a small constant from $\sqrt{n!}$ in size. We also analyze randomized
&quot;collision&quot; algorithms for the same problem.

 <dc:description>  Consus is a strictly serializable geo-replicated transactional key-value
store. The key contribution of Consus is a new commit protocol that reduces the
cost of executing a transaction to three wide area message delays in the common
case. Augmenting the commit protocol are multiple Paxos implementations
optimized for different purposes. Together the different implementations and
optimizations comprise a cohesive system that provides low latency, high
availability, and strong guarantees. This paper describes the techniques
implemented in the open source release of Consus, and lays the groundwork for
evaluating Consus once the system implementation is sufficiently robust for a
thorough evaluation.

exponents. As an application, we study the special case where $\mathcal{A}$ is
a fixed real $n\times (n+3)$ matrix whose columns form the spectrum of an
$n$-variate exponential sum $g$ with fixed sign vector for its coefficients: We
prove that the number of possible isotopy types for the real zero set of $g$ is
$O(n^2)$. The best previous upper bound was $2^{O(n^4)}$. Along the way, we
also show that the singular loci of our generalized $\mathcal{A}$-discriminants
are images of low-degree algebraic sets under certain analytic maps.

 <dc:description>  We consider a rate-distortion problem with side information at multiple
decoders. Several upper and lower bounds have been proposed for this general
problem or special cases of it. We provide an upper bound for general instances
of this problem, which takes the form of a linear program, by utilizing random
binning and simultaneous decoding techniques and compare it with the existing
bounds. We also provide a lower bound for the general problem, which was
inspired by a linear-programming lower bound for index coding, and show that it
subsumes most of the lower bounds in literature. Using these upper and lower
bounds, we explicitly characterize the rate-distortion function of a problem
that can be seen as a Gaussian analogue of the &quot;odd-cycle&quot; index coding
problem.

 <dc:description>  Two multiplierless pruned 8-point discrete cosine transform (DCT)
approximation are presented. Both transforms present lower arithmetic
complexity than state-of-the-art methods. The performance of such new methods
was assessed in the image compression context. A JPEG-like simulation was
performed, demonstrating the adequateness and competitiveness of the introduced
methods. Digital VLSI implementation in CMOS technology was also considered.
Both presented methods were realized in Berkeley Emulation Engine (BEE3).

 <dc:description>  The importance of peer influence on consumer actions plays a vital role in
marketing efforts. However, peer influence effects are often confounded with
latent homophily, which are unobserved commonalities that drive friendship.
Understanding causality has become one of the pressing issues of current
research. We present an approach to explicitly account for various causal
influences. We implement a simulation framework to show the effectiveness of
two latent homophily proxies, latent coordinates and community membership, in
improving peer influence effect estimates on game downloads in a Japanese
social network website. We demonstrate that latent homophily proxies have no
significant improvement in peer influence effect bias in the available website
data.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) depends critically on the choice of reward
functions used to capture the de- sired behavior and constraints of a robot.
Usually, these are handcrafted by a expert designer and represent heuristics
for relatively simple tasks. Real world applications typically involve more
complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structure. In this paper we take
advantage of the expressive power of temporal logic (TL) to specify complex
rules the robot should follow, and incorporate domain knowledge into learning.
We propose Truncated Linear Temporal Logic (TLTL) as specifications language,
that is arguably well suited for the robotics applications, together with
quantitative semantics, i.e., robustness degree. We propose a RL approach to
learn tasks expressed as TLTL formulae that uses their associated robustness
degree as reward functions, instead of the manually crafted heuristics trying
to capture the same specifications. We show in simulated trials that learning
is faster and policies obtained using the proposed approach outperform the ones
learned using heuristic rewards in terms of the robustness degree, i.e., how
well the tasks are satisfied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed RL
approach in a toast-placing task learned by a Baxter robot.

 <dc:description>  Secure spontaneous authentication between devices worn at arbitrary location
on the same body is a challenging, yet unsolved problem. We propose BANDANA,
the first-ever implicit secure device-to-device authentication scheme for
devices worn on the same body. Our approach leverages instantaneous variation
in acceleration patterns from gait sequences to extract always-fresh secure
secrets. It enables secure spontaneous pairing of devices worn on the same body
or interacted with. The method is robust against noise in sensor readings and
active attackers. We demonstrate the robustness of BANDANA on two gait datasets
and discuss the discriminability of intra- and inter-body cases, robustness to
statistical bias, as well as possible attack scenarios.

 <dc:title>On Choosing Training and Testing Data for Supervised Algorithms in

 <dc:description>  Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is one of the most popular and successful
sensing modalities that has been investigated for landmine and subsurface
threat detection. Many of the detection algorithms applied to this task are
supervised and therefore require labeled examples of target and non-target data
for training. Training data most often consists of 2-dimensional images (or
patches) of GPR data, from which features are extracted, and provided to the
classifier during training and testing. Identifying desirable training and
testing locations to extract patches, which we term &quot;keypoints&quot;, is well
established in the literature. In contrast however, a large variety of
strategies have been proposed regarding keypoint utilization (e.g., how many of
the identified keypoints should be used at targets, or non-target, locations).
Given the variety keypoint utilization strategies that are available, it is
very unclear (i) which strategies are best, or (ii) whether the choice of
strategy has a large impact on classifier performance. We address these
questions by presenting a taxonomy of existing utilization strategies, and then
evaluating their effectiveness on a large dataset using many different
classifiers and features. We analyze the results and propose a new strategy,
called PatchSelect, which outperforms other strategies across all experiments.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a novel family of biologically plausible online algorithms for
reducing the dimensionality of streaming data has been derived from the
similarity matching principle. In these algorithms, the number of output
dimensions can be determined adaptively by thresholding the singular values of
the input data matrix. However, setting such threshold requires knowing the
magnitude of the desired singular values in advance. Here we propose online
algorithms where the threshold is self-calibrating based on the singular values
computed from the existing observations. To derive these algorithms from the
similarity matching cost function we propose novel regularizers. As before,
these online algorithms can be implemented by Hebbian/anti-Hebbian neural
networks in which the learning rule depends on the chosen regularizer. We
demonstrate both mathematically and via simulation the effectiveness of these
online algorithms in various settings.

 <dc:title>ManyDSL: A Host for Many Languages</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Domain-specific languages are becoming increasingly important. Almost every
application touches multiple domains. But how to define, use, and combine
multiple DSLs within the same application?
  The most common approach is to split the project along the domain boundaries
into multiple pieces and files. Each file is then compiled separately.
Alternatively, multiple languages can be embedded in a flexible host language:
within the same syntax a new domain semantic is provided. In this paper we
follow a less explored route of metamorphic languages. These languages are able
to modify their own syntax and semantics on the fly, thus becoming a more
flexible host for DSLs.
  Our language allows for dynamic creation of grammars and switching languages
where needed. We achieve this through a novel concept of Syntax-Directed
Execution. A language grammar includes semantic actions that are pieces of
functional code executed immediately during parsing. By avoiding additional
intermediate representation, connecting actions from different languages and
domains is greatly simplified. Still, actions can generate highly specialized
code though lambda encapsulation and Dynamic Staging.

 <dc:description>  We provide a brief technical description of an online platform for disease
monitoring, titled as the Flu Detector (fludetector.cs.ucl.ac.uk). Flu
Detector, in its current version (v.0.5), uses either Twitter or Google search
data in conjunction with statistical Natural Language Processing models to
estimate the rate of influenza-like illness in the population of England. Its
back-end is a live service that collects online data, utilises modern
technologies for large-scale text processing, and finally applies statistical
inference models that are trained offline. The front-end visualises the various
disease rate estimates. Notably, the models based on Google data achieve a high
level of accuracy with respect to the most recent four flu seasons in England
(2012/13 to 2015/16). This highlighted Flu Detector as having a great potential
of becoming a complementary source to the domestic traditional flu surveillance
schemes.

 <dc:description>  A cost effective approach to remote monitoring of protected areas such as
marine reserves and restricted naval waters is to use passive sonar to detect,
classify, localize, and track marine vessel activity (including small boats and
autonomous underwater vehicles). Cepstral analysis of underwater acoustic data
enables the time delay between the direct path arrival and the first multipath
arrival to be measured, which in turn enables estimation of the instantaneous
range of the source (a small boat). However, this conventional method is
limited to ranges where the Lloyd's mirror effect (interference pattern formed
between the direct and first multipath arrivals) is discernible. This paper
proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the joint
detection and ranging of broadband acoustic noise sources such as marine
vessels in conjunction with a data augmentation approach for improving network
performance in varied signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. Performance is
compared with a conventional passive sonar ranging method for monitoring marine
vessel activity using real data from a single hydrophone mounted above the sea
floor. It is shown that CNNs operating on cepstrum data are able to detect the
presence and estimate the range of transiting vessels at greater distances than
the conventional method.

 <dc:title>An Attention-Driven Approach of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel method of no-reference image quality
assessment (NR-IQA), which is to predict the perceptual quality score of a
given image without using any reference image. The proposed method harnesses
three functions (i) the visual attention mechanism, which affects many aspects
of visual perception including image quality assessment, however, is overlooked
in the NR-IQA literature. The method assumes that the fixation areas on an
image contain key information to the process of IQA. (ii) the robust averaging
strategy, which is a means \--- supported by psychology studies \--- to
integrating multiple/step-wise evidence to make a final perceptual judgment.
(iii) the multi-task learning, which is believed to be an effectual means to
shape representation learning and could result in a more generalized model.
  To exploit the synergy of the three, we consider the NR-IQA as a dynamic
perception process, in which the model samples a sequence of &quot;informative&quot;
areas and aggregates the information to learn a representation for the tasks of
jointly predicting the image quality score and the distortion type.
  The model learning is implemented by a reinforcement strategy, in which the
rewards of both tasks guide the learning of the optimal sampling policy to
acquire the &quot;task-informative&quot; image regions so that the predictions can be
made accurately and efficiently (in terms of the sampling steps). The
reinforcement learning is realized by a deep network with the policy gradient
method and trained through back-propagation.
  In experiments, the model is tested on the TID2008 dataset and it outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model is very efficient in
the sense that a small number of fixations are used in NR-IQA.

 <dc:title>On kernel design for regularized LTI system identification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Tianshi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are two key issues for the kernel-based regularization method: one is
how to design a suitable kernel to embed in the kernel the prior knowledge of
the LTI system to be identified, and the other one is how to tune the kernel
such that the resulting regularized impulse response estimator can achieve a
good bias-variance tradeoff. In this paper, we focus on the issue of kernel
design. Depending on the type of the prior knowledge, we propose two methods to
design kernels: one is from a machine learning perspective and the other one is
from a system theory perspective. We also provide analysis results for both
methods, which not only enhances our understanding for the existing kernels but
also directs the design of new kernels.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of phase retrieval from corrupted magnitude

recovered exactly from corrupted magnitude measurements $|\langle a_i, x_0
\rangle | + \eta_i, \quad i =1,2\ldots m$ with high probability for $m = O(n)$,
where $a_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are i.i.d standard Gaussian and $\eta \in
\mathbb{R}^m$ has fixed sparse support and is otherwise arbitrary, by using a
version of the PhaseMax algorithm augmented with slack variables subject to a
penalty. This linear programming formulation, which we call RobustPhaseMax,
operates in the natural parameter space, and our proofs rely on a direct
analysis of the optimality conditions using concentration inequalities.

 <dc:description>  Positive instance detection, especially for these in positive bags (true
positive instances, TPIs), plays a key role for multiple instance learning
(MIL) arising from a specific classification problem only provided with bag (a
set of instances) label information. However, most previous MIL methods on this
issue ignore the global similarity among positive instances and that negative
instances are non-i.i.d., usually resulting in the detection of TPI not precise
and sensitive to outliers. To the end, we propose a positive instance detection
via graph updating for multiple instance learning, called PIGMIL, to detect TPI
accurately. PIGMIL selects instances from working sets (WSs) of some working
bags (WBs) as positive candidate pool (PCP). The global similarity among
positive instances and the robust discrimination of instances of PCP from
negative instances are measured to construct the consistent similarity and
discrimination graph (CSDG). As a result, the primary goal (i.e. TPI detection)
is transformed into PCP updating, which is approximated efficiently by updating
CSDG with a random walk ranking algorithm and an instance updating strategy. At
last bags are transformed into feature representation vector based on the
identified TPIs to train a classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
high precision of PIGMIL's detection of TPIs and its excellent performance
compared to classic baseline MIL methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel neural network model for question answering,
the \emph{entity-based memory network}. It enhances neural networks' ability of
representing and calculating information over a long period by keeping records
of entities contained in text. The core component is a memory pool which
comprises entities' states. These entities' states are continuously updated
according to the input text. Questions with regard to the input text are used
to search the memory pool for related entities and answers are further
predicted based on the states of retrieved entities. Compared with previous
memory network models, the proposed model is capable of handling fine-grained
information and more sophisticated relations based on entities. We formulated
several different tasks as question answering problems and tested the proposed
model. Experiments reported satisfying results.

 <dc:description>  Visual attention plays an important role to understand images and
demonstrates its effectiveness in generating natural language descriptions of
images. On the other hand, recent studies show that language associated with an
image can steer visual attention in the scene during our cognitive process.
Inspired by this, we introduce a text-guided attention model for image
captioning, which learns to drive visual attention using associated captions.
For this model, we propose an exemplar-based learning approach that retrieves
from training data associated captions with each image, and use them to learn
attention on visual features. Our attention model enables to describe a
detailed state of scenes by distinguishing small or confusable objects
effectively. We validate our model on MS-COCO Captioning benchmark and achieve
the state-of-the-art performance in standard metrics.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate PN-sequences with ideal autocorrelation
property and the consequences of this property on the number of +1s and -1s and
run structure of sequences. We begin by discussing and surveying about the
length of PNsequences with ideal autocorrelation property. From our discussion
and survey we introduce circulant matrix representation of PN-sequence. Through
circulant matrix representation we obtain system of non-linear equations that
lead to ideal autocorrelation property. Rewriting PN-sequence and its
autocorrelation property in {0,1} leads to a definition based on Hamming weight
and Hamming distance and hence we can easily prove some results on the
PN-sequences with ideal autocorrelation property.

 <dc:description>  Systematic literature studies have received much attention in empirical
software engineering in recent years. They have become a powerful tool to
collect and structure reported knowledge in a systematic and reproducible way.
We distinguish systematic literature reviews to systematically analyze reported
evidence in depth, and systematic mapping studies to structure a field of
interest in a broader, usually quantified manner. Due to the rapidly increasing
body of knowledge in software engineering, researchers who want to capture the
published work in a domain often face an extensive amount of publications,
which need to be screened, rated for relevance, classified, and eventually
analyzed. Although there are several guidelines to conduct literature studies,
they do not yet help researchers coping with the specific difficulties
encountered in the practical application of these guidelines. In this article,
we present an experience-based guideline to aid researchers in designing
systematic literature studies with special emphasis on the data collection and
selection procedures. Our guideline aims at providing a blueprint for a
practical and pragmatic path through the plethora of currently available
practices and deliverables capturing the dependencies among the single steps.
The guideline emerges from various mapping studies and literature reviews
conducted by the authors and provides recommendations for the general study
design, data collection, and study selection procedures. Finally, we share our
experiences and lessons learned in applying the different practices of the
proposed guideline.

 <dc:title>Statistics of Visual Responses to Object Stimuli from Primate AIT

 <dc:description>  Cadieu et al. (Cadieu,2014) reported that deep neural networks(DNNs) could
rival the representation of primate inferotemporal cortex for object
recognition. Lehky et al. (Lehky,2011) provided a statistical analysis on
neural responses to object stimuli in primate AIT cortex. They found the
intrinsic dimensionality of object representations in AIT cortex is around 100
(Lehky,2014). Considering the outstanding performance of DNNs in object
recognition, it is worthwhile investigating whether the responses of DNN
neurons have similar response statistics to those of AIT neurons. Following
Lehky et al.'s works, we analyze the response statistics to image stimuli and
the intrinsic dimensionality of object representations of DNN neurons. Our
findings show in terms of kurtosis and Pareto tail index, the response
statistics on single-neuron selectivity and population sparseness of DNN
neurons are fundamentally different from those of IT neurons except some
special cases. By increasing the number of neurons and stimuli, the conclusions
could alter substantially. In addition, with the ascendancy of the
convolutional layers of DNNs, the single-neuron selectivity and population
sparseness of DNN neurons increase, indicating the last convolutional layer is
to learn features for object representations, while the following
fully-connected layers are to learn categorization features. It is also found
that a sufficiently large number of stimuli and neurons are necessary for
obtaining a stable dimensionality. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
analyze the response statistics of DNN neurons comparing with AIT neurons, and
our results provide not only some insights into the discrepancy of DNN neurons
with respect to IT neurons in object representation, but also shed some light
on possible outcomes of IT neurons when the number of recorded neurons and
stimuli is beyond the level in (Lehky,2011,2014).

 <dc:description>  Recent research has shown that the performance of search personalization
depends on the richness of user profiles which normally represent the user's
topical interests. In this paper, we propose a new embedding approach to
learning user profiles, where users are embedded on a topical interest space.
We then directly utilize the user profiles for search personalization.
Experiments on query logs from a major commercial web search engine demonstrate
that our embedding approach improves the performance of the search engine and
also achieves better search performance than other strong baselines.

 <dc:description>  In the trace reconstruction problem, an unknown bit string $x \in \{0,1\}^n$
is observed through the deletion channel, which deletes each bit of $x$ with
some constant probability $q$, yielding a contracted string $\widetilde{x}$.
How many independent copies of $\widetilde{x}$ are needed to reconstruct $x$
with high probability? Prior to this work, the best upper bound, due to
Holenstein, Mitzenmacher, Panigrahy, and Wieder (2008), was
$\exp(\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2}))$. We improve this bound to $\exp(O(n^{1/3}))$
using statistics of individual bits in the output and show that this bound is
sharp in the restricted model where this is the only information used. Our
method, that uses elementary complex analysis, can also handle insertions.

 <dc:description>  An out-branching and an in-branching of a digraph $D$ are called $k$-distinct
if each of them has $k$ arcs absent in the other. Bang-Jensen, Saurabh and
Simonsen (2016) proved that the problem of deciding whether a strongly
connected digraph $D$ has $k$-distinct out-branching and in-branching is
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by $k$. They asked whether
the problem remains FPT when extended to arbitrary digraphs. Bang-Jensen and
Yeo (2008) asked whether the same problem is FPT when the out-branching and
in-branching have the same root. By linking the two problems with the problem
of whether a digraph has an out-branching with at least $k$ leaves (a leaf is a
vertex of out-degree zero), we first solve the problem of Bang-Jensen and Yeo
(2008). We then develop a new digraph decomposition called the rooted cut
decomposition and using it we prove that the problem of Bang-Jensen et al.
(2016) is FPT for all digraphs. We believe that the \emph{rooted cut
decomposition} will be useful for obtaining other results on digraphs.

 <dc:description>  Graph-based methods pervade the inference toolkits of numerous disciplines
including sociology, biology, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, and
engineering. A challenging problem encountered in this context pertains to
determining the attributes of a set of vertices given those of another subset
at possibly different time instants. Leveraging spatiotemporal dynamics can
drastically reduce the number of observed vertices, and hence the cost of
sampling. Alleviating the limited flexibility of existing approaches, the
present paper broadens the existing kernel-based graph function reconstruction
framework to accommodate time-evolving functions over possibly time-evolving
topologies. This approach inherits the versatility and generality of
kernel-based methods, for which no knowledge on distributions or second-order
statistics is required. Systematic guidelines are provided to construct two
families of space-time kernels with complementary strengths. The first
facilitates judicious control of regularization on a space-time frequency
plane, whereas the second can afford time-varying topologies. Batch and online
estimators are also put forth, and a novel kernel Kalman filter is developed to
obtain these estimates at affordable computational cost. Numerical tests with
real data sets corroborate the merits of the proposed methods relative to
competing alternatives.

 <dc:title>Generating Code Summaries Using the Power of the Crowd</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the first steps to perform most of the software maintenance
activities, such as updating features or fixing bugs, is to have a relatively
good understanding of the program's source code which is often written by other
developers. A code summary is a description about a program's entities (e.g.,
its methods) which helps developers have a better comprehension of the code in
a shorter period of time. However, generating code summaries can be a
challenging task. To mitigate this problem, in this article, we introduce
CrowdSummarizer, a code summarization platform that benefits from the concepts
of crowdsourcing, gamification, and natural language processing to
automatically generate a high level summary for the methods of a Java program.
We have implemented CrowdSummarizer as an Eclipse plugin together with a
web-based code summarization game that can be played by the crowd. The results
of two empirical studies that evaluate the applicability of the approach and
the quality of generated summaries indicate that CrowdSummarizer is effective
in generating quality results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a binary convolutional encoder-decoder network
(B-CEDNet) for natural scene text processing (NSTP). It converts a text image
to a class-distinguished salience map that reveals the categorical, spatial and
morphological information of characters. The existing solutions are either
memory consuming or run-time consuming that cannot be applied to real-time
applications on resource-constrained devices such as advanced driver assistance
systems. The developed network can process multiple regions containing
characters by one-off forward operation, and is trained to have binary weights
and binary feature maps, which lead to both remarkable inference run-time
speedup and memory usage reduction. By training with over 200, 000 synthesis
scene text images (size of $32\times128$), it can achieve $90\%$ and $91\%$
pixel-wise accuracy on ICDAR-03 and ICDAR-13 datasets. It only consumes $4.59\
ms$ inference run-time realized on GPU with a small network size of 2.14 MB,
which is up to $8\times$ faster and $96\%$ smaller than it full-precision
version.

 <dc:description>  We consider several classes of intersection graphs of line segments in the
plane and prove new equality and separation results between those classes. In
particular, we show that: (1) intersection graphs of grounded segments and
intersection graphs of downward rays form the same graph class, (2) not every
intersection graph of rays is an intersection graph of downward rays, and (3)
not every intersection graph of rays is an outer segment graph. The first
result answers an open problem posed by Cabello and Jej\v{c}i\v{c}. The third
result confirms a conjecture by Cabello. We thereby completely elucidate the
remaining open questions on the containment relations between these classes of
segment graphs. We further characterize the complexity of the recognition
problems for the classes of outer segment, grounded segment, and ray
intersection graphs. We prove that these recognition problems are complete for
the existential theory of the reals. This holds even if a 1-string realization
is given as additional input.

 <dc:description>  Social graphs, representing online friendships among users, are one of the
fundamental types of data for many applications, such as recommendation,
virality prediction and marketing in social media. However, this data may be
unavailable due to the privacy concerns of users, or kept private by social
network operators, which makes such applications difficult. Inferring user
interests and discovering user connections through their shared multimedia
content has attracted more and more attention in recent years. This paper
proposes a Gaussian relational topic model for connection discovery using user
shared images in social media. The proposed model not only models user
interests as latent variables through their shared images, but also considers
the connections between users as a result of their shared images. It explicitly
relates user shared images to user connections in a hierarchical, systematic
and supervisory way and provides an end-to-end solution for the problem. This
paper also derives efficient variational inference and learning algorithms for
the posterior of the latent variables and model parameters. It is demonstrated
through experiments with over 200k images from Flickr that the proposed method
significantly outperforms the methods in previous works.

 <dc:title>Toward improving the visual stimulus meaning for increasing the P300

 <dc:description>  The P300 speller is a well known Brain-Computer Interface paradigm that has
been used for over two decades. A new P300 speller paradigm (XP300) is
proposed. It includes several characteristics: (i) the items are not
intensified by using rows and columns, (ii) the order of the visual stimuli is
pseudo-random, (iii) a visual feedback is added on each item to increase the
stimulus meaning, which is the main novelty. XP300 has been tested on ten
healthy subjects on copy spelling mode, with only eight sensors. It has been
compared with the classical P300 paradigm (CP300). With five repetitions, the
average recognition rate across subjects is 85.25% for XP300 and 77.25% for
CP300. Single-trial detection is significantly higher with XP300 by comparing
the AUC (Area Under Curve) of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)
curve. The mean AUC is 0.86 for XP300, 0.80 for CP300. More importantly, XP300
has also been judged as more convenient and user-friendly than CP300, hence
being able to allow longer sessions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Research into cybercrime often points to concentrations of abuse at certain
hosting providers. The implication is that these providers are worse in terms
of security; some are considered `bad' or even `bullet proof'. Remarkably
little work exists on systematically comparing the security performance of
providers. Existing metrics typically count instances of abuse and sometimes
normalize these counts by taking into account the advertised address space of
the provider. None of these attempts have worked through the serious
methodological challenges that plague metric design. In this paper we present a
systematic approach for metrics development and identify the main challenges:
(i) identification of providers, (ii) abuse data coverage and quality, (iii)
normalization, (iv) aggregation and (v) metric interpretation. We describe a
pragmatic approach to deal with these challenges. In the process, we answer an
urgent question posed to us by the Dutch police: `which are the worst providers
in our jurisdiction?'. Notwithstanding their limitations, there is a clear need
for security metrics for hosting providers in the fight against cybercrime.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of producing compact architectures for text
classification, such that the full model fits in a limited amount of memory.
After considering different solutions inspired by the hashing literature, we
propose a method built upon product quantization to store word embeddings.
While the original technique leads to a loss in accuracy, we adapt this method
to circumvent quantization artefacts. Our experiments carried out on several
benchmarks show that our approach typically requires two orders of magnitude
less memory than fastText while being only slightly inferior with respect to
accuracy. As a result, it outperforms the state of the art by a good margin in
terms of the compromise between memory usage and accuracy.

evaluate the performance of this approach in a simulation-based autonomous
driving scenario. Our results resemble the intuitive relation between the

generates collision-free motions and performs human-like lane change behaviour.

 <dc:description>  We investigate what distinguishes reported dreams from other personal
narratives. The continuity hypothesis, stemming from psychological dream
analysis work, states that most dreams refer to a person's daily life and
personal concerns, similar to other personal narratives such as diary entries.
Differences between the two texts may reveal the linguistic markers of dream
text, which could be the basis for new dream analysis work and for the
automatic detection of dream descriptions. We used three text analytics
methods: text classification, topic modeling, and text coherence analysis, and
applied these methods to a balanced set of texts representing dreams, diary
entries, and other personal stories. We observed that dream texts could be
distinguished from other personal narratives nearly perfectly, mostly based on
the presence of uncertainty markers and descriptions of scenes. Important
markers for non-dream narratives are specific time expressions and
conversational expressions. Dream texts also exhibit a lower discourse
coherence than other personal narratives.

 <dc:description>  Top-k error is currently a popular performance measure on large scale image
classification benchmarks such as ImageNet and Places. Despite its wide
acceptance, our understanding of this metric is limited as most of the previous
research is focused on its special case, the top-1 error. In this work, we
explore two directions that shed more light on the top-k error. First, we
provide an in-depth analysis of established and recently proposed single-label
multiclass methods along with a detailed account of efficient optimization
algorithms for them. Our results indicate that the softmax loss and the smooth
multiclass SVM are surprisingly competitive in top-k error uniformly across all
k, which can be explained by our analysis of multiclass top-k calibration.
Further improvements for a specific k are possible with a number of proposed
top-k loss functions. Second, we use the top-k methods to explore the
transition from multiclass to multilabel learning. In particular, we find that
it is possible to obtain effective multilabel classifiers on Pascal VOC using a
single label per image for training, while the gap between multiclass and
multilabel methods on MS COCO is more significant. Finally, our contribution of
efficient algorithms for training with the considered top-k and multilabel loss
functions is of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a quantum-proof key exchange scheme which
is fast approaching the communication industry. An essential component in QKD
is the information reconciliation step, which is used for correcting the
quantum channel noise errors. The recently suggested blind reconciliation
technique, based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, offers remarkable
prospectives for efficient information reconciliation without an a priori error
rate estimation. In the present work, we suggest an improvement of the blind
information reconciliation protocol allowing significant increase the
efficiency of the procedure and reducing its interactivity. The proposed
technique is based on introducing symmetry in operations of parties, and the
consideration of results of unsuccessful belief propagation decodings.

 <dc:description>  Image segmentation has many applications which range from machine learning to
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a framework for the segmentation
of images based on super-pixels and algorithms for community identification in
graphs. The super-pixel pre-segmentation step reduces the number of nodes in
the graph, rendering the method the ability to process large images. Moreover,
community detection algorithms provide more accurate segmentation than
traditional approaches, such as those based on spectral graph partition. We
also compare our method with two algorithms: a) the graph-based approach by
Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher and b) the contour-based method by Arbelaez.
Results have shown that our method provides more precise segmentation and is
faster than both of them.

 <dc:description>  Proof of security of cryptographic protocols theoretically establishes the
strength of a protocol and the constraints under which it can perform, it does
not take into account the overall design of the protocol. In the past model
checking has been successfully applied to classical cryptographic protocols to
weed out design flaws which would have otherwise gone unnoticed. Quantum
cryptographic protocols differ from their classical counterparts, in their
ability to detect the presence of an eavesdropper. Although unconditional
security has been proven for both BB84 and B92 protocols, in this paper we show
that identifying an eavesdropper's presence is constrained on the number of
qubits exchanged. We first model the protocols in CQP and then explain the
mechanism by which we have translated this into a PRISM model. We mainly focus
on the protocols' ability to detect an active eavesdropper and the extent to
which an eavesdropper can retrieve the shared key without being detected by
either party. We then conclude by comparing the performance of the protocols.

 <dc:title>Empirical Evaluation of A New Approach to Simplifying Long Short-term
  Memory (LSTM)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lu, Yuzhen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The standard LSTM, although it succeeds in the modeling long-range
dependences, suffers from a highly complex structure that can be simplified
through modifications to its gate units. This paper was to perform an empirical
comparison between the standard LSTM and three new simplified variants that
were obtained by eliminating input signal, bias and hidden unit signal from
individual gates, on the tasks of modeling two sequence datasets. The
experiments show that the three variants, with reduced parameters, can achieve
comparable performance with the standard LSTM. Due attention should be paid to
turning the learning rate to achieve high accuracies

 <dc:description>  &quot;Geographic Load Balancing&quot; is a strategy for reducing the energy cost of
data centers spreading across different terrestrial locations. In this paper,
we focus on load balancing among micro-datacenters powered by renewable energy
sources. We model via a Markov Chain the problem of scheduling jobs by
prioritizing datacenters where renewable energy is currently available. Not
finding a convenient closed form solution for the resulting chain, we use mean
field techniques to derive an asymptotic approximate model which instead is
shown to have an extremely simple and intuitive steady state solution. After
proving, using both theoretical and discrete event simulation results, that the
system performance converges to the asymptotic model for an increasing number
of datacenters, we exploit the simple closed form model's solution to
investigate relationships and trade-offs among the various system parameters.

 <dc:description>  Semantic classes can be either things (objects with a well-defined shape,
e.g. car, person) or stuff (amorphous background regions, e.g. grass, sky).
While lots of classification and detection works focus on thing classes, less
attention has been given to stuff classes. Nonetheless, stuff classes are
important as they allow to explain important aspects of an image, including (1)
scene type; (2) which thing classes are likely to be present and their location
(determined through contextual reasoning); (3) physical attributes, material
types and geometric properties of the scene. To understand stuff and things in
context we annotate 10,000 images of the COCO dataset with a broad range of
stuff classes, using a specialized stuff annotation protocol allowing us to
efficiently label each pixel. On this dataset, we analyze several aspects: (a)
the importance of stuff and thing classes in terms of their surface cover and
how frequently they are mentioned in image captions; (b) the importance of
several visual criteria to discriminate stuff and thing classes; (c) we study
the spatial relations between stuff and things, highlighting the rich
contextual relations that make our dataset unique. Furthermore, we show
experimentally how modern semantic segmentation methods perform on stuff and
thing classes and answer the question whether stuff is easier to segment than
things. We release our new dataset and the trained models online, hopefully
promoting further research on stuff and stuff-thing contextual relations.

 <dc:description>  The question how complex systems become more organized and efficient with
time is open. Examples are, the formation of elementary particles from pure
energy, the formation of atoms from particles, the formation of stars and
galaxies, the formation of molecules from atoms, of organisms, and of the
society. In this sequence, order appears inside complex systems and randomness
(entropy) is expelled to their surroundings. Key features of self-organizing
systems are that they are open and they are far away from equilibrium, with
increasing energy flowing through them. This work searches for global measures
of such self-organizing systems, that are predictable and do not depend on the
substrate of the system studied. Our results will help to understand the
existence of complex systems and mechanisms of self-organization. In part we
also provide insights, in this work, about the underlying physical essence of
the Moore's law and the multiple logistic growth observed in technological
progress.

 <dc:description>  We model a social-encounter network where linked nodes match for reproduction
in a manner depending probabilistically on each node`s attractiveness. The
developed model reveals that increasing either the network`s mean degree or the
``choosiness`` exercised during pair-formation increases the strength of
positive assortative mating. That is, we note that attractiveness is correlated
among mated nodes. Their total number also increases with mean degree and
selectivity during pair-formation. By iterating over model mapping of parents
onto offspring across generations, we study the evolution of attractiveness.
Selection mediated by exclusion from reproduction increases mean
attractiveness, but is rapidly balanced by skew in the offspring distribution
of highly attractive mated pairs.

 <dc:description>  For any prime $p$, $\lambda$-constacyclic codes of length $p^s$ over ${\cal
R}=\mathbb{F}_{p^m} + u\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ are precisely the ideals of the local
ring ${\cal R}_{\lambda}=\frac{{\cal R}[x]}{\left\langle x^{p^s}-\lambda
\right\rangle}$, where $u^2=0$. In this paper, we first investigate the Hamming
distances of cyclic codes of length $p^s$ over ${\cal R}$. The minimum Hamming
distances of all cyclic codes of length $p^s$ over ${\cal R}$ are determined.
Moreover, an isometry between cyclic and $\alpha$-constacyclic codes of length
$p^s$ over ${\cal R}$ is established, where $\alpha$ is a nonzero element of
$\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$, which carries over the results regarding cyclic codes
corresponding to $\alpha$-constacyclic codes of length $p^s$ over ${\cal R}$.

 <dc:title>A Note on Testing Intersection of Convex Sets in Sublinear Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Solomon, Israela</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a simple sublinear time algorithm for testing the following
geometric property. Let $P_1, ..., P_n$ be $n$ convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$
($n \gg d$), such as polytopes, balls, etc. We assume that the complexity of
each set depends only on $d$ (and not on the number of sets $n$). We test the
property that there exists a common point in all sets, i.e. that their
intersection is nonempty. Our goal is to distinguish between the case where the
intersection is nonempty, and the case where even after removing many of the
sets the intersection is empty. In particular, our algorithm returns PASS if
all of the $n$ sets intersect, and returns FAIL with probability at least
$1-\epsilon$ if no point belongs to $\frac{\alpha}{d+1} n$ sets, for any given
$0 &lt; \alpha, \epsilon &lt; 1$.

 <dc:description>  A graph is well-covered if all its maximal independent sets are of the same
cardinality (Plummer, 1970). If G is a well-covered graph, has at least two
vertices, and G-v is well-covered for every vertex v, then G is a
1-well-covered graph (Staples, 1975). We call G a {\lambda}-quasi-regularizable
graph if {\lambda} |S| =&lt; |N(S)| for every independent set S of G. The
independence polynomial I(G;x) is the generating function of independent sets
in a graph G (Gutman &amp; Harary, 1983). The Roller-Coaster Conjecture (Michael &amp;
Travis, 2003), saying that for every permutation {\sigma} of the set
{({\alpha}/2),...,{\alpha}} there exists a well-covered graph G with
independence number {\alpha} such that the coefficients (s_{k}) of I(G;x) are
chosen in accordance with {\sigma}, has been validated in (Cutler &amp; Pebody,
2017). In this paper, we show that independence polynomials of
{\lambda}-quasi-regularizable graphs are partially unimodal. More precisely,
the coefficients of an upper part of I(G;x) are in non-increasing order. Based
on this finding, we prove that the domain of the Roller- Coaster Conjecture can
be shortened for well-covered graphs and 1-well-covered graphs.

 <dc:description>  Adversaries with physical access to a target platform can perform cold boot
or DMA attacks to extract sensitive data from the RAM. In response, several
main-memory encryption schemes have been proposed to prevent such attacks. Also
hardware vendors have acknowledged the threat and already announced respective
hardware extensions. Intel's SGX and AMD's SME will provide means to encrypt
parts of the RAM to protect security-relevant assets that reside there.
Encrypting the RAM will protect the user's content against passive
eavesdropping. However, the level of protection it provides in scenarios that
involve an adversary who is not only able to read from RAM but can also change
content in RAM is less clear. Obviously, encryption offers some protection
against such an &quot;active&quot; adversary: from the ciphertext the adversary cannot
see what value is changed in the plaintext, nor predict the system behaviour
based on the changes. But is this enough to prevent an active adversary from
performing malicious tasks? This paper addresses the open research question
whether encryption alone is a dependable protection mechanism in practice when
considering an active adversary. To this end, we first build a software based
memory encryption solution on a desktop system which mimics AMD's SME.
Subsequently, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept fault attack on this system, by
which we are able to extract the private RSA key of a GnuPG user. Our work
suggests that transparent memory encryption is not enough to prevent active
attacks.

 <dc:description>  It is starting to become a big trend in the era of social networking that
people produce and upload user-generated contents to Internet via wireless
networks, bringing a significant burden on wireless uplink networks. In this
paper, we contribute to designing and theoretical understanding of wireless
cache-enabled upload transmission in a delay-tolerant small cell network to
relieve the burden, and then propose the corresponding scheduling policies for
the small base station (SBS) under the infinite and finite cache sizes.
Specifically, the cache ability introduced by SBS enables SBS to eliminate the
redundancy among the upload contents from users. This strategy not only
alleviates the wireless backhual traffic congestion from SBS to a macro base
station (MBS), but also improves the transmission efficiency of SBS. We then
investigate the scheduling schemes of SBS to offload more data traffic under
caching size constraint. Moreover, two operational regions for the wireless
cache-enabled upload network, namely, the delay-limited region and the
cache-limited region, are established to reveal the fundamental tradeoff
between the delay tolerance and the cache ability. Finally, numerical results
are provided to demonstrate the significant performance gains of the proposed
wireless cache-enabled upload network.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel recursive system identification algorithm for linear
autoregressive systems with skewed innovations. The algorithm is based on the
variational Bayes approximation of the model with a multivariate normal prior
for the model coefficients, multivariate skew-normally distributed innovations,
and matrix-variate-normal - inverse-Wishart prior for the parameters of the
innovation distribution. The proposed algorithm simultaneously estimates the
model coefficients as well as the parameters of the innovation distribution,
which are both allowed to be slowly time-varying. Through computer simulations,
we compare the proposed method with a variational algorithm based on the
normally-distributed innovations model, and show that modelling the skewness
can provide improvement in identification accuracy.

 <dc:title>From narrative descriptions to MedDRA: automagically encoding adverse

 <dc:description>  The collection of narrative spontaneous reports is an irreplaceable source
for the prompt detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs): qualified
domain experts manually revise a huge amount of narrative descriptions and then
encode texts according to MedDRA standard terminology. The manual annotation of
narrative documents with medical terminology is a subtle and expensive task,
since the number of reports is growing up day-by-day. MagiCoder, a Natural
Language Processing algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of
free-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in
terms of computational complexity (in particular, it is linear in the size of
the narrative input and the terminology). We tested it on a large dataset of
about 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison
between human and MagiCoder revisions. For the current base version of
MagiCoder, we measured: on short descriptions, an average recall of $86\%$ and
an average precision of $88\%$; on medium-long descriptions (up to 255
characters), an average recall of $64\%$ and an average precision of $63\%$.
From a practical point of view, MagiCoder reduces the time required for
encoding ADR reports. Pharmacologists have simply to review and validate the
MagiCoder terms proposed by the application, instead of choosing the right
terms among the 70K low level terms of MedDRA. Such improvement in the
efficiency of pharmacologists' work has a relevant impact also on the quality
of the subsequent data analysis. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian
pharmacovigilance language. However, our proposal is based on a general
approach, not depending on the considered language nor the term dictionary.

 <dc:description>  Traditional sentiment analysis often uses sentiment dictionary to extract
sentiment information in text and classify documents. However, emerging
informal words and phrases in user generated content call for analysis aware to
the context. Usually, they have special meanings in a particular context.
Because of its great performance in representing inter-word relation, we use
sentiment word vectors to identify the special words. Based on the distributed
language model word2vec, in this paper we represent a novel method about
sentiment representation of word under particular context, to be detailed, to
identify the words with abnormal sentiment polarity in long answers. Result
shows the improved model shows better performance in representing the words
with special meaning, while keep doing well in representing special idiomatic
pattern. Finally, we will discuss the meaning of vectors representing in the
field of sentiment, which may be different from general object-based
conditions.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks (DNN), have
achieved remarkable success in a number of complex data processing tasks. These
methods have arguably had their strongest impact on tasks such as image and
audio processing - data processing domains in which humans have long held clear
advantages over conventional algorithms. In contrast to biological neural
systems, which are capable of learning continuously, deep artificial networks
have a limited ability for incorporating new information in an already trained
network. As a result, methods for continuous learning are potentially highly
impactful in enabling the application of deep networks to dynamic data sets.
Here, inspired by the process of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, we
explore the potential for adding new neurons to deep layers of artificial
neural networks in order to facilitate their acquisition of novel information
while preserving previously trained data representations. Our results on the
MNIST handwritten digit dataset and the NIST SD 19 dataset, which includes
lower and upper case letters and digits, demonstrate that neurogenesis is well
suited for addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma that has long challenged
adaptive machine learning algorithms.

 <dc:description>  SimTensor is a multi-platform, open-source software for generating artificial
tensor data (either with CP/PARAFAC or Tucker structure) for reproducible
research on tensor factorization algorithms. SimTensor is a stand-alone
application based on MATALB. It provides a wide range of facilities for
generating tensor data with various configurations. It comes with a
user-friendly graphical user interface, which enables the user to generate
tensors with complicated settings in an easy way. It also has this facility to
export generated data to universal formats such as CSV and HDF5, which can be
imported via a wide range of programming languages (C, C++, Java, R, Fortran,
MATLAB, Perl, Python, and many more). The most innovative part of SimTensor is
this that can generate temporal tensors with periodic waves, seasonal effects
and streaming structure. it can apply constraints such as non-negativity and
different kinds of sparsity to the data. SimTensor also provides this facility
to simulate different kinds of change-points and inject various types of
anomalies. The source code and binary versions of SimTensor is available for
download in http://www.simtensor.org.

 <dc:title>Hybrid Learning of Optical Flow and Next Frame Prediction to Boost

 <dc:description>  CNN-based optical flow estimation has attracted attention recently, mainly
due to its impressively high frame rates. These networks perform well on
synthetic datasets, but they are still far behind the classical methods in
real-world videos. This is because there is no ground truth optical flow for
training these networks on real data. In this paper, we boost CNN-based optical
flow estimation in real scenes with the help of the freely available
self-supervised task of next-frame prediction. To this end, we train the
network in a hybrid way, providing it with a mixture of synthetic and real
videos. With the help of a sample-variant multi-tasking architecture, the
network is trained on different tasks depending on the availability of
ground-truth. We also experiment with the prediction of &quot;next-flow&quot; instead of
estimation of the current flow, which is intuitively closer to the task of
next-frame prediction and yields favorable results. We demonstrate the
improvement in optical flow estimation on the real-world KITTI benchmark.
Additionally, we test the optical flow indirectly in an action classification
scenario. As a side product of this work, we report significant improvements
over state-of-the-art in the task of next-frame prediction.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art computer vision algorithms often achieve efficiency by
making discrete choices about which hypotheses to explore next. This allows
allocation of computational resources to promising candidates, however, such
decisions are non-differentiable. As a result, these algorithms are hard to
train in an end-to-end fashion. In this work we propose to learn an efficient
algorithm for the task of 6D object pose estimation. Our system optimizes the
parameters of an existing state-of-the art pose estimation system using
reinforcement learning, where the pose estimation system now becomes the
stochastic policy, parametrized by a CNN. Additionally, we present an efficient
training algorithm that dramatically reduces computation time. We show
empirically that our learned pose estimation procedure makes better use of
limited resources and improves upon the state-of-the-art on a challenging
dataset. Our approach enables differentiable end-to-end training of complex
algorithmic pipelines and learns to make optimal use of a given computational
budget.

 <dc:title>Online Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Exploration in Continuous

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new method to learn online policies in continuous
state, continuous action, model-free Markov decision processes, with two
properties that are crucial for practical applications. First, the policies are
implementable with a very low computational cost: once the policy is computed,
the action corresponding to a given state is obtained in logarithmic time with
respect to the number of samples used. Second, our method is versatile: it does
not rely on any a priori knowledge of the structure of optimal policies. We
build upon the Fitted Q-iteration algorithm which represents the $Q$-value as
the average of several regression trees. Our algorithm, the Fitted Policy
Forest algorithm (FPF), computes a regression forest representing the Q-value
and transforms it into a single tree representing the policy, while keeping
control on the size of the policy using resampling and leaf merging. We
introduce an adaptation of Multi-Resolution Exploration (MRE) which is
particularly suited to FPF. We assess the performance of FPF on three classical
benchmarks for reinforcement learning: the &quot;Inverted Pendulum&quot;, the &quot;Double
Integrator&quot; and &quot;Car on the Hill&quot; and show that FPF equals or outperforms other
algorithms, although these algorithms rely on the use of particular
representations of the policies, especially chosen in order to fit each of the
three problems. Finally, we exhibit that the combination of FPF and MRE allows
to find nearly optimal solutions in problems where $\epsilon$-greedy approaches
would fail.

low-accurate robotic arm. Our method corrects errors by using an RGB-D sensor.
It is based on SURF invariant features which allows us to perform object
recognition at a high frame rate. We define regions of interest based on depth
segmentation, and we use them to speed-up the recognition and to improve
reliability. The system has been tested on a real-world scenario. In spite of
the lack of accuracy of all the components and the uncontrolled environment, it
grasps objects successfully on more than 95 percents of the trials.

 <dc:description>  One of the main cost factors in software development is the detection and
removal of defects. However, the relationships and influencing factors of the
costs and revenues of defect-detection techniques are still not well
understood. This paper proposes an analytical, stochastic model of the
economics of defect detection and removal to improve this understanding. The
model is able to incorporate dynamic as well as static techniques in contrast
to most other models of that kind. We especially analyse the model with
state-ofthe-art sensitivity analysis methods to (1) identify the most relevant
factors for model simplification and (2) prioritise the factors to guide
further research and measurements.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we consider the coexistence and spectrum sharing between
downlink multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communication and
a MIMO radar. For a given performance requirement of the downlink communication
system, we design the transmit beamforming such that the detection probability
of the radar is maximized. While the original optimization problem is
non-convex, we exploit the monotonically increasing relationship of the
detection probability with the non-centrality parameter of the resulting
probability distribution to obtain a convex lower-bound optimization. The
proposed beamformer is designed to be robust to imperfect channel state
information (CSI). Simulation results verify that the proposed approach
facilitates the coexistence between radar and communication links, and
illustrates a scalable trade-off between the two systems' performance.

 <dc:description>  Several methods exist for a computer to generate music based on data
including Markov chains, recurrent neural networks, recombinancy, and grammars.
We explore the use of unit selection and concatenation as a means of generating
music using a procedure based on ranking, where, we consider a unit to be a
variable length number of measures of music. We first examine whether a unit
selection method, that is restricted to a finite size unit library, can be
sufficient for encompassing a wide spectrum of music. We do this by developing
a deep autoencoder that encodes a musical input and reconstructs the input by
selecting from the library. We then describe a generative model that combines a
deep structured semantic model (DSSM) with an LSTM to predict the next unit,
where units consist of four, two, and one measures of music. We evaluate the
generative model using objective metrics including mean rank and accuracy and
with a subjective listening test in which expert musicians are asked to
complete a forced-choiced ranking task. We compare our model to a note-level
generative baseline that consists of a stacked LSTM trained to predict forward
by one note.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel scheme to combine neural machine translation (NMT) with
traditional statistical machine translation (SMT). Our approach borrows ideas
from linearised lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding for SMT. The NMT score is
combined with the Bayes-risk of the translation according the SMT lattice. This
makes our approach much more flexible than $n$-best list or lattice rescoring
as the neural decoder is not restricted to the SMT search space. We show an
efficient and simple way to integrate risk estimation into the NMT decoder
which is suitable for word-level as well as subword-unit-level NMT. We test our
method on English-German and Japanese-English and report significant gains over
lattice rescoring on several data sets for both single and ensembled NMT. The
MBR decoder produces entirely new hypotheses far beyond simply rescoring the
SMT search space or fixing UNKs in the NMT output.

 <dc:description>  Compressed sensing (CS) is a sampling paradigm that allows to simultaneously
measure and compress signals that are sparse or compressible in some domain.
The choice of a sensing matrix that carries out the measurement has a defining
impact on the system performance and it is often advocated to draw its elements
randomly. It has been noted that in the presence of input (signal) noise, the
application of the sensing matrix causes SNR degradation due to the noise
folding effect. In fact, it might also result in the variations of the output
SNR in compressive measurements over the support of the input signal,
potentially resulting in unexpected non-uniform system performance. In this
work, we study the impact of a distribution from which the elements of a
sensing matrix are drawn on the spread of the output SNR. We derive analytic
expressions for several common types of sensing matrices and show that the SNR
spread grows with the decrease of the number of measurements. This makes its
negative effect especially pronounced for high compression rates that are often
of interest in CS.

 <dc:description>  Taxi services and product delivery services are instrumental for our modern
society. Thanks to the emergence of sharing economy, ride-sharing services such
as Uber, Didi, Lyft and Google's Waze Rider are becoming more ubiquitous and
grow into an integral part of our everyday lives. However, the efficiency of
these services are severely limited by the sub-optimal and imbalanced matching
between the supply and demand. We need a generalized framework and
corresponding efficient algorithms to address the efficient matching, and hence
optimize the performance of these markets. Existing studies for taxi and
delivery services are only applicable in scenarios of the one-sided market. In
contrast, this work investigates a highly generalized model for the taxi and
delivery services in the market economy (abbreviated as&quot;taxi and delivery
market&quot;) that can be widely used in two-sided markets. Further, we present
efficient online and offline algorithms for different applications. We verify
our algorithm with theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations under
realistic settings.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Software reliability models are an important tool in quality management and
release planning. There is a large number of different models that often
exhibit strengths in different areas. This paper proposes a model that is based
on a geometric sequence (or progression) of the failure rates of faults. This
property of the failure process was observed in practice at Siemens among
others and led to the development of the proposed model. It is described in
detail and evaluated using standard criteria. Most importantly, the model
performs constantly well over several projects in terms of its predictive
validity.

 <dc:description>  Humans learn a predictive model of the world and use this model to reason
about future events and the consequences of actions. In contrast to most
machine predictors, we exhibit an impressive ability to generalize to unseen
scenarios and reason intelligently in these settings. One important aspect of
this ability is physical intuition(Lake et al., 2016). In this work, we explore
the potential of unsupervised learning to find features that promote better
generalization to settings outside the supervised training distribution. Our
task is predicting the stability of towers of square blocks. We demonstrate
that an unsupervised model, trained to predict future frames of a video
sequence of stable and unstable block configurations, can yield features that
support extrapolating stability prediction to blocks configurations outside the
training set distribution

 <dc:title>Spreadsheet Guardian: An Approach to Protecting Semantic Correctness

 <dc:description>  Spreadsheets are powerful tools which play a business-critical role in many
organizations. However, many bad decisions taken due to faulty spreadsheets
show that these tools need serious quality assurance. Furthermore, while
collaboration on spreadsheets for maintenance tasks is common, there has been
almost no support for ensuring that the spreadsheets remain correct during this
process.
  We have developed an approach named Spreadsheet Guardian which separates the
specification of spreadsheet test rules from their execution. By automatically
executing user-defined test rules, our approach is able to detect semantic
faults. It also protects all collaborating spreadsheet users from introducing
faults during maintenance, even if only few end-users specify test rules. To
evaluate Spreadsheet Guardian, we implemented a representative testing
technique as an add-in for Microsoft Excel.
  We evaluated the testing technique in two empirical evaluations with 29
end-users and 42 computer science students. The results indicate that the
technique is easy to learn and to apply. Furthermore, after finishing
maintenance, participants with spreadsheets &quot;protected&quot; by the technique are
more realistic about the correctness of their spreadsheets than participants
who employ only &quot;classic&quot;, non-interactive test rules based on static analysis
techniques. Hence, we believe Spreadsheet Guardian can be of use for
business-critical spreadsheets.

 <dc:description>  We examine double successive approximations on a set, which we denote by
$L_2L_1, \ U_2U_1, U_2L_1,$ $L_2U_1$ where $L_1, U_1$ and $L_2, U_2$ are based
on generally non-equivalent equivalence relations $E_1$ and $E_2$ respectively,
on a finite non-empty set $V.$ We consider the case of these operators being
given fully defined on its powerset $\mathscr{P}(V).$ Then, we investigate if
we can reconstruct the equivalence relations which they may be based on.
Directly related to this, is the question of whether there are unique solutions
for a given defined operator and the existence of conditions which may
characterise this. We find and prove these characterising conditions that
equivalence relation pairs should satisfy in order to generate unique such
operators.

 <dc:description>  Tensor decompositions have rich applications in statistics and machine
learning, and developing efficient, accurate algorithms for the problem has
received much attention recently. Here, we present a new method built on
Kruskal's uniqueness theorem to decompose symmetric, nearly orthogonally
decomposable tensors. Unlike the classical higher-order singular value
decomposition which unfolds a tensor along a single mode, we consider
unfoldings along two modes and use rank-1 constraints to characterize the
underlying components. This tensor decomposition method provably handles a
greater level of noise compared to previous methods and achieves a high
estimation accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is robust
to various noise distributions and that it performs especially favorably as the
order increases.

curves given by Barg, Tamo and Vl\u{a}du\c{t} to those with arbitrarily many
recovery sets by exploiting the structure of fiber products of curves.
Employing maximal curves, we create several new families of locally recoverable
codes with multiple recovery sets, including codes with two recovery sets from
the generalized Giulietti and Korchm\'{a}ros (GK) curves and the Suzuki curves,
and new locally recoverable codes with many recovery sets based on the
Hermitian curve, using a fiber product construction of van der Geer and van der
Vlugt. In addition, we consider the relationship between local error recovery
and global error correction as well as the availability required to locally
recover any pattern of a fixed number of erasures.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a novel distributed coverage control framework for a
network of mobile agents, in charge of covering a finite set of points of
interest (PoI), such as people in danger, geographically dispersed equipment or
environmental landmarks. The proposed algorithm is inspired by C-Means, an
unsupervised learning algorithm originally proposed for non-exclusive
clustering and for identification of cluster centroids from a set of
observations. To cope with the agents' limited sensing range and avoid
infeasible coverage solutions, traditional C-Means needs to be enhanced with
proximity constraints, ensuring that each agent takes into account only
neighboring PoIs. The proposed coverage control framework provides useful
information concerning the ranking or importance of the different PoIs to the
agents, which can be exploited in further application-dependent data fusion
processes, patrolling, or disaster relief applications.

 <dc:description>  To extract value from evergrowing volumes of data, coming from a number of
different sources, and to drive decision making, organizations frequently
resort to the composition of data processing workflows, since they are
expressive, flexible, and scalable. The typical workflow model enforces strict
temporal synchronization across processing steps without accounting the actual
effect of intermediate computations on the final workflow output. However, this
is not the most desirable behavior in a multitude of scenarios. We identify a
class of applications for continuous data processing where workflow output
changes slowly and without great significance in a short-to-medium time window,
thus wasting compute resources and energy with current approaches.
  To overcome such inefficiency, we introduce a novel workflow model, for
continuous and data-intensive processing, capable of relaxing triggering
semantics according to the impact input data is assessed to have on changing
the workflow output. To assess this impact, learn the correlation between input
and output variation, and guarantee correctness within a given tolerated error
constant, we rely on Machine Learning. The functionality of this workflow model
is implemented in SmartFlux, a middleware framework which can be effortlessly
integrated with existing workflow managers. Experimental results indicate we
are able to save a significant amount of resources while not deviating the
workflow output beyond a small error constant with high confidence level.

 <dc:description>  The crossing number is the smallest number of pairwise edge-crossings when
drawing a graph into the plane. There are only very few graph classes for which
the exact crossing number is known or for which there at least exist constant
approximation ratios. Furthermore, up to now, general crossing number
computations have never been successfully tackled using bounded width of graph
decompositions, like treewidth or pathwidth.
  In this paper, we for the first time show that crossing number is tractable
(even in linear time) for maximal graphs of bounded pathwidth~3. The technique
also shows that the crossing number and the rectilinear (a.k.a. straight-line)
crossing number are identical for this graph class, and that we require only an
$O(n)\times O(n)$-grid to achieve such a drawing.
  Our techniques can further be extended to devise a 2-approximation for
general graphs with pathwidth 3, and a $4w^3$-approximation for maximal graphs
of pathwidth $w$. This is a constant approximation for bounded pathwidth
graphs.

 <dc:title>Improved Algorithms for Decremental Single-Source Reachability on
  Directed Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently we presented the first algorithm for maintaining the set of nodes
reachable from a source node in a directed graph that is modified by edge
deletions with $o(mn)$ total update time, where $m$ is the number of edges and
$n$ is the number of nodes in the graph [Henzinger et al. STOC 2014]. The
algorithm is a combination of several different algorithms, each for a
different $m$ vs. $n$ trade-off. For the case of $m = \Theta(n^{1.5})$ the
running time is $O(n^{2.47})$, just barely below $mn = \Theta(n^{2.5})$. In
this paper we simplify the previous algorithm using new algorithmic ideas and
achieve an improved running time of $\tilde O(\min(m^{7/6} n^{2/3}, m^{3/4}
n^{5/4 + o(1)}, m^{2/3} n^{4/3+o(1)} + m^{3/7} n^{12/7+o(1)}))$. This gives,
e.g., $O(n^{2.36})$ for the notorious case $m = \Theta(n^{1.5})$. We obtain the
same upper bounds for the problem of maintaining the strongly connected
components of a directed graph undergoing edge deletions. Our algorithms are
correct with high probabililty against an oblivious adversary.

 <dc:description>  In a social network, influence diffusion is the process of spreading
innovations from user to user. An activation state identifies who are the
active users who have adopted the target innovation. Given an activation state
of a certain diffusion, effector detection aims to reveal the active users who
are able to best explain the observed state. In this paper, we tackle the
effector detection problem from two perspectives. The first approach is based
on the influence distance that measures the chance that an active user can
activate its neighbors. For a certain pair of users, the shorter the influence
distance, the higher probability that one can activate the other. Given an
activation state, the effectors are expected to have short influence distance
to active users while long to inactive users. By this idea, we propose the
influence-distance-based effector detection problem and provide a
3-approximation. Second, we address the effector detection problem by the
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. We prove that the optimal MLE can
be obtained in polynomial time for connected directed acyclic graphs. For
general graphs, we first extract a directed acyclic subgraph that can well
preserve the information in the original graph and then apply the MLE approach
to the extracted subgraph to obtain the effectors. The effectiveness of our
algorithms is experimentally verified via simulations on the real-world social
network.

 <dc:title>Random Kneser graphs and hypergraphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kupavskii, Andrey</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A Kneser graph $KG_{n,k}$ is a graph whose vertices are all $k$-element
subsets of $[n],$ with two vertices connected if and only if the corresponding
sets do not intersect. A famous result due to Lov\'asz states that the
chromatic number of a Kneser graph $KG_{n,k}$ is equal to $n-2k+2$. In this
paper we discuss the chromatic number of random Kneser graphs and hypergraphs.
It was studied in two recent papers, one due to Kupavskii, who proposed the
problem and studied it in the graph case, and the more recent one due to
Alishahi and Hajiabolhassan. The authors of the latter paper had extended the
result of Kupavskii to the case of general Kneser hypergraphs. Moreover, they
have improved the bounds of Kupavskii in the graph case for many values of
parameters.
  In the present paper we present a purely combinatorial approach to the
problem based on blow-ups of graphs, which gives much better bounds on the
chromatic number of random Kneser and Schrijver graphs and Kneser hypergraphs.
The central idea of using blow-ups is due to Noga Alon.

 <dc:description>  This study provides the first confirmation that individual employment status
can be predicted from standard mobile phone network logs externally validated
with household survey data. Individual welfare and households vulnerability to
shocks are intimately connected to employment status and professions of
household breadwinners. At a societal level unemployment is an important
indicator of the performance of an economy. By deriving a broad set of novel
mobile phone network indicators reflecting users financial, social and mobility
patterns we show how machine learning models can be used to predict 18
categories of profession in a South-Asian developing country. The model
predicts individual unemployment status with 70.4 percent accuracy. We further
show how unemployment can be aggregated from individual level and mapped
geographically at cell tower resolution, providing a promising approach to map
labor market economic indicators, and the distribution of economic productivity
and vulnerability between censuses, especially in heterogeneous urban areas.
The method also provides a promising approach to support data collection on
vulnerable populations, which are frequently under-represented in official
surveys.

 <dc:description>  Given a knowledge base (KB) rich in facts about common nouns or generics,
such as &quot;all trees produce oxygen&quot; or &quot;some animals live in forests&quot;, we
consider the problem of deriving additional such facts at a high precision.
While this problem has received much attention for named entity KBs such as
Freebase, little emphasis has been placed on generics despite their importance
for capturing general knowledge. Different from named entity KBs, generics KBs
involve implicit or explicit quantification, have more complex underlying
regularities, are substantially more incomplete, and violate the commonly used
locally closed world assumption (LCWA). Consequently, existing completion
methods struggle with this new task. We observe that external information, such
as relation schemas and entity taxonomies, if used correctly, can be
surprisingly powerful in addressing the challenges associated with generics.
Using this insight, we propose a simple yet effective knowledge guided tensor
factorization approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on two generics
KBs for science, doubling their size at 74\%-86\% precision. Further, to
address the paucity of facts about rare entities such as oriole (a bird), we
present a novel taxonomy guided submodular active learning method to collect
additional annotations that are over five times more effective in inferring
further new facts than multiple active learning baselines.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the stochastic network with dynamic traffic. The
spatial distribution of access points (APs) and users are first modeled as
mutually independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). Different from most
previous literatures which assume all the APs are fully loaded, we consider the
fact that APs having no data to transmit do not generate interference to users.
The APs opportunistically share the channel according to the existence of the
packet to be transmitted and the proposed interference suppression strategy. In
the interference suppression region, only one AP can be active at a time to
transmit the packet on the channel and the other adjacent APs keep silent to
reduce serious interference. The idle probability of any AP, influenced by the
traffic load and availability of the channels, is analyzed. The density of
simultaneously active APs in the network is obtained and the packet loss rate
is further elaborated. We reveal the impacts of network features (e.g., AP
density, user density and channel state) and service features (e.g., user
request, packet size) on the network performance. Simulation results validate
our proposed model.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem associated to recovering the block structure of an
Ising model given independent observations on the binary hypercube. This new
model, called the Ising blockmodel, is a perturbation of the mean field
approximation of the Ising model known as the Curie-Weiss model: the sites are
partitioned into two blocks of equal size and the interaction between those of
the same block is stronger than across blocks, to account for more order within
each block. We study probabilistic, statistical and computational aspects of
this model in the high-dimensional case when the number of sites may be much
larger than the sample size.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a unified framework for the effective rate analysis over
arbitrary correlated and not necessarily identical multiple inputs single
output (MISO) fading channels, which uses moment generating function (MGF)
based approach and H transform representation. The proposed framework has the
potential to simplify the cumbersome analysis procedure compared to the
probability density function (PDF) based approach. Moreover, the effective
rates over two specific fading scenarios are investigated, namely independent
but not necessarily identical distributed (i.n.i.d.) MISO hyper Fox's H fading
channels and arbitrary correlated generalized K fading channels. The exact
analytical representations for these two scenarios are also presented. By
substituting corresponding parameters, the effective rates in various practical
fading scenarios, such as Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Weibull/Gamma and generalized K
fading channels, are readily available. In addition, asymptotic approximations
are provided for the proposed H transform and MGF based approach as well as for
the effective rate over i.n.i.d. MISO hyper Fox's H fading channels.
Simulations under various fading scenarios are also presented, which support
the validity of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  A significant portion of web search queries directly refers to named
entities. Search engines explore various ways to improve the user experience
for such queries. We suggest augmenting search results with {\em trivia facts}
about the searched entity. Trivia is widely played throughout the world, and
was shown to increase users' engagement and retention.
  Most random facts are not suitable for the trivia section. There is skill
(and art) to curating good trivia. In this paper, we formalize a notion of
\emph{trivia-worthiness} and propose an algorithm that automatically mines
trivia facts from Wikipedia. We take advantage of Wikipedia's category
structure, and rank an entity's categories by their trivia-quality.
  Our algorithm is capable of finding interesting facts, such as Obama's Grammy
or Elvis' stint as a tank gunner. In user studies, our algorithm captures the
intuitive notion of &quot;good trivia&quot; 45\% higher than prior work. Search-page
tests show a 22\% decrease in bounce rates and a 12\% increase in dwell time,
proving our facts hold users' attention.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between the classical
Lucas &amp; Kanade (LK) algorithm and the emerging topic of Spatial Transformer
Networks (STNs). STNs are of interest to the vision and learning communities
due to their natural ability to combine alignment and classification within the
same theoretical framework. Inspired by the Inverse Compositional (IC) variant
of the LK algorithm, we present Inverse Compositional Spatial Transformer
Networks (IC-STNs). We demonstrate that IC-STNs can achieve better performance
than conventional STNs with less model capacity; in particular, we show
superior performance in pure image alignment tasks as well as joint
alignment/classification problems on real-world problems.

 <dc:description>  Hashing is one of the most popular and powerful approximate nearest neighbor
search techniques for large-scale image retrieval. Most traditional hashing
methods first represent images as off-the-shelf visual features and then
produce hashing codes in a separate stage. However, off-the-shelf visual
features may not be optimally compatible with the hash code learning procedure,
which may result in sub-optimal hash codes. Recently, deep hashing methods have
been proposed to simultaneously learn image features and hash codes using deep
neural networks and have shown superior performance over traditional hashing
methods. Most deep hashing methods are given supervised information in the form
of pairwise labels or triplet labels. The current state-of-the-art deep hashing
method DPSH~\cite{li2015feature}, which is based on pairwise labels, performs
image feature learning and hash code learning simultaneously by maximizing the
likelihood of pairwise similarities. Inspired by DPSH~\cite{li2015feature}, we
propose a triplet label based deep hashing method which aims to maximize the
likelihood of the given triplet labels. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms all the baselines on CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets,
including the state-of-the-art method DPSH~\cite{li2015feature} and all the
previous triplet label based deep hashing methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the physical layer security of non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) in large-scale networks with invoking stochastic
geometry. Both single-antenna and multiple-antenna aided transmission scenarios
are considered, where the base station (BS) communicates with randomly
distributed NOMA users. In the single-antenna scenario, we adopt a protected
zone around the BS to establish an eavesdropper-exclusion area with the aid of
careful channel-ordering of the NOMA users. In the multiple-antenna scenario,
artificial noise is generated at the BS for further improving the security of a
beamforming-aided system. In order to characterize the secrecy performance, we
derive new exact expressions of the security outage probability for both
single-antenna and multiple-antenna aided scenarios. To obtain further
insights, 1) for the single antenna scenario, we perform secrecy diversity
order analysis of the selected user pair. The analytical results derived
demonstrate that the secrecy diversity order is determined by the specific user
having the worse channel condition among the selected user pair; and 2) for the
multiple-antenna scenario, we derive the asymptotic secrecy outage probability,
when the number of transmit antennas tends to infinity. Monte Carlo simulations
are provided for verifying the analytical results derived and to show that:
i)~The security performance of the NOMA networks can be improved by invoking
the protected zone and by generating artificial noise at the BS; and ii)~The
asymptotic secrecy outage probability is close to the exact secrecy outage
probability.

 <dc:title>Design of Data-Driven Mathematical Laws for Optimal Statistical
  Classification Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reeves, Denise M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article will devise data-driven, mathematical laws that generate
optimal, statistical classification systems which achieve Bayes' error rate for
data distributions with unchanging statistics. Thereby, I will design learning
machines that minimize the Bayes' risk or probability of misclassification. I
will devise a system of fundamental equations of binary classification for a
classification system in statistical equilibrium. I will use this system of
equations to formulate the problem of learning unknown, linear and quadratic
discriminant functions from data as a locus problem, thereby formulating
geometric locus methods within a statistical framework. Solving locus problems
involves finding the equation of a curve or surface defined by a given property
and finding the graph or locus of a given equation. I will devise three systems
of data-driven, locus equations that generate optimal, statistical
classification systems. Each class of learning machines satisfies fundamental
statistical laws for a classification system in statistical equilibrium.
Thereby, I will formulate three classes of learning machines that are scalable
modules for optimal, statistical pattern recognition systems, all of which are
capable of performing a wide variety of statistical pattern recognition tasks,
where any given M-class statistical pattern recognition system exhibits optimal
generalization performance for an M-class feature space.

 <dc:description>  This study investigates a 3D and fully convolutional neural network (CNN) for
subcortical brain structure segmentation in MRI. 3D CNN architectures have been
generally avoided due to their computational and memory requirements during
inference. We address the problem via small kernels, allowing deeper
architectures. We further model both local and global context by embedding
intermediate-layer outputs in the final prediction, which encourages
consistency between features extracted at different scales and embeds
fine-grained information directly in the segmentation process. Our model is
efficiently trained end-to-end on a graphics processing unit (GPU), in a single
stage, exploiting the dense inference capabilities of fully CNNs.
  We performed comprehensive experiments over two publicly available datasets.
First, we demonstrate a state-of-the-art performance on the ISBR dataset. Then,
we report a {\em large-scale} multi-site evaluation over 1112 unregistered
subject datasets acquired from 17 different sites (ABIDE dataset), with ages
ranging from 7 to 64 years, showing that our method is robust to various
acquisition protocols, demographics and clinical factors. Our method yielded
segmentations that are highly consistent with a standard atlas-based approach,
while running in a fraction of the time needed by atlas-based methods and
avoiding registration/normalization steps. This makes it convenient for massive
multi-site neuroanatomical imaging studies. To the best of our knowledge, our
work is the first to study subcortical structure segmentation on such
large-scale and heterogeneous data.

 <dc:title>Paying More Attention to Attention: Improving the Performance of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Attention plays a critical role in human visual experience. Furthermore, it
has recently been demonstrated that attention can also play an important role
in the context of applying artificial neural networks to a variety of tasks
from fields such as computer vision and NLP. In this work we show that, by
properly defining attention for convolutional neural networks, we can actually
use this type of information in order to significantly improve the performance
of a student CNN network by forcing it to mimic the attention maps of a
powerful teacher network. To that end, we propose several novel methods of
transferring attention, showing consistent improvement across a variety of
datasets and convolutional neural network architectures. Code and models for
our experiments are available at

two-phase supervised learning and online human-in-the-loop active learning.
While most existing research proposes offline supervision or hand-crafted
reward functions for online reinforcement, we devise a novel interactive
learning mechanism based on hamming-diverse beam search for response generation
and one-character user-feedback at each step. Experiments show that our model
inherently promotes the generation of semantically relevant and interesting
responses, and can be used to train agents with customized personas, moods and
conversational styles.

network applications. In this paper, we use machine learning as an effective
technique for real-time characterization of the communication performance as
observed by the MAC layer. Our approach is data-driven and consists of three

trace-driven performance evaluation. From our experiments and analysis, we find
that a neural networks prediction model shows best performance.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks are gaining in popularity as they are used to generate
state-of-the-art results for a variety of computer vision and machine learning
applications. At the same time, these networks have grown in depth and
complexity in order to solve harder problems. Given the limitations in power
budgets dedicated to these networks, the importance of low-power, low-memory
solutions has been stressed in recent years. While a large number of dedicated
hardware using different precisions has recently been proposed, there exists no
comprehensive study of different bit precisions and arithmetic in both inputs
and network parameters. In this work, we address this issue and perform a study
of different bit-precisions in neural networks (from floating-point to
fixed-point, powers of two, and binary). In our evaluation, we consider and
analyze the effect of precision scaling on both network accuracy and hardware
metrics including memory footprint, power and energy consumption, and design
area. We also investigate training-time methodologies to compensate for the
reduction in accuracy due to limited bit precision and demonstrate that in most
cases, precision scaling can deliver significant benefits in design metrics at
the cost of very modest decreases in network accuracy. In addition, we propose
that a small portion of the benefits achieved when using lower precisions can
be forfeited to increase the network size and therefore the accuracy. We
evaluate our experiments, using three well-recognized networks and datasets to
show its generality. We investigate the trade-offs and highlight the benefits
of using lower precisions in terms of energy and memory footprint.

 <dc:description>  Signal identification represents the task of a receiver to identify the
signal type and its parameters, with applications to both military and
commercial communications. In this paper, we investigate the identification of
spatial multiplexing (SM) and Alamouti (AL) space-time block code (STBC) with
single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) signals, when the
receiver is equipped with a single antenna. We develop a discriminating feature
based on a fourth-order statistic of the received signal, as well as a constant
false alarm rate decision criterion which relies on the statistical properties
of the feature estimate. Furthermore, we present the theoretical performance
analysis of the proposed identification algorithm. The algorithm does not
require channel or noise power estimation, modulation classification, and block
synchronization. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed
algorithm, as well as a very good agreement with the theoretical analysis.

 <dc:description>  Mathematically, the contaminant transport in an aquifer is described by an
advection-diffusion equation and the identification of the contamination
sources relies on solving a complex ill posed inverse model against the
available observed data. The contaminant migration is usually monitored by
spatially discrete detectors (e.g. monitoring wells) providing temporal records
representing sampling events. These records are then used to estimate
properties of the contaminant sources, e.g., locations, release strengths and
model parameters representing contaminant migration (e.g., velocity,
dispersivity, etc.). These estimates are essential for a reliable assessment of
the contamination hazards and risks. If there are more than one contaminant
sources (with different locations and strengths), the observed records
represent contaminant mixtures; typically, the number of sources is unknown.
The mixing ratios of the different contaminant sources at the detectors are
also unknown; this further hinders the reliability and complexity of the
inverse-model analyses. To circumvent some of these challenges, we have
developed a novel hybrid source identification method coupling machine learning
and inverse analysis methods, and called Green-NMFk. Our method is capable of
identifying the unknown number, locations, and properties of a set of
contaminant sources from measured contaminant-source mixtures with unknown
mixing ratios, without any additional information. It also estimates the
contaminant transport properties, such as velocity and dispersivity.

 <dc:description>  Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a well-known unsupervised learning
method that has been successfully used for blind source separation of
non-negative additive signals.NMF method requires the number of the original
sources to be known a priori. Recently, we reported a method, we called NMFk,
which by coupling the original NMF multiplicative algorithm with a custom
semi-supervised clustering allows us to estimate the number of the sources
based on the robustness of the reconstructed solutions. Here, an extension of
NMFk is developed, called ShiftNMFk, which by combining NMFk with previously
formulated ShiftNMF algorithm, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and a custom
procedure for estimating the source locations is capable of identifying: (a)
the number of the unknown sources, (b) the eventual delays in the signal
propagation, (c) the locations of the sources, and (d) the speed of propagation
of each of the signals in the medium. Our new method is a natural extension of
NMFk that can be used for sources identification based only on observational
data. We demonstrate how our novel method identifies the components of
synthetic data sets, discuss its limitations, and present a Julia language
implementation of ShiftNMFk algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We propose a holographic image restoration method using an autoencoder, which
is an artificial neural network. Because holographic reconstructed images are
often contaminated by direct light, conjugate light, and speckle noise, the
discrimination of reconstructed images may be difficult. In this paper, we
demonstrate the restoration of reconstructed images from holograms that record
page data in holographic memory and QR codes by using the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Widespread outreach programs using remote retinal imaging have proven to
decrease the risk from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in
the US. However, this process still requires manual verification of image
quality and grading of images for level of disease by a trained human grader
and will continue to be limited by the lack of such scarce resources.
Computer-aided diagnosis of retinal images have recently gained increasing
attention in the machine learning community. In this paper, we introduce a set
of neural networks for diabetic retinopathy classification of fundus retinal
images. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed classifiers in combination
with preprocessing and augmentation steps on a sample dataset. Our experimental
results show that neural networks in combination with preprocessing on the
images can boost the classification accuracy on this dataset. Moreover the
proposed models are scalable and can be used in large scale datasets for
diabetic retinopathy detection. The models introduced in this paper can be used
to facilitate the diagnosis and speed up the detection process.

 <dc:description>  Citations are commonly held to represent scientific impact. To date, however,
there is no empirical evidence in support of this postulate that is central to
research assessment exercises and Science of Science studies. Here, we report
on the first empirical verification of the degree to which citation numbers
represent scientific impact as it is actually perceived by experts in their
respective field. We run a large-scale survey of about 2000 corresponding
authors who performed a pairwise impact assessment task across more than 20000
scientific articles. Results of the survey show that citation data and
perceived impact do not align well, unless one properly accounts for strong
psychological biases that affect the opinions of experts with respect to their
own papers vs. those of others. First, researchers tend to largely prefer their
own publications to the most cited papers in their field of research. Second,
there is only a mild positive correlation between the number of citations of
top-cited papers in given research areas and expert preference in pairwise
comparisons. This also applies to pairs of papers with several orders of
magnitude differences in their total number of accumulated citations. However,
when researchers were asked to choose among pairs of their own papers, thus
eliminating the bias favouring one's own papers over those of others, they did
systematically prefer the most cited article. We conclude that, when scientists
have full information and are making unbiased choices, expert opinion on impact
is congruent with citation numbers.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new model, the Recurrent Entity Network (EntNet). It is
equipped with a dynamic long-term memory which allows it to maintain and update
a representation of the state of the world as it receives new data. For
language understanding tasks, it can reason on-the-fly as it reads text, not
just when it is required to answer a question or respond as is the case for a
Memory Network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). Like a Neural Turing Machine or
Differentiable Neural Computer (Graves et al., 2014; 2016) it maintains a fixed
size memory and can learn to perform location and content-based read and write
operations. However, unlike those models it has a simple parallel architecture
in which several memory locations can be updated simultaneously. The EntNet
sets a new state-of-the-art on the bAbI tasks, and is the first method to solve
all the tasks in the 10k training examples setting. We also demonstrate that it
can solve a reasoning task which requires a large number of supporting facts,
which other methods are not able to solve, and can generalize past its training
horizon. It can also be practically used on large scale datasets such as
Children's Book Test, where it obtains competitive performance, reading the
story in a single pass.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the development of an in situ measurement system known as
the Debris Resistive Acoustic Grid Orbital Navy/NASA Sensor (DRAGONS). The
DRAGONS system is designed to detect impacts caused by particles ranging from
50 micrometers to 1 mm at both low-earth and geostationary orbits. DRAGONS
utilizes a combination of low-cost sensor technologies to facilitate accurate
measurements and approximations of the size, velocity, and angle of impacting
micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD). Two thin layers of kapton sheets
with resistive traces are used to detect the changes in resistance that are
directly proportional to the impacting force caused by the fast traveling
particles. Four polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensors are positioned in the
back of each kapton sheet to measure acoustic strain caused by an impact. The
electronic hardware module that controls all operations employs a low-power,
modular, and compact design that enables it to be installed as a low-resource
load on a host satellite. Laboratory results demonstrate that in addition to
having the ability to detect an impact event, the DRAGONS system can determine
impact location, speed, and angle of impact with a mean error of 1.4 cm, 0.2
km/s, and 5{\deg}. The DRAGONS system could be deployed as an add-on subsystem
of a payload to enable a real-time, in-depth study of the properties of MMOD.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning about language can be improved by supplying it with specific
knowledge and sources of external information. We present here a new version of
the linked open data resource ConceptNet that is particularly well suited to be
used with modern NLP techniques such as word embeddings.
  ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural
language with labeled edges. Its knowledge is collected from many sources that
include expert-created resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It
is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding
language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application
to better understand the meanings behind the words people use.
  When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional
semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that
they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower
resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this with state-of-the-art
results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that translate into
improvements on applications of word vectors, including solving SAT-style
analogies.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel process has been developed to realize high-level
complex cognitive behaviors into reactive agents, efficiently. This method
paves the way for deducting high-level reactive behaviors from low-level
perceptive information by autonomous robots. The aforementioned process lets us
actualize different generations of Braitenberg vehicles, are which able to
mimic desired behaviors to survive in complex environments with high degrees of
flexibility in perception and emergence of high-level cognitive actions. The
approach has been used to engineer a Braitenberg vehicle with a wide range of
perception-action capabilities. Verification would be realized within this
framework, due to the efficient traceability between each sequential pair of
process phases. The applied simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the
established development process, based on the Braitenberg vehicle's behavior.

 <dc:description>  A key drawback of the current generation of artificial decision-makers is
that they do not adapt well to changes in unexpected situations. This paper
addresses the situation in which an AI for aerial dog fighting, with tunable
parameters that govern its behavior, will optimize behavior with respect to an
objective function that must be evaluated and learned through simulations. Once
this objective function has been modeled, the agent can then choose its desired
behavior in different situations. Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian Process
surrogate is used as the method for investigating the objective function. One
key benefit is that during optimization the Gaussian Process learns a global
estimate of the true objective function, with predicted outcomes and a
statistical measure of confidence in areas that haven't been investigated yet.
However, standard Bayesian optimization does not perform consistently or
provide an accurate Gaussian Process surrogate function for highly volatile
objective functions. We treat these problems by introducing a novel sampling
technique called Hybrid Repeat/Multi-point Sampling. This technique gives the
AI ability to learn optimum behaviors in a highly uncertain environment. More
importantly, it not only improves the reliability of the optimization, but also
creates a better model of the entire objective surface. With this improved
model the agent is equipped to better adapt behaviors.

 <dc:description>  Human interaction recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision and
has been researched over the years due to its important applications. With the
development of deep models for the human pose estimation problem, this work
aims to verify the effectiveness of using the human pose in order to recognize
the human interaction in monocular videos. This paper developed a method based
on 5 steps: detect each person in the scene, track them, retrieve the human
pose, extract features based on the pose and finally recognize the interaction
using a classifier. The Two-Person interaction dataset was used for the
development of this methodology. Using a whole sequence evaluation approach it
achieved 87.56% of average accuracy of all interaction. Yun, et at achieved
91.10% using the same dataset, however their methodology used the depth sensor
to recognize the interaction. The methodology developed in this paper shows
that an RGB camera can be as effective as depth cameras to recognize the
interaction between two persons using the recent development of deep models to
estimate the human pose.

 <dc:title>Restless Video Bandits: Optimal SVC Streaming in a Multi-user Wireless

 <dc:creator>Panwar, Shivendra S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal scalable video delivery to
mobile users in wireless networks given arbitrary Quality Adaptation (QA)
mechanisms. In current practical systems, QA and scheduling are performed
independently by the content provider and network operator, respectively. While
most research has been focused on jointly optimizing these two tasks, the high
complexity that comes with a joint approach makes the implementation
impractical. Therefore, we present a scheduling mechanism that takes the QA
logic of each user as input and optimizes the scheduling accordingly. Hence,
there is no need for centralized QA and cross-layer interactions are minimized.
We model the QA-adaptive scheduling and the jointly optimal problem as a
Restless Bandit and a Multi-user Semi Markov Decision Process, respectively in
order to compare the loss incurred by not employing a jointly optimal scheme.
We then present heuristic algorithms in order to achieve the optimal outcome of
the Restless Bandit solution assuming the base station has knowledge of the
underlying quality adaptation of each user (QA-Aware). We also present a
simplified heuristic without the need for any higher layer knowledge at the
base station (QA-Blind). We show that our QA-Aware strategy can achieve up to
two times improvement in user network utilization compared to popular baseline
algorithms such as Proportional Fairness. We also provide a testbed
implementation of the QA-Blind scheme in order to compare it with baseline
algorithms in a real network setting.

 <dc:title>A Fast Keypoint Based Hybrid Method for Copy Move Forgery Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Copy move forgery detection in digital images has become a very popular
research topic in the area of image forensics. Due to the availability of
sophisticated image editing tools and ever increasing hardware capabilities, it
has become an easy task to manipulate the digital images. Passive forgery
detection techniques are more relevant as they can be applied without the prior
information about the image in question. Block based techniques are used to
detect copy move forgery, but have limitations of large time complexity and
sensitivity against affine operations like rotation and scaling. Keypoint based
approaches are used to detect forgery in large images where the possibility of
significant post processing operations like rotation and scaling is more. A
hybrid approach is proposed using different methods for keypoint detection and
description. Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) are used to detect the keypoints
in the image and Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK) features
are used to describe features at these keypoints. The proposed method has
performed better than the existing forgery detection method using SURF
significantly in terms of detection speed and is invariant to post processing
operations like rotation and scaling. The proposed method is also invariant to
other commonly applied post processing operations like adding Gaussian noise
and JPEG compression

 <dc:description>  This paper describes methods for evaluating automatic speech recognition
(ASR) systems in comparison with human perception results, using measures
derived from linguistic distinctive features. Error patterns in terms of
manner, place and voicing are presented, along with an examination of confusion
matrices via a distinctive-feature-distance metric. These evaluation methods
contrast with conventional performance criteria that focus on the phone or word
level, and are intended to provide a more detailed profile of ASR system
performance,as well as a means for direct comparison with human perception
results at the sub-phonemic level.

 <dc:description>  Mismatched transcriptions have been proposed as a mean to acquire
probabilistic transcriptions from non-native speakers of a language.Prior work
has demonstrated the value of these transcriptions by successfully adapting
cross-lingual ASR systems for different tar-get languages. In this work, we
describe two techniques to refine these probabilistic transcriptions: a
noisy-channel model of non-native phone misperception is trained using a
recurrent neural net-work, and decoded using minimally-resourced
language-dependent pronunciation constraints. Both innovations improve quality
of the transcript, and both innovations reduce phone error rate of a
trainedASR, by 7% and 9% respectively

 <dc:description>  Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmission is a promising
technology to improve the capacity and reliability of wireless systems.
However, the number of antennas that can be equipped at a base station (BS) is
limited by the BS form factor, posing a challenge to the deployment of massive
linear arrays. To cope with this limitation, this work discusses Full Dimension
MIMO (FD-MIMO), which is currently an active area of research and
standardization in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for evolution
towards fifth generation (5G) cellular systems. FD-MIMO utilizes an active
antenna system (AAS) with a 2D planar array structure, which provides the
ability of adaptive electronic beamforming in the 3D space. This paper presents
the design of the AAS and the ongoing efforts in the 3GPP to develop the
corresponding 3D channel model. Compact structure of large-scale antenna arrays
drastically increases the spatial correlation in FD-MIMO systems. In order to
account for its effects, the generalized spatial correlation functions for
channels constituted by individual antenna elements and overall antenna ports
in the AAS are derived. Exploiting the quasi-static channel covariance matrices
of the users, the problem of determining the optimal downtilt weight vector for
antenna ports, which maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference ratio of a
multi-user multiple-input-single-output system, is formulated as a fractional
optimization problem. A quasi-optimal solution is obtained through the
application of semi-definite relaxation and Dinkelbach's method. Finally, the
user-group specific elevation beamforming scenario is devised, which offers
significant performance gains as confirmed through simulations. These results
have direct application in the analysis of 5G FD-MIMO systems.

 <dc:description>  Two the most common tasks for autonomous mobile robots is to explore the
environment and locate a target. %In the last case, the objective is either to
find a target in the shortest time possible or, alternatively, to find %as many
targets as possible for a given amount of time. Targets could range from
sources of chemical contamination to people needing assistance in a disaster
area. From the very beginning, the quest for most efficient search algorithms
was strongly influenced by behavioral science and ecology, where researchers
try to figure out the strategies used by leaving beings, from bacteria to
mammals. Since then, bio-inspired random search algorithms remain one the most
important directions in autonomous robotics. Recently a new wave arrived
bringing a specific type of random walks as a universal search strategy
exploited by immune cells, insects, mussels, albatrosses, sharks, deers, and a
dozen of other animals including humans. These \textit{L\'{e}vy} walks combine
two key features, the ability of walkers to spread anomalously fast while
moving with a finite velocity. The latter is especially valuable in the context
of robotics because it respects the reality autonomous robots live in. There is
already an impressive body of publications on L\'{e}vy robotics; yet research
in this field is unfolding further, constantly bringing new results, ideas,
hypothesis and speculations. In this mini-review we survey the current state of
the field, list latest advances, discuss the prevailing trends, and outline
further perspectives.

 <dc:description>  Primal and dual block coordinate descent methods are iterative methods for
solving regularized and unregularized optimization problems. Distributed-memory
parallel implementations of these methods have become popular in analyzing
large machine learning datasets. However, existing implementations communicate
at every iteration which, on modern data center and supercomputing
architectures, often dominates the cost of floating-point computation. Recent
results on communication-avoiding Krylov subspace methods suggest that large
speedups are possible by re-organizing iterative algorithms to avoid
communication. We show how applying similar algorithmic transformations can
lead to primal and dual block coordinate descent methods that only communicate
every $s$ iterations--where $s$ is a tuning parameter--instead of every
iteration for the \textit{regularized least-squares problem}. We show that the
communication-avoiding variants reduce the number of synchronizations by a
factor of $s$ on distributed-memory parallel machines without altering the
convergence rate and attains strong scaling speedups of up to $6.1\times$ on a
Cray XC30 supercomputer.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies a wireless network consisting of multiple
transmitter-receiver pairs sharing the same spectrum where interference is
regarded as noise. Previously, the throughput region of such a network was
characterized for either one time slot or an infinite time horizon. This work
aims to close the gap by investigating the throughput region for transmissions
over a finite time horizon. We derive an efficient algorithm to examine the
achievability of any given rate in the finite-horizon throughput region and
provide the rate-achieving policy. The computational efficiency of our
algorithm comes from the use of A* search with a carefully chosen heuristic
function and a tree pruning strategy. We also show that the celebrated
max-weight algorithm which finds all achievable rates in the infinite-horizon
throughput region fails to work for the finite-horizon throughput region.

 <dc:description>  For many movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and ataxia, disease
progression is visually assessed by a clinician using a numerical disease
rating scale. These tests are subjective, time-consuming, and must be
administered by a professional. This can be problematic where specialists are
not available, or when a patient is not consistently evaluated by the same
clinician. We present an automated method for quantifying the severity of
motion impairment in patients with ataxia, using only video recordings. We
consider videos of the finger-to-nose test, a common movement task used as part
of the assessment of ataxia progression during the course of routine clinical
checkups.
  Our method uses neural network-based pose estimation and optical flow
techniques to track the motion of the patient's hand in a video recording. We
extract features that describe qualities of the motion such as speed and
variation in performance. Using labels provided by an expert clinician, we
train a supervised learning model that predicts severity according to the Brief
Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). The performance of our system is comparable to that
of a group of ataxia specialists in terms of mean error and correlation, and
our system's predictions were consistently within the range of inter-rater
variability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using computer vision
and machine learning to produce consistent and clinically useful measures of
motor impairment.

 <dc:description>  The success of deep neural networks hinges on our ability to accurately and
efficiently optimize high-dimensional, non-convex functions. In this paper, we
empirically investigate the loss functions of state-of-the-art networks, and
how commonly-used stochastic gradient descent variants optimize these loss
functions. To do this, we visualize the loss function by projecting them down
to low-dimensional spaces chosen based on the convergence points of different
optimization algorithms. Our observations suggest that optimization algorithms
encounter and choose different descent directions at many saddle points to find
different final weights. Based on consistency we observe across re-runs of the
same stochastic optimization algorithm, we hypothesize that each optimization
algorithm makes characteristic choices at these saddle points.

 <dc:description>  We consider a multi-user (MU) multiple-input-single-output (MISO) downlink
system with M single-antenna users and N transmit antennas with a nonlinear
power amplifier (PA) at each antenna. Instead of emitting constant envelope
(CE) signals from the antennas to have highly power efficient PAs, we relax the
CE constraint and allow the transmit signals to have instantaneous power less
than or equal to the available power at each PA. The PA power efficiency
decreases but simulation results show that the same performance in terms of
bit-error-ratio (BER) can be achieved with less transmitted power and less PA
power consumption. We propose a linear and a nonlinear precoder design to
mitigate the multi-user interference (MUI) under the constraint of a maximal
instantaneous per-antenna peak power.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks have become one of the most studied
frameworks for unsupervised learning due to their intuitive formulation. They
have also been shown to be capable of generating convincing examples in limited
domains, such as low-resolution images. However, they still prove difficult to
train in practice and tend to ignore modes of the data generating distribution.
Quantitatively capturing effects such as mode coverage and more generally the
quality of the generative model still remain elusive. We propose Generative
Adversarial Parallelization, a framework in which many GANs or their variants
are trained simultaneously, exchanging their discriminators. This eliminates
the tight coupling between a generator and discriminator, leading to improved
convergence and improved coverage of modes. We also propose an improved variant
of the recently proposed Generative Adversarial Metric and show how it can
score individual GANs or their collections under the GAP model.

 <dc:description>  Multi-task learning aims to learn multiple tasks jointly by exploiting their
relatedness to improve the generalization performance for each task.
Traditionally, to perform multi-task learning, one needs to centralize data
from all the tasks to a single machine. However, in many real-world
applications, data of different tasks may be geo-distributed over different
local machines. Due to heavy communication caused by transmitting the data and
the issue of data privacy and security, it is impossible to send data of
different task to a master machine to perform multi-task learning. Therefore,
in this paper, we propose a distributed multi-task learning framework that
simultaneously learns predictive models for each task as well as task
relationships between tasks alternatingly in the parameter server paradigm. In
our framework, we first offer a general dual form for a family of regularized
multi-task relationship learning methods. Subsequently, we propose a
communication-efficient primal-dual distributed optimization algorithm to solve
the dual problem by carefully designing local subproblems to make the dual
problem decomposable. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis
for the proposed algorithm, which is specific for distributed multi-task
relationship learning. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets to evaluate our proposed framework in terms of
effectiveness and convergence.

 <dc:description>  The first International Workshop on Verification and Validation of
Cyber-Physical Systems (V2CPS-16) was held in conjunction with the 12th
International Conference on integration of Formal Methods (iFM 2016) in
Reykjavik, Iceland. The purpose of V2CPS-16 was to bring together researchers
and experts of the fields of formal verification and cyber-physical systems
(CPS) to cover the theme of this workshop, namely a wide spectrum of
verification and validation methods including (but not limited to) control,
simulation, formal methods, etc.
  A CPS is an integration of networked computational and physical processes
with meaningful inter-effects; the former monitors, controls, and affects the
latter, while the latter also impacts the former. CPSs have applications in a
wide-range of systems spanning robotics, transportation, communication,
infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing. Many safety-critical systems such as
chemical processes, medical devices, aircraft flight control, and automotive
systems, are indeed CPS. The advanced capabilities of CPS require complex
software and synthesis algorithms, which are hard to verify. In fact, many
problems in this area are undecidable. Thus, a major step is to find particular
abstractions of such systems which might be algorithmically verifiable
regarding specific properties of such systems, describing the partial/overall
behaviors of CPSs.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate DCTNet for audio signal classification. Its
output feature is related to Cohen's class of time-frequency distributions. We
introduce the use of adaptive DCTNet (A-DCTNet) for audio signals feature
extraction. The A-DCTNet applies the idea of constant-Q transform, with its
center frequencies of filterbanks geometrically spaced. The A-DCTNet is
adaptive to different acoustic scales, and it can better capture low frequency
acoustic information that is sensitive to human audio perception than features
such as Mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSC). We use features extracted
by the A-DCTNet as input for classifiers. Experimental results show that the
A-DCTNet and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) achieve state-of-the-art
performance in bird song classification rate, and improve artist identification
accuracy in music data. They demonstrate A-DCTNet's applicability to signal
processing problems.

 <dc:description>  In the Colonel Blotto game, which was initially introduced by Borel in 1921,
two colonels simultaneously distribute their troops across different
battlefields. The winner of each battlefield is determined independently by a
winner-take-all rule. The ultimate payoff of each colonel is the number of
battlefields he wins. This game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range of
applications such as the U.S presidential election, innovative technology
competitions, advertisements, etc. There have been persistent efforts for
finding the optimal strategies for the Colonel Blotto game. After almost a
century Ahmadinejad, Dehghani, Hajiaghayi, Lucier, Mahini, and Seddighin
provided a poly-time algorithm for finding the optimal strategies. They first
model the problem by a Linear Program (LP) and use Ellipsoid method to solve
it. However, despite the theoretical importance of their algorithm, it is
highly impractical. In general, even Simplex method (despite its exponential
running-time) performs better than Ellipsoid method in practice. In this paper,
we provide the first polynomial-size LP formulation of the optimal strategies
for the Colonel Blotto game. We use linear extension techniques. Roughly
speaking, we project the strategy space polytope to a higher dimensional space,
which results in a lower number of facets for the polytope. We use this
polynomial-size LP to provide a novel, simpler and significantly faster
algorithm for finding the optimal strategies for the Colonel Blotto game. We
further show this representation is asymptotically tight in terms of the number
of constraints. We also extend our approach to multi-dimensional Colonel Blotto
games, and implement our algorithm to observe interesting properties of Colonel
Blotto; for example, we observe the behavior of players in the discrete model
is very similar to the previously studied continuous model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the probabilistic caching for an $N$-tier wireless
heterogeneous network (HetNet) using stochastic geometry. A general and
tractable expression of the successful delivery probability (SDP) is first
derived. We then optimize the caching probabilities for maximizing the SDP in
the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The problem is proved to be convex
and solved efficiently. We next establish an interesting connection between
$N$-tier HetNets and single-tier networks. Unlike the single-tier network where
the optimal performance only depends on the cache size, the optimal performance
of $N$-tier HetNets depends also on the BS densities. The performance upper
bound is, however, determined by an equivalent single-tier network. We further
show that with uniform caching probabilities regardless of content
popularities, to achieve a target SDP, the BS density of a tier can be reduced
by increasing the cache size of the tier when the cache size is larger than a
threshold; otherwise the BS density and BS cache size can be increased
simultaneously. It is also found analytically that the BS density of a tier is
inverse to the BS cache size of the same tier and is linear to BS cache sizes
of other tiers.

 <dc:description>  The vanishing and exploding gradient problems are well-studied obstacles that
make it difficult for recurrent neural networks to learn long-term time
dependencies. We propose a reparameterization of standard recurrent neural
networks to update linear transformations in a provably norm-preserving way
through Givens rotations. Additionally, we use the absolute value function as
an element-wise non-linearity to preserve the norm of backpropagated signals
over the entire network. We show that this reparameterization reduces the
number of parameters and maintains the same algorithmic complexity as a
standard recurrent neural network, while outperforming standard recurrent
neural networks with orthogonal initializations and Long Short-Term Memory
networks on the copy problem.

 <dc:title>Construction of Full-Diversity LDPC Lattices for Block-Fading Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  LDPC lattices were the first family of lattices which have an efficient
decoding algorithm in high dimensions over an AWGN channel. Considering
Construction D' of lattices with one binary LDPC code as underlying code gives
the well known Construction A LDPC lattices or 1-level LDPC lattices.
Block-fading channel (BF) is a useful model for various wireless communication
channels in both indoor and outdoor environments. Frequency-hopping schemes and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can conveniently be modelled
as block-fading channels. Applying lattices in this type of channel entails
dividing a lattice point into multiple blocks such that fading is constant
within a block but changes, independently, across blocks. The design of
lattices for BF channels offers a challenging problem, which differs greatly
from its counterparts like AWGN channels. Recently, the original binary
Construction A for lattices, due to Forney, have been generalized to a lattice
construction from totally real and complex multiplication fields. This
generalized Construction A of lattices provides signal space diversity
intrinsically, which is the main requirement for the signal sets designed for
fading channels. In this paper we construct full diversity LDPC lattices for
block-fading channels using Construction A over totally real number fields. We
propose a new iterative decoding method for these family of lattices which has
complexity that grows linearly in the dimension of the lattice. In order to
implement our decoding algorithm, we propose the definition of a parity check
matrix and Tanner graph for full diversity Construction A lattices. We also
prove that the constructed LDPC lattices together with the proposed decoding
method admit diversity order n-1 over an n-block-fading channel.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great potential for
numerous real-world machine learning applications, but performing inference in
large CNNs in real-time remains a challenge. We have previously demonstrated
that traditional CNNs can be converted into deep spiking neural networks
(SNNs), which exhibit similar accuracy while reducing both latency and
computational load as a consequence of their data-driven, event-based style of
computing. Here we provide a novel theory that explains why this conversion is
successful, and derive from it several new tools to convert a larger and more
powerful class of deep networks into SNNs. We identify the main sources of
approximation errors in previous conversion methods, and propose simple
mechanisms to fix these issues. Furthermore, we develop spiking implementations
of common CNN operations such as max-pooling, softmax, and batch-normalization,
which allow almost loss-less conversion of arbitrary CNN architectures into the
spiking domain. Empirical evaluation of different network architectures on the
MNIST and CIFAR10 benchmarks leads to the best SNN results reported to date.

 <dc:title>Data Gathering from Path Constrained Mobile Sensors Using Data MULE</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) sensor nodes are deployed to sense useful
data from environment. Sensors are energy-constrained devices. To prolong the
sensor network lifetime, now a days mobile robots (sometimes refer as data
sink, data mules, or data collectors) are used for collecting the sensed data
from the sensors. In this environment sensor nodes directly transfer their
sensed data to the data mules. Sensed data are sometime time sensitive;
therefore, the data should be collected within a predefined period. Hence,
depending on the speed of the data mules the trajectory lengths of the data
mules have upper limits. In this paper an approximation algorithm is proposed
for collecting data from the mobile sensors using mobile data collectors

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art i-vector based speaker verification relies on variants of
Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) for discriminant analysis. We
are mainly motivated by the recent work of the joint Bayesian (JB) method,
which is originally proposed for discriminant analysis in face verification. We
apply JB to speaker verification and make three contributions beyond the
original JB. 1) In contrast to the EM iterations with approximated statistics
in the original JB, the EM iterations with exact statistics are employed and
give better performance. 2) We propose to do simultaneous diagonalization (SD)
of the within-class and between-class covariance matrices to achieve efficient
testing, which has broader application scope than the SVD-based efficient
testing method in the original JB. 3) We scrutinize similarities and
differences between various Gaussian PLDAs and JB, complementing the previous
analysis of comparing JB only with Prince-Elder PLDA. Extensive experiments are
conducted on NIST SRE10 core condition 5, empirically validating the
superiority of JB with faster convergence rate and 9-13% EER reduction compared
with state-of-the-art PLDA.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In optical wireless scattering communication, received signal in each symbol
interval is captured by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and then sampled through
very short but finite interval sampling. The resulting samples form a signal
vector for symbol detection. The upper and lower bounds on transmission rate of
such a processing system are studied. It is shown that the gap between two
bounds approaches zero as the thermal noise and shot noise variances approach
zero. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) signal detection is performed and a low
computational complexity receiver is derived under piecewise polynomial
approximation. Meanwhile, the threshold based signal detection is also studied,
where two threshold selection rules are proposed based on the detection error
probability and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. For the latter, it is shown
that the KL distance is not sensitive to the threshold selection for small shot
and thermal noise variances, and thus the threshold can be selected among a
wide range without significant loss from the optimal KL distance. The
performances of the transmission rate bounds, the signal detection, and the
threshold selection approaches are evaluated by the numerical results.

algorithm is based on a system model where an overall noise term describes
both, the measurement noise and the noise resulting from the model
uncertainties. This overall noise term is a function of the true parameter

applied on structured as well as unstructured models and it outperforms prior

 <dc:description>  User-given tags or labels are valuable resources for semantic understanding
of visual media such as images and videos. Recently, a new type of labeling
mechanism known as hash-tags have become increasingly popular on social media
sites. In this paper, we study the problem of generating relevant and useful
hash-tags for short video clips. Traditional data-driven approaches for tag
enrichment and recommendation use direct visual similarity for label transfer
and propagation. We attempt to learn a direct low-cost mapping from video to
hash-tags using a two step training process. We first employ a natural language
processing (NLP) technique, skip-gram models with neural network training to
learn a low-dimensional vector representation of hash-tags (Tag2Vec) using a
corpus of 10 million hash-tags. We then train an embedding function to map
video features to the low-dimensional Tag2vec space. We learn this embedding
for 29 categories of short video clips with hash-tags. A query video without
any tag-information can then be directly mapped to the vector space of tags
using the learned embedding and relevant tags can be found by performing a
simple nearest-neighbor retrieval in the Tag2Vec space. We validate the
relevance of the tags suggested by our system qualitatively and quantitatively
with a user study.

 <dc:description>  Social event detection in a static image is a very challenging problem and
it's very useful for internet of things applications including automatic photo
organization, ads recommender system, or image captioning. Several publications
show that variety of objects, scene, and people can be very ambiguous for the
system to decide the event that occurs in the image. We proposed the spatial
pyramid configuration of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for
social event detection in a static image. By applying the spatial pyramid

observe more accurately by the classifier. USED dataset provided by Ahmad et

 <dc:title>Green OFDMA Resource Allocation in Cache-Enabled CRAN</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Stephen, Reuben George</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Rui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cloud radio access network (CRAN), in which remote radio heads (RRHs) are
deployed to serve users in a target area, and connected to a central processor
(CP) via limited-capacity links termed the fronthaul, is a promising candidate
for the next-generation wireless communication systems. Due to the
content-centric nature of future wireless communications, it is desirable to
cache popular contents beforehand at the RRHs, to reduce the burden on the
fronthaul and achieve energy saving through cooperative transmission. This
motivates our study in this paper on the energy efficient transmission in an
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based CRAN with multiple
RRHs and users, where the RRHs can prefetch popular contents. We consider a
joint optimization of the user-SC assignment, RRH selection and transmit power
allocation over all the SCs to minimize the total transmit power of the RRHs,
subject to the RRHs' individual fronthaul capacity constraints and the users'
minimum rate constraints, while taking into account the caching status at the
RRHs. Although the problem is non-convex, we propose a Lagrange duality based
solution, which can be efficiently computed with good accuracy. We compare the
minimum transmit power required by the proposed algorithm with different
caching strategies against the case without caching by simulations, which show
the significant energy saving with caching.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of representing multidimensional data where the
domain of each dimension is organized hierarchically, and the queries require
summary information at a different node in the hierarchy of each dimension.
This is the typical case of OLAP databases. A basic approach is to represent
each hierarchy as a one-dimensional line and recast the queries as
multidimensional range queries. This approach can be implemented compactly by
generalizing to more dimensions the $k^2$-treap, a compact representation of
two-dimensional points that allows for efficient summarization queries along
generic ranges. Instead, we propose a more flexible generalization, which
instead of a generic quadtree-like partition of the space, follows the domain
hierarchies across each dimension to organize the partitioning. The resulting
structure is much more efficient than a generic multidimensional structure,
since queries are resolved by aggregating much fewer nodes of the tree.

 <dc:title>Setting the Foundations for PoP-Based Internet Evolution Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zilberman, Noa</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shavitt, Yuval</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Developing an evolution model of the Internet has been a long standing
research challenge. Such a model can improve the design and placement of
communication infrastructure, reducing costs and improving users' quality of
experience. While communication infrastructure is tightly coupled to
geographical locations, Internet modelling and forecasting in the last decade
used network elements that are only loosely bounded to any geographical
location. In this paper we set the foundations for developing an evolution
model of the Internet based on the Point of Presence (PoP) level. As PoPs have
a strong geographical grip they can better represent the evolution of the
Internet. We annotate the PoP topologies of the Internet with geographical,
economic and demographic information to achieve an understanding of the
dynamics of the Internet's structure, in order to identify the constitutive
laws of Internet evolution. We identify GDP as the strongest indicator on the
country level, and the size of the TV market as the strongest indicator on the
US metropolitan level. Finally, we draw attention to the limitations of
developing a world-wide evolution model.

 <dc:title>An attack against the Helios election system that exploits re-voting</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Election systems must ensure that representatives are chosen by voters.
Moreover, each voter should have equal influence. Traditionally, this has been
achieved by permitting voters to cast at most one ballot. More recently, this
has been achieved by counting the last ballot cast by each voter. We show that
the Helios election system fails to achieve this, because an adversary can
cause a ballot other than a voter's last to be counted. Moreover, we show how
the adversary can choose the contents of such ballots, thus the adversary can
unduly influence the selection of representatives.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This MSc dissertation considers the effects of the current corporate interest
on researchers in the field of machine learning. Situated within the field's
cyclical history of academic, public and corporate interest, this dissertation
investigates how current researchers view recent developments and negotiate
their own research practices within an environment of increased commercial
interest and funding. The original research consists of in-depth interviews
with 12 machine learning researchers working in both academia and industry.
Building on theory from science, technology and society studies, this
dissertation problematizes the traditional narratives of the neoliberalization
of academic research by allowing the researchers themselves to discuss how
their career choices, working environments and interactions with others in the
field have been affected by the reinvigorated corporate interest of recent
years.

movements inside of an unmodified live cell. We used a time-lapse image series
obtained using wide-field bright-field photon transmission microscopy as an
algorithm input. The benefit of the algorithm is the application of the R\'enyi
information entropy, namely a variable called a point information gain, which
enables to highlight the borders of the intracellular organelles and to
localize the organelles' centers of mass with the precision of one pixel.

 <dc:description>  Despite their attractiveness, popular perception is that techniques for
nonparametric function approximation do not scale to streaming data due to an
intractable growth in the amount of storage they require. To solve this problem
in a memory-affordable way, we propose an online technique based on functional
stochastic gradient descent in tandem with supervised sparsification based on
greedy function subspace projections. The method, called parsimonious online
learning with kernels (POLK), provides a controllable tradeoff? between its
solution accuracy and the amount of memory it requires. We derive conditions
under which the generated function sequence converges almost surely to the
optimal function, and we establish that the memory requirement remains finite.
We evaluate POLK for kernel multi-class logistic regression and kernel
hinge-loss classification on three canonical data sets: a synthetic Gaussian
mixture model, the MNIST hand-written digits, and the Brodatz texture database.
On all three tasks, we observe a favorable tradeoff of objective function
evaluation, classification performance, and complexity of the nonparametric
regressor extracted the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a new knowledge discovery method
that is used for text mining, signal processing, bioinformatics, and consumer
analysis. However, its basic property as a learning machine is not yet
clarified, as it is not a regular statistical model, resulting that theoretical
optimization method of NMF has not yet established. In this paper, we study the
real log canonical threshold of NMF and give an upper bound of the
generalization error in Bayesian learning. The results show that the
generalization error of the matrix factorization can be made smaller than
regular statistical models if Bayesian learning is applied.

 <dc:description>  We present an architecture for information extraction from text that augments
an existing parser with a character-level neural network. The network is
trained using a measure of consistency of extracted data with existing
databases as a form of noisy supervision. Our architecture combines the ability
of constraint-based information extraction systems to easily incorporate domain
knowledge and constraints with the ability of deep neural networks to leverage
large amounts of data to learn complex features. Boosting the existing parser's
precision, the system led to large improvements over a mature and highly tuned
constraint-based production information extraction system used at Bloomberg for
financial language text.

estimation. A lower bound on the spectral efficiency (SE) of any combining
scheme is derived, under imperfect covariance knowledge, and a closed-form
expression is computed for maximum-ratio combin- ing. We show that having
covariance information is not critical, but that it is relatively easy to
acquire it and to achieve SE close to the ideal case of having perfect
statistical information.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for estimation
of a lens-embedded antenna array with deterministic parameters. Unlike CRLB of
uniform linear array (ULA), it is noted that CRLB for direction of arrival
(DoA) of lens-embedded antenna array is dominated by not only angle but
characteristics of lens. Derivation is based on the approximation that
amplitude of received signal with lens is approximated to Gaussian function. We
confirmed that parameters needed to design a lens can be derived by standard
deviation of Gaussian, which represents characteristic of received signal, by
simulation of beam propagation method. Well-designed lens antenna shows better
performance than ULA in terms of estimating DoA. This is a useful derivation
because, result can be the guideline for designing parameters of lens to
satisfy certain purpose.

 <dc:description>  The detection of face-screen distance on smartphone (i.e., the distance
between the user face and the smartphone screen) is of paramount importance for
many mobile applications, including dynamic adjustment of screen on-off, screen
resolution, screen luminance, font size, with the purposes of power saving,
protection of human eyesight, etc. Existing detection techniques for
face-screen distance depend on external or internal hardware, e.g., an
accessory plug-in sensor (e.g., infrared or ultrasonic sensors) to measure the
face-screen distance, a built-in proximity sensor that usually outputs a
coarse-grained, two-valued, proximity index (for the purpose of powering on/off
the screen), etc. In this paper, we present a fine-grained detection method,
called &quot;Look Into My Eyes (LIME)&quot;, that utilizes the front camera and inertial
accelerometer of the smartphone to estimate the facescreen distance.
Specifically, LIME captures the photo of the user's face only when the
accelerometer detects certain motion patterns of mobile phones, and then
estimates the face-screen distance by looking at the distance between the
user's eyes. Besides, LIME is able to take care of the user experience when
multiple users are facing the phone screen. The experimental results show that
LIME can achieve a mean squared error smaller than 2.4 cm in all of
experimented scenarios, and it incurs a small cost on battery life when
integrated into an SMS application for enabling dynamic font size by detecting
the face-screen distance.

research is to explore the potential of supervised machine learning in
face-induced social computing and cognition, riding on the momentum of much
heralded successes of face processing, analysis and recognition on the tasks of
biometric-based identification. We present a case study of automated
statistical inference on sociopsychological perceptions of female faces
controlled for race, attractiveness, age and nationality. Our empirical
evidences point to the possibility of training machine learning algorithms,
using example face images characterized by internet users, to predict
perceptions of personality traits and demeanors.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Allowing swift release cycles, Continuous Delivery has become popular in
application software development and is starting to be applied in
safety-critical domains such as the automotive industry. These domains require
thorough analysis regarding safety constraints, which can be achieved by formal
verification and the execution of safety tests resulting from a safety analysis
on the product. With continuous delivery in place, such tests need to be
executed with every build to ensure the latest software still fulfills all
safety requirements. Even more though, the safety analysis has to be updated
with every change to ensure the safety test suite is still up-to-date. We thus
propose that a safety analysis should be treated no differently from other
deliverables such as source-code and dependencies, formulate guidelines on how
to achieve this and advert areas where future research is needed.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power
Transfer (SWIPT) over a fading multiple access channel with additive Gaussian
noise. The transmitters as well as the receiver harvest energy from ambient
sources. We assume that the transmitters have two classes of data to send, viz.
delay sensitive and delay tolerant data. Each transmitter sends the delay
sensitive data at a certain minimum rate irrespective of the channel conditions
(fading states). In addition, if the channel conditions are good, the delay
tolerant data is sent. {Along with data, the transmitters also transfer power
to aid the receiver in meeting its energy requirements.} In this setting, we
characterize the \textit{minimum-rate capacity region} which provides the
fundamental limit of transferring information and power simultaneously with
minimum rate guarantees. Owing to the limitations of current technology, these
limits might not be achievable in practice. Among the practical receiver
structures proposed for SWIPT in literature, two popular architectures are the
\textit{time switching} and \textit{power splitting} receivers. For each of
these architectures, we derive the minimum-rate capacity regions. We show that
power splitting receivers although more complex, provide a larger capacity
region.

 <dc:title>Models of retrieval in sentence comprehension: A computational

 <dc:description>  Research on interference has provided evidence that the formation of
dependencies between non-adjacent words relies on a cue-based retrieval
mechanism. Two different models can account for one of the main predictions of
interference, i.e., a slowdown at a retrieval site, when several items share a
feature associated with a retrieval cue: Lewis and Vasishth's (2005)
activation-based model and McElree's (2000) direct access model. Even though
these two models have been used almost interchangeably, they are based on
different assumptions and predict differences in the relationship between
reading times and response accuracy. The activation-based model follows the
assumptions of ACT-R, and its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race
between accumulators of evidence with a single variance. Under this model,
accuracy of the retrieval is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval
time by its rate of accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes
a model of memory where only the probability of retrieval varies between items;
in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of the possibility and
repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented both models in a Bayesian
hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them and compare them. We show that
some aspects of the data are better fit under the direct access model than
under the activation-based model. We suggest that this finding does not rule
out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving as a race model with
assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the ACT-R framework. We show
that by introducing a modification of the activation model, i.e, by assuming
that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of incorrect items is not only
slower but noisier (i.e., different variances for the correct and incorrect
items), the model can provide a fit as good as the one of the direct access
model.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider a scenario wherein an energy harvesting wireless
radio equipment sends information to multiple receivers alongside powering
them. In addition to harvesting the incoming radio frequency (RF) energy, the
receivers also harvest energy from {its environment (e.g., solar energy)}. This
communication framework is captured by a fading Gaussian Broadcast Channel
(GBC) with energy harvesting transmitter and receivers. In order to ensure
{some quality of service (QoS)} in data reception among the receivers, we
impose a \textit{minimum-rate} requirement on data transmission. For the
setting in place, we characterize the fundamental limits in jointly
transmitting information and power subject to a QoS guarantee, for three
cardinal receiver structures namely, \textit{ideal}, \textit{time-switching}
and \textit{power-splitting}. We show that a time-switching receiver can
{switch} between {information reception mode} and {energy harvesting mode},
\textit{without} the transmitter's knowledge of the same and \textit{without}
any extra \textit{rate loss}. We also prove that, for the same amount of power
transferred, on average, a power-splitting receiver supports higher data rates
compared to a time-switching receiver.

 <dc:description>  This is a manifesto for DEMoS, which is a Distributed Embedded Modular
System, but also a manifesto addressing the need for more
inter-/cross-disciplinary mastery of working knowledge related to installing
this class of systems in the real world. There is somehow room for yet another
class of systems - complementary to existing embedded systems - complementing
distributed operating systems - which takes on an interdisciplinary
cyber-physical-materiality approach, a dedicated holistic perspective that
recognizes the true value of interdisciplinary mastery vs. the implicit and
overlooked expense of narrow intra-disciplinary focus dominating much of
systems development (e.g. EE, CE, CS, SE, and IS). Interdisciplinary mastery
yields its accumulated value across the development, deployment, use, re-use,
and decommission phases for this class of systems: DEMoS is a system
architected to be locally distributed, embedded, and modular as outlined herein
and with the additional goals of human interdisciplinary mastery in this
context: A potential set of goals for developing and applying DEMoS can be
found in UN Resolution 70/1.

 <dc:description>  Continuous improvement in silicon process technologies has made possible the
integration of hundreds of cores on a single chip. However, power and heat have
become dominant constraints in designing these massive multicore chips causing
issues with reliability, timing variations and reduced lifetime of the chips.
Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) is a solution to avoid high temperatures on
the die. Typical DTM schemes only address core level thermal issues. However,
the Network-on-chip (NoC) paradigm, which has emerged as an enabling
methodology for integrating hundreds to thousands of cores on the same die can
contribute significantly to the thermal issues. Moreover, the typical DTM is
triggered reactively based on temperature measurements from on-chip thermal
sensor requiring long reaction times whereas predictive DTM method estimates
future temperature in advance, eliminating the chance of temperature overshoot.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used in various domains for
modeling and prediction with high accuracy due to its ability to learn and
adapt. This thesis concentrates on designing an ANN prediction engine to
predict the thermal profile of the cores and Network-on-Chip elements of the
chip. This thermal profile of the chip is then used by the predictive DTM that
combines both core level and network level DTM techniques. On-chip wireless
interconnect which is recently envisioned to enable energy-efficient data
exchange between cores in a multicore environment, will be used to provide a
broadcast-capable medium to efficiently distribute thermal control messages to
trigger and manage the DTM schemes.

 <dc:description>  We investigate parameterizations of both database instances and queries that
make query evaluation fixed-parameter tractable in combined complexity. We
introduce a new Datalog fragment with stratified negation,
intensional-clique-guarded Datalog (ICG-Datalog), with linear-time evaluation
on structures of bounded treewidth for programs of bounded rule size. Such
programs capture in particular conjunctive queries with simplicial
decompositions of bounded width, guarded negation fragment queries of bounded
CQ-rank, or two-way regular path queries. Our result proceeds via compilation
to alternating two-way automata, whose semantics is defined via cyclic
provenance circuits (cycluits) that can be tractably evaluated. Last, we prove
that probabilistic query evaluation remains intractable in combined complexity
under this parameterization.

gives a matrix multiplication algorithm with time complexity $n^2(\log \log
n)^{O((\log \log n)^2)}$.

 <dc:description>  We present a new Compact Trip Representation (CTR) that allows us to manage
users' trips (moving objects) over networks. These could be public
transportation networks (buses, subway, trains, and so on) where nodes are
stations or stops, or road networks where nodes are intersections. CTR
represents the sequences of nodes and time instants in users' trips. The
spatial component is handled with a data structure based on the well-known
Compressed Suffix Array (CSA), which provides both a compact representation and
interesting indexing capabilities. We also represent the temporal component of
the trips, that is, the time instants when users visit nodes in their trips. We
create a sequence with these time instants, which are then self-indexed with a
balanced Wavelet Matrix (WM). This gives us the ability to solve range-interval
queries efficiently. We show how CTR can solve relevant spatial and
spatio-temporal queries over large sets of trajectories. Finally, we also
provide experimental results to show the space requirements and query
efficiency of CTR.

 <dc:description>  Previous machine comprehension (MC) datasets are either too small to train
end-to-end deep learning models, or not difficult enough to evaluate the
ability of current MC techniques. The newly released SQuAD dataset alleviates
these limitations, and gives us a chance to develop more realistic MC models.
Based on this dataset, we propose a Multi-Perspective Context Matching (MPCM)
model, which is an end-to-end system that directly predicts the answer
beginning and ending points in a passage. Our model first adjusts each
word-embedding vector in the passage by multiplying a relevancy weight computed
against the question. Then, we encode the question and weighted passage by
using bi-directional LSTMs. For each point in the passage, our model matches
the context of this point against the encoded question from multiple
perspectives and produces a matching vector. Given those matched vectors, we
employ another bi-directional LSTM to aggregate all the information and predict
the beginning and ending points. Experimental result on the test set of SQuAD
shows that our model achieves a competitive result on the leaderboard.

 <dc:description>  Recently millimeter-wave bands have been postulated as a means to accommodate
the foreseen extreme bandwidth demands in vehicular communications, which
result from the dissemination of sensory data to nearby vehicles for enhanced
environmental awareness and improved safety level. However, the literature is
particularly scarce in regards to principled resource allocation schemes that
deal with the challenging radio conditions posed by the high mobility of
vehicular scenarios. In this work we propose a novel framework that blends
together Matching Theory and Swarm Intelligence to dynamically and efficiently
pair vehicles and optimize both transmission and reception beamwidths. This is
done by jointly considering Channel State Information (CSI) and Queue State
Information (QSI) when establishing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. To validate
the proposed framework, simulation results are presented and discussed where
the throughput performance as well as the latency/reliability trade-offs of the
proposed approach are assessed and compared to several baseline approaches
recently proposed in the literature. The results obtained in our study show
performance gains in terms of reliability and delay up to 25% for ultra-dense
vehicular scenarios and on average 50% more paired vehicles that some of the
baselines. These results shed light on the operational limits and practical
feasibility of mmWave bands, as a viable radio access solution for future
high-rate V2V communications.

 <dc:description>  Current CFD calibration work has mainly focused on the CFD model calibration.
However no known work has considered the calibration of the CFD results. In
this paper, we take inspiration from the image editing problem to develop a
methodology to calibrate CFD simulation results based on sparse sensor
observations. We formulate the calibration of CFD results as an optimization
problem. The cost function consists of two terms. One term guarantees a good
local adjustment of the simulation results based on the sparse sensor
observations. The other term transmits the adjustment from local regions around
sensing locations to the global domain. The proposed method can enhance the CFD
simulation results while preserving the overall original profile. An experiment
in an air-conditioned room was implemented to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. In the experiment, four sensor observations were used to
calibrate a simulated thermal map with 167x365 data points. The experimental
results show that the proposed method is effective and practical.

 <dc:description>  Reconstruction of signals from compressively sensed measurements is an
ill-posed problem. In this paper, we leverage the recurrent generative model,
RIDE, as an image prior for compressive image reconstruction. Recurrent
networks can model long-range dependencies in images and hence are suitable to
handle global multiplexing in reconstruction from compressive imaging. We
perform MAP inference with RIDE using back-propagation to the inputs and
projected gradient method. We propose an entropy thresholding based approach
for preserving texture in images well. Our approach shows superior
reconstructions compared to recent global reconstruction approaches like D-AMP
and TVAL3 on both simulated and real data.

 <dc:description>  License Assisted Access (LAA) LTE (LTE-LAA) is a new type of LTE that
aggregates the licensed LTE bands with the unlicensed bands via carrier
aggregation. To operate in unlicensed bands, LTE-LAA adopts the
listen-before-talk policy and designs its channel access mechanism similar to
WLAN's DCF. In this paper, we consider an LAA network consisting of an LTE-LAA
eNB coexisting with a Wi-Fi STA, and capture the {\em asymmetric hidden
terminal problem} where the eNB recognizes the STA while the opposite is not
true, which is caused by the asymmetric CCA thresholds between them. We model
the network as a joint Markov chain (MC) consisting of two individual MCs, and
derive its steady-state probabilities, throughput, and channel access delay
along with other key metrics like transmit, busy, collision, and doubling
probabilities. Through extensive evaluation, we confirm that the proposed model
well predicts the dynamics of the LAA network, and identify important design
guidelines for fair coexistence between LTE-LAA and WLAN as follows. First,
LTE-LAA should design its contention window (CW) doubling policy by considering
Wi-Fi's packet duration and subframe-dependent collision probabilities. Second,
there exists a tradeoff between throughput and channel access delay, according
to which the CW doubling policy should be adapted.

 <dc:description>  Motivation: Biological data and knowledge bases increasingly rely on Semantic
Web technologies and the use of knowledge graphs for data integration,
retrieval and federated queries. In the past years, feature learning methods
that are applicable to graph-structured data are becoming available, but have
not yet widely been applied and evaluated on structured biological knowledge.
Results: We develop a novel method for feature learning on biological knowledge
graphs. Our method combines symbolic methods, in particular knowledge
representation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural
networks to generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related information
within knowledge graphs. Through the use of symbolic logic, these embeddings
contain both explicit and implicit information. We apply these embeddings to
the prediction of edges in the knowledge graph representing problems of
function prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein-protein
interactions, or drug target relations, and demonstrate performance that
matches and sometimes outperforms traditional approaches based on manually
crafted features. Our method can be applied to any biological knowledge graph,
and will thereby open up the increasing amount of Semantic Web based knowledge
bases in biology to use in machine learning and data analytics. Availability

 <dc:description>  Supervised learning with a deep convolutional neural network is used to
identify the QCD equation of state (EoS) employed in relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations of heavy-ion collisions from the simulated final-state particle
spectra $\rho(p_T,\Phi)$. High-level correlations of $\rho(p_T,\Phi)$ learned
by the neural network act as an effective &quot;EoS-meter&quot; in detecting the nature
of the QCD transition. The EoS-meter is model independent and insensitive to
other simulation inputs, especially the initial conditions. Thus it provides a
powerful direct-connection of heavy-ion collision observables with the bulk
properties of QCD.

 <dc:description>  Emails today are often encrypted, but only between mail servers---the vast
majority of emails are exposed in plaintext to the mail servers that handle
them. While better than no encryption, this arrangement leaves open the
possibility of attacks, privacy violations, and other disclosures. Publicly,
email providers have stated that default end-to-end encryption would conflict
with essential functions (spam filtering, etc.), because the latter requires
analyzing email text. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that there is no
conflict. We do so by designing, implementing, and evaluating Pretzel. Starting
from a cryptographic protocol that enables two parties to jointly perform a
classification task without revealing their inputs to each other, Pretzel
refines and adapts this protocol to the email context. Our experimental
evaluation of a prototype demonstrates that email can be encrypted end-to-end
\emph{and} providers can compute over it, at tolerable cost: clients must
devote some storage and processing, and provider overhead is roughly 5 times
versus the status quo.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we define and study a family of codes which come close to be
MRD codes, so we call them AMRD codes (almost MRD). An AMRD code is a code with
rank defect equal to 1. AMRD codes whose duals are AMRD are called dually AMRD.
Dually AMRD codes are the closest to the MRD codes given that both they and
their dual codes are almost optimal. Necessary and sufficient conditions for
the codes to be dually AMRD are given. Furthermore we show that dually AMRD
codes and codes of rank defect one and maximum 2-generalized weight coincide
when the size of the matrix divides the dimension.

(FTL). The simulator also allows a comprehensive fault injection for testing
the reliability of the FTL. Compared against a real FPGA implementation, the
simulator's response time deviation is under 0.28% on average, with a maximum
of 10.12%.

 <dc:title>Application of Advanced Record Linkage Techniques for Complex Population
  Reconstruction</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Record linkage is the process of identifying records that refer to the same
entities from several databases. This process is challenging because commonly
no unique entity identifiers are available. Linkage therefore has to rely on
partially identifying attributes, such as names and addresses of people. Recent
years have seen the development of novel techniques for linking data from
diverse application areas, where a major focus has been on linking complex data
that contain records about different types of entities. Advanced approaches
that exploit both the similarities between record attributes as well as the
relationships between entities to identify clusters of matching records have
been developed.
  In this application paper we study the novel problem where rather than
different types of entities we have databases where the same entity can have
different roles, and where these roles change over time. We specifically
develop novel techniques for linking historical birth, death, marriage and
census records with the aim to reconstruct the population covered by these
records over a period of several decades. Our experimental evaluation on real
Scottish data shows that even with advanced linkage techniques that consider
group, relationship, and temporal aspects it is challenging to achieve high
quality linkage from such complex data.

 <dc:description>  Coalition formation typically involves the coming together of multiple,
heterogeneous, agents to achieve both their individual and collective goals. In
this paper, we focus on a special case of coalition formation known as
Graph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) whereby a network connecting the
agents constrains the formation of coalitions. We focus on this type of problem
given that in many real-world applications, agents may be connected by a
communication network or only trust certain peers in their social network. We
propose a novel representation of this problem based on the concept of edge
contraction, which allows us to model the search space induced by the GCCF
problem as a rooted tree. Then, we propose an anytime solution algorithm
(CFSS), which is particularly efficient when applied to a general class of
characteristic functions called $m+a$ functions. Moreover, we show how CFSS can
be efficiently parallelised to solve GCCF using a non-redundant partition of
the search space. We benchmark CFSS on both synthetic and realistic scenarios,
using a real-world dataset consisting of the energy consumption of a large
number of households in the UK. Our results show that, in the best case, the
serial version of CFSS is 4 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the
art, while the parallel version is 9.44 times faster than the serial version on
a 12-core machine. Moreover, CFSS is the first approach to provide anytime
approximate solutions with quality guarantees for very large systems of agents
(i.e., with more than 2700 agents).

 <dc:description>  An important theorem of Banaszczyk (Random Structures &amp; Algorithms `98)
states that for any sequence of vectors of $\ell_2$ norm at most $1/5$ and any
convex body $K$ of Gaussian measure $1/2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a
signed combination of these vectors which lands inside $K$. A major open
problem is to devise a constructive version of Banaszczyk's vector balancing
theorem, i.e. to find an efficient algorithm which constructs the signed
combination.
  We make progress towards this goal along several fronts. As our first
contribution, we show an equivalence between Banaszczyk's theorem and the
existence of $O(1)$-subgaussian distributions over signed combinations. For the
case of symmetric convex bodies, our equivalence implies the existence of a
universal signing algorithm (i.e. independent of the body), which simply
samples from the subgaussian sign distribution and checks to see if the
associated combination lands inside the body. For asymmetric convex bodies, we
provide a novel recentering procedure, which allows us to reduce to the case
where the body is symmetric.
  As our second main contribution, we show that the above framework can be
efficiently implemented when the vectors have length $O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$,
recovering Banaszczyk's results under this stronger assumption. More precisely,
we use random walk techniques to produce the required $O(1)$-subgaussian
signing distributions when the vectors have length $O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$, and
use a stochastic gradient ascent method to implement the recentering procedure
for asymmetric bodies.

 <dc:description>  A key requirement for the current generation of artificial decision-makers is
that they should adapt well to changes in unexpected situations. This paper
addresses the situation in which an AI for aerial dog fighting, with tunable
parameters that govern its behavior, must optimize behavior with respect to an
objective function that is evaluated and learned through simulations. Bayesian
optimization with a Gaussian Process surrogate is used as the method for
investigating the objective function. One key benefit is that during
optimization, the Gaussian Process learns a global estimate of the true
objective function, with predicted outcomes and a statistical measure of
confidence in areas that haven't been investigated yet. Having a model of the
objective function is important for being able to understand possible outcomes
in the decision space; for example this is crucial for training and providing
feedback to human pilots. However, standard Bayesian optimization does not
perform consistently or provide an accurate Gaussian Process surrogate function
for highly volatile objective functions. We treat these problems by introducing
a novel sampling technique called Hybrid Repeat/Multi-point Sampling. This
technique gives the AI ability to learn optimum behaviors in a highly uncertain
environment. More importantly, it not only improves the reliability of the
optimization, but also creates a better model of the entire objective surface.
With this improved model the agent is equipped to more accurately/efficiently
predict performance in unexplored scenarios.

 <dc:description>  We propose to use Digital Memcomputing Machines (DMMs), implemented with
self-organizing logic gates (SOLGs), to solve the problem of numerical
inversion. Starting from fixed-point scalar inversion we describe the
generalization to solving linear systems and matrix inversion. This method,
when realized in hardware, will output the result in only one computational
step. As an example, we perform simulations of the scalar case using a 5-bit
logic circuit made of SOLGs, and show that the circuit successfully performs
the inversion. Our method can be extended efficiently to any level of
precision, since we prove that producing n-bit precision in the output requires
extending the circuit by at most n bits. This type of numerical inversion can
be implemented by DMM units in hardware, it is scalable, and thus of great
benefit to any real-time computing application.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances have shown the capability of Fully Convolutional Neural
Networks (FCN) to model cost functions for motion planning in the context of
learning driving preferences purely based on demonstration data from human
drivers. While pure learning from demonstrations in the framework of Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a promising approach, we can benefit from well
informed human priors and incorporate them into the learning process. Our work
achieves this by pretraining a model to regress to a manual cost function and
refining it based on Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning. When
injecting prior knowledge as pretraining for the network, we achieve higher
robustness, more visually distinct obstacle boundaries, and the ability to
capture instances of obstacles that elude models that purely learn from
demonstration data. Furthermore, by exploiting these human priors, the
resulting model can more accurately handle corner cases that are scarcely seen
in the demonstration data, such as stairs, slopes, and underpasses.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $G$ we study the chromatic number of a random graph $G_{1/2}$
obtained from $G$ by removing each edge of $G$ independently with probability
$1/2$. Studying $\chi(G_{1/2})$ has been suggested by Bukh, who asked whether
$E[\chi(G_{1/2})] \geq \Omega( \chi(G)/\log(\chi(G)))$ holds for all graphs
$G$. In this paper we prove several results related this problem. Denoting the
chromatic number of $G$ by $k = \chi(G)$ we prove the following results.
  1. For all $d \leq k^{1/3}$ it holds that $\Pr[\chi(G_{1/2}) \leq d] &lt; \exp
\left(- \Omega\left(\frac{k(k-d^3)}{d^3}\right)\right)$. In particular,
$\Pr[G_{1/2} \text{ is bipartite}] &lt; \exp \left(- \Omega \left(k^2
\right)\right)$. When $G$ is the $k$-clique, this bound is tight up to a
constant in $\Omega(\cdot)$.
  2. For all $\epsilon &gt; 0$ it holds that $\Pr[\chi(G_{1/2}) \leq
(1-\epsilon)\sqrt{k}] &lt; \exp \left(-
\Omega\left(\epsilon^2\sqrt{k}\right)\right)$.
  3. If $\alpha(G) \leq O(n/k)$, then $E[\chi(G_{1/2})] \geq \Omega \left(
k/\log(k) \right)$.

 <dc:description>  Stabilization and trajectory control of a quadrotor carrying a suspended load
with a fixed known mass has been extensively studied in recent years. However,
the load mass is not always known beforehand or may vary during the practical
transportations. This mass uncertainty brings uncertain disturbances to the
quadrotor system, causing existing controllers to have worse stability and
trajectory tracking performance. To improve the quadrotor stability and
trajectory tracking capability in this situation, we fully investigate the
impacts of the uncertain load mass on the quadrotor. By comparing the
performances of three different controllers -- the proportional-derivative (PD)
controller, the sliding mode controller (SMC), and the model predictive
controller (MPC) -- stabilization rather than trajectory tracking error is
proved to be the main influence in the load mass uncertainty. A critical motion
mass exists for the quadrotor to maintain a desired transportation performance.
Moreover, simulation results verify that a controller with strong robustness
against disturbances is a good choice for practical applications.

 <dc:description>  Understanding how people explore immersive virtual environments is crucial
for many applications, such as designing virtual reality (VR) content,
developing new compression algorithms, or learning computational models of
saliency or visual attention. Whereas a body of recent work has focused on
modeling saliency in desktop viewing conditions, VR is very different from
these conditions in that viewing behavior is governed by stereoscopic vision
and by the complex interaction of head orientation, gaze, and other kinematic
constraints. To further our understanding of viewing behavior and saliency in
VR, we capture and analyze gaze and head orientation data of 169 users
exploring stereoscopic, static omni-directional panoramas, for a total of 1980
head and gaze trajectories for three different viewing conditions. We provide a
thorough analysis of our data, which leads to several important insights, such
as the existence of a particular fixation bias, which we then use to adapt
existing saliency predictors to immersive VR conditions. In addition, we
explore other applications of our data and analysis, including automatic
alignment of VR video cuts, panorama thumbnails, panorama video synopsis, and
saliency-based compression.

 <dc:description>  We provide a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of 8 clear sky models
used in Computer Graphics. We compare the models with each other as well as
with measurements and with a reference model from the physics community. After
a short summary of the physics of the problem, we present the measurements and
the reference model, and how we &quot;invert&quot; it to get the model parameters. We
then give an overview of each CG model, and detail its scope, its algorithmic
complexity, and its results using the same parameters as in the reference
model. We also compare the models with a perceptual study. Our quantitative
results confirm that the less simplifications and approximations are used to
solve the physical equations, the more accurate are the results. We conclude
with a discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of each model, and how to
further improve their accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Artistic style transfer is an image synthesis problem where the content of an
image is reproduced with the style of another. Recent works show that a
visually appealing style transfer can be achieved by using the hidden
activations of a pretrained convolutional neural network. However, existing
methods either apply (i) an optimization procedure that works for any style
image but is very expensive, or (ii) an efficient feedforward network that only
allows a limited number of trained styles. In this work we propose a simpler
optimization objective based on local matching that combines the content
structure and style textures in a single layer of the pretrained network. We
show that our objective has desirable properties such as a simpler optimization
landscape, intuitive parameter tuning, and consistent frame-by-frame
performance on video. Furthermore, we use 80,000 natural images and 80,000
paintings to train an inverse network that approximates the result of the
optimization. This results in a procedure for artistic style transfer that is
efficient but also allows arbitrary content and style images.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show that determining the rank of a tensor over a field has the same
complexity as deciding the existential theory of that field. This implies
earlier NP-hardness results by H{\aa}stad~\cite{H90}. The hardness proof also
implies an algebraic universality result.

 <dc:title>A High-Capacity Separable Reversible Method for Hiding Multiple Messages

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work proposes a high-capacity scheme for separable reversible data
hiding in encrypted images. At the sender side, the original uncompressed image
is encrypted using an encryption key. One or several data hiders use the MSB of
some image pixels to hide additional data. Given the encrypted image containing
this additional data, with only one of those data hiding keys, the receiver can
extract the corresponding embedded data, although the image content will remain
inaccessible. With all of the embedding keys, the receiver can extract all of
the embedded data. Finally, with the encryption key, the receiver can decrypt
the received data and reconstruct the original image perfectly\ignore{ without
the data embedding key(s) }by exploiting the spatial correlation of natural
images. Based on the proposed method a receiver could recover the original
image perfectly even when it does not have the data embedding key(s) and the
embedding rate is high.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning is considered to be a strong AI paradigm which can be
used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and learning
from their mistakes, but it has not yet been successfully used for automotive
applications. There has recently been a revival of interest in the topic,
however, driven by the ability of deep learning algorithms to learn good
representations of the environment. Motivated by Google DeepMind's successful
demonstrations of learning for games from Breakout to Go, we will propose
different methods for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning.
This is of particular interest as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as
a supervised learning problem as it has a strong interaction with the
environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As this is a
relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we will formulate two
main categories of algorithms: 1) Discrete actions category, and 2) Continuous
actions category. For the discrete actions category, we will deal with Deep
Q-Network Algorithm (DQN) while for the continuous actions category, we will
deal with Deep Deterministic Actor Critic Algorithm (DDAC). In addition to
that, We will also discover the performance of these two categories on an open
source car simulator for Racing called (TORCS) which stands for The Open Racing
car Simulator. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous
maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction
with other vehicles. Finally, we explain the effect of some restricted
conditions, put on the car during the learning phase, on the convergence time
for finishing its learning phase.

 <dc:description>  We present a dual contribution to the task of machine reading-comprehension:
a technique for creating large-sized machine-comprehension (MC) datasets using
paragraph-vector models; and a novel, hybrid neural-network architecture that
combines the representation power of recurrent neural networks with the
discriminative power of fully-connected multi-layered networks. We use the
MC-dataset generation technique to build a dataset of around 2 million
examples, for which we empirically determine the high-ceiling of human
performance (around 91% accuracy), as well as the performance of a variety of
computer models. Among all the models we have experimented with, our hybrid
neural-network architecture achieves the highest performance (83.2% accuracy).
The remaining gap to the human-performance ceiling provides enough room for
future model improvements.

 <dc:description>  High-dimensional crowdsourced data collected from a large number of users
produces rich knowledge for our society. However, it also brings unprecedented
privacy threats to participants. Local privacy, a variant of differential
privacy, is proposed as a means to eliminate the privacy concern.
Unfortunately, achieving local privacy on high-dimensional crowdsourced data
raises great challenges on both efficiency and effectiveness. Here, based on EM
and Lasso regression, we propose efficient multi-dimensional joint distribution
estimation algorithms with local privacy. Then, we develop a Locally
privacy-preserving high-dimensional data Publication algorithm, LoPub, by
taking advantage of our distribution estimation techniques. In particular, both
correlations and joint distribution among multiple attributes can be identified
to reduce the dimension of crowdsourced data, thus achieving both efficiency
and effectiveness in locally private high-dimensional data publication.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrated that the efficiency
of our multivariate distribution estimation scheme and confirm the
effectiveness of our LoPub scheme in generating approximate datasets with local
privacy.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  During the execution of a test plan, a test manager may decide to drop a test
case if its result can be inferred from already executed test cases. We show
that it is possible to automatically generate a test plan to exploit the
potential to justifiably drop a test case and thus reduce the number of test
cases. Our approach uses Boolean formulas to model the mutual dependencies
between test results. The algorithm to generate a test plan comes with the
formal guarantee of optimality with regards to the inference of the result of a
test case from already executed test cases.

 <dc:description>  It is a classical result from universal algebra that the notions of
polymorphisms and invariants provide a Galois connection between suitably
closed classes (clones) of finitary operations $f\colon B^n\to B$, and classes
(coclones) of relations $r\subseteq B^k$. We will present a generalization of
this duality to classes of (multi-valued, partial) functions $f\colon B^n\to
B^m$, employing invariants valued in partially ordered monoids instead of
relations. In particular, our set-up encompasses the case of permutations
$f\colon B^n\to B^n$, motivated by problems in reversible computing.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel generative model named Stacked Generative
Adversarial Networks (SGAN), which is trained to invert the hierarchical
representations of a bottom-up discriminative network. Our model consists of a
top-down stack of GANs, each learned to generate lower-level representations
conditioned on higher-level representations. A representation discriminator is
introduced at each feature hierarchy to encourage the representation manifold
of the generator to align with that of the bottom-up discriminative network,
leveraging the powerful discriminative representations to guide the generative
model. In addition, we introduce a conditional loss that encourages the use of
conditional information from the layer above, and a novel entropy loss that
maximizes a variational lower bound on the conditional entropy of generator
outputs. We first train each stack independently, and then train the whole
model end-to-end. Unlike the original GAN that uses a single noise vector to
represent all the variations, our SGAN decomposes variations into multiple
levels and gradually resolves uncertainties in the top-down generative process.
Based on visual inspection, Inception scores and visual Turing test, we
demonstrate that SGAN is able to generate images of much higher quality than
GANs without stacking.

 <dc:title>Multi-Dimensional Convergence in Future 5G Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ruffini, Marco</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Future 5G services are characterised by unprecedented need for high rate,
ubiquitous availability, ultra-low latency and high reliability. The fragmented
network view that is widespread in current networks will not stand the
challenge posed by next generations of users. A new vision is required, and
this paper provides an insight on how network convergence and
application-centric approaches will play a leading role towards enabling the 5G
vision. The paper, after expressing the view on the need for an end-to-end
approach to network design, brings the reader into a journey on the expected 5G
network requirements and outlines some of the work currently carried out by
main standardisation bodies. It then proposes the use of the concept of network
convergence for providing the overall architectural framework to bring together
all the different technologies within a unifying and coherent network
ecosystem. The novel interpretation of multi-dimensional convergence we
introduce leads us to the exploration of aspects of node consolidation and
converged network architectures, delving into details of optical-wireless
integration and future convergence of optical data centre and access-metro
networks. We then discuss how ownership models enabling network sharing will be
instrumental in realising the 5G vision. The paper concludes with final remarks
on the role SDN will play in 5G and on the need for new business models that
reflect the application-centric view of the network. Finally, we provide some
insight on growing research areas in 5G networking.

 <dc:description>  This article introduces a novel family of decentralised caching policies,
applicable to wireless networks with finite storage at the edge-nodes
(stations). These policies, that are based on the Least-Recently-Used
replacement principle, are here referred to as spatial multi-LRU. They update
cache inventories in a way that provides content diversity to users who are
covered by, and thus have access to, more than one station. Two variations are
proposed, the multi-LRU-One and -All, which differ in the number of replicas
inserted in the involved caches. We analyse their performance under two types
of traffic demand, the Independent Reference Model (IRM) and a model that
exhibits temporal locality. For IRM, we propose a Che-like approximation to
predict the hit probability, which gives very accurate results. Numerical
evaluations show that the performance of multi-LRU increases the more the
multi-coverage areas increase, and it is close to the performance of
centralised policies, when multi-coverage is sufficient. For IRM traffic,
multi-LRU-One is preferable to multi-LRU-All, whereas when the traffic exhibits
temporal locality the -All variation can perform better. Both variations
outperform the simple LRU. When popularity knowledge is not accurate, the new
policies can perform better than centralised ones.

 <dc:description>  The design and evaluation of a robotic prosthesis for a drummer with a
transradial amputation is presented. The principal objective of the prosthesis
is to simulate the role fingers play in drumming. This primarily includes
controlling the manner in which the drum stick rebounds after initial impact.
This is achieved using a DC motor driven by a variable impedance control
framework in a shared control system. The user's ability to perform with and
control the prosthesis is evaluated using a musical synchronization study. A
secondary objective of the prosthesis is to explore the implications of musical
expression and human-robotic interaction when a second, completely autonomous,
stick is added to the prosthesis. This wearable robotic musician interacts with
the user by listening to the music and responding with different rhythms and
behaviors. We recount some empirical findings based on the user's experience of
performing under such a paradigm.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Though tremendous strides have been made in object recognition, one of the
remaining open challenges is detecting small objects. We explore three aspects
of the problem in the context of finding small faces: the role of scale
invariance, image resolution, and contextual reasoning. While most recognition
approaches aim to be scale-invariant, the cues for recognizing a 3px tall face
are fundamentally different than those for recognizing a 300px tall face. We
take a different approach and train separate detectors for different scales. To
maintain efficiency, detectors are trained in a multi-task fashion: they make
use of features extracted from multiple layers of single (deep) feature
hierarchy. While training detectors for large objects is straightforward, the
crucial challenge remains training detectors for small objects. We show that
context is crucial, and define templates that make use of massively-large
receptive fields (where 99% of the template extends beyond the object of
interest). Finally, we explore the role of scale in pre-trained deep networks,
providing ways to extrapolate networks tuned for limited scales to rather
extreme ranges. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on
massively-benchmarked face datasets (FDDB and WIDER FACE). In particular, when
compared to prior art on WIDER FACE, our results reduce error by a factor of 2
(our models produce an AP of 82% while prior art ranges from 29-64%).

 <dc:description>  This article describes a data driven method for deriving the relationship
between personality and media preferences. A qunatifiable representation of
such a relationship can be leveraged for use in recommendation systems and
ameliorate the &quot;cold start&quot; problem. Here, the data is comprised of an original
collection of 1,316 Okcupid dating profiles. Of these profiles, 800 are labeled
with one of 16 possible Myers-Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI). A personality
specific topic model describing a person's favorite books, movies, shows,
music, and food was generated using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). There
were several significant findings, for example, intuitive thinking types
preferred sci-fi/fantasy entertainment, extraversion correlated positively with
upbeat dance music, and jazz, folk, and international cuisine correlated
positively with those characterized by openness to experience. Many other
correlations confirmed previous findings describing the relationship among
personality, writing style, and personal preferences. (For complete
word/personality type assocations see the Appendix).

 <dc:title>Comments on Improving Transferability Between Different Engineering
  Stages in the Development of Automated Material Flow Modules</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the paper by D. Regulin et al. (IEEE Trans. On Automation Science and
Engineering, vol. 13, no. 4, 1422-1432, October 2016) authors claim that they
present a meta-model for the modeling of the Automated Material Flow Module
(aMFM) and a model-driven design approach for aMFMs. In this letter we comment
on the presented meta-model and the proposed model-driven approach regarding
their potential for exploitation. We present specific arguments and make cases
that call the authors design decision into question.

 <dc:title>Inferring object rankings based on noisy pairwise comparisons from

 <dc:description>  Ranking a set of objects involves establishing an order allowing for
comparisons between any pair of objects in the set. Oftentimes, due to the
unavailability of a ground truth of ranked orders, researchers resort to
obtaining judgments from multiple annotators followed by inferring the ground
truth based on the collective knowledge of the crowd. However, the aggregation
is often ad-hoc and involves imposing stringent assumptions in inferring the
ground truth (e.g. majority vote). In this work, we propose
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithms that rely on the judgments from
multiple annotators and the object attributes for inferring the latent ground
truth. The algorithm learns the relation between the latent ground truth and
object attributes as well as annotator specific probabilities of flipping, a
metric to assess annotator quality. We further extend the EM algorithm to allow
for a variable probability of flipping based on the pair of objects at hand. We
test our algorithms on two data sets with synthetic annotations and investigate
the impact of annotator quality and quantity on the inferred ground truth. We
also obtain the results on two other data sets with annotations from
machine/human annotators and interpret the output trends based on the data
characteristics.

 <dc:description>  Despite the growing importance of multilingual aspect of web search, no
appropriate offline metrics to evaluate its quality are proposed so far. At the
same time, personal language preferences can be regarded as intents of a query.
This approach translates the multilingual search problem into a particular task
of search diversification. Furthermore, the standard intent-aware approach
could be adopted to build a diversified metric for multilingual search on the
basis of a classical IR metric such as ERR. The intent-aware approach estimates
user satisfaction under a user behavior model. We show however that the
underlying user behavior models is not realistic in the multilingual case, and
the produced intent-aware metric do not appropriately estimate the user
satisfaction. We develop a novel approach to build intent-aware user behavior
models, which overcome these limitations and convert to quality metrics that
better correlate with standard online metrics of user satisfaction.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed the surge of asynchronous parallel
(async-parallel) iterative algorithms due to problems involving very
large-scale data and a large number of decision variables. Because of
asynchrony, the iterates are computed with outdated information, and the age of
the outdated information, which we call delay, is the number of times it has
been updated since its creation. Almost all recent works prove convergence
under the assumption of a finite maximum delay and set their stepsize
parameters accordingly. However, the maximum delay is practically unknown.
  This paper presents convergence analysis of an async-parallel method from a
probabilistic viewpoint, and it allows for large unbounded delays. An explicit
formula of stepsize that guarantees convergence is given depending on delays'
statistics. With $p+1$ identical processors, we empirically measured that
delays closely follow the Poisson distribution with parameter $p$, matching our
theoretical model, and thus the stepsize can be set accordingly. Simulations on
both convex and nonconvex optimization problems demonstrate the validness of
our analysis and also show that the existing maximum-delay induced stepsize is
too conservative, often slowing down the convergence of the algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We propose an extension to neural network language models to adapt their
prediction to the recent history. Our model is a simplified version of memory
augmented networks, which stores past hidden activations as memory and accesses
them through a dot product with the current hidden activation. This mechanism
is very efficient and scales to very large memory sizes. We also draw a link
between the use of external memory in neural network and cache models used with
count based language models. We demonstrate on several language model datasets
that our approach performs significantly better than recent memory augmented
networks.

 <dc:description>  Detecting loops in data networks usually involves counting down a hop limit
or caching data at each hop to detect a cycle. Using a hop limit means that the
origin of a packet must know the maximum distance a packet could travel without
loops. It also means a loop is not detected until it travels that maximum
distance, even if that is many loops. Caching a packet signature at each hop,
such as a hash or nonce, could require large amounts of memory at every hop
because that cached information must persist for as long as a loop could
forward packets. This paper presents a new distributed loop detection mechanism
based on a Tortoise and Hare algorithm that can quickly detect loops without
caching per-packet data at each hop with a modest amount of additional state in
each packet.

 <dc:description>  Characterizing patient somatic mutations through next-generation sequencing
technologies opens up possibilities for refining cancer subtypes. However,
catalogues of mutations reveal that only a small fraction of the genes are
altered frequently in patients. On the other hand different genomic alterations
may perturb the same pathways. We propose a novel clustering procedure that
quantifies the similarities of patients from their mutational profile on
pathways via a novel graph kernel. We represent each KEGG pathway as an
undirected graph. For each patient the vertex labels are assigned based on her
altered genes. Smoothed shortest path graph kernel (smSPK) evaluates each pair
of patients by comparing their vertex labeled pathway graphs. Our clustering
procedure involves two steps: the smSPK kernel matrix derived for each pathway
are input to kernel k-means algorithm and each pathway is evaluated
individually. In the next step, only those pathways that are successful are
combined in to a single kernel input to kernel k-means to stratify patients.
Evaluating the procedure on simulated data showed that smSPK clusters patients
up to 88\% accuracy. Finally to identify ovarian cancer patient subgroups, we
apply our methodology to the cancer genome atlas ovarian data that involves 481
patients. The identified subgroups are evaluated through survival analysis.
Grouping patients into four clusters results with patients groups that are
significantly different in their survival times ($p$-value $\le 0.005$).

aimed at investigating how different social networks impact the efficiency of
scientists in acquiring knowledge. As such, the ABM is a computational tool for
tackling issues in the domain of scientific methodology and science policy. In
contrast to existing ABMs of science, our model aims to represent the
argumentative dynamics that underlies scientific practice. To this end we
employ abstract argumentation theory as the core design feature of the model.
This helps to avoid a number of problematic idealizations which are present in
other ABMs of science and which impede their relevance for actual scientific
practice.

 <dc:description>  The rise in popularity of the Android platform has resulted in an explosion
of malware threats targeting it. As both Android malware and the operating
system itself constantly evolve, it is very challenging to design robust
malware mitigation techniques that can operate for long periods of time without
the need for modifications or costly re-training. In this paper, we present
MaMaDroid, an Android malware detection system that relies on app behavior.
MaMaDroid builds a behavioral model, in the form of a Markov chain, from the
sequence of abstracted API calls performed by an app, and uses it to extract
features and perform classification. By abstracting calls to their packages or
families, MaMaDroid maintains resilience to API changes and keeps the feature
set size manageable. We evaluate its accuracy on a dataset of 8.5K benign and
35.5K malicious apps collected over a period of six years, showing that it not
only effectively detects malware (with up to 99% F-measure), but also that the
model built by the system keeps its detection capabilities for long periods of
time (on average, 86% and 75% F-measure, respectively, one and two years after
training). Finally, we compare against DroidAPIMiner, a state-of-the-art system
that relies on the frequency of API calls performed by apps, showing that
MaMaDroid significantly outperforms it.

 <dc:description>  There are many forms of feature information present in video data. Principle
among them are object identity information which is largely static across
multiple video frames, and object pose and style information which continuously
transforms from frame to frame. Most existing models confound these two types
of representation by mapping them to a shared feature space. In this paper we
propose a probabilistic approach for learning separable representations of
object identity and pose information using unsupervised video data. Our
approach leverages a deep generative model with a factored prior distribution
that encodes properties of temporal invariances in the hidden feature set.
Learning is achieved via variational inference. We present results of learning
identity and pose information on a dataset of moving characters as well as a
dataset of rotating 3D objects. Our experimental results demonstrate our
model's success in factoring its representation, and demonstrate that the model
achieves improved performance in transfer learning tasks.

 <dc:title>Analysis of proposed PDE-based underwater image enhancement algorithms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nnolim, U. A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This report describes the experimental analysis of proposed underwater image
enhancement algorithms based on partial differential equations (PDEs). The
algorithms perform simultaneous smoothing and enhancement due to the
combination of both processes within the PDE-formulation. The framework enables
the incorporation of suitable colour and contrast enhancement algorithms within
one unified functional. Additional modification of the formulation includes the
combination of the popular Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization
(CLAHE) with the proposed approach. This modification enables the hybrid
algorithm to provide both local enhancement (due to the CLAHE) and global
enhancement (due to the proposed contrast term). Additionally, the CLAHE clip
limit parameter is computed dynamically in each iteration and used to gauge the
amount of local enhancement performed by the CLAHE within the formulation. This
enables the algorithm to reduce or prevent the enhancement of noisy artifacts,
which if present, are also smoothed out by the anisotropic diffusion term
within the PDE formulation. In other words, the modified algorithm combines the
strength of the CLAHE, AD and the contrast term while minimizing their
weaknesses. Ultimately, the system is optimized using image data metrics for
automated enhancement and compromise between visual and quantitative results.
Experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms perform a series of functions
such as illumination correction, colour enhancement correction and restoration,
contrast enhancement and noise suppression. Moreover, the proposed approaches
surpass most other conventional algorithms found in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Reconstructing brain activity through electroencephalography requires a
boundary value problem (BVP) solver to take a proposed distribution of current
dipoles within the brain and compute the resulting electrostatic potential on
the scalp. This article proposes the use of sequential kriging optimization to
identify different optimal BVP solver parameters for dipoles located in
isolated sections of the brain by considering the cumulative impact of randomly
oriented dipoles within a chosen isolated section. We attempt preemptive
termination of parametrizations suggested during the sequential kriging
optimization which, given the results to that point, seem unlikely to produce
high quality solutions. Numerical experiments on a simplification of the full
geometry for which an approximate solution is available show a benefit from
this preemptive termination.

 <dc:description>  Binary linear codes with good parameters have important applications in
secret sharing schemes, authentication codes, association schemes, and consumer
electronics and communications. In this paper, we construct several classes of
binary linear codes from vectorial Boolean functions and determine their
parameters, by further studying a generic construction developed by Ding
\emph{et al.} recently. First, by employing perfect nonlinear functions and
almost bent functions, we obtain several classes of six-weight linear codes
which contains the all-one codeword. Second, we investigate a subcode of any
linear code mentioned above and consider its parameters. When the vectorial
Boolean function is a perfect nonlinear function or a Gold function in odd
dimension, we can completely determine the weight distribution of this subcode.
Besides, our linear codes have larger dimensions than the ones by Ding et al.'s
generic construction.

 <dc:description>  The orbital angular momentum (OAM) technique provides a new degree of freedom
for information transmissions in millimeter wave communications. Considering
the spatial distribution characteristics of OAM beams, a new OAM spatial
modulation (OAM-SM) millimeter wave communication system is first proposed for
future mobile networks. Furthermore, the capacity, average bit error
probability and energy efficiency of OAM-SM millimeter wave communication
systems are analytically derived for performance analysis. Compared with the
conventional multi-input multi-output (MIMO) millimeter wave communication
systems, the maximum capacity and energy efficiency of OAM-SM millimeter wave
communication systems are improved by 36% and 472.3%, respectively. Moreover,
numerical results indicate that the proposed OAM-SM millimeter wave
communication systems are more robust to path-loss attenuations than the
conventional MIMO millimeter wave communication systems, which makes it
suitable for long-range transmissions. Therefore, OAM-SM millimeter wave
communication systems provide a great growth space for future mobile networks.

 <dc:description>  When small cells are densely deployed in the fifth generation (5G) cellular
networks, the base stations (BSs) switch-off strategy is an effective approach
for saving energy consumption considering changes of traffic load. In general,
the loss of coverage efficiency is an inevitable cost for cellular networks
adopting BSs switch-off strategies. Based on the BSs switch-off strategy, an
optimized energy density efficiency of hard core point process (HCPP) small
cell networks is proposed to trade off the energy and coverage efficiency.
Simulation results imply that the minimum active BS distance used for the BSs
switch-off strategy is recommended as 150 meters to achieve a tradeoff between
energy and coverage efficiency in 5G small cell networks.

 <dc:description>  The fundamental role of hypernymy in NLP has motivated the development of
many methods for the automatic identification of this relation, most of which
rely on word distribution. We investigate an extensive number of such
unsupervised measures, using several distributional semantic models that differ
by context type and feature weighting. We analyze the performance of the
different methods based on their linguistic motivation. Comparison to the
state-of-the-art supervised methods shows that while supervised methods
generally outperform the unsupervised ones, the former are sensitive to the
distribution of training instances, hurting their reliability. Being based on
general linguistic hypotheses and independent from training data, unsupervised
measures are more robust, and therefore are still useful artillery for
hypernymy detection.

 <dc:description>  Planar automata seems to be representative of the synchronizing behavior of

to show that the class of planar automata is representative of the algorithmic

 <dc:description>  With the anticipated increase in the number of low power base stations (BSs)
deployed in small cell networks, blockage effects becoming more sensitive on
wireless transmissions over high spectrums, variable propagation fading
scenarios make it hard to describe coverage of small cell networks. In this
paper, we propose a dual-directional path loss model cooperating with
Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) transmissions for the fifth
generation (5G) fractal small cell networks. Based on the proposed path loss
model, a LoS transmission probability is derived as a function of the
coordinate azimuth of the BS and the distance between the mobile user (MU) and
the BS. Moreover, the coverage probability and the average achievable rate are
analyzed for 5G fractal small cell networks. Numerical results imply that the
minimum intensity of blockages and the maximum intensity of BSs can not
guarantee the maximum average achievable rate in 5G fractal small cell
networks. Our results explore the relationship between the anisotropic path
loss fading and the small cell coverage in 5G fractal small cell networks.

 <dc:title>Frames and numerical approximation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Functions of one or more variables are usually approximated with a basis; a
complete, linearly independent set of functions that spans an appropriate
function space. The topic of this paper is the numerical approximation of
functions using the more general notion of frames; that is, complete systems
that are generally redundant but provide stable infinite representations. While
frames are well-known in image and signal processing, coding theory and other
areas of applied mathematics, their use in numerical analysis is far less
widespread. Yet, as we show via a series of examples, frames are more flexible
than bases, and can be constructed easily in a range of problems where finding
orthonormal bases with desirable properties is difficult or impossible. By
means of example, we exhibit a frame which yields simple, high-order
approximations of smooth, multivariate functions in complicated geometries.
  A major concern when using frames is that computing a best approximation
typically requires solving an ill-conditioned linear system. Nonetheless, we
show that an accurate frame approximation of a function $f$ can be computed
numerically up to an error of order $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ with a simple algorithm,
or even of order $\epsilon$ with modifications to the algorithm. Here,
$\epsilon$ is a user-controlled parameter. Crucially, the order of convergence
down to this limit is determined by the existence of accurate, approximate
representations of $f$ in the frame that have small-norm coefficients. We
demonstrate the existence of such representations in our examples. Overall, our
analysis suggests that frames are a natural generalization of bases in which to
develop numerical approximation. In particular, even in the presence of severe
ill-conditioning, frames impose sufficient mathematical structure so as to give
rise to good accuracy in finite precision calculations.

 <dc:description>  Whereas CNNs have demonstrated immense progress in many vision problems, they
suffer from a dependence on monumental amounts of labeled training data. On the
other hand, dictionary learning does not scale to the size of problems that
CNNs can handle, despite being very effective at low-level vision tasks such as
denoising and inpainting. Recently, interest has grown in adapting dictionary
learning methods for supervised tasks such as classification and inverse
problems. We propose two new network layers that are based on dictionary
learning: a sparse factorization layer and a convolutional sparse factorization
layer, analogous to fully-connected and convolutional layers, respectively.
Using our derivations, these layers can be dropped in to existing CNNs, trained
together in an end-to-end fashion with back-propagation, and leverage
semisupervision in ways classical CNNs cannot. We experimentally compare
networks with these two new layers against a baseline CNN. Our results
demonstrate that networks with either of the sparse factorization layers are
able to outperform classical CNNs when supervised data are few. They also show
performance improvements in certain tasks when compared to the CNN with no
sparse factorization layers with the same exact number of parameters.

 <dc:title>Web-based Argumentation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is an argumentation framework that has
been proposed in the late 20th century. Since then, there was still no solver
implemented in a programming language which is easy to setup and no solver have
been interfaced to the web, which impedes the interests of the public. This
project aims to implement an ABA solver in a modern programming language that
performs reasonably well and interface it to the web for easier access by the
public. This project has demonstrated the novelty of development of an ABA
solver, that computes conflict-free, stable, admissible, grounded, ideal, and
complete semantics, in Python programming language which can be used via an
easy-to-use web interface for visualization of the argument and dispute trees.
Experiments were conducted to determine the project's best configurations and
to compare this project with proxdd, a state-of-the-art ABA solver, which has
no web interface and computes less number of semantics. From the results of the
experiments, this project's best configuration is achieved by utilizing
&quot;pickle&quot; technique and tree caching technique. Using this project's best
configuration, this project achieved a lower average runtime compared to
proxdd. On other aspect, this project encountered more cases with exceptions
compared to proxdd, which might be caused by this project computing more
semantics and hence requires more resources to do so. Hence, it can be said
that this project run comparably well to the state-of-the-art ABA solver
proxdd. Future works of this project include computational complexity analysis
and efficiency analysis of algorithms implemented, implementation of more
semantics in argumentation framework, and usability testing of the web
interface.

 <dc:description>  We present efficient realization of Householder Transform (HT) based QR
factorization through algorithm-architecture co-design where we achieve
performance improvement of 3-90x in-terms of Gflops/watt over state-of-the-art
multicore, General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and ClearSpeed CSX700. Theoretical and
experimental analysis of classical HT is performed for opportunities to exhibit
higher degree of parallelism where parallelism is quantified as a number of
parallel operations per level in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the
transform. Based on theoretical analysis of classical HT, an opportunity
re-arrange computations in the classical HT is identified that results in
Modified HT (MHT) where it is shown that MHT exhibits 1.33x times higher
parallelism than classical HT. Experiments in off-the-shelf multicore and
General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) for HT and MHT suggest that
MHT is capable of achieving slightly better or equal performance compared to
classical HT based QR factorization realizations in the optimized software
packages for Dense Linear Algebra (DLA). We implement MHT on a customized
platform for Dense Linear Algebra (DLA) and show that MHT achieves 1.3x better
performance than native implementation of classical HT on the same accelerator.
For custom realization of HT and MHT based QR factorization, we also identify
macro operations in the DAGs of HT and MHT that are realized on a
Reconfigurable Data-path (RDP). We also observe that due to re-arrangement in
the computations in MHT, custom realization of MHT is capable of achieving 12%
better performance improvement over multicore and GPGPUs than the performance
improvement reported by General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) over highly tuned
DLA software packages for multicore and GPGPUs which is counter-intuitive.

 <dc:description>  Timing channels are information flows, encoded in the relative timing of
events, that bypass the system's protection mechanisms. Any microarchitectural
state that depends on execution history and affects the rate of progress of
later executions potentially establishes a timing channel, unless explicit
steps are taken to close it. Such state includes CPU caches, TLBs, branch
predictors and prefetchers; removing the channels requires that the OS can
partition such state or flush it on a switch of security domains. We measure
the capacities of channels based on these microarchitectural features on
several generations of processors across the two mainstream ISAs, x86 and ARM,
and investigate the effectiveness of the flushing mechanisms provided by the
respective ISA.We find that in all processors we studied, at least one
significant channel remains. This implies that closing all timing channels
seems impossible on contemporary mainstream processors.

 <dc:title>Re-incentivizing Discovery: Mechanisms for Partial-Progress Sharing in
  Research</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  An essential primitive for an efficient research ecosystem is
\emph{partial-progress sharing} (PPS) -- whereby a researcher shares
information immediately upon making a breakthrough. This helps prevent
duplication of work; however there is evidence that existing reward structures
in research discourage partial-progress sharing. Ensuring PPS is especially
important for new online collaborative-research platforms, which involve many
researchers working on large, multi-stage problems.
  We study the problem of incentivizing information-sharing in research, under
a stylized model: non-identical agents work independently on subtasks of a
large project, with dependencies between subtasks captured via an acyclic
subtask-network. Each subtask carries a reward, given to the first agent who
publicly shares its solution. Agents can choose which subtasks to work on, and
more importantly, when to reveal solutions to completed subtasks. Under this
model, we uncover the strategic rationale behind certain anecdotal phenomena.
Moreover, for any acyclic subtask-network, and under a general model of
agent-subtask completion times, we give sufficient conditions that ensure PPS
is incentive-compatible for all agents.
  One surprising finding is that rewards which are approximately proportional
to perceived task-difficulties are sufficient to ensure PPS in all acyclic
subtask-networks. The fact that there is no tension between local fairness and
global information-sharing in multi-stage projects is encouraging, as it
suggests practical mechanisms for real-world settings. Finally, we show that
PPS is necessary, and in many cases, sufficient, to ensure a high rate of
progress in research.

 <dc:description>  Smart Contract Templates support legally-enforceable smart contracts, using
operational parameters to connect legal agreements to standardised code. In
this paper, we explore the design landscape of potential formats for storage
and transmission of smart legal agreements. We identify essential requirements
and describe a number of key design options, from which we envisage future
development of standardised formats for defining and manipulating smart legal
agreements. This provides a preliminary step towards supporting industry
adoption of legally-enforceable smart contracts.

 <dc:description>  Product Community Question Answering (PCQA) provides useful information about
products and their features (aspects) that may not be well addressed by product
descriptions and reviews. We observe that a product's compatibility issues with
other products are frequently discussed in PCQA and such issues are more
frequently addressed in accessories, i.e., via a yes/no question &quot;Does this
mouse work with windows 10?&quot;. In this paper, we address the problem of
extracting compatible and incompatible products from yes/no questions in PCQA.
This problem can naturally have a two-stage framework: first, we perform
Complementary Entity (product) Recognition (CER) on yes/no questions; second,
we identify the polarities of yes/no answers to assign the complementary
entities a compatibility label (compatible, incompatible or unknown). We
leverage an existing unsupervised method for the first stage and a 3-class
classifier by combining a distant PU-learning method (learning from positive
and unlabeled examples) together with a binary classifier for the second stage.
The benefit of using distant PU-learning is that it can help to expand more
implicit yes/no answers without using any human annotated data. We conduct
experiments on 4 products to show that the proposed method is effective.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, new few weights linear codes over the local ring
$R=\mathbb{F}_p+u\mathbb{F}_p+v\mathbb{F}_p+uv\mathbb{F}_p,$ with $u^2=v^2=0,
uv=vu,$ are constructed by using the trace function defined over an extension
ring of degree $m.$ %In fact, These codes are punctured from the linear code is
defined in \cite{SWLP} up to coordinate permutations. These trace codes have
the algebraic structure of abelian codes. Their weight distributions are
evaluated explicitly by means of Gaussian sums over finite fields. Two
different defining sets are explored.
  Using a linear Gray map from $R$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^4,$ we obtain several
families of new $p$-ary codes from trace codes of dimension $4m$. For the first
defining set: when $m$ is even, or $m$ is odd and $p\equiv3 ~({\rm mod} ~4),$
we obtain a new family of two-weight codes, which are shown to be optimal by
the application of the Griesmer bound; when $m$ is even and under some special
conditions, we obtain two new classes of three-weight codes. For the second
defining set: we obtain a new class of two-weight codes and prove that it meets
the Griesmer bound. In addition, we give the minimum distance of the dual code.
Finally, applications of the $p$-ary image codes in secret sharing schemes are
presented.

 <dc:description>  Ethereum represents new innovation in the fields of cryptocurrency which has
become relatively stagnate, promising many things, including an entire
programming language and development enviroment built into the network. However
the current trend is to write implementations and proof of concepts before
doing the rigor involved with proving security. Miller's recent thesis is an
attempt to remedy this, and we apply his provable security techniques to the
algorithm description of CASPER, the new &quot;proof-of-stake&quot; consensus protocol
scheme to be implemented in ethereum. We conclude by stating it satisfies
almost all the definitions, except one, leaving room for improvement.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel single image action recognition algorithm
which is based on the idea of semantic body part actions. Unlike existing
bottom up methods, we argue that the human action is a combination of
meaningful body part actions. In detail, we divide human body into five parts:
head, torso, arms, hands and legs. And for each of the body parts, we define
several semantic body part actions, e.g., hand holding, hand waving. These
semantic body part actions are strongly related to the body actions, e.g.,
writing, and jogging. Based on the idea, we propose a deep neural network based
system: first, body parts are localized by a Semi-FCN network. Second, for each
body parts, a Part Action Res-Net is used to predict semantic body part
actions. And finally, we use SVM to fuse the body part actions and predict the
entire body action. Experiments on two dataset: PASCAL VOC 2012 and Stanford-40
report mAP improvement from the state-of-the-art by 3.8% and 2.6% respectively.

 <dc:description>  State of the art methods in astronomical image reconstruction rely on the
resolution of a regularized or constrained optimization problem. Solving this
problem can be computationally intensive and usually leads to a quadratic or at
least superlinear complexity w.r.t. the number of pixels in the image. We
investigate in this work the use of convolutional neural networks for image
reconstruction in astronomy. With neural networks, the computationally
intensive tasks is the training step, but the prediction step has a fixed
complexity per pixel, i.e. a linear complexity. Numerical experiments show that
our approach is both computationally efficient and competitive with other state
of the art methods in addition to being interpretable.

 <dc:description>  The introduction of convolutional layers greatly advanced the performance of
neural networks on image tasks due to innately capturing a way of encoding and
learning translation-invariant operations, matching one of the underlying
symmetries of the image domain. In comparison, there are a number of problems
in which there are a number of different inputs which are all 'of the same
type' --- multiple particles, multiple agents, multiple stock prices, etc. The
corresponding symmetry to this is permutation symmetry, in that the algorithm
should not depend on the specific ordering of the input data. We discuss a
permutation-invariant neural network layer in analogy to convolutional layers,
and show the ability of this architecture to learn to predict the motion of a
variable number of interacting hard discs in 2D. In the same way that
convolutional layers can generalize to different image sizes, the permutation
layer we describe generalizes to different numbers of objects.

 <dc:description>  To cater for the demands of future fifth generation (5G) ultra-dense small
cell networks, the wireless backhaul network is an attractive solution for the
urban deployment of 5G wireless networks. Optimization of 5G wireless backhaul
networks is a key issue. In this paper we propose a two-scale optimization
solution to maximize the cost efficiency of 5G wireless backhaul networks.
Specifically, the number and positions of gateways are optimized in the long
time scale of 5G wireless backhaul networks. The wireless backhaul routings are
optimized in the short time scale of 5G wireless backhaul networks. Numerical
results show the cost efficiency of proposed optimization algorithm is better
than the cost efficiency of conventional and most widely used shortest path
(SP) algorithm in 5G wireless backhaul networks.

 <dc:description>  We make one of the first attempts to build working models for
intra-sentential code-switching based on the Equivalence-Constraint (Poplack
1980) and Matrix-Language (Myers-Scotton 1993) theories. We conduct a detailed
theoretical analysis, and a small-scale empirical study of the two models for
Hindi-English CS. Our analyses show that the models are neither sound nor
complete. Taking insights from the errors made by the models, we propose a new
model that combines features of both the theories.

 <dc:title>Approximate fast graph Fourier transforms via multi-layer sparse

 <dc:description>  The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm of paramount importance in
signal processing as it allows to apply the Fourier transform in O(n log n)
instead of O(n 2) arithmetic operations. Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is a
recent research domain that generalizes classical signal processing tools, such
as the Fourier transform, to situations where the signal domain is given by any
arbitrary graph instead of a regular grid. Today, there is no method to rapidly
apply graph Fourier transforms. We propose in this paper a method to obtain
approximate graph Fourier transforms that can be applied rapidly and stored
efficiently. It is based on a greedy approximate diagonalization of the graph
Laplacian matrix, carried out using a modified version of the famous Jacobi
eigenvalues algorithm. The method is described and analyzed in detail, and then
applied to both synthetic and real graphs, showing its potential.

 <dc:title>Wiener system identification with generalized orthonormal basis
  functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tiels, Koen</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Schoukens, Johan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many nonlinear systems can be described by a Wiener-Schetzen model. In this
model, the linear dynamics are formulated in terms of orthonormal basis
functions (OBFs). The nonlinearity is modeled by a multivariate polynomial. In
general, an infinite number of OBFs is needed for an exact representation of
the system. This paper considers the approximation of a Wiener system with
finite-order infinite impulse response dynamics and a polynomial nonlinearity.
We propose to use a limited number of generalized OBFs (GOBFs). The pole
locations, needed to construct the GOBFs, are estimated via the best linear
approximation of the system. The coefficients of the multivariate polynomial
are determined with a linear regression. This paper provides a convergence
analysis for the proposed identification scheme. It is shown that the estimated
output converges in probability to the exact output. Fast convergence rates, in
the order $O_p({N_F}^{-n_{rep}/2})$, can be achieved, with $N_F$ the number of
excited frequencies and $n_{rep}$ the number of repetitions of the GOBFs.

 <dc:title>Initial estimates for Wiener-Hammerstein models using phase-coupled

 <dc:description>  Block-oriented models are often used to model nonlinear systems. These models
consist of linear dynamic (L) and nonlinear static (N) sub-blocks. This paper
addresses the generation of initial estimates for a Wiener-Hammerstein model
(LNL cascade). While it is easy to measure the product of the two linear blocks
using a Gaussian excitation and linear identification methods, it is difficult
to split the global dynamics over the individual blocks. This paper first
proposes a well-designed multisine excitation with pairwise coupled random
phases. Next, a modified best linear approximation is estimated on a shifted
frequency grid. It is shown that this procedure creates a shift of the input
dynamics with a known frequency offset, while the output dynamics do not shift.
The resulting transfer function, which has complex coefficients due to the
frequency shift, is estimated with a modified frequency domain estimation
method. The identified poles and zeros can be assigned to either the input or
output dynamics. Once this is done, it is shown in the literature that the
remaining initialization problem can be solved much easier than the original
one. The method is illustrated on experimental data obtained from the
Wiener-Hammerstein benchmark system.

 <dc:title>A Refined Analysis of LSH for Well-dispersed Data Points</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Near neighbor problems are fundamental in algorithms for high-dimensional
Euclidean spaces. While classical approaches suffer from the curse of
dimensionality, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) can effectively solve
a-approximate r-near neighbor problem, and has been proven to be optimal in the
worst case. However, for real-world data sets, LSH can naturally benefit from
well-dispersed data and low doubling dimension, leading to significantly
improved performance. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a
refined analyses for running time of approximating near neighbors queries via
LSH. We characterize dispersion of data using N_b, the number of b*r-near pairs
among the data points. Combined with optimal data-oblivious LSH scheme, we get
a new query time bound depending on N_b and doubling dimension. For many
natural scenarios where points are well-dispersed or lying in a
low-doubling-dimension space, our result leads to sharper performance than
existing worst-case analysis. This paper not only present first rigorous proof
on how LSHs make use of the structure of data points, but also provide
important insights into parameter setting in the practice of LSH beyond worst
case. Besides, the techniques in our analysis involve a generalized version of
sphere packing problem, which might be of some independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Many stochastic processes are defined on special geometrical objects like
spheres and cones. We describe how tools from harmonic analysis, i.e. Fourier
analysis on groups, can be used to investigate probability density functions
(pdfs) on groups and homogeneous spaces. We consider the special case of the
Lorentz group SU(1,1) and the unit disk with its hyperbolic geometry, but the
procedure can be generalized to a much wider class of Lie-groups. We mainly
concentrate on the Mehler-Fock transform which is the radial part of the
Fourier transform on the disk. Some of the characteristic features of this
transform are the relation to group-convolutions, the isometry between signal
and transform space, the relation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the
relation to group representation theory. We will give an overview over these
properties and their applications in signal processing. We will illustrate the
theory with two examples from low-level vision and color image processing.

 <dc:description>  The uneven distribution of wealth and individual economic capacities are
among the main forces which shape modern societies and arguably bias the
emerging social structures. However, the study of correlations between the
social network and economic status of individuals is difficult due to the lack
of large-scale multimodal data disclosing both the social ties and economic
indicators of the same population. Here, we close this gap through the analysis
of coupled datasets recording the mobile phone communications and bank
transaction history of one million anonymised individuals living in a Latin
American country. We show that wealth and debt are unevenly distributed among
people in agreement with the Pareto principle; the observed social structure is
strongly stratified, with people being better connected to others of their own
socioeconomic class rather than to others of different classes; the social
network appears with assortative socioeconomic correlations and tightly
connected &quot;rich clubs&quot;; and that egos from the same class live closer to each
other but commute further if they are wealthier. These results are based on a
representative, society-large population, and empirically demonstrate some
long-lasting hypotheses on socioeconomic correlations which potentially lay
behind social segregation, and induce differences in human mobility.

 <dc:description>  Current techniques for formally verifying circuits implemented in Galois
field (GF) arithmetic are limited to those with a known irreducible polynomial
P(x). This paper presents a computer algebra based technique that extracts the
irreducible polynomial P(x) used in the implementation of a multiplier in
GF(2^m). The method is based on first extracting a unique polynomial in Galois
field of each output bit independently. P(x) is then obtained by analyzing the
algebraic expression in GF(2^m) of each output bit. We demonstrate that this
method is able to reverse engineer the irreducible polynomial of an n-bit GF
multiplier in n threads. Experiments were performed on Mastrovito and
Montgomery multipliers with different P (x), including NIST-recommended
polynomials and optimal polynomials for different microprocessor architectures.

 <dc:description>  Over the last decades, a considerable amount of empirical knowledge about the
efficiency of defect-detection techniques has been accumulated. Also a few
surveys have summarised those studies with different focuses, usually for a
specific type of technique. This work reviews the results of empirical studies
and associates them with a model of software quality economics. This allows a
better comparison of the different techniques and supports the application of
the model in practice as several parameters can be approximated with typical
average values. The main contributions are the provision of average values of
several interesting quantities w.r.t. defect detection and the identification
of areas that need further research because of the limited knowledge available.

 <dc:description>  Usability is a key quality attribute of successful software systems.
Unfortunately, there is no common understanding of the factors influencing
usability and their interrelations. Hence, the lack of a comprehensive basis
for designing, analyzing, and improving user interfaces. This paper proposes a
2-dimensional model of usability that associates system properties with the
activities carried out by the user. By separating activities and properties,
sound quality criteria can be identified, thus facilitating statements
concerning their interdependencies. This model is based on a tested quality
meta-model that fosters preciseness and completeness. A case study demonstrates
the manner by which such a model aids in revealing contradictions and omissions
in existing usability standards. Furthermore, the model serves as a central and
structured knowledge base for the entire quality assurance process, e.g. the
automatic generation of guideline documents.

 <dc:title>Retrieving sinusoids from nonuniformly sampled data using recursive

 <dc:creator>Maric, Ivan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A heuristic procedure based on novel recursive formulation of sinusoid (RFS)
and on regression with predictive least-squares (LS) enables to decompose both
uniformly and nonuniformly sampled 1-d signals into a sparse set of sinusoids
(SSS). An optimal SSS is found by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization of RFS
parameters of near-optimal sinusoids combined with common criteria for the
estimation of the number of sinusoids embedded in noise. The procedure
estimates both the cardinality and the parameters of SSS. The proposed
algorithm enables to identify the RFS parameters of a sinusoid from a data
sequence containing only a fraction of its cycle. In extreme cases when the
frequency of a sinusoid approaches zero the algorithm is able to detect a
linear trend in data. Also, an irregular sampling pattern enables the algorithm
to correctly reconstruct the under-sampled sinusoid. Parsimonious nature of the
obtaining models opens the possibilities of using the proposed method in
machine learning and in expert and intelligent systems needing analysis and
simple representation of 1-d signals. The properties of the proposed algorithm
are evaluated on examples of irregularly sampled artificial signals in noise
and are compared with high accuracy frequency estimation algorithms based on
linear prediction (LP) approach, particularly with respect to Cramer-Rao Bound
(CRB).

 <dc:description>  Predicting business process behaviour is an important aspect of business
process management. Motivated by research in natural language processing, this
paper describes an application of deep learning with recurrent neural networks
to the problem of predicting the next event in a business process. This is both
a novel method in process prediction, which has largely relied on explicit
process models, and also a novel application of deep learning methods. The
approach is evaluated on two real datasets and our results surpass the
state-of-the-art in prediction precision.

 <dc:description>  Emoji is an essential component in dialogues which has been broadly utilized
on almost all social platforms. It could express more delicate feelings beyond
plain texts and thus smooth the communications between users, making dialogue
systems more anthropomorphic and vivid. In this paper, we focus on
automatically recommending appropriate emojis given the contextual information
in multi-turn dialogue systems, where the challenges locate in understanding
the whole conversations. More specifically, we propose the hierarchical long
short-term memory model (H-LSTM) to construct dialogue representations,
followed by a softmax classifier for emoji classification. We evaluate our
models on the task of emoji classification in a real-world dataset, with some
further explorations on parameter sensitivity and case study. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves the best performances on all
evaluation metrics. It indicates that our method could well capture the
contextual information and emotion flow in dialogues, which is significant for
emoji recommendation.

 <dc:title>A Lazy Language Needs a Lazy Type System: Introducing Polymorphic
  Contexts</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Most type systems that support polymorphic functions are based on a version
of System-F. We argue that this limits useful programming paradigms for
languages with lazy evaluation. We motivate an extension of System-F
alleviating this limitation.
  First, using a sequence of examples, we show that for lazily evaluated
languages current type systems may force one to write a program in an unnatural
way; we in particular argue that in such languages the relationship between
polymorphic and existential types can be made more systematic by allowing to
pass back (part of) an existential result of a function call as an argument to
the the function call that produced that value.
  After presenting our extension to System-F we show how we can implement the
strict-state thread monad $\mathrm{ST}$ by using a returned existential type in
specialising the polymorphic function which returns that type. Currently this
monad is built-in into the runtime system of GHC and as such has become part of
the language.
  Our proposed language extension, i.e. the introduction of polymorphic
contexts, reverses the relationship between the context of a function call and
the called function with respect to where it is decided with which type to
instantiate a type variable.

 <dc:title>How Grammatical is Character-level Neural Machine Translation? Assessing
  MT Quality with Contrastive Translation Pairs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sennrich, Rico</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Analysing translation quality in regards to specific linguistic phenomena has
historically been difficult and time-consuming. Neural machine translation has
the attractive property that it can produce scores for arbitrary translations,
and we propose a novel method to assess how well NMT systems model specific
linguistic phenomena such as agreement over long distances, the production of
novel words, and the faithful translation of polarity. The core idea is that we
measure whether a reference translation is more probable under a NMT model than
a contrastive translation which introduces a specific type of error. We present
LingEval97, a large-scale data set of 97000 contrastive translation pairs based
on the WMT English-&gt;German translation task, with errors automatically created
with simple rules. We report results for a number of systems, and find that
recently introduced character-level NMT systems perform better at
transliteration than models with byte-pair encoding (BPE) segmentation, but
perform more poorly at morphosyntactic agreement, and translating discontiguous
units of meaning.

 <dc:description>  The pose of a rigid object is usually regarded as a rigid transformation,
described by a translation and a rotation. However, equating the pose space
with the space of rigid transformations is in general abusive, as it does not
account for objects with proper symmetries -- which are common among man-made
objects.In this article, we define pose as a distinguishable static state of an
object, and equate a pose with a set of rigid transformations. Based solely on
geometric considerations, we propose a frame-invariant metric on the space of
possible poses, valid for any physical rigid object, and requiring no arbitrary
tuning. This distance can be evaluated efficiently using a representation of
poses within an Euclidean space of at most 12 dimensions depending on the
object's symmetries. This makes it possible to efficiently perform neighborhood
queries such as radius searches or k-nearest neighbor searches within a large
set of poses using off-the-shelf methods. Pose averaging considering this
metric can similarly be performed easily, using a projection function from the
Euclidean space onto the pose space. The practical value of those theoretical
developments is illustrated with an application of pose estimation of instances
of a 3D rigid object given an input depth map, via a Mean Shift procedure.

 <dc:description>  Translating or rotating an input image should not affect the results of many
computer vision tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are already
translation equivariant: input image translations produce proportionate feature
map translations. This is not the case for rotations. Global rotation
equivariance is typically sought through data augmentation, but patch-wise
equivariance is more difficult. We present Harmonic Networks or H-Nets, a CNN
exhibiting equivariance to patch-wise translation and 360-rotation. We achieve
this by replacing regular CNN filters with circular harmonics, returning a
maximal response and orientation for every receptive field patch.
  H-Nets use a rich, parameter-efficient and low computational complexity
representation, and we show that deep feature maps within the network encode
complicated rotational invariants. We demonstrate that our layers are general
enough to be used in conjunction with the latest architectures and techniques,
such as deep supervision and batch normalization. We also achieve
state-of-the-art classification on rotated-MNIST, and competitive results on
other benchmark challenges.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of selecting a set of $k$ measurements from
$n$ available sensor observations. The selected measurements should minimize a
certain error function assessing the error in estimating a certain $m$
dimensional parameter vector. The exhaustive search inspecting each of the
$n\choose k$ possible choices would require a very high computational
complexity and as such is not practical for large $n$ and $k$. Alternative
methods with low complexity have recently been investigated but their main
drawbacks are that 1) they require perfect knowledge of the measurement matrix
and 2) they need to be applied at the pace of change of the measurement matrix.
To overcome these issues, we consider the asymptotic regime in which $k$, $n$
and $m$ grow large at the same pace. Tools from random matrix theory are then
used to approximate in closed-form the most important error measures that are
commonly used. The asymptotic approximations are then leveraged to select
properly $k$ measurements exhibiting low values for the asymptotic error
measures. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed: the first one merely consists
in applying the convex optimization artifice to the asymptotic error measure.
The second algorithm is a low-complexity greedy algorithm that attempts to look
for a sufficiently good solution for the original minimization problem. The
greedy algorithm can be applied to both the exact and the asymptotic error
measures and can be thus implemented in blind and channel-aware fashions. We
present two potential applications where the proposed algorithms can be used,
namely antenna selection for uplink transmissions in large scale multi-user
systems and sensor selection for wireless sensor networks. Numerical results
are also presented and sustain the efficiency of the proposed blind methods in
reaching the performances of channel-aware algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Stereo algorithm is important for robotics applications, such as quadcopter
and autonomous driving. It needs to be robust enough to handle images of
challenging conditions, such as raining or strong lighting. Textureless and
specular regions of these images make feature matching difficult and smoothness
assumption invalid. It is important to understand whether an algorithm is
robust to these hazardous regions. Many stereo benchmarks have been developed
to evaluate the performance and track progress. But it is not easy to quantize
the effect of these hazardous regions. In this paper, we develop a synthetic
image generation tool and build a benchmark with synthetic images. First, we
manually tweak hazardous factors in a virtual world, such as making objects
more specular or transparent, to simulate corner cases to test the robustness
of stereo algorithms. Second, we use ground truth information, such as object
mask, material property, to automatically identify hazardous regions and
evaluate the accuracy of these regions. Our tool is based on a popular game
engine Unreal Engine 4 and will be open-source. Many publicly available
realistic game contents can be used by our tool which can provide an enormous
resource for algorithm development and evaluation.

 <dc:description>  Context: In the workplace, some individuals engage in the voluntary and
intentional generation, promotion, and realization of new ideas for the benefit
of individual performance, group effectiveness, or the organization. The
literature classifies this phenomenon as innovative behaviour. Despite its
importance to the development of innovation, innovative behaviour has not been
fully investigated in software engineering. Objective: To understand the
factors that support or inhibit innovative behaviour in software engineering
practice. Method: We conducted a pilot case study in a Canadian software
company using interviews and observations as data collection techniques. Using
qualitative analysis, we identified relevant factors and relationships not
addressed by studies from other areas. Results: Individual innovative behaviour
is influenced by individual attitudes and also by situational factors such as
relationships in the workplace, organizational characteristics, and project
type. We built a model to express the interacting effects of these factors.
Conclusions: Innovative behaviour is dependent on individual and contextual
factors. Our results contribute to relevant impacts on research and practice,
and to topics that deserve further study.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a multi-pair two-way amplify-and-forward relaying
system, where multiple pairs of full-duplex users are served via a full-duplex
relay with massive antennas, and the relay adopts maximum-ratio
combining/maximum-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) processing. The orthogonal pilot
scheme and the least square method are firstly exploited to estimate the
channel state information (CSI). When the number of relay antennas is finite,
we derive an approximate sum rate expression which is shown to be a good
predictor of the ergodic sum rate, especially in large number of antennas. Then
the corresponding achievable rate expression is obtained by adopting another
pilot scheme which estimates the composite CSI for each user pair to reduce the
pilot overhead of channel estimation. We analyze the achievable rates of the
two pilot schemes and then show the relative merits of the two methods.
Furthermore, power allocation strategies for users and the relay are proposed
based on sum rate maximization and max-min fairness criterion, respectively.
Finally, numerical results verify the accuracy of the analytical results and
show the performance gains achieved by the proposed power allocation.

 <dc:description>  It is believed that hippocampus functions as a memory allocator in brain, the
mechanism of which remains unrevealed. In Valiant's neuroidal model, the
hippocampus was described as a randomly connected graph, the computation on
which maps input to a set of activated neuroids with stable size. Valiant
proposed three requirements for the hippocampal circuit to become a stable
memory allocator (SMA): stability, continuity and orthogonality. The
functionality of SMA in hippocampus is essential in further computation within
cortex, according to Valiant's model.
  In this paper, we put these requirements for memorization functions into
rigorous mathematical formulation and introduce the concept of capacity, based
on the probability of erroneous allocation. We prove fundamental limits for the
capacity and error probability of SMA, in both data-independent and
data-dependent settings. We also establish an example of stable memory
allocator that can be implemented via neuroidal circuits. Both theoretical
bounds and simulation results show that the neural SMA functions well.

 <dc:description>  Data compression combined with effective encryption is a common requirement
of data storage and transmission. Low cost of these operations is often a high
priority in order to increase transmission speed and reduce power usage. This
requirement is crucial for battery-powered devices with limited resources, such
as autonomous remote sensors or implants. Well-known and popular encryption
techniques are frequently too expensive. This problem is on the increase as
machine-to-machine communication and the Internet of Things are becoming a
reality. Therefore, there is growing demand for finding trade-offs between
security, cost and performance in lightweight cryptography. This article
discusses Asymmetric Numeral Systems -- an innovative approach to entropy
coding which can be used for compression with encryption. It provides
compression ratio comparable with arithmetic coding at similar speed as Huffman
coding, hence, this coding is starting to replace them in new compressors.
Additionally, by perturbing its coding tables, the Asymmetric Numeral System
makes it possible to simultaneously encrypt the encoded message at nearly no
additional cost. The article introduces this approach and analyzes its security
level. The basic application is reducing the number of rounds of some cipher
used on ANS-compressed data, or completely removing additional encryption layer
if reaching a satisfactory protection level.

become available externally, from public resources (e.g., user profiles),
participation in OSNs (e.g., establishing relationships and recording
transactions such as user updates) and APIs of the OSN provider (such as the
Twitter API). APIs let OSN providers monetize the release of data while helping
control measurement load, e.g. by providing samples with different
cost-granularity tradeoffs. To date, this approach has been more suited to
releasing transactional data, with graphical data still being obtained by
resource intensive methods such a graph crawling. In this paper, we propose a
method for OSNs to provide samples of the user graph of tunable size, in
non-intersecting increments, with sample selection that can be weighted to
enhance accuracy when estimating different features of the graph.

 <dc:description>  Aiming at improving the efficiency and accuracy of community detection in
complex networks, we proposed a new algorithm, which is based on the idea that
communities could be detected from subnetworks by comparing the internal and
external cohesion of each subnetwork. In our method, similar nodes are firstly
gathered into meta-communities, which are then decided to be retained or merged
through a multilevel label propagation process, until all of them meet our
community criterion. Our algorithm requires neither any priori information of
communities nor optimization of any objective function. Experimental results on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that, our algorithm performs quite
well and runs extremely fast, compared with several other popular algorithms.
By tuning a resolution parameter, we can also observe communities at different
scales, so this could reveal the hierarchical structure of the network. To
further explore the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to the E-Coli
transcriptional regulatory network, and found that all the identified modules
have strong structural and functional coherence.

 <dc:description>  This paper presented our work on applying Recurrent Deep Stacking Networks
(RDSNs) to Robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. In the paper, we
also proposed a more efficient yet comparable substitute to RDSN, Bi- Pass
Stacking Network (BPSN). The main idea of these two models is to add
phoneme-level information into acoustic models, transforming an acoustic model
to the combination of an acoustic model and a phoneme-level N-gram model.
Experiments showed that RDSN and BPsn can substantially improve the
performances over conventional DNNs.

 <dc:description>  Community detection is a task of fundamental importance in social network
analysis that can be used in a variety of knowledge-based domains. While there
exist many works on community detection based on connectivity structures, they
suffer from either considering the overlapping or non-overlapping communities.
In this work, we propose a novel approach for general community detection
through an integrated framework to extract the overlapping and non-overlapping
community structures without assuming prior structural connectivity on
networks. Our general framework is based on a primary node based criterion
which consists of the internal association degree along with the external
association degree. The evaluation of the proposed method is investigated
through the extensive simulation experiments and several benchmark real network
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
the earlier state-of-the-art algorithms based on the well-known evaluation
criteria.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we report on domain clustering in the ambit of an adaptive MT
architecture. A standard bottom-up hierarchical clustering algorithm has been
instantiated with five different distances, which have been compared, on an MT
benchmark built on 40 commercial domains, in terms of dendrograms, intrinsic
and extrinsic evaluations. The main outcome is that the most expensive distance
is also the only one able to allow the MT engine to guarantee good performance
even with few, but highly populated clusters of domains.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), particularly Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
RNNs, are a popular and very successful method for learning and generating
sequences. However, current generative RNN techniques do not allow real-time
interactive control of the sequence generation process, thus aren't well suited
for live creative expression. We propose a method of real-time continuous
control and 'steering' of sequence generation using an ensemble of RNNs and
dynamically altering the mixture weights of the models. We demonstrate the
method using character based LSTM networks and a gestural interface allowing
users to 'conduct' the generation of text.

 <dc:title>Algorithmic Analysis of Invisible Video Watermarking using LSB Encoding
  Over a Client-Server Framework</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Video watermarking is extensively used in many media-oriented applications
for embedding watermarks, i.e. hidden digital data, in a video sequence to
protect the video from illegal copying and to identify manipulations made in
the video. In case of an invisible watermark, the human eye can not perceive
any difference in the video, but a watermark extraction application can read
the watermark and obtain the embedded information. Although numerous
methodologies exist for embedding watermarks, many of them have shortcomings
with respect to performance efficiency, especially over a distributed network.
This paper proposes and analyses a 2-bit Least Significant Bit (LSB) parallel
algorithmic approach for achieving performance efficiency to watermark and
distribute videos over a client-server framework.

 <dc:description>  We present an interior point method for the min-cost flow problem that uses
arc contractions and deletions to steer clear from the boundary of the polytope
when path-following methods come too close. We obtain a randomized algorithm
running in expected $\tilde O( m^{3/2} )$ time that only visits integer lattice
points in the vicinity of the central path of the polytope. This enables us to
use integer arithmetic like classical combinatorial algorithms typically do. We
provide explicit bounds on the size of the numbers that appear during all
computations. By presenting an integer arithmetic interior point algorithm we
avoid the tediousness of floating point error analysis and achieve a method
that is guaranteed to be free of any numerical issues. We thereby eliminate one
of the drawbacks of numerical methods in contrast to combinatorial min-cost
flow algorithms that still yield the most efficient implementations in
practice, despite their inferior worst-case time complexity.

 <dc:description>  A stochastic iterative algorithm approximating second-order information using
von Neumann series is discussed. We present convergence guarantees for
strongly-convex and smooth functions. Our analysis is much simpler in contrast
to a similar algorithm and its analysis, LISSA. The algorithm is primarily
suitable for training large scale linear models, where the number of data
points is very large. Two novel analyses, one showing space independent linear
convergence, and one showing conditional quadratic convergence are discussed.
In numerical experiments, the behavior of the error is similar to the
second-order algorithm L-BFGS, and improves the performance of LISSA for
quadratic objective function.

 <dc:description>  Let R be a finite principal left ideal ring. Via a total ordering of the ring
elements and an ordered basis a lexicographic ordering of the module R^n is
produced. This is used to set up a greedy algorithm that selects vectors for
which all linear combination with the previously selected vectors satisfy a
pre-specified selection property and updates the to-be-constructed code to the
linear hull of the vectors selected so far. The output is called a lexicode.
This process was discussed earlier in the literature for fields and chain
rings. In this paper we investigate the properties of such lexicodes over
finite principal left ideal rings and show that the total ordering of the ring
elements has to respect containment of ideals in order for the algorithm to
produce meaningful results. Only then it is guaranteed that the algorithm is
exhaustive and thus produces codes that are maximal with respect to inclusion.
It is further illustrated that the output of the algorithm heavily depends on
the total ordering and chosen basis.

 <dc:description>  This article examines the area coverage problem for a network of mobile
robots with imprecise agents' localization. Each robot has uniform radial
sensing ability, governed by first order kinodynamics. The convex-space is
partitioned based on the Guaranteed Voronoi (GV) principle and each robot's
area of responsibility corresponds to its GV-cell, bounded by hyperbolic arcs.
The proposed control law is distributed, demanding the positioning information
about its GV-Delaunay neighbors. Simulation and experimental studies are
offered to highlight the efficiency of the proposed control law.

 <dc:title>A Survey on Forced Oscillations in Power System</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghorbaniparvar, Mohammadreza</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Oscillations in a power system can be categorized into free oscillations and
forced oscillations. Many algorithms have been developed to estimate the modes
of free oscillations in a power system. Recently, forced oscillations caught
many attentions. Techniques are proposed to detect forced oscillations and
locate their sources. In addition, forced oscillations may have negative impact
on the estimation of mode and mode-shape if they are not properly accounted
for. To improve the power system reliability and dynamic properties, it is
important to first distinguish forced oscillations from free oscillations and
then locate the sources of forced oscillations in timely manner. The negative
impact of forced oscillation can be mitigated when they are detected and
located. This paper provides an overview on the analysis technique of forced
oscillations in power systems. In addition, some future opportunities are
discussed on forced oscillation studies.

reduce production costs, are envisioned to be a key feature of the smart grid
paradigm. Several recent works proposed DR mechanisms and used analytical
models to derive optimal incentives. Most of these works, however, rely on a
macroscopic description of the population that does not model individual
choices of users. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of those models
and we argue that the macroscopic descriptions hide important assumptions that
can jeopardize the mechanisms' implementation (such as the ability to make
personalized offers and to perfectly estimate the demand that is moved from a
timeslot to another). Then, we start from a microscopic description that
explicitly models each user's decision. We introduce four DR mechanisms with
various assumptions on the provider's capabilities. Contrarily to previous
studies, we find that the optimization problems that result from our mechanisms
are complex and can be solved numerically only through a heuristic. We present
numerical simulations that compare the different mechanisms and their
sensitivity to forecast errors. At a high level, our results show that the
performance of DR mechanisms under reasonable assumptions on the provider's
capabilities are significantly lower than

 <dc:description>  We present a family of neural-network--inspired models for computing
continuous word representations, specifically designed to exploit both
monolingual and multilingual text. This framework allows us to perform
unsupervised training of embeddings that exhibit higher accuracy on syntactic
and semantic compositionality, as well as multilingual semantic similarity,
compared to previous models trained in an unsupervised fashion. We also show
that such multilingual embeddings, optimized for semantic similarity, can
improve the performance of statistical machine translation with respect to how
it handles words not present in the parallel data.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the noisy phase retrieval problem: recovering a complex
image signal with independent noise from quadratic measurements. Inspired by
the dark fringes shown in the measured images of the array detector, a novel
phase retrieval approach is proposed and demonstrated both theoretically and
experimentally to recognize the dark fringes and bypass the invalid fringes. A
more accurate relative phase ratio between arbitrary two pixels is achieved by
calculating the multiplicative ratios (or the sum of phase difference) on the
path between them. Then the object phase image can be reconstructed precisely.
Our approach is a good choice for retrieving high-quality phase images from
noisy signals and has many potential applications in the fields such as X-ray
crystallography, diffractive imaging, and so on.

 <dc:title>An Architecture for Deep, Hierarchical Generative Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bachman, Philip</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an architecture which lets us train deep, directed generative
models with many layers of latent variables. We include deterministic paths
between all latent variables and the generated output, and provide a richer set
of connections between computations for inference and generation, which enables
more effective communication of information throughout the model during
training. To improve performance on natural images, we incorporate a
lightweight autoregressive model in the reconstruction distribution. These
techniques permit end-to-end training of models with 10+ layers of latent
variables. Experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on standard image modelling benchmarks, can expose latent class
structure in the absence of label information, and can provide convincing
imputations of occluded regions in natural images.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a method for imposing higher-level structure on generated,
polyphonic music. A Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (C-RBM) as a
generative model is combined with gradient descent constraint optimization to
provide further control over the generation process. Among other things, this
allows for the use of a &quot;template&quot; piece, from which some structural properties
can be extracted, and transferred as constraints to newly generated material.
The sampling process is guided with Simulated Annealing in order to avoid local
optima, and find solutions that both satisfy the constraints, and are
relatively stable with respect to the C-RBM. Results show that with this
approach it is possible to control the higher level self-similarity structure,
the meter, as well as tonal properties of the resulting musical piece while
preserving its local musical coherence.

 <dc:title>A Simple and Approximately Optimal Mechanism for a Buyer with

 <dc:description>  We consider a revenue-maximizing seller with $m$ heterogeneous items and a
single buyer whose valuation $v$ for the items may exhibit both substitutes
(i.e., for some $S, T$, $v(S \cup T) &lt; v(S) + v(T)$) and complements (i.e., for
some $S, T$, $v(S \cup T) &gt; v(S) + v(T)$). We show that the mechanism first
proposed by Babaioff et al. [2014] - the better of selling the items separately
and bundling them together - guarantees a $\Theta(d)$ fraction of the optimal
revenue, where $d$ is a measure on the degree of complementarity. Note that
this is the first approximately optimal mechanism for a buyer whose valuation
exhibits any kind of complementarity, and extends the work of Rubinstein and
Weinberg [2015], which proved that the same simple mechanisms achieve a
constant factor approximation when buyer valuations are subadditive, the most
general class of complement-free valuations.
  Our proof is enabled by the recent duality framework developed in Cai et al.
[2016], which we use to obtain a bound on the optimal revenue in this setting.
Our main technical contributions are specialized to handle the intricacies of
settings with complements, and include an algorithm for partitioning edges in a
hypergraph. Even nailing down the right model and notion of &quot;degree of
complementarity&quot; to obtain meaningful results is of interest, as the natural
extensions of previous definitions provably fail.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we propose a super-resolution method to resolve the problem
of image low spatial because of the limitation of imaging devices. We make use
of the strong non-linearity mapped ability of the back-propagation neural
networks(BPNN). Training sample images are got by undersampled method. The
elements chose as the inputs of the BPNN are pixels referred to Non-local
means(NL-Means). Making use of the self-similarity of the images, those inputs
are the pixels which are pixels gained from modified NL-means which is specific
for super-resolution. Besides, small change on core function of NL-means has
been applied in the method we use in this article so that we can have a clearer
edge in the shrunk image. Experimental results gained from the Peak Signal to
Noise Ratio(PSNR) and the Equivalent Number of Look(ENL), indicate that adding
the similar pixels as inputs will increase the results than not taking them
into consideration.

 <dc:description>  Deep models are the defacto standard in visual decision models due to their
impressive performance on a wide array of visual tasks. However, they are
frequently seen as opaque and are unable to explain their decisions. In
contrast, humans can justify their decisions with natural language and point to
the evidence in the visual world which led to their decisions. We postulate
that deep models can do this as well and propose our Pointing and Justification
(PJ-X) model which can justify its decision with a sentence and point to the
evidence by introspecting its decision and explanation process using an
attention mechanism. Unfortunately there is no dataset available with reference
explanations for visual decision making. We thus collect two datasets in two
domains where it is interesting and challenging to explain decisions. First, we
extend the visual question answering task to not only provide an answer but
also a natural language explanation for the answer. Second, we focus on
explaining human activities which is traditionally more challenging than object
classification. We extensively evaluate our PJ-X model, both on the
justification and pointing tasks, by comparing it to prior models and ablations
using both automatic and human evaluations.

encapsulation of complex probabilistic models with latent variables alongside
custom stochastic approximate inference machinery, and provides a
platform-agnostic abstraction barrier separating the model internals from the
host probabilistic inference system. The interface can be seen as a stochastic
generalization of a standard simulation and density interface for probabilistic
primitives. We show that sound approximate inference algorithms can be
constructed for networks of probabilistic modules, and we demonstrate that the
interface can be implemented using learned stochastic inference networks and
MCMC and SMC approximate inference programs.

 <dc:title>CoPaSul Manual - Contour-based parametric and superpositional intonation
  stylization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reichel, Uwe D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The purposes of the CoPaSul toolkit are (1) automatic prosodic annotation and
(2) prosodic feature extraction from syllable to utterance level. CoPaSul
stands for contour-based, parametric, superpositional intonation stylization.
In this framework intonation is represented as a superposition of global and
local contours that are described parametrically in terms of polynomial
coefficients. On the global level (usually associated but not necessarily
restricted to intonation phrases) the stylization serves to represent register
in terms of time-varying F0 level and range. On the local level (e.g. accent
groups), local contour shapes are described. From this parameterization several
features related to prosodic boundaries and prominence can be derived.
Furthermore, by coefficient clustering prosodic contour classes can be obtained
in a bottom-up way. Next to the stylization-based feature extraction also
standard F0 and energy measures (e.g. mean and variance) as well as rhythmic
aspects can be calculated. At the current state automatic annotation comprises:
segmentation into interpausal chunks, syllable nucleus extraction, and
unsupervised localization of prosodic phrase boundaries and prominent
syllables. F0 and partly also energy feature sets can be derived for: standard
measurements (as median and IQR), register in terms of F0 level and range,
prosodic boundaries, local contour shapes, bottom-up derived contour classes,
Gestalt of accent groups in terms of their deviation from higher level prosodic
units, as well as for rhythmic aspects quantifying the relation between F0 and
energy contours and prosodic event rates.

 <dc:title>Detect, Replace, Refine: Deep Structured Prediction For Pixel Wise

 <dc:description>  Pixel wise image labeling is an interesting and challenging problem with
great significance in the computer vision community. In order for a dense
labeling algorithm to be able to achieve accurate and precise results, it has
to consider the dependencies that exist in the joint space of both the input
and the output variables. An implicit approach for modeling those dependencies
is by training a deep neural network that, given as input an initial estimate
of the output labels and the input image, it will be able to predict a new
refined estimate for the labels. In this context, our work is concerned with
what is the optimal architecture for performing the label improvement task. We
argue that the prior approaches of either directly predicting new label
estimates or predicting residual corrections w.r.t. the initial labels with
feed-forward deep network architectures are sub-optimal. Instead, we propose a
generic architecture that decomposes the label improvement task to three steps:
1) detecting the initial label estimates that are incorrect, 2) replacing the
incorrect labels with new ones, and finally 3) refining the renewed labels by
predicting residual corrections w.r.t. them. Furthermore, we explore and
compare various other alternative architectures that consist of the
aforementioned Detection, Replace, and Refine components. We extensively
evaluate the examined architectures in the challenging task of dense disparity
estimation (stereo matching) and we report both quantitative and qualitative
results on three different datasets. Finally, our dense disparity estimation
network that implements the proposed generic architecture, achieves
state-of-the-art results in the KITTI 2015 test surpassing prior approaches by
a significant margin.

 <dc:title>Beam Search for Learning a Deep Convolutional Neural Network of 3D

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses 3D shape recognition. Recent work typically represents a
3D shape as a set of binary variables corresponding to 3D voxels of a uniform
3D grid centered on the shape, and resorts to deep convolutional neural
networks(CNNs) for modeling these binary variables. Robust learning of such
CNNs is currently limited by the small datasets of 3D shapes available, an
order of magnitude smaller than other common datasets in computer vision.
Related work typically deals with the small training datasets using a number of
ad hoc, hand-tuning strategies. To address this issue, we formulate CNN
learning as a beam search aimed at identifying an optimal CNN architecture,
namely, the number of layers, nodes, and their connectivity in the network, as
well as estimating parameters of such an optimal CNN. Each state of the beam
search corresponds to a candidate CNN. Two types of actions are defined to add
new convolutional filters or new convolutional layers to a parent CNN, and thus
transition to children states. The utility function of each action is
efficiently computed by transferring parameter values of the parent CNN to its
children, thereby enabling an efficient beam search. Our experimental
evaluation on the 3D ModelNet dataset demonstrates that our model pursuit using
the beam search yields a CNN with superior performance on 3D shape
classification than the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  We propose to operate massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) cellular
base stations (BSs) in unlicensed bands. We denote such system as massive MIMO
unlicensed (mMIMO-U). We design the key procedures required at a cellular BS to
guarantee coexistence with nearby Wi-Fi devices operating in the same band. In
particular, spatial reuse is enhanced by actively suppressing interference
towards neighboring Wi-Fi devices. Wi-Fi interference rejection is also
performed during an enhanced listen-before-talk (LBT) phase. These operations
enable Wi-Fi devices to access the channel as though no cellular BSs were
transmitting, and vice versa. Under concurrent Wi-Fi and BS transmissions, the
downlink rates attainable by cellular user equipment (UEs) are degraded by the
Wi-Fi-generated interference. To mitigate this effect, we select a suitable set
of UEs to be served in the unlicensed band accounting for a measure of the
Wi-Fi/UE proximity. Our results show that the so-designed mMIMO-U allows
simultaneous cellular and Wi-Fi transmissions by keeping their mutual
interference below the regulatory threshold. Compared to a system without
interference suppression, Wi-Fi devices enjoy a median interference power
reduction of between 3 dB with 16 antennas and 18 dB with 128 antennas. With
mMIMO-U, cellular BSs can also achieve large data rates without significantly
degrading the performance of Wi-Fi networks deployed within their coverage
area.

 <dc:title>SVD-based Kalman Filter Derivative Computation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recursive adaptive filtering methods are often used for solving the problem
of simultaneous state and parameters estimation arising in many areas of
research. The gradient-based schemes for adaptive Kalman filtering (KF) require
the corresponding filter sensitivity computations. The standard approach is
based on the direct differentiation of the KF equations. The shortcoming of
this strategy is a numerical instability of the conventional KF (and its
derivatives) with respect to roundoff errors. For decades, special attention
has been paid in the KF community for designing efficient filter
implementations that improve robustness of the estimator against roundoff. The
most popular and beneficial techniques are found in the class of square-root
(SR) or UD factorization-based methods. They imply the Cholesky decomposition
of the corresponding error covariance matrix. Another important matrix
factorization method is the singular value decomposition (SVD) and, hence,
further encouraging KF algorithms might be found under this approach.
Meanwhile, the filter sensitivity computation heavily relies on the use of
matrix differential calculus. Previous works on the robust KF derivative
computation have produced the SR- and UD-based methodologies. Alternatively, in
this paper we design the SVD-based approach. The solution is expressed in terms
of the SVD-based KF covariance quantities and their derivatives (with respect
to unknown system parameters). The results of numerical experiments illustrate
that although the newly-developed SDV-based method is algebraically equivalent
to the conventional approach and the previously derived SR- and UD-based
strategies, it outperforms the mentioned techniques for estimation accuracy in
ill-conditioned situations.

 <dc:description>  We consider edge insertion and deletion operations that increase the
connectivity of a given planar straight-line graph (PSLG), while minimizing the
total edge length of the output. We show that every connected PSLG $G=(V,E)$ in
general position can be augmented to a 2-connected PSLG $(V,E\cup E^+)$ by
adding new edges of total Euclidean length $\|E^+\|\leq 2\|E\|$, and this bound
is the best possible. An optimal edge set $E^+$ can be computed in $O(|V|^4)$
time; however the problem becomes NP-hard when $G$ is disconnected. Further,
there is a sequence of edge insertions and deletions that transforms a
connected PSLG $G=(V,E)$ into a planar straight-line cycle $G'=(V,E')$ such
that $\|E'\|\leq 2\|{\rm MST}(V)\|$, and the graph remains connected with edge
length below $\|E\|+\|{\rm MST}(V)\|$ at all stages. These bounds are the best
possible.

 <dc:description>  The perceptron algorithm for linear programming, arising from machine
learning, has been around since the 1950s. While not a polynomial-time
algorithm, it is useful in practice due to its simplicity and robustness. In
2004, Dunagan and Vempala showed that a randomized rescaling turns the
perceptron method into a polynomial time algorithm, and later Pe\~{n}a and
Soheili gave a deterministic rescaling. In this paper, we give a deterministic
rescaling for the perceptron algorithm that improves upon the previous
rescaling methods by making it possible to rescale much earlier. This results
in a faster running time for the rescaled perceptron algorithm. We will also
demonstrate that the same rescaling methods yield a polynomial time algorithm
based on the multiplicative weights update method. This draws a connection to
an area that has received a lot of recent attention in theoretical computer
science.

 <dc:description>  The detailed reconstruction of neural anatomy for connectomics studies
requires a combination of resolution and large three-dimensional data capture
provided by serial section electron microscopy (ssEM). The convergence of high
throughput ssEM imaging and improved tissue preparation methods now allows ssEM
capture of complete specimen volumes up to cubic millimeter scale. The
resulting multi-terabyte image sets span thousands of serial sections and must
be precisely registered into coherent volumetric forms in which neural circuits
can be traced and segmented. This paper introduces a Signal Whitening Fourier
Transform Image Registration approach (SWiFT-IR) under development at the
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and its use to align mouse and zebrafish brain
datasets acquired using the wafer mapper ssEM imaging technology recently
developed at Harvard University. Unlike other methods now used for ssEM
registration, SWiFT-IR modifies its spatial frequency response during image
matching to maximize a signal-to-noise measure used as its primary indicator of
alignment quality. This alignment signal is more robust to rapid variations in
biological content and unavoidable data distortions than either phase-only or
standard Pearson correlation, thus allowing more precise alignment and
statistical confidence. These improvements in turn enable an iterative
registration procedure based on projections through multiple sections rather
than more typical adjacent-pair matching methods. This projection approach,
when coupled with known anatomical constraints and iteratively applied in a
multi-resolution pyramid fashion, drives the alignment into a smooth form that
properly represents complex and widely varying anatomical content such as the
full cross-section zebrafish data.

of minimum degree at least 3. Our algorithm uses the framework of
ear-decompositions for approximating connectivity problems, which was
previously used in algorithms for finding the smallest 2-edge-connected
spanning subgraph by Cheriyan, Seb\H{o} and Szigeti (SIAM J.Discrete Math.

 <dc:description>  In many model-based diagnosis applications it is impossible to provide such a
set of observations and/or measurements that allow to identify the real cause
of a fault. Therefore, diagnosis systems often return many possible candidates,
leaving the burden of selecting the correct diagnosis to a user. Sequential
diagnosis techniques solve this problem by automatically generating a sequence
of queries to some oracle. The answers to these queries provide additional
information necessary to gradually restrict the search space by removing
diagnosis candidates inconsistent with the answers.
  During query computation, existing sequential diagnosis methods often require
the generation of many unnecessary query candidates and strongly rely on
expensive logical reasoners. We tackle this issue by devising efficient
heuristic query search methods. The proposed methods enable for the first time
a completely reasoner-free query generation while at the same time guaranteeing
optimality conditions, e.g. minimal cardinality or best understandability, of
the returned query that existing methods cannot realize. Hence, the performance
of this approach is independent of the (complexity of the) diagnosed system.
Experiments conducted using real-world problems show that the new approach is
highly scalable and outperforms existing methods by orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new set of problems based on the Chain Editing problem. In our
version of Chain Editing, we are given a set of anonymous participants and a
set of undisclosed tasks that every participant attempts. For each
participant-task pair, we know whether the participant has succeeded at the
task or not. We assume that participants vary in their ability to solve tasks,
and that tasks vary in their difficulty to be solved. In an ideal world,
stronger participants should succeed at a superset of tasks that weaker
participants succeed at. Similarly, easier tasks should be completed
successfully by a superset of participants who succeed at harder tasks. In
reality, it can happen that a stronger participant fails at a task that a
weaker participants succeeds at. Our goal is to find a perfect nesting of the
participant-task relations by flipping a minimum number of participant-task
relations, implying such a &quot;nearest perfect ordering&quot; to be the one that is
closest to the truth of participant strengths and task difficulties. Many
variants of the problem are known to be NP-hard.
  We propose six natural $k$-near versions of the Chain Editing problem and
classify their complexity. The input to a $k$-near Chain Editing problem
includes an initial ordering of the participants (or tasks) that we are
required to respect by moving each participant (or task) at most $k$ positions
from the initial ordering. We obtain surprising results on the complexity of
the six $k$-near problems: Five of the problems are polynomial-time solvable
using dynamic programming, but one of them is NP-hard.

 <dc:description>  We present a polynomial multigrid method for the nodal interior penalty
formulation of the Poisson equation on three-dimensional Cartesian grids. Its
key ingredient is a weighted overlapping Schwarz smoother operating on
element-centered subdomains. The MG method reaches superior convergence rates
corresponding to residual reductions of about two orders of magnitude within a
single V(1,1) cycle. It is robust with respect to the mesh size and the ansatz
order, at least up to ${P=32}$. Rigorous exploitation of tensor-product
factorization yields a computational complexity of $O(PN)$ for $N$ unknowns,
whereas numerical experiments indicate even linear runtime scaling. Moreover,
by allowing adjustable subdomain overlaps and adding Krylov acceleration, the
method proved feasible for anisotropic grids with element aspect ratios up to
48.

 <dc:title>The Capacity of Gaussian MIMO Channels Under Total and Per-Antenna Power
  Constraints</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Loyka, S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The capacity of a fixed Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
channel and the optimal transmission strategy under the total power (TP)
constraint and full channel state information are well-known. This problem
remains open in the general case under individual per-antenna (PA) power
constraints, while some special cases have been solved. These include a
full-rank solution for the MIMO channel and a general solution for the
multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel. In this paper, the fixed Gaussian
MISO channel is considered and its capacity as well as optimal transmission
strategies are determined in a closed form under the joint total and
per-antenna power constraints in the general case. In particular, the optimal
strategy is hybrid and includes two parts: first is equal-gain transmission and
second is maximum-ratio transmission, which are responsible for the PA and TP
constraints respectively. The optimal beamforming vector is given in a
closed-form and an accurate yet simple approximation to the capacity is
proposed. Finally, the above results are extended to the MIMO case by
establishing the ergodic capacity of fading MIMO channels under the joint power
constraints when the fading distribution is right unitary-invariant (of which
i.i.d. and semi-correlated Rayleigh fading are special cases). Unlike the fixed
MISO case, the optimal signaling is shown to be isotropic in this case.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a generalization of deep neural networks called deep
function machines (DFMs). DFMs act on vector spaces of arbitrary (possibly
infinite) dimension and we show that a family of DFMs are invariant to the
dimension of input data; that is, the parameterization of the model does not
directly hinge on the quality of the input (eg. high resolution images). Using
this generalization we provide a new theory of universal approximation of
bounded non-linear operators between function spaces. We then suggest that DFMs
provide an expressive framework for designing new neural network layer types
with topological considerations in mind. Finally, we introduce a novel
architecture, RippLeNet, for resolution invariant computer vision, which
empirically achieves state of the art invariance.

 <dc:title>Anomaly Detection Using the Knowledge-based Temporal Abstraction Method</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shabtai, Asaf</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The rapid growth in stored time-oriented data necessitates the development of
new methods for handling, processing, and interpreting large amounts of
temporal data. One important example of such processing is detecting anomalies
in time-oriented data. The Knowledge-Based Temporal Abstraction method was
previously proposed for intelligent interpretation of temporal data based on
predefined domain knowledge. In this study we propose a framework that
integrates the KBTA method with a temporal pattern mining process for anomaly
detection. According to the proposed method a temporal pattern mining process
is applied on a dataset of basic temporal abstraction database in order to
extract patterns representing normal behavior. These patterns are then analyzed
in order to identify abnormal time periods characterized by a significantly
small number of normal patterns. The proposed approach was demonstrated using a
dataset collected from a real server.

 <dc:description>  Spectral imaging has received enormous interest in the field of medical
imaging modalities. It provides a powerful tool for the analysis of different
organs and non-invasive tissues. Therefore, significant amount of research has
been conducted to explore the possibility of using spectral imaging in
biomedical applications. To observe spectral image information in real time
during surgery and monitor the temporal changes in the organs and tissues is a
demanding task. Available spectral imaging devices are not sufficient to
accomplish this task with an acceptable spatial and spectral resolution. A
solution to this problem is to estimate the spectral video from RGB video and
perform visualization with the most prominent spectral bands. In this research,
we propose a framework to generate neurosurgery spectral video from RGB video.
A spectral estimation technique is applied on each RGB video frames. The RGB
video is captured using a digital camera connected with an operational
microscope dedicated to neurosurgery. A database of neurosurgery spectral
images is used to collect training data and evaluate the estimation accuracy. A
searching technique is used to identify the best training set. Five different
spectrum estimation techniques are experimented to indentify the best method.
Although this framework is established for neurosurgery spectral video
generation, however, the methodology outlined here would also be applicable to
other similar research.

 <dc:description>  Fast-AT is an automatic thumbnail generation system based on deep neural
networks. It is a fully-convolutional deep neural network, which learns
specific filters for thumbnails of different sizes and aspect ratios. During
inference, the appropriate filter is selected depending on the dimensions of
the target thumbnail. Unlike most previous work, Fast-AT does not utilize
saliency but addresses the problem directly. In addition, it eliminates the
need to conduct region search on the saliency map. The model generalizes to
thumbnails of different sizes including those with extreme aspect ratios and
can generate thumbnails in real time. A data set of more than 70,000 thumbnail
annotations was collected to train Fast-AT. We show competitive results in
comparison to existing techniques.

 <dc:description>  Learning from the crowd has become increasingly popular in the Web and social
media. There is a wide variety of crowdlearning sites in which, on the one
hand, users learn from the knowledge that other users contribute to the site,
and, on the other hand, knowledge is reviewed and curated by the same users
using assessment measures such as upvotes or likes.
  In this paper, we present a probabilistic modeling framework of
crowdlearning, which uncovers the evolution of a user's expertise over time by
leveraging other users' assessments of her contributions. The model allows for
both off-site and on-site learning and captures forgetting of knowledge. We
then develop a scalable estimation method to fit the model parameters from
millions of recorded learning and contributing events. We show the
effectiveness of our model by tracing activity of ~25 thousand users in Stack
Overflow over a 4.5 year period. We find that answers with high knowledge value
are rare. Newbies and experts tend to acquire less knowledge than users in the
middle range. Prolific learners tend to be also proficient contributors that
post answers with high knowledge value.

 <dc:description>  One characteristic that sets humans apart from modern learning-based computer
vision algorithms is the ability to acquire knowledge about the world and use
that knowledge to reason about the visual world. Humans can learn about the
characteristics of objects and the relationships that occur between them to
learn a large variety of visual concepts, often with few examples. This paper
investigates the use of structured prior knowledge in the form of knowledge
graphs and shows that using this knowledge improves performance on image
classification. We build on recent work on end-to-end learning on graphs,
introducing the Graph Search Neural Network as a way of efficiently
incorporating large knowledge graphs into a vision classification pipeline. We
show in a number of experiments that our method outperforms standard neural
network baselines for multi-label classification.

 <dc:title>Constraint Selection in Metric Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Capitaine, Hoel Le</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A number of machine learning algorithms are using a metric, or a distance, in
order to compare individuals. The Euclidean distance is usually employed, but
it may be more efficient to learn a parametric distance such as Mahalanobis
metric. Learning such a metric is a hot topic since more than ten years now,
and a number of methods have been proposed to efficiently learn it. However,
the nature of the problem makes it quite difficult for large scale data, as
well as data for which classes overlap. This paper presents a simple way of
improving accuracy and scalability of any iterative metric learning algorithm,
where constraints are obtained prior to the algorithm. The proposed approach
relies on a loss-dependent weighted selection of constraints that are used for
learning the metric. Using the corresponding dedicated loss function, the
method clearly allows to obtain better results than state-of-the-art methods,
both in terms of accuracy and time complexity. Some experimental results on
real world, and potentially large, datasets are demonstrating the effectiveness
of our proposition.

 <dc:title>Temporal-Needle: A view and appearance invariant video descriptor</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The ability to detect similar actions across videos can be very useful for
real-world applications in many fields. However, this task is still challenging
for existing systems, since videos that present the same action, can be taken
from significantly different viewing directions, performed by different actors
and backgrounds and under various video qualities. Video descriptors play a
significant role in these systems. In this work we propose the
&quot;temporal-needle&quot; descriptor which captures the dynamic behavior, while being
invariant to viewpoint and appearance. The descriptor is computed using multi
temporal scales of the video and by computing self-similarity for every patch
through time in every temporal scale. The descriptor is computed for every
pixel in the video. However, to find similar actions across videos, we consider
only a small subset of the descriptors - the statistical significant
descriptors. This allow us to find good correspondences across videos more
efficiently. Using the descriptor, we were able to detect the same behavior
across videos in a variety of scenarios. We demonstrate the use of the
descriptor in tasks such as temporal and spatial alignment, action detection
and even show its potential in unsupervised video clustering into categories.
In this work we handled only videos taken with stationary cameras, but the
descriptor can be extended to handle moving camera as well.

 <dc:description>  We present the design of a low-power 4-bit 1GS/s folding-flash ADC with a
folding factor of two. The design of a new unbalanced double-tail dynamic
comparator affords an ultra-low power operation and a high dynamic range.
Unlike the conventional approaches, this design uses a fully matched input
stage, an unbalanced latch stage, and a two-clock operation scheme. A
combination of these features yields significant reduction of the kick-back
noise, while allowing the design flexibility for adjusting the trip points of
the comparators. As a result, the ADC achieves SNDR of 22.3 dB at 100MHz and
21.8 dB at 500MHz (i.e. the Nyquist frequency). The maximum INL and DNL are
about 0.2 LSB. The converter consumes about 700uW from a 1-V supply yielding a
figure of merit of 65fJ/conversion step. These attributes make the proposed
folding-flash ADC attractive for the next-generation wireless applications.

 <dc:title>A fuzzy approach for segmentation of touching characters</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The problem of correctly segmenting touching characters is an hard task to
solve and it is of major relevance in pattern recognition. In the recent years,
many methods and algorithms have been proposed; still, a definitive solution is
far from being found. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on fuzzy
logic. The proposed method combines in a novel way three features for
segmenting touching characters that have been already proposed in other studies
but have been exploited only singularly so far. The proposed strategy is based
on a 3--input/1--output fuzzy inference system with fuzzy rules specifically
optimized for segmenting touching characters in the case of Latin printed and
handwritten characters. The system performances are illustrated and supported
by numerical examples showing that our approach can achieve a reasonable good
overall accuracy in segmenting characters even on tricky conditions of touching
characters. Moreover, numerical results suggest that the method can be applied
to many different datasets of characters by means of a convenient tuning of the
fuzzy sets and rules.

 <dc:description>  User acceptance of artificial intelligence agents might depend on their
ability to explain their reasoning, which requires adding an interpretability
layer that fa- cilitates users to understand their behavior. This paper focuses
on adding an in- terpretable layer on top of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS),
which measures the degree of semantic equivalence between two sentences. The
interpretability layer is formalized as the alignment between pairs of segments
across the two sentences, where the relation between the segments is labeled
with a relation type and a similarity score. We present a publicly available
dataset of sentence pairs annotated following the formalization. We then
develop a system trained on this dataset which, given a sentence pair, explains
what is similar and different, in the form of graded and typed segment
alignments. When evaluated on the dataset, the system performs better than an
informed baseline, showing that the dataset and task are well-defined and
feasible. Most importantly, two user studies show how the system output can be
used to automatically produce explanations in natural language. Users performed
better when having access to the explanations, pro- viding preliminary evidence
that our dataset and method to automatically produce explanations is useful in
real applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel non-parametric clustering technique, which
is based on an iterative algorithm that peels off layers of points around the
clusters. Our technique is based on the notion that each latent cluster is
comprised of layers that surround its core, where the external layers, or
border points, implicitly separate the clusters. Analyzing the K-nearest
neighbors of the points makes it possible to identify the border points and
associate them with points of inner layers. Our clustering algorithm
iteratively identifies border points, peels them, and separates the latent
clusters. We show that the peeling process adapts to the local density and
successfully separates adjacent clusters. A notable quality of the
Border-Peeling algorithm is that it does not require any parameter tuning in
order to outperform state-of-the-art finely-tuned non-parametric clustering
methods, including Mean-Shift and DBSCAN. We further assess our technique on
high-dimensional datasets that vary in size and characteristics. In particular,
we analyze the space of deep features that were trained by a convolutional
neural network.

 <dc:description>  We investigate a human-machine collaborative drawing environment in which an
autonomous agent sketches images while optionally allowing a user to directly
influence the agent's trajectory. We combine Monte Carlo Tree Search with image
classifiers and test both shallow models (e.g. multinomial logistic regression)
and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g. LeNet, Inception v3). We found
that using the shallow model, the agent produces a limited variety of images,
which are noticably recogonisable by humans. However, using the deeper models,
the agent produces a more diverse range of images, and while the agent remains
very confident (99.99%) in having achieved its objective, to humans they mostly
resemble unrecognisable 'random' noise. We relate this to recent research which
also discovered that 'deep neural networks are easily fooled' \cite{Nguyen2015}
and we discuss possible solutions and future directions for the research.

 <dc:description>  While advances in computing resources have made processing enormous amounts
of data possible, human ability to identify patterns in such data has not
scaled accordingly. Efficient computational methods for condensing and
simplifying data are thus becoming vital for extracting actionable insights. In
particular, while data summarization techniques have been studied extensively,
only recently has summarizing interconnected data, or graphs, become popular.
This survey is a structured, comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art
methods for summarizing graph data. We first broach the motivation behind, and
the challenges of, graph summarization. We then categorize summarization
approaches by the type of graphs taken as input and further organize each
category by core methodology. Finally, we discuss applications of summarization
on real-world graphs and conclude by describing some open problems in the
field.

 <dc:description>  Most approaches to human attribute and action recognition in still images are
based on image representation in which multi-scale local features are pooled
across scale into a single, scale-invariant encoding. Both in bag-of-words and
the recently popular representations based on convolutional neural networks,
local features are computed at multiple scales. However, these multi-scale
convolutional features are pooled into a single scale-invariant representation.
We argue that entirely scale-invariant image representations are sub-optimal
and investigate approaches to scale coding within a Bag of Deep Features
framework.
  Our approach encodes multi-scale information explicitly during the image
encoding stage. We propose two strategies to encode multi-scale information
explicitly in the final image representation. We validate our two scale coding
techniques on five datasets: Willow, PASCAL VOC 2010, PASCAL VOC 2012,
Stanford-40 and Human Attributes (HAT-27). On all datasets, the proposed scale
coding approaches outperform both the scale-invariant method and the standard
deep features of the same network. Further, combining our scale coding
approaches with standard deep features leads to consistent improvement over the
state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  A prediction market is a useful means of aggregating information about a
future event. To function, the market needs a trusted entity who will verify
the true outcome in the end. Motivated by the recent introduction of
decentralized prediction markets, we introduce a mechanism that allows for the
outcome to be determined by the votes of a group of arbiters who may themselves
hold stakes in the market. Despite the potential conflict of interest, we
derive conditions under which we can incentivize arbiters to vote truthfully by
using funds raised from market fees to implement a peer prediction mechanism.
Finally, we investigate what parameter values could be used in a real-world
implementation of our mechanism.

 <dc:description>  Compressive sensing (CS) is a promising technology for realizing
energy-efficient wireless sensors for long-term health monitoring. However,
conventional model-driven CS frameworks suffer from limited compression ratio
and reconstruction quality when dealing with physiological signals due to
inaccurate models and the overlook of individual variability. In this paper, we
propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and
personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to
enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such
improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the
sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property
and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show
that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10x, successfully reduces
the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random
matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB
over conventional model-driven approaches.

 <dc:description>  Let $T$ be a tree space (or tree network) represented by a weighted tree with
$t$ vertices, and $S$ be a set of $n$ stochastic points in $T$, each of which
has a fixed location with an independent existence probability. We investigate
two fundamental problems under such a stochastic setting, the closest-pair
problem and the nearest-neighbor search. For the former, we study the
computation of the $\ell$-threshold probability and the expectation of the
closest-pair distance of a realization of $S$. We propose the first algorithm
to compute the $\ell$-threshold probability in $O(t+n\log n+ \min\{tn,n^2\})$
time for any given threshold $\ell$, which immediately results in an
$O(t+\min\{tn^3,n^4\})$-time algorithm for computing the expected closest-pair
distance. Based on this, we further show that one can compute a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the expected closest-pair distance in
$O(t+\varepsilon^{-1}\min\{tn^2,n^3\})$ time, by arguing that the expected
closest-pair distance can be approximated via $O(\varepsilon^{-1}n)$ threshold
probability queries. For the latter, we study the $k$ most-likely
nearest-neighbor search ($k$-LNN) via a notion called $k$ most-likely Voronoi
Diagram ($k$-LVD). We show that the size of the $k$-LVD $\varPsi_T^S$ of $S$ on
$T$ is bounded by $O(kn)$ if the existence probabilities of the points in $S$
are constant-far from 0. Furthermore, we establish an $O(kn)$ average-case
upper bound for the size of $\varPsi_T^S$, by regarding the existence
probabilities as i.i.d. random variables drawn from some fixed distribution.
Our results imply the existence of an LVD data structure which answers $k$-LNN
queries in $O(\log n+k)$ time using average-case $O(t+k^2n)$ space, and
worst-case $O(t+kn^2)$ space if the existence probabilities are constant-far
from 0. Finally, we also give an $O(t+ n^2\log n+n^2k)$-time algorithm to
construct the LVD data structure.

 <dc:description>  Objective: The advent of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) with large
electronic imaging databases along with advances in deep neural networks with
machine learning has provided a unique opportunity to achieve milestones in
automated image analysis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most
commonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and
rich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to
determine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images
from images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Methods:
Automated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to
clinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg
Spectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted
from EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two
cohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a
random subset of patients. Area under receiver operator curves (auROC) were
constructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient
level. Results: Of an extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical
datapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were
selected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either
normal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an auROC of 92.78% with an
accuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an auROC of 93.83% with an
accuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an auROC of 97.45% with an
accuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were
92.64% and 93.69% respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques are
effective for classifying OCT images. These findings have important
implications in utilizing OCT in automated screening and computer aided
diagnosis tools.

 <dc:description>  In this work, a novel data-based stochastic global identification framework
is introduced for air vehicles operating under varying flight states and
uncertainty. In this context, the term global refers to the identification of a
model that is capable of representing the system dynamics under any admissible
flight state based on data recorded from sample states. The proposed framework
is based on stochastic time-series models for representing the system dynamics
and aeroelastic response under multiple flight states, with each state
characterized by several variables, such as the airspeed and angle of attack,
forming a flight state vector. The method's cornerstone lies in the new class
of Vector-dependent Functionally Pooled (VFP) models which allow the explicit
analytical inclusion of the flight state vector into the model parameters and,
hence, system dynamics. The experimental evaluation is based on a prototype
bio-inspired self-sensing composite wing that is subjected to a series of wind
tunnel experiments. Distributed micro-sensors in the form of stretchable sensor
networks are embedded in the composite layup of the wing to provide the sensing
capabilities. Data collected from piezoelectric sensors are employed for the
identification of a stochastic global VFP model. The estimated VFP model
parameters constitute two-dimensional functions of the flight state vector
defined by the airspeed and angle of attack. The identified model is able to
successfully represent the aeroelastic response of the wing under the
admissible flight states via a minimum number of estimated parameters compared
to standard identification approaches. The obtained results demonstrate the
high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed global identification
framework, thus constituting a first step towards the next generation of
fly-by-feel aerospace vehicles with state awareness capabilities.

 <dc:title>Learning binary or real-valued time-series via spike-timing dependent

 <dc:description>  A dynamic Boltzmann machine (DyBM) has been proposed as a model of a spiking
neural network, and its learning rule of maximizing the log-likelihood of given
time-series has been shown to exhibit key properties of spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP), which had been postulated and experimentally confirmed in
the field of neuroscience as a learning rule that refines the Hebbian rule.
Here, we relax some of the constraints in the DyBM in a way that it becomes
more suitable for computation and learning. We show that learning the DyBM can
be considered as logistic regression for binary-valued time-series. We also
show how the DyBM can learn real-valued data in the form of a Gaussian DyBM and
discuss its relation to the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. The Gaussian
DyBM extends the VAR by using additional explanatory variables, which
correspond to the eligibility traces of the DyBM and capture long term
dependency of the time-series. Numerical experiments show that the Gaussian
DyBM significantly improves the predictive accuracy over VAR.

 <dc:description>  We describe a computationally efficient, stochastic graph-regularization
technique that can be utilized for the semi-supervised training of deep neural
networks in a parallel or distributed setting. We utilize a technique, first
described in [13] for the construction of mini-batches for stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) based on synthesized partitions of an affinity graph that are
consistent with the graph structure, but also preserve enough stochasticity for
convergence of SGD to good local minima. We show how our technique allows a
graph-based semi-supervised loss function to be decomposed into a sum over
objectives, facilitating data parallelism for scalable training of machine
learning models. Empirical results indicate that our method significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to the fully-supervised case when the
fraction of labeled data is low, and in the parallel case, achieves significant
speed-up in terms of wall-clock time to convergence. We show the results for
both sequential and distributed-memory semi-supervised DNN training on a speech
corpus.

 <dc:description>  We describe a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework in the context
of deep neural networks that uses a graph-based entropic regularizer to favor
smooth solutions over a graph induced by the data. The main contribution of
this work is a computationally efficient, stochastic graph-regularization
technique that uses mini-batches that are consistent with the graph structure,
but also provides enough stochasticity (in terms of mini-batch data diversity)
for convergence of stochastic gradient descent methods to good solutions. For
this work, we focus on results of frame-level phone classification accuracy on
the TIMIT speech corpus but our method is general and scalable to much larger
data sets. Results indicate that our method significantly improves
classification accuracy compared to the fully-supervised case when the fraction
of labeled data is low, and it is competitive with other methods in the fully
labeled case.

 <dc:title>Tinkering Under the Hood: Interactive Zero-Shot Learning with Net

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of visual net surgery, in which a CNN can be
reconfigured without extra data to recognize novel concepts that may be omitted
from the training set. While most prior work make use of linguistic cues for
such &quot;zero-shot&quot; learning, we do so by using a pictorial language
representation of the training set, implicitly learned by a CNN, to generalize
to new classes. To this end, we introduce a set of visualization techniques
that better reveal the activation patterns and relations between groups of CNN
filters. We next demonstrate that knowledge of pictorial languages can be used
to rewire certain CNN neurons into a part model, which we call a pictorial
language classifier. We demonstrate the robustness of simple PLCs by applying
them in a weakly supervised manner: labeling unlabeled concepts for visual
classes present in the training data. Specifically we show that a PLC built on
top of a CNN trained for ImageNet classification can localize humans in Graz-02
and determine the pose of birds in PASCAL-VOC without extra labeled data or
additional training. We then apply PLCs in an interactive zero-shot manner,
demonstrating that pictorial languages are expressive enough to detect a set of
visual classes in MS-COCO that never appear in the ImageNet training set.

 <dc:description>  Capabilities to exchange health information are critical to accelerate
discovery and its diffusion to healthcare practice. However, the same ethical
and legal policies that protect privacy hinder these data exchanges, and the
issues accumulate if moving data across geographical or organizational borders.
This can be seen as one of the reasons why many health technologies and
research findings are limited to very narrow domains. In this paper, we compare
how using and disclosing personal data for research purposes is addressed in
Australian, Austrian, Finnish, Swiss, and US policies with a focus on text data
analytics. Our goal is to identify approaches and issues that enable or hinder
international health information exchanges. As expected, the policies within
each country are not as diverse as across countries. Most policies apply the
principles of accountability and/or adequacy and are thereby fundamentally
similar. Their following requirements create complications with re-using and
re-disclosing data and even secondary data: 1) informing data subjects about
the purposes of data collection and use, before the dataset is collected; 2)
assurance that the subjects are no longer identifiable; and 3) destruction of
data when the research activities are finished. Using storage and compute cloud
services as well as other exchange technologies on the Internet without proper
permissions is technically not allowed if the data are stored in another
country. Both legislation and technologies are available as vehicles for
overcoming these barriers. The resulting richness in information variety will
contribute to the development and evaluation of new clinical hypotheses and
technologies.

 <dc:title>Regressing Robust and Discriminative 3D Morphable Models with a very

 <dc:description>  The 3D shapes of faces are well known to be discriminative. Yet despite this,
they are rarely used for face recognition and always under controlled viewing
conditions. We claim that this is a symptom of a serious but often overlooked
problem with existing methods for single view 3D face reconstruction: when
applied &quot;in the wild&quot;, their 3D estimates are either unstable and change for
different photos of the same subject or they are over-regularized and generic.
In response, we describe a robust method for regressing discriminative 3D
morphable face models (3DMM). We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to
regress 3DMM shape and texture parameters directly from an input photo. We
overcome the shortage of training data required for this purpose by offering a
method for generating huge numbers of labeled examples. The 3D estimates
produced by our CNN surpass state of the art accuracy on the MICC data set.
Coupled with a 3D-3D face matching pipeline, we show the first competitive face
recognition results on the LFW, YTF and IJB-A benchmarks using 3D face shapes
as representations, rather than the opaque deep feature vectors used by other
modern systems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a class of convex feasibility problems (CFPs) are studied for
multi-agent systems through local interactions. The objective is to search a
feasible solution to the convex inequalities with some set constraints in a
distributed manner. The distributed control algorithms, involving subgradient
and projection, are proposed for both continuous- and discrete-time systems,
respectively. Conditions associated with connectivity of the directed
communication graph are given to ensure convergence of the algorithms. It is
shown that under mild conditions, the states of all agents reach consensus
asymptotically and the consensus state is located in the solution set of the
CFP. Simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of verifying the correctness of quantum computation for
a restricted class of circuits which contain at most two basis changes. This
contains circuits giving rise to the second level of the Fourier Hierarchy, the
lowest level for which there is an established quantum advantage. We show that,
when the circuit has an outcome with probability at least the inverse of some
polynomial in the circuit size, the outcome can be checked in polynomial time
with bounded error by a completely classical verifier. This verification
procedure is based on random sampling of computational paths and is only
possible given knowledge of the likely outcome.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows a strategy based on passive force control for collaborative
object transportation using Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), focusing on the
transportation of a bulky object by two hexacopters. The goal is to develop a
robust approach which does not rely on: (a) communication links between the
MAVs, (b) the knowledge of the payload shape and (c) the position of grasping
point. The proposed approach is based on the master-slave paradigm, in which
the slave agent guarantees compliance to the external force applied by the
master to the payload via an admittance controller. The external force acting
on the slave is estimated using a non-linear estimator based on the Unscented
Kalman Filter (UKF) from the information provided by a visual inertial
navigation system. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the
force estimator and show the collaborative transportation of a 1.2 m long
object.

 <dc:title>Combination of Linear Prediction and Phase Decomposition for Glottal

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Some glottal analysis approaches based upon linear prediction or complex
cepstrum approaches have been proved to be effective to estimate glottal source
from real speech utterances. We propose a new approach employing both an
all-pole odd-order linear prediction to provide a coarse estimation and phase
decomposition based causality/anti-causality separation to generate further
refinements. The obtained measures show that this method improved performance
in terms of reducing source-filter separation in estimation of glottal flow
pulses (GFP). No glottal model fitting is required by this method, thus it has
wide and flexible adaptation to retain fidelity of speakers's vocal features
with computationally affordable resource. The method is evaluated on real
speech utterances to validate it.

 <dc:description>  The use of deep learning to solve problems in literary arts has been a recent
trend that has gained a lot of attention and automated generation of music has
been an active area. This project deals with the generation of music using raw
audio files in the frequency domain relying on various LSTM architectures.
Fully connected and convolutional layers are used along with LSTM's to capture
rich features in the frequency domain and increase the quality of music
generated. The work is focused on unconstrained music generation and uses no
information about musical structure(notes or chords) to aid learning.The music
generated from various architectures are compared using blind fold tests. Using
the raw audio to train models is the direction to tapping the enormous amount
of mp3 files that exist over the internet without requiring the manual effort
to make structured MIDI files. Moreover, not all audio files can be represented
with MIDI files making the study of these models an interesting prospect to the
future of such models.

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate the possibility of classifying causal systems into kinds that
share a common structure without first constructing an explicit dynamical model
or using prior knowledge of the system dynamics. The algorithmic ability to
determine whether arbitrary systems are governed by causal relations of the
same form offers significant practical applications in the development and
validation of dynamical models. It is also of theoretical interest as an
essential stage in the scientific inference of laws from empirical data. The
algorithm presented is based on the dynamical symmetry approach to dynamical
kinds. A dynamical symmetry with respect to time is an intervention on one or
more variables of a system that commutes with the time evolution of the system.
A dynamical kind is a class of systems sharing a set of dynamical symmetries.
The algorithm presented classifies deterministic, time-dependent causal systems
by directly comparing their exhibited symmetries. Using simulated, noisy data
from a variety of nonlinear systems, we show that this algorithm correctly
sorts systems into dynamical kinds. It is robust under significant sampling
error, is immune to violations of normality in sampling error, and fails
gracefully with increasing dynamical similarity. The algorithm we demonstrate
is the first to address this aspect of automated scientific discovery.

 <dc:description>  A good dialogue agent should have the ability to interact with users by both
responding to questions and by asking questions, and importantly to learn from
both types of interaction. In this work, we explore this direction by designing
a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks in the movie domain that allow such
interactions between a learner and a teacher. We investigate how a learner can
benefit from asking questions in both offline and online reinforcement learning
settings, and demonstrate that the learner improves when asking questions.
Finally, real experiments with Mechanical Turk validate the approach. Our work
represents a first step in developing such end-to-end learned interactive
dialogue agents.

 <dc:description>  Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have recently demonstrated
significant potentials in visible light communications (VLC), as they can
overcome the modulation bandwidth limitation and provide substantial
improvement in terms of spectral efficiency and link reliability. However, MIMO
systems typically suffer from inter-channel interference, which causes severe
degradation to the system performance. In this context, we propose a novel
optical adaptive precoding (OAP) scheme for the downlink of MIMO VLC systems,
which exploits the knowledge of transmitted symbols to enhance the effective
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. We also derive bit-error-rate
expressions for the OAP under perfect and outdated channel state information
(CSI). Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more robust to both
CSI error and channel correlation, compared to conventional channel inversion
precoding.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of remote state estimation, in the presence of an
eavesdropper. An authorized user estimates the state of a linear plant, based
on the data received from a sensor, while the data may also be intercepted by
the eavesdropper. To maintain confidentiality with respect to state, we
introduce a novel control-theoretic definition of perfect secrecy requiring
that the user's expected error remains bounded while the eavesdropper's
expected error grows unbounded. We propose a secrecy mechanism which guarantees
perfect secrecy by randomly withholding sensor information, under the condition
that the user's packet reception rate is larger than the eavesdropper's
interception rate. Given this mechanism, we also explore the tradeoff between
user's utility and confidentiality with respect to the eavesdropper, via an
optimization problem. Finally, some examples are studied to provide insights
about this tradeoff.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the joint antenna selection (AS) problem for a classical
two-user MIMO non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where both the base
station (BS) and users (UEs) are equipped with multiple antennas. Specifically,
several computationally-efficient AS algorithms are developed for two
commonly-used NOMA scenarios: fixed power allocation NOMA (F-NOMA) and
cognitive radio-inspired NOMA (CR-NOMA). For the F-NOMA system, two novel AS
schemes, namely max-max-max AS (A$^3$-AS) and max-min-max AS (AIA-AS), are
proposed to maximize the system sum-rate, without and with the consideration of
user fairness, respectively. In the CR-NOMA network, a novel AS algorithm,
termed maximum-channel-gain-based AS (MCG-AS), is proposed to maximize the
achievable rate of the secondary user, under the condition that the primary
user's quality of service requirement is satisfied. The asymptotic closed-form
expressions of the average sum-rate for A$^3$-AS and AIA-AS and that of the
average rate of the secondary user for MCG-AS are derived, respectively.
Numerical results demonstrate that the AIA-AS provides better user-fairness,
while the A$^3$-AS achieves a near-optimal sum-rate in F-NOMA systems. For the
CR-NOMA scenario, MCG-AS achieves a near-optimal performance in a wide SNR
regime. Furthermore, all the proposed AS algorithms yield a significant
computational complexity reduction, compared to exhaustive search-based
counterparts.

 <dc:title>Maintaining an Up-to-date Global Network View in SDN</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Maintaining an up-to-date global network view is of crucial importance for
intelligent SDN applications that need to act autonomously. In this paper, we
focus on two key factors that can affect the controllers' global network view
and subsequently impact the application performance. Particularly we examine:
(1) network state collection, and (2) network state distribution. First, we
compare the impact of active and passive OpenFlow network state collection
methods on an SDN load-balancing application running at the controller using
key performance indicators that we define. We do this comparison through: (i) a
simulation of a mathematical model we derive for the SDN load-balancer, and
(ii) an evaluation of a load-balancing application running on top of single and
distributed controllers. Further, we investigate the impact of network state
collection on a state-distribution-aware load-balancing application. Finally,
we study the impact of network scale on applications requiring an up-to-date
global network view in the presence of the aforementioned key factors. Our
results show that both the network state collection and network state
distribution can have an impact on the SDN application performance. The more
the information at the controllers becomes outdated, the higher the impact
would be. Even with those applications that were designed to mitigate the
issues of controller state distribution, their performance was affected by the
network state collection. Lastly, the results suggest that the impact of
network state collection on application performance becomes more apparent as
the number of distributed controllers increases.

 <dc:description>  Along with the prosperity of recurrent neural network in modelling sequential
data and the power of attention mechanism in automatically identify salient
information, image captioning, a.k.a., image description, has been remarkably
advanced in recent years. Nonetheless, most existing paradigms may suffer from
the deficiency of invariance to images with different scaling, rotation, etc.;
and effective integration of standalone attention to form a holistic end-to-end
system. In this paper, we propose a novel image captioning architecture, termed
Recurrent Image Captioner (\textbf{RIC}), which allows visual encoder and
language decoder to coherently cooperate in a recurrent manner. Specifically,
we first equip CNN-based visual encoder with a differentiable layer to enable
spatially invariant transformation of visual signals. Moreover, we deploy an
attention filter module (differentiable) between encoder and decoder to
dynamically determine salient visual parts. We also employ bidirectional LSTM
to preprocess sentences for generating better textual representations. Besides,
we propose to exploit variational inference to optimize the whole architecture.
Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets (i.e., Flickr8k,
Flickr30k and MS COCO) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture
as compared to most of the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  With the development of range sensors such as LIDAR and time-of-flight
cameras, 3D point cloud scans have become ubiquitous in computer vision
applications, the most prominent ones being gesture recognition and autonomous
driving. Parsimony-based algorithms have shown great success on images and
videos where data points are sampled on a regular Cartesian grid. We propose an
adaptation of these techniques to irregularly sampled signals by using
continuous dictionaries. We present an example application in the form of point
cloud denoising.

 <dc:title>QoS-Based Linear Transceiver Optimization for Full-Duplex Multi-User

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a multi-user wireless system with one full duplex
(FD) base station (BS) serving a set of half duplex (HD) mobile users.To cope
with the in-band self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference, we
formulate a quality-of-service (QoS) based linear transceiver design problem.
The problem jointly optimizes the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) beamforming
vectors of the BS and the transmission powers of UL users so as to provide both
the DL and UL users with guaranteed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
performance, using a minimum UL and DL transmission sum power.The considered
system model not only takes into account noise caused by non-ideal RF circuits,
analog/digital SI cancellation but also constrains the maximum signal power at
the input of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for avoiding signal
distortion due to finite ADC precision. The formulated design problem is not
convex and challenging to solve in general. We first show that for a special
case where the SI channel estimation errors are independent and identically
distributed, the QoS-based linear transceiver design problem is globally
solvable by a polynomial-time bisection algorithm.For the general case, we
propose a suboptimal algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO). The AO
algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution.To reduce
the complexity of the AO algorithm, we further develop a fixed-point method by
extending the classical uplink-downlink duality in HD systems to the FD
system.Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the
proposed algorithms and the comparison with HD systems.

 <dc:description>  Image-matched nonseparable wavelets can find potential use in many
applications including image classification, segmen- tation, compressive
sensing, etc. This paper proposes a novel design methodology that utilizes
convolutional neural net- work (CNN) to design two-channel non-separable
wavelet matched to a given image. The design is proposed on quin- cunx lattice.
The loss function of the convolutional neural network is setup with total
squared error between the given input image to CNN and the reconstructed image
at the output of CNN, leading to perfect reconstruction at the end of train-
ing. Simulation results have been shown on some standard images.

proposed Parallel Circuits (PCs), a biologically inspired architecture.
Previous work has shown that this approach fails to maintain generalization
performance in spite of achieving sharp speed gains. To address this issue, and
motivated by the way Dropout prevents node co-adaption, in this paper, we
suggest an improvement by extending Dropout to the PC architecture. The paper
provides multiple insights into this combination, including a variety of fusion
approaches. Experiments show promising results in which improved error rates
are achieved in most cases, whilst maintaining the speed advantage of the PC
approach.

 <dc:description>  A formal description of a Cyber-Physical system should include a rigorous
specification of the computational and physical components involved, as well as
their interaction. Such a description, thus, lends itself to a compositional
model where every module in the model specifies the behavior of a
(computational or physical) component or the interaction between different
components. We propose a framework based on Soft Constraint Automata that
facilitates the component-wise description of such systems and includes the
tools necessary to compose subsystems in a meaningful way, to yield a
description of the entire system. Most importantly, Soft Constraint Automata
allow the description and composition of components' preferences as well as
environmental constraints in a uniform fashion. We illustrate the utility of
our framework using a detailed description of a patrolling robot, while
highlighting methods of composition as well as possible techniques to employ
them.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we design a symbolic output feedback controller of a
cyber-physical system (CPS). The physical plant is modeled by an infinite
transition system. We consider the situation that a finite abstracted system of
the physical plant, called a c-abstracted system, is given. There exists an
approximate alternating simulation relation from the c-abstracted system to the
physical plant. A desired behavior of the c-abstracted system is also given,
and we have a symbolic state feedback controller of the physical plant. We
consider the case where some states of the plant are not measured. Then, to
estimate the states with abstracted outputs measured by sensors, we introduce a
finite abstracted system of the physical plant, called an o-abstracted system,
such that there exists an approximate simulation relation. The relation
guarantees that an observer designed based on the state of the o-abstracted
system estimates the current state of the plant. We construct a symbolic output
feedback controller by composing these systems. By a relation-based approach,
we proved that the controlled system approximately exhibits the desired
behavior.

 <dc:description>  Several notions of conformance have been proposed for checking the behavior
of cyber-physical systems against their hybrid systems models. In this paper,
we explore the initial idea of a notion of approximate conformance that allows
for comparison of both observable discrete actions and (sampled) continuous
trajectories. As such, this notion will consolidate two earlier notions, namely
the notion of Hybrid Input-Output Conformance (HIOCO) by M. van Osch and the
notion of Hybrid Conformance by H. Abbas and G.E. Fainekos. We prove that our
proposed notion of conformance satisfies a semi-transitivity property, which
makes it suitable for a step-wise proof of conformance or refinement.

 <dc:description>  Priced timed automata provide a natural model for quantitative analysis of
real-time systems and have been successfully applied in various scheduling and
planning problems. The optimal reachability problem for linearly-priced timed
automata is known to be PSPACE-complete. In this paper we investigate priced
timed automata with more general prices and show that in the most general
setting the optimal reachability problem is undecidable. We adapt and implement
the construction of Audemard, Cimatti, Kornilowicz, and Sebastiani for
non-linear priced timed automata using state-of-the-art theorem prover Z3 and
present some preliminary results.

 <dc:description>  There is an increasing necessity to deploy autonomous systems in highly
heterogeneous, dynamic environments, e.g. service robots in hospitals or
autonomous cars on highways. Due to the uncertainty in these environments, the
verification results obtained with respect to the system and environment models
at design-time might not be transferable to the system behavior at run time.
For autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments, safety of motion and
collision avoidance are critical requirements. With regard to these
requirements, Macek et al. [6] define the passive safety property, which
requires that no collision can occur while the autonomous system is moving. To
verify this property, we adopt a two phase process which combines static
verification methods, used at design time, with dynamic ones, used at run time.
In the design phase, we exploit UPPAAL to formalize the autonomous system and
its environment as timed automata and the safety property as TCTL formula and
to verify the correctness of these models with respect to this property. For
the runtime phase, we build a monitor to check whether the assumptions made at
design time are also correct at run time. If the current system observations of
the environment do not correspond to the initial system assumptions, the
monitor sends feedback to the system and the system enters a passive safe
state.

 <dc:title>Using the Context of User Feedback in Recommender Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Peska, Ladislav</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Our work is generally focused on recommending for small or medium-sized
e-commerce portals, where explicit feedback is absent and thus the usage of
implicit feedback is necessary. Nonetheless, for some implicit feedback
features, the presentation context may be of high importance. In this paper, we
present a model of relevant contextual features affecting user feedback,
propose methods leveraging those features, publish a dataset of real e-commerce
users containing multiple user feedback indicators as well as its context and
finally present results of purchase prediction and recommendation experiments.
Off-line experiments with real users of a Czech travel agency website
corroborated the importance of leveraging presentation context in both purchase
prediction and recommendation tasks.

 <dc:title>Characterizing DAG-depth of Directed Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study DAG-depth, a structural depth measure of directed graphs, which
naturally extends the tree-depth of ordinary graphs. We define a DAG-depth
decomposition as a strategy for the cop player in the lift-free version of the
cops-and-robber game on directed graphs and prove its correctness. The
DAG-depth decomposition is related to DAG-depth in a similar way as an
elimination tree is related to the tree-depth. We study the size aspect of
DAG-depth decomposition and provide a definition of mergeable and optimally
mergeable vertices in order to make the decomposition smaller and acceptable
for the cop player as a strategy. We also provide a way to find the closure of
a DAG-depth decomposition, which is the largest digraph for which the given
decomposition represents a winning strategy for the cop player.

 <dc:title>Reducing Nondeterministic Tree Automata by Adding Transitions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Almeida, Ricardo Manuel de Oliveira</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce saturation of nondeterministic tree automata, a technique that
consists of adding new transitions to an automaton while preserving its
language. We implemented our algorithm on minotaut - a module of the tree
automata library libvata that reduces the size of automata by merging states
and removing superfluous transitions - and we show how saturation can make
subsequent merge and transition-removal operations more effective. Thus we
obtain a Ptime algorithm that reduces the size of tree automata even more than
before. Additionally, we explore how minotaut alone can play an important role
when performing hard operations like complementation, allowing to both obtain
smaller complement automata and lower computation times. We then show how
saturation can extend this contribution even further. We tested our algorithms
on a large collection of automata from applications of libvata in shape
analysis, and on different classes of randomly generated automata.

 <dc:title>Sending Money Like Sending E-mails: Cryptoaddresses, The Universal

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sending money in cryptocurrencies is majorly based on public keys or their
hashed forms -- &quot;addresses.&quot; These long random-looking strings are user
unfriendly for transferring by other means than via copy-and-paste or QR codes.
Replacing such strings with identifiers chosen by users themselves would
significantly improve usability of cryptocurrencies. Such identifiers could be
memorable, easier to write on paper or to dictate over phone. Main challenge
lies in designing a practically usable decentralised system for providing these
identifiers. Former solutions have been built as centralised systems or come
with nonnegligible limitations. Our solution is reminiscent of a prevalent
e-mail system, which is an already user friendly and desirably decentralised
system. It is shown that our approach is directly applicable also to other
systems that use long cryptographic identifiers.

 <dc:title>A Light-Weight Approach for Verifying Multi-Threaded Programs with
  CPAchecker</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Verifying multi-threaded programs is becoming more and more important,
because of the strong trend to increase the number of processing units per CPU
socket. We introduce a new configurable program analysis for verifying
multi-threaded programs with a bounded number of threads. We present a simple
and yet efficient implementation as component of the existing
program-verification framework CPAchecker. While CPAchecker is already
competitive on a large benchmark set of sequential verification tasks, our
extension enhances the overall applicability of the framework. Our
implementation of handling multiple threads is orthogonal to the abstract
domain of the data-flow analysis, and thus, can be combined with several
existing analyses in CPAchecker, like value analysis, interval analysis, and
BDD analysis. The new analysis is modular and can be used, for example, to
verify reachability properties as well as to detect deadlocks in the program.
This paper includes an evaluation of the benefit of some optimization steps
(e.g., changing the iteration order of the reachability algorithm or applying
partial-order reduction) as well as the comparison with other state-of-the-art
tools for verifying multi-threaded programs.

 <dc:title>Avalanche Effect in Improperly Initialized CAESAR Candidates</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cryptoprimitives rely on thorough theoretical background, but often lack
basic usability features making them prone to unintentional misuse by
developers. We argue that this is true even for the state-of-the-art designs.
Analyzing 52 candidates of the current CAESAR competition has shown none of
them have an avalanche effect in authentication tag strong enough to work
properly when partially misconfigured. Although not directly decreasing their
security profile, this hints at their security usability being less than
perfect. Paper details available at crcs.cz/papers/memics2016

algorithm that decides whether or not it is possible to cover vertices of an

complement is closed under Bondy-Chvatal closure, then it is possible to bound
neighborhood diversity of the complement by a function of w only. A simpler
proof where tree-depth is used instead of tree-width is also presented.

parts -- the acquisition of entities and the extraction of relationships among
these entities. Our knowledge-base consists of approximately 100,000 triples.
We conducted an evaluation on a sample of triples and report an accuracy of a
little over 90\%. We additionally conducted classification experiments on
StackOverflow data with features from TeKnowbase and achieved improved
classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  The surging interest in blockchain technology has revitalized the search for
effective Byzantine consensus schemes. In particular, the blockchain community
has been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine
fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing
various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions.
However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their
$O(n^2)$ message complexity.
  In this paper, we propose FastBFT, the fastest and most scalable BFT protocol
to-date. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that
combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight
secret sharing primitives. Combining this technique with several other
optimizations (i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure
detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large
scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that
FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.

 <dc:description>  Colorectal endoscopy is important for the early detection and treatment of
colorectal cancer and is used worldwide. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
system that provides an objective measure to endoscopists during colorectal
endoscopic examinations would be of great value. In this study, we describe a
newly developed CAD system that provides real-time objective measures. Our
system captures the video stream from an endoscopic system and transfers it to
a desktop computer. The captured video stream is then classified by a
pretrained classifier and the results are displayed on a monitor. The
experimental results show that our developed system works efficiently in actual
endoscopic examinations and is medically significant.

interactions between them. Typically this problem is confounded with the
problem of graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL), because both problems
represent the data as a graph and predict the missing class labels of nodes.
However, not all graphs are created equally. In GSSL a graph is constructed,
often from independent data, based on similarity. As such, edges tend to
connect instances with the same class label. Relational networks, however, can
be more heterogeneous and edges do not always indicate similarity. For
instance, instead of links being more likely to connect nodes with the same
class label, they may occur more frequently between nodes with different class
labels (link-heterogeneity). Or nodes with the same class label do not
necessarily have the same type of connectivity across the whole network
(class-heterogeneity), e.g. in a network of sexual interactions we may observe
links between opposite genders in some parts of the graph and links between the
same genders in others. Performing classification in networks with different
types of heterogeneity is a hard problem that is made harder still when we do
not know a-priori the type or level of heterogeneity. Here we present two
scalable approaches for graph-based semi-supervised learning for the more
general case of relational networks. We demonstrate these approaches on
synthetic and real-world networks that display different link patterns within
and between classes. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, ours give better
classification performance without prior knowledge of how classes interact. In
particular, our two-step label propagation algorithm gives consistently good
accuracy and runs on networks of over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges in
around 12 seconds.

 <dc:description>  We consider conditional transition systems, that model software product lines
with upgrades, in a coalgebraic setting. By using Birkhoff's duality for
distributive lattices, we derive two equivalent Kleisli categories in which
these coalgebras live: Kleisli categories based on the reader and on the
so-called lattice monad over $\mathsf{Poset}$. We study two different functors
describing the branching type of the coalgebra and investigate the resulting
behavioural equivalence. Furthermore we show how an existing algorithm for
coalgebra minimisation can be instantiated to derive behavioural equivalences
in this setting.

 <dc:description>  We present a multilinear statistical model of the human tongue that captures
anatomical and tongue pose related shape variations separately. The model is
derived from 3D magnetic resonance imaging data of 11 speakers sustaining
speech related vocal tract configurations. The extraction is performed by using
a minimally supervised method that uses as basis an image segmentation approach
and a template fitting technique. Furthermore, it uses image denoising to deal
with possibly corrupt data, palate surface information reconstruction to handle
palatal tongue contacts, and a bootstrap strategy to refine the obtained
shapes. Our evaluation concludes that limiting the degrees of freedom for the
anatomical and speech related variations to 5 and 4, respectively, produces a
model that can reliably register unknown data while avoiding overfitting
effects. Furthermore, we show that it can be used to generate a plausible
tongue animation by tracking sparse motion capture data.

 <dc:title>An early sign of satisfiability</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lozinskii, Eliezer L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This note considers checking satisfiability of sets of propositional clauses
(SAT instances). It shows that &quot;unipolar sets&quot; of clauses (containing no
positive or no negative clauses) provide an &quot;early sign&quot; of satisfiability of
SAT instances before all the clauses become satisfied in the course of solving
SAT problems. At this sign the processing can be terminated by &quot;unipolar set
termination&quot;, UST thus before it is usually done by SAT solvers (Table 1). An
analysis of benchmark SAT instances used at SAT Competitions shows that UST can
speed up solving SAT instances stemming from many real-world problems. The
efficiency of UST increases with the &quot;skewness&quot; of the SAT set being checked,
that is the difference between probabilities of negated and unnegated literals
in the set. Many real-world problems, by virtue of their semantics, are skewed
(Table 2). The efficiency of UST can be increased by revealing the &quot;hidden
skewness&quot; of SAT sets (Table 3).

 <dc:description>  Reconstruction of structure and parameters of an Ising model from binary
samples is a problem of practical importance in a variety of disciplines,
ranging from statistical physics and computational biology to image processing
and machine learning. The focus of the research community shifted towards
developing universal reconstruction algorithms which are both computationally
efficient and require the minimal amount of expensive data. We introduce a new
method, Interaction Screening, which accurately estimates the model parameters
using local optimization problems. The algorithm provably achieves perfect
graph structure recovery with an information-theoretically optimal number of
samples, notably in the low-temperature regime which is known to be the hardest
for learning. The efficacy of Interaction Screening is assessed through
extensive numerical tests on synthetic Ising models of various topologies with
different types of interactions, as well as on a real data produced by a D-Wave
quantum computer. This study shows that the Interaction Screening method is an
exact, tractable and optimal technique universally solving the inverse Ising
problem.

 <dc:description>  Ontohub is a repository engine for managing distributed heterogeneous
ontologies. The distributed nature enables communities to share and exchange
their contributions easily. The heterogeneous nature makes it possible to
integrate ontologies written in various ontology languages. Ontohub supports a
wide range of formal logical and ontology languages, as well as various
structuring and modularity constructs and inter-theory (concept) mappings,
building on the OMG-standardized DOL language. Ontohub repositories are
organised as Git repositories, thus inheriting all features of this popular
version control system. Moreover, Ontohub is the first repository engine
meeting a substantial amount of the requirements formulated in the context of
the Open Ontology Repository (OOR) initiative, including an API for federation
as well as support for logical inference and axiom selection.

 <dc:description>  Synchronous programming is a paradigm of choice for the design of
safety-critical reactive systems. Runtime enforcement is a technique to ensure
that the output of a black-box system satisfies some desired properties. This
paper deals with the problem of runtime enforcement in the context of
synchronous programs. We propose a framework where an enforcer monitors both
the inputs and the outputs of a synchronous program and (minimally) edits
erroneous inputs/outputs in order to guarantee that a given property holds. We
define enforceability conditions, develop an online enforcement algorithm, and
prove its correctness. We also report on an implementation of the algorithm on
top of the KIELER framework for the SCCharts synchronous language. Experimental
results show that enforcement has minimal execution time overhead, which
decreases proportionally with larger benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Micro-facial expressions are regarded as an important human behavioural event
that can highlight emotional deception. Spotting these movements is difficult
for humans and machines, however research into using computer vision to detect
subtle facial expressions is growing in popularity. This paper proposes an
individualised baseline micro-movement detection method using 3D Histogram of
Oriented Gradients (3D HOG) temporal difference method. We define a face
template consisting of 26 regions based on the Facial Action Coding System
(FACS). We extract the temporal features of each region using 3D HOG. Then, we
use Chi-square distance to find subtle facial motion in the local regions.
Finally, an automatic peak detector is used to detect micro-movements above the
newly proposed adaptive baseline threshold. The performance is validated on two
FACS coded datasets: SAMM and CASME II. This objective method focuses on the
movement of the 26 face regions. When comparing with the ground truth, the best
result was an AUC of 0.7512 and 0.7261 on SAMM and CASME II, respectively. The
results show that 3D HOG outperformed for micro-movement detection, compared to
state-of-the-art feature representations: Local Binary Patterns in Three
Orthogonal Planes and Histograms of Oriented Optical Flow.

 <dc:title>Adversarial Message Passing For Graphical Models</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bayesian inference on structured models typically relies on the ability to
infer posterior distributions of underlying hidden variables. However,
inference in implicit models or complex posterior distributions is hard. A
popular tool for learning implicit models are generative adversarial networks
(GANs) which learn parameters of generators by fooling discriminators.
Typically, GANs are considered to be models themselves and are not understood
in the context of inference. Current techniques rely on inefficient global
discrimination of joint distributions to perform learning, or only consider
discriminating a single output variable. We overcome these limitations by
treating GANs as a basis for likelihood-free inference in generative models and
generalize them to Bayesian posterior inference over factor graphs. We propose
local learning rules based on message passing minimizing a global divergence
criterion involving cooperating local adversaries used to sidestep explicit
likelihood evaluations. This allows us to compose models and yields a unified
inference and learning framework for adversarial learning. Our framework treats
model specification and inference separately and facilitates richly structured
models within the family of Directed Acyclic Graphs, including components such
as intractable likelihoods, non-differentiable models, simulators and generally
cumbersome models. A key result of our treatment is the insight that Bayesian
inference on structured models can be performed only with sampling and
discrimination when using nonparametric variational families, without access to
explicit distributions. As a side-result, we discuss the link to likelihood
maximization. These approaches hold promise to be useful in the toolbox of
probabilistic modelers and enrich the gamut of current probabilistic
programming applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the matching of short music audio snippets to the
corresponding pixel location in images of sheet music. A system is presented
that simultaneously learns to read notes, listens to music and matches the
currently played music to its corresponding notes in the sheet. It consists of
an end-to-end multi-modal convolutional neural network that takes as input
images of sheet music and spectrograms of the respective audio snippets. It
learns to predict, for a given unseen audio snippet (covering approximately one
bar of music), the corresponding position in the respective score line. Our
results suggest that with the use of (deep) neural networks -- which have
proven to be powerful image processing models -- working with sheet music
becomes feasible and a promising future research direction.

 <dc:description>  Many time series are generated by a set of entities that interact with one
another over time. This paper introduces a broad, flexible framework to learn
from multiple inter-dependent time series generated by such entities. Our
framework explicitly models the entities and their interactions through time.
It achieves this by building on the capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks,
while also offering several ways to incorporate domain knowledge/constraints
into the model architecture. The capabilities of our approach are showcased
through an application to weather prediction, which shows gains over strong
baselines.

 <dc:title>Reflectance Adaptive Filtering Improves Intrinsic Image Estimation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nestmeyer, Thomas</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Separating an image into reflectance and shading layers poses a challenge for
learning approaches because no large corpus of precise and realistic ground
truth decompositions exists. The Intrinsic Images in the Wild~(IIW) dataset
provides a sparse set of relative human reflectance judgments, which serves as
a standard benchmark for intrinsic images. A number of methods use IIW to learn
statistical dependencies between the images and their reflectance layer.
Although learning plays an important role for high performance, we show that a
standard signal processing technique achieves performance on par with current
state-of-the-art. We propose a loss function for CNN learning of dense
reflectance predictions. Our results show a simple pixel-wise decision, without
any context or prior knowledge, is sufficient to provide a strong baseline on
IIW. This sets a competitive baseline which only two other approaches surpass.
We then develop a joint bilateral filtering method that implements strong prior
knowledge about reflectance constancy. This filtering operation can be applied
to any intrinsic image algorithm and we improve several previous results
achieving a new state-of-the-art on IIW. Our findings suggest that the effect
of learning-based approaches may have been over-estimated so far. Explicit
prior knowledge is still at least as important to obtain high performance in
intrinsic image decompositions.

 <dc:description>  The EditLens is an interactive lens technique that supports the editing of
graphs. The user can insert, update, or delete nodes and edges while
maintaining an already existing layout of the graph. For the nodes and edges
that are affected by an edit operation, the EditLens suggests suitable
locations and routes, which the user can accept or adjust. For this purpose,
the EditLens requires an efficient routing algorithm that can compute results
at interactive framerates. Existing algorithms cannot fully satisfy the needs
of the EditLens. This paper describes a novel algorithm that can compute
orthogonal edge routes for incremental edit operations of graphs. Tests
indicate that, in general, the algorithm is better than alternative solutions.

 <dc:title>Feature Learning for Chord Recognition: The Deep Chroma Extractor</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We explore frame-level audio feature learning for chord recognition using
artificial neural networks. We present the argument that chroma vectors
potentially hold enough information to model harmonic content of audio for
chord recognition, but that standard chroma extractors compute too noisy
features. This leads us to propose a learned chroma feature extractor based on
artificial neural networks. It is trained to compute chroma features that
encode harmonic information important for chord recognition, while being robust
to irrelevant interferences. We achieve this by feeding the network an audio
spectrum with context instead of a single frame as input. This way, the network
can learn to selectively compensate noise and resolve harmonic ambiguities.
  We compare the resulting features to hand-crafted ones by using a simple
linear frame-wise classifier for chord recognition on various data sets. The
results show that the learned feature extractor produces superior chroma
vectors for chord recognition.

 <dc:description>  This paper demonstrates the feasibility of learning to retrieve short
snippets of sheet music (images) when given a short query excerpt of music
(audio) -- and vice versa --, without any symbolic representation of music or
scores. This would be highly useful in many content-based musical retrieval
scenarios. Our approach is based on Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA)
and learns correlated latent spaces allowing for cross-modality retrieval in
both directions. Initial experiments with relatively simple monophonic music
show promising results.

 <dc:description>  We introduce SceneNet RGB-D, expanding the previous work of SceneNet to
enable large scale photorealistic rendering of indoor scene trajectories. It
provides pixel-perfect ground truth for scene understanding problems such as
semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection, and also
for geometric computer vision problems such as optical flow, depth estimation,
camera pose estimation, and 3D reconstruction. Random sampling permits
virtually unlimited scene configurations, and here we provide a set of 5M
rendered RGB-D images from over 15K trajectories in synthetic layouts with
random but physically simulated object poses. Each layout also has random
lighting, camera trajectories, and textures. The scale of this dataset is well
suited for pre-training data-driven computer vision techniques from scratch
with RGB-D inputs, which previously has been limited by relatively small
labelled datasets in NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D. It also provides a basis for
investigating 3D scene labelling tasks by providing perfect camera poses and
depth data as proxy for a SLAM system. We host the dataset at

 <dc:description>  Chord recognition systems depend on robust feature extraction pipelines.
While these pipelines are traditionally hand-crafted, recent advances in
end-to-end machine learning have begun to inspire researchers to explore
data-driven methods for such tasks. In this paper, we present a chord
recognition system that uses a fully convolutional deep auditory model for
feature extraction. The extracted features are processed by a Conditional
Random Field that decodes the final chord sequence. Both processing stages are
trained automatically and do not require expert knowledge for optimising
parameters. We show that the learned auditory system extracts musically
interpretable features, and that the proposed chord recognition system achieves
results on par or better than state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Driving under the influence of alcohol is a widespread phenomenon in the US
where it is considered a major cause of fatal accidents. In this research we
present a novel approach and concept for detecting intoxication from motion
differences obtained by the sensors of wearable devices. We formalize the
problem of drunkenness detection as a supervised machine learning task, both as
a binary classification problem (drunk or sober) and a regression problem (the
breath alcohol content level).
  In order to test our approach, we collected data from 30 different subjects
(patrons at three bars) using Google Glass and the LG G-watch, Microsoft Band,
and Samsung Galaxy S4. We validated our results against an admissible
breathalyzer used by the police.
  A system based on this concept, successfully detected intoxication and
achieved the following results: 0.95 AUC and 0.05 FPR, given a fixed TPR of
1.0. Applications based on our system can be used to analyze the free gait of
drinkers when they walk from the car to the bar and vice-versa, in order to
alert people, or even a connected car and prevent people from driving under the
influence of alcohol.

 <dc:description>  Two variations of the McEliece cryptosystem are presented. The first one is
based on a relaxation of the column permutation in the classical McEliece
scrambling process. This is done in such a way that the Hamming weight of the
error, added in the encryption process, can be controlled so that efficient
decryption remains possible. The second variation is based on the use of
spatially coupled moderate-density parity-check codes as secret codes. These
codes are known for their excellent error-correction performance and allow for
a relatively low key size in the cryptosystem. For both variants the security
with respect to known attacks is discussed.

 <dc:description>  Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and variants thereof have become
standard for large-scale empirical risk minimization like the training of
neural networks. These methods are usually used with a constant batch size
chosen by simple empirical inspection. The batch size significantly influences
the behavior of the stochastic optimization algorithm, though, since it
determines the variance of the gradient estimates. This variance also changes
over the optimization process; when using a constant batch size, stability and
convergence is thus often enforced by means of a (manually tuned) decreasing
learning rate schedule.
  We propose a practical method for dynamic batch size adaptation. It estimates
the variance of the stochastic gradients and adapts the batch size to decrease
the variance proportionally to the value of the objective function, removing
the need for the aforementioned learning rate decrease. In contrast to recent
related work, our algorithm couples the batch size to the learning rate,
directly reflecting the known relationship between the two. On popular image
classification benchmarks, our batch size adaptation yields faster optimization
convergence, while simultaneously simplifying learning rate tuning. A
TensorFlow implementation is available.

 <dc:title>Computational Intelligence: are you crazy? Since when has intelligence

 <dc:creator>Diamant, Emanuel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Computational Intelligence is a dead-end attempt to recreate human-like
intelligence in a computing machine. The goal is unattainable because the means
chosen for its accomplishment are mutually inconsistent and contradictory:
&quot;Computational&quot; implies data processing ability while &quot;Intelligence&quot; implies
the ability to process information. In the research community, there is a lack
of interest in data versus information divergence. The cause of this
indifference is the Shannon's Information theory, which has dominated the
scientific community since the early 1950s. However, today it is clear that
Shannon's theory is applicable only to a specific case of data communication
and is inapplicable to the majority of other occasions, where information about
semantic properties of a message must be taken into account. The paper will try
to explain the devastating results of overlooking some of these very important
issues - what is intelligence, what is semantic information, how they are
interrelated and what happens when the relationship is disregarded.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of planning a collision-free path of a robot in the
presence of risk zones. The robot is allowed to travel in these zones but is
penalized in a super-linear fashion for consecutive accumulative time spent
there. We recently suggested a natural cost function that balances path length
and risk-exposure time. When no risk zones exists, our problem resorts to
computing minimal-length paths which is known to be computationally hard in the
number of dimensions. It is well known that in two-dimensions computing
minimal-length paths can be done efficiently. Thus, a natural question we pose
is &quot;Is our problem computationally hard or not?&quot; If the problem is hard, we
wish to find an approximation algorithm to compute a near-optimal path. If not,
then a polynomial-time algorithm should be found.

 <dc:description>  Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an emerging field with important
applications in many areas. CEP systems collect events arriving from input data
streams and use them to infer more complex events according to predefined
patterns. The Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is one of the most
popular mechanisms on which such systems are based. During the event detection
process, NFAs incrementally extend previously observed partial matches until a
full match for the query is found. As a result, each arriving event needs to be
processed to determine whether a new partial match is to be initiated or an
existing one extended. This method may be highly inefficient when many of the
events do not result in output matches. We present a lazy evaluation mechanism
that defers processing of frequent event types and stores them internally upon
arrival. Events are then matched in ascending order of frequency, thus
minimizing potentially redundant computations. We introduce a Lazy Chain NFA,
which utilizes the above principle, and does not depend on the underlying
pattern structure. An algorithm for constructing a Lazy Chain NFA for common
pattern types is presented, including conjunction, negation and iteration.
Finally, we experimentally evaluate our mechanism on real-world stock trading
data. The results demonstrate a performance gain of two orders of magnitude
over traditional NFA-based approaches, with significantly reduced memory
resource requirements.

 <dc:description>  The roll-out of smart meters in electricity networks introduces risks for
consumer privacy due to increased measurement frequency and granularity.
Through various Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring techniques, consumer behavior may
be inferred from their metering data. In this paper, we propose an energy
management method that reduces energy cost and protects privacy through the
minimization of information leakage. The method is based on a Model Predictive
Controller that utilizes energy storage and local generation, and that predicts
the effects of its actions on the statistics of the actual energy consumption
of a consumer and that seen by the grid. Computationally, the method requires
solving a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program of manageable size whenever new meter
readings are available. We simulate the controller on generated residential
load profiles with different privacy costs in a two-tier time-of-use energy
pricing environment. Results show that information leakage is effectively
reduced at the expense of increased energy cost. The results also show that
with the proposed controller the consumer load profile seen by the grid
resembles a mixture between that obtained with Non-Intrusive Load Leveling and
Lazy Stepping.

 <dc:description>  The surging global mobile data traffic challenges the economic viability of
cellular networks and calls for innovative solutions to reduce the network
congestion and improve user experience. In this context, user-provided networks
(UPNs), where mobile users share their Internet access by exploiting their
diverse network resources and needs, turn out to be very promising.
Heterogeneous users with advanced handheld devices can form connections in a
distributed fashion and unleash dormant network resources at the network edge.
However, the success of such services heavily depends on users' willingness to
contribute their resources, such as network access and device battery energy.
In this paper, we introduce a general framework for UPN services and design a
bargaining-based distributed incentive mechanism to ensure users participation.
The proposed mechanism determines the resources that each user should
contribute in order to maximise the aggregate data rate in UPN, and fairly
allocate the benefit among the users. The numerical results verify that the
service can always improve performance, and such improvement increases with the
diversity of the users' resources. Quantitatively, it can reach an average 30%
increase of the total served traffic for a typical scenario even with only 6
mobile users.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel reranking model, future reward reranking, to
re-score the actions in a transition-based parser by using a global scorer.
Different to conventional reranking parsing, the model searches for the best
dependency tree in all feasible trees constraining by a sequence of actions to
get the future reward of the sequence. The scorer is based on a first-order
graph-based parser with bidirectional LSTM, which catches different parsing
view compared with the transition-based parser. Besides, since context
enhancement has shown substantial improvement in the arc-stand transition-based
parsing over the parsing accuracy, we implement context enhancement on an
arc-eager transition-base parser with stack LSTMs, the dynamic oracle and
dropout supporting and achieve further improvement. With the global scorer and
context enhancement, the results show that UAS of the parser increases as much
as 1.20% for English and 1.66% for Chinese, and LAS increases as much as 1.32%
for English and 1.63% for Chinese. Moreover, we get state-of-the-art LASs,
achieving 87.58% for Chinese and 93.37% for English.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports on an algorithm for planning trajectories that allow a
multirotor micro aerial vehicle (MAV) to quickly identify a set of unknown
parameters. In many problems like self calibration or model parameter
identification some states are only observable under a specific motion. These
motions are often hard to find, especially for inexperienced users. Therefore,
we consider system model identification in an active setting, where the vehicle
autonomously decides what actions to take in order to quickly identify the
model. Our algorithm approximates the belief dynamics of the system around a
candidate trajectory using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). It uses
sampling-based motion planning to explore the space of possible beliefs and
find a maximally informative trajectory within a user-defined budget. We
validate our method in simulation and on a real system showing the feasibility
and repeatability of the proposed approach. Our planner creates trajectories
which reduce model parameter convergence time and uncertainty by a factor of
four.

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article, we formulate the generation of optomechanical entanglement
between the linearly coupled cavity field and the mechanical resonator as an
optimal control problem in hyperbolic space $H^3$, with control input the
coupling rate of the two oscillators. Next, we use optimal control theory to
find the allowed optimal values of the coupling which maximize the amount of
generated entanglement for a fixed duration of the interaction. Finally, we
employ a numerical optimization method to obtain the exact optimal pulse
sequences for several illustrative examples. In the strong coupling regime,
where the coupling rate is comparable or larger than the frequency of the
mechanical resonator, a substantial amount of entanglement can be generated
within a fraction of a single oscillator period.

 <dc:description>  In an attempt at exploring the limitations of simple approaches to the task
of piano transcription (as usually defined in MIR), we conduct an in-depth
analysis of neural network-based framewise transcription. We systematically
compare different popular input representations for transcription systems to
determine the ones most suitable for use with neural networks. Exploiting
recent advances in training techniques and new regularizers, and taking into
account hyper-parameter tuning, we show that it is possible, by simple
bottom-up frame-wise processing, to obtain a piano transcriber that outperforms
the current published state of the art on the publicly available MAPS dataset
-- without any complex post-processing steps. Thus, we propose this simple
approach as a new baseline for this dataset, for future transcription research
to build on and improve.

 <dc:description>  Designing chaotic maps with complex dynamics is a challenging topic. This
paper introduces the nonlinear chaotic processing (NCP) model, which contains
six basic nonlinear operations. Each operation is a general framework that can
use existing chaotic maps as seed maps to generate a huge number of new chaotic
maps. The proposed NCP model can be easily extended by introducing new
nonlinear operations or by arbitrarily combining existing ones. The properties
and chaotic behaviors of the NCP model are investigated. To show its
effectiveness and usability, as examples, we provide four new chaotic maps
generated by the NCP model and evaluate their chaotic performance using
Lyapunov exponent, Shannon entropy, correlation dimension and initial state
sensitivity. The experimental results show that these chaotic maps have more
complex chaotic behaviors than existing ones.

 <dc:title>A Phase Vocoder based on Nonstationary Gabor Frames</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new algorithm for time stretching music signals based on the
theory of nonstationary Gabor frames (NSGFs). The algorithm extends the
techniques of the classical phase vocoder (PV) by incorporating adaptive
time-frequency (TF) representations and adaptive phase locking. The adaptive TF
representations imply good time resolution for the onsets of attack transients
and good frequency resolution for the sinusoidal components. We estimate the
phase values only at peak channels and the remaining phases are then locked to
the values of the peaks in an adaptive manner. During attack transients we keep
the stretch factor equal to one and we propose a new strategy for determining
which channels are relevant for reinitializing the corresponding phase values.
In contrast to previously published algorithms we use a non-uniform NSGF to
obtain a low redundancy of the corresponding TF representation. We show that
with just three times as many TF coefficients as signal samples, artifacts such
as phasiness and transient smearing can be greatly reduced compared to the
classical PV. The proposed algorithm is tested on both synthetic and real world
signals and compared with state of the art algorithms in a reproducible manner.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a framework for solving a single-agent task by
using multiple agents, each focusing on different aspects of the task. This
approach has two main advantages: 1) it allows for training specialized agents
on different parts of the task, and 2) it provides a new way to transfer
knowledge, by transferring trained agents. Our framework generalizes the
traditional hierarchical decomposition, in which, at any moment in time, a
single agent has control until it has solved its particular subtask. We
illustrate our framework with empirical experiments on two domains.

 <dc:title>A Novel RTL ATPG Model Based on Gate Inherent Faults (GIF-PO) of Complex
  Gates</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Strauch, Tobias</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper starts with a comprehensive survey on RTL ATPG. It then proposes a
novel RTL ATPG model based on &quot;Gate Inherent Faults&quot; (GIF). These GIF are
extracted from each complex gate (adder, case-statement, etc.) of the RTL
source code individually. They are related to the internal logic paths of a
complex gate. They are not related to any net/signal in the RTL design. It is
observed, that when all GIF on RTL are covered (100%) and the same stimulus is
applied, then all gate level stuck-at faults of the netlist are covered (100%)
as well. The proposed RTL ATPG model is therefore synthesis independent. This
is shown on ITC'99 testcases. The applied semi-automatic test pattern
generation process is based on functional simulation.

Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) campaign. Eight sub-systems are developed,
all based on a state-of-the-art approach: i-vector/PLDA which represents the
mainstream technique in text-independent speaker recognition. These sub-systems
differ: on the acoustic feature extraction front-end (MFCC, PLP), at the
i-vector extraction stage (UBM, DNN or two-feats posteriors) and finally on the
data-shifting (IDVC, mean-shifting). The submitted system is a fusion at the
score-level of these eight sub-systems.

 <dc:description>  Recently Cole and Gkatzelis gave the first constant factor approximation
algorithm for the problem of allocating indivisible items to agents, under
additive valuations, so as to maximize the Nash Social Welfare. We give
constant factor algorithms for a substantial generalization of their problem --
to the case of separable, piecewise-linear concave utility functions. We give
two such algorithms, the first using market equilibria and the second using the
theory of stable polynomials.
  In AGT, there is a paucity of methods for the design of mechanisms for the
allocation of indivisible goods and the result of Cole and Gkatzelis seemed to
be taking a major step towards filling this gap. Our result can be seen as
another step in this direction.

 <dc:description>  The paper studies the problem of achieving consensus in multi-agent systems
in the case where the dependency digraph $\Gamma$ has no spanning in-tree. We
consider the regularization protocol that amounts to the addition of a dummy
agent (hub) uniformly connected to the agents. The presence of such a hub
guarantees the achievement of an asymptotic consensus. For the &quot;evaporation&quot; of
the dummy agent, the strength of its influences on the other agents vanishes,
which leads to the concept of latent consensus. We obtain a closed-form
expression for the consensus when the connections of the hub are symmetric, in
this case, the impact of the hub upon the consensus remains fixed. On the other
hand, if the hub is essentially influenced by the agents, whereas its influence
on them tends to zero, then the consensus is expressed by the scalar product of
the vector of column means of the Laplacian eigenprojection of $\Gamma$ and the
initial state vector of the system. Another protocol, which assumes the
presence of vanishingly weak uniform background links between the agents, leads
to the same latent consensus.

 <dc:title>Building a robust sentiment lexicon with (almost) no resource</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Creating sentiment polarity lexicons is labor intensive. Automatically
translating them from resourceful languages requires in-domain machine
translation systems, which rely on large quantities of bi-texts. In this paper,
we propose to replace machine translation by transferring words from the
lexicon through word embeddings aligned across languages with a simple linear
transform. The approach leads to no degradation, compared to machine
translation, when tested on sentiment polarity classification on tweets from
four languages.

 <dc:title>CSVideoNet: A Real-time End-to-end Learning Framework for
  High-frame-rate Video Compressive Sensing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the real-time encoding-decoding problem for
high-frame-rate video compressive sensing (CS). Unlike prior works that perform
reconstruction using iterative optimization-based approaches, we propose a
non-iterative model, named &quot;CSVideoNet&quot;. CSVideoNet directly learns the inverse
mapping of CS and reconstructs the original input in a single forward
propagation. To overcome the limitations of existing CS cameras, we propose a
multi-rate CNN and a synthesizing RNN to improve the trade-off between
compression ratio (CR) and spatial-temporal resolution of the reconstructed
videos. The experiment results demonstrate that CSVideoNet significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. With no pre/post-processing, we
achieve 25dB PSNR recovery quality at 100x CR, with a frame rate of 125 fps on
a Titan X GPU. Due to the feedforward and high-data-concurrency natures of
CSVideoNet, it can take advantage of GPU acceleration to achieve three orders
of magnitude speed-up over conventional iterative-based approaches. We share
the source code at https://github.com/PSCLab-ASU/CSVideoNet.

 <dc:title>GentleRain+: Making GentleRain Robust on Clock Anomalies</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Causal consistency is in an intermediate consistency model that can be
achieved together with high availability and high performance requirements even
in presence of network partitions. There are several proposals in the
literature for causally consistent data stores. Thanks to the use of single
scalar physical clocks, GentleRain has a throughput higher than other proposals
such as COPS or Orbe. However, both of its correctness and performance relay on
monotonic synchronized physical clocks. Specifically, if physical clocks go
backward its correctness is violated. In addition, GentleRain is sensitive on
the clock synchronization, and clock skew may slow write operations in
GenlteRain. In this paper, we want to solve this issue in GenlteRain by using
Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) instead of physical clocks. Using HLC, GentleRain
protocl is not sensitive on the clock skew anymore. In addition, even if clocks
go backward, the correctness of the system is not violated. Furthermore, by
HLC, we timestamp versions with a clock very close to the physical clocks.
Thus, we can take causally consistency snapshot of the system at any give
physical time. We call GentleRain protocol with HLCs GentleRain+. We have
implemented GentleRain+ protocol, and have evaluated it experimentally.
GentleRain+ provides faster write operations compare to GentleRain that rely
solely on physical clocks to achieve causal consistency. We have also shown
that using HLC instead of physical clock does not have any overhead. Thus, it
makes GentleRain more robust on clock anomalies at no cost.

 <dc:title>Relativizing an incompressible number and an incompressible function

 <dc:description>  We show in this article that uncomputability is also a relative property of
subrecursive classes built on a recursive relative incompressible function,
which acts as a higher-order &quot;yardstick&quot; of irreducible information for the
respective subrecursive class. We define the concept of a Turing submachine,
and a recursive relative version for the Busy Beaver function and for the
halting probability (or Chaitin's constant) Omega; respectively the Busy Beaver
Plus (BBP) function and a time-bounded halting probability. Therefore, we prove
that the computable BBP function defined on any Turing submachine is neither
computable nor compressible by any program running on this submachine. In
addition, we build a Turing submachine that can use lower approximations to its
own time-bounded halting probability to calculate the values of its Busy Beaver
Plus function, in the &quot;same&quot; manner that universal Turing machines use
approximations to Omega to calculate Busy Beaver values. Thus, the algorithmic
information carried by the BBP function is relatively incompressible (and
uncomputable) at the same time that it still is occasionally reached by
submachines. We point that this phenomenon enriches the research on the
relativization and simulation of uncomputability and irreducible information.

 <dc:title>Multi-Agent and Multivariate Submodular Optimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Santiago, Richard</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shepherd, F. Bruce</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent years have seen many algorithmic advances in the area of submodular
optimization: (SO) $\min/\max~f(S): S \in \F$, where $\F$ is a given family of
feasible sets over a ground set $V$ and $f:2^V \rightarrow \R$ is submodular.
This progress has been coupled with a wealth of new applications for these
models. Our focus is on a more general class of {\em multi-agent submodular
optimization} (MASO) which was introduced by Goel et al. in the minimization
setting: $\min \sum_i f_i(S_i): S_1+S_2+ \cdots +S_k \in \F$. Here we use $+$
to denote disjoint union and hence this model is attractive where resources are
being allocated across $k$ agents, each with its own submodular cost function
$f_i()$. In this paper we explore the extent to which the approximability of
the multi-agent problems are linked to their single-agent {\em primitives}. We
also see that the maximization form is tractable for the (much) more general
class of multivariate submodular functions. We give examples of how to use such
functions in modelling competition between agents.

 <dc:description>  Lossy communication of correlated sources over a multiple access channel is
studied. First, lossy communication is investigated in the presence of
correlated decoder side information. An achievable joint source-channel coding
scheme is presented, and the conditions under which separate source and channel
coding is optimal are explored. It is shown that separation is optimal when the
encoders and the decoder have access to a common observation conditioned on
which the two sources are independent. Separation is shown to be optimal also
when only the encoders have access to such a common observation whose lossless
recovery is required at the decoder. Moreover, the optimality of separation is
shown for sources with a common part, and sources with reconstruction
constraints. Next, these results obtained for the system in presence of side
information are utilized to provide a set of necessary conditions for the
transmission of correlated sources over a multiple access channel without side
information. The identified necessary conditions are specialized to the case of
bivariate Gaussian sources over a Gaussian multiple access channel, and are
shown to be tighter than known results in the literature in certain cases. Our
results indicate that side information can have a significant impact on the
optimality of source-channel separation in lossy transmission, in addition to
being instrumental in identifying necessary conditions for the transmission of
correlated sources when no side information is present.

 <dc:description>  Using unitary (instead of general) matrices in artificial neural networks
(ANNs) is a promising way to solve the gradient explosion/vanishing problem, as
well as to enable ANNs to learn long-term correlations in the data. This
approach appears particularly promising for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
In this work, we present a new architecture for implementing an Efficient
Unitary Neural Network (EUNNs); its main advantages can be summarized as
follows. Firstly, the representation capacity of the unitary space in an EUNN
is fully tunable, ranging from a subspace of SU(N) to the entire unitary space.
Secondly, the computational complexity for training an EUNN is merely
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ per parameter. Finally, we test the performance of EUNNs on
the standard copying task, the pixel-permuted MNIST digit recognition benchmark
as well as the Speech Prediction Test (TIMIT). We find that our architecture
significantly outperforms both other state-of-the-art unitary RNNs and the LSTM
architecture, in terms of the final performance and/or the wall-clock training
speed. EUNNs are thus promising alternatives to RNNs and LSTMs for a wide
variety of applications.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the concept of a Visual Compiler that generates a scene specific
pedestrian detector and pose estimator without any pedestrian observations.
Given a single image and auxiliary scene information in the form of camera
parameters and geometric layout of the scene, the Visual Compiler first infers
geometrically and photometrically accurate images of humans in that scene
through the use of computer graphics rendering. Using these renders we learn a
scene-and-region specific spatially-varying fully convolutional neural network,
for simultaneous detection, pose estimation and segmentation of pedestrians. We
demonstrate that when real human annotated data is scarce or non-existent, our
data generation strategy can provide an excellent solution for bootstrapping
human detection and pose estimation. Experimental results show that our
approach outperforms off-the-shelf state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors and
pose estimators that are trained on real data.

 <dc:description>  Continual data collection and widespread deployment of machine learning
algorithms, particularly the distributed variants, have raised new privacy
challenges. In a distributed machine learning scenario, the dataset is stored
among several machines and they solve a distributed optimization problem to
collectively learn the underlying model. We present a secure multi-party
computation inspired privacy preserving distributed algorithm for optimizing a
convex function consisting of several possibly non-convex functions. Each
individual objective function is privately stored with an agent while the
agents communicate model parameters with neighbor machines connected in a
network. We show that our algorithm can correctly optimize the overall
objective function and learn the underlying model accurately. We further prove
that under a vertex connectivity condition on the topology, our algorithm
preserves privacy of individual objective functions. We establish limits on the
what a coalition of adversaries can learn by observing the messages and states
shared over a network.

 <dc:description>  The CENDARI infrastructure is a research supporting platform designed to
provide tools for transnational historical research, focusing on two topics:
Medieval culture and World War I. It exposes to the end users modern web-based
tools relying on a sophisticated infrastructure to collect, enrich, annotate,
and search through large document corpora. Supporting researchers in their
daily work is a novel concern for infrastructures. We describe how we gathered
requirements through multiple methods to understand the historians' needs and
derive an abstract workflow to support them. We then outline the tools we have
built, tying their technical descriptions to the user requirements. The main
tools are the Note Taking Environment and its faceted search capabilities, the
Data Integration platform including the Data API, supporting semantic
enrichment through entity recognition, and the environment supporting the
software development processes throughout the project to keep both technical
partners and researchers in the loop. The outcomes are technical together with
new resources developed and gathered, and the research workflow that has been
described and documented.

 <dc:description>  Existing models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sentence
classification often do not incorporate the context in which sentences appear,
and classify sentences individually. However, traditional sentence
classification approaches have been shown to greatly benefit from jointly
classifying subsequent sentences, such as with conditional random fields. In
this work, we present an ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness of
typical ANN models to classify sentences in isolation, with the strength of
structured prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two
different datasets for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts.

 <dc:description>  Recently, sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention due to the
interest in mining opinions of social media users. Sentiment analysis consists
in determining the polarity of a given text, i.e., its degree of positiveness
or negativeness. Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis algorithms have been
tailored to a specific language given the complexity of having a number of
lexical variations and errors introduced by the people generating content. In
this contribution, our aim is to provide a simple to implement and easy to use
multilingual framework, that can serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis
contests, and as starting point to build new sentiment analysis systems. We
compare our approach in eight different languages, three of them have important
international contests, namely, SemEval (English), TASS (Spanish), and
SENTIPOLC (Italian). Within the competitions our approach reaches from medium
to high positions in the rankings; whereas in the remaining languages our
approach outperforms the reported results.

 <dc:title>Compressed Control of Complex Wireless Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Future wireless networks are envisioned to integrate multi-hop,
multi-operator, multi-technology (m3) components in order to meet the
increasing traffic demand at an acceptable price for subscribers. The
performance of such a network depends on the multitude of parameters defining
traffic statistics, network topology/technology, channel characteristics and
business models for multi-operator cooperation. So far, most of these aspects
have been addressed separately in the literature. Since the above parameters
are mutually dependent, and simultaneously present in a network, for a given
channel and traffic statistics, a joint optimization of technology and business
model parameters is required. In this paper, we present such joint models of
complex wireless networks and introduce optimization with parameter clustering
to solve the problem in a tractable way for large number of parameters. By
parameter clustering we compress the optimization vector and significantly
simplify system implementation, hence the algorithm is referred to as
compressed control of wireless networks. Two distinct parameter compression
techniques are introduced mainly parameter absorption and parameter
aggregation. Numerical results obtained in this way demonstrate clear maximum
in the network utility as a function of the network topology parameters. The
results, for a specific network with traffic offloading, show that the
cooperation decisions between the multiple operators will be significantly
influenced by the traffic dynamics. For typical example scenarios, the optimum
offloading price varies by factor 3 for different traffic patterns which
justifies the use of dynamic strategies in the decision process. Besides, if
user availability increases by multi-operator cooperation, network capacity can
be increased up to 50% and network throughput up to 30-40%.

 <dc:description>  Networks of coupled dynamical systems provide a powerful way to model systems
with enormously complex dynamics, such as the human brain. Control of
synchronization in such networked systems has far reaching applications in many
domains, including engineering and medicine. In this paper, we formulate the
synchronization control in dynamical systems as an optimization problem and
present a multi-objective genetic programming-based approach to infer optimal
control functions that drive the system from a synchronized to a
non-synchronized state and vice-versa. The genetic programming-based controller
allows learning optimal control functions in an interpretable symbolic form.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in controlling
synchronization in coupled oscillator systems linked in networks of increasing
order complexity, ranging from a simple coupled oscillator system to a
hierarchical network of coupled oscillators. The results show that the proposed
method can learn highly-effective and interpretable control functions for such
systems.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel non-linear precoding technique for the transmission of 16
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols in a 1-bit massive multi-user
(MU) multipleinput- single-output (MISO) downlink system. We deploy low
resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the transmitter for the sake
of decreasing the high energy consumption related to the massive MISO system.
To mitigate the multi-user interference (MUI) and the distortions due to the
low resolution DACs, the minimum bit error ratio (MBER) precoder was introduced
in previous work. However, this precoder technique is restricted to quadrature
phase shift keying (QPSK) signaling. Our approach consists in upgrading this
method to the transmission of 16 QAM symbols. Simulation results show that the
performance in terms of uncoded BER is significantly improved for larger
massive MISO gain.

 <dc:description>  The piling up storage and compute stacks in cloud data center are expected to
accommodate the majority of internet traffic in the future. However, as the
number of mobile devices significantly increases, getting massive data into and
out of the cloud wirelessly inflicts high pressure on the bandwidth, and
meanwhile induces unpredictable latency. Fog computing, which advocates
extending clouds to network edge, guarantees low latency and location-aware
service provisioning. In this article, we consider fog computing as an ideal
complement rather than a substitute of cloud computing, and we propose a
software defined networking (SDN) enabled framework for cloud-fog
interoperation, aiming at improving quality of experience and optimizing
network resource usage. Two case studies are provided to illuminate the
feasibility and advantage of the proposed framework. At last, potential
research issues are presented for further investigation.

 <dc:title>Construction of Polar Codes with Sublinear Complexity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Consider the problem of constructing a polar code of block length $N$ for the
transmission over a given channel $W$. Typically this requires to compute the
reliability of all the $N$ synthetic channels and then to include those that
are sufficiently reliable. However, we know from [1], [2] that there is a
partial order among the synthetic channels. Hence, it is natural to ask whether
we can exploit it to reduce the computational burden of the construction
problem.
  We show that, if we take advantage of the partial order [1], [2], we can
construct a polar code by computing the reliability of roughly a fraction
$1/\log^{3/2} N$ of the synthetic channels. In particular, we prove that
$N/\log^{3/2} N$ is a lower bound on the number of synthetic channels to be
considered and such a bound is tight up to a multiplicative factor $\log\log
N$. This set of roughly $N/\log^{3/2} N$ synthetic channels is universal, in
the sense that it allows one to construct polar codes for any $W$, and it can
be identified by solving a maximum matching problem on a bipartite graph.
  Our proof technique consists of reducing the construction problem to the
problem of computing the maximum cardinality of an antichain for a suitable
partially ordered set. As such, this method is general and it can be used to
further improve the complexity of the construction problem in case a new
partial order on the synthetic channels of polar codes is discovered.

 <dc:description>  Across a far-reaching diversity of scientific and industrial applications, a
general key problem involves relating the structure of time-series data to a
meaningful outcome, such as detecting anomalous events from sensor recordings,
or diagnosing patients from physiological time-series measurements like heart
rate or brain activity. Currently, researchers must devote considerable effort
manually devising, or searching for, properties of their time series that are
suitable for the particular analysis problem at hand. Addressing this
non-systematic and time-consuming procedure, here we introduce a new tool,
hctsa, that selects interpretable and useful properties of time series
automatically, by comparing implementations over 7700 time-series features
drawn from diverse scientific literatures. Using two exemplar biological
applications, we show how hctsa allows researchers to leverage decades of
time-series research to quantify and understand informative structure in their
time-series data.

 <dc:title>A Survey of Inductive Biases for Factorial Representation-Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ridgeway, Karl</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the resurgence of interest in neural networks, representation learning
has re-emerged as a central focus in artificial intelligence. Representation
learning refers to the discovery of useful encodings of data that make
domain-relevant information explicit. Factorial representations identify
underlying independent causal factors of variation in data. A factorial
representation is compact and faithful, makes the causal factors explicit, and
facilitates human interpretation of data. Factorial representations support a
variety of applications, including the generation of novel examples, indexing
and search, novelty detection, and transfer learning.
  This article surveys various constraints that encourage a learning algorithm
to discover factorial representations. I dichotomize the constraints in terms
of unsupervised and supervised inductive bias. Unsupervised inductive biases
exploit assumptions about the environment, such as the statistical distribution
of factor coefficients, assumptions about the perturbations a factor should be
invariant to (e.g. a representation of an object can be invariant to rotation,
translation or scaling), and assumptions about how factors are combined to
synthesize an observation. Supervised inductive biases are constraints on the
representations based on additional information connected to observations.
Supervisory labels come in variety of types, which vary in how strongly they
constrain the representation, how many factors are labeled, how many
observations are labeled, and whether or not we know the associations between
the constraints and the factors they are related to.
  This survey brings together a wide variety of models that all touch on the
problem of learning factorial representations and lays out a framework for
comparing these models based on the strengths of the underlying supervised and
unsupervised inductive biases.

 <dc:description>  We present a tracking algorithm to maintain the communication link between a
base station (BS) and a mobile station (MS) in a millimeter wave (mmWave)
communication system, where antenna arrays are used for beamforming in both the
BS and MS. Downlink transmission is considered, and the tracking is performed
at the MS as it moves relative to the BS. Specifically, we consider the case
that the MS rotates quickly due to hand movement. The algorithm estimates the
angle of arrival (AoA) by using variations in the radiation pattern of the beam
as a function of this angle. Numerical results show that the algorithm achieves
accurate beam alignment when the MS rotates in a wide range of angular speeds.
For example, the algorithm can support angular speeds up to 800 degrees per
second when tracking updates are available every 10 ms.

 <dc:description>  Several recently developed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solvers scale to
large MAPF instances by searching for MAPF plans on 2 levels: The high-level
search resolves collisions between agents, and the low-level search plans paths
for single agents under the constraints imposed by the high-level search. We
make the following contributions to solve the MAPF problem with imperfect plan
execution with small average makespans: First, we formalize the MAPF Problem
with Delay Probabilities (MAPF-DP), define valid MAPF-DP plans and propose the
use of robust plan-execution policies for valid MAPF-DP plans to control how
each agent proceeds along its path. Second, we discuss 2 classes of
decentralized robust plan-execution policies (called Fully Synchronized
Policies and Minimal Communication Policies) that prevent collisions during
plan execution for valid MAPF-DP plans. Third, we present a 2-level MAPF-DP
solver (called Approximate Minimization in Expectation) that generates valid
MAPF-DP plans.

 <dc:title>Modeling Trolling in Social Media Conversations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mojica, Luis Gerardo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Social media websites, electronic newspapers and Internet forums allow
visitors to leave comments for others to read and interact. This exchange is
not free from participants with malicious intentions, who troll others by
positing messages that are intended to be provocative, offensive, or menacing.
With the goal of facilitating the computational modeling of trolling, we
propose a trolling categorization that is novel in the sense that it allows
comment-based analysis from both the trolls' and the responders' perspectives,
characterizing these two perspectives using four aspects, namely, the troll's
intention and his intention disclosure, as well as the responder's
interpretation of the troll's intention and her response strategy. Using this
categorization, we annotate and release a dataset containing excerpts of Reddit
conversations involving suspected trolls and their interactions with other
users. Finally, we identify the difficult-to-classify cases in our corpus and
suggest potential solutions for them.

 <dc:title>The Method of Gauss-Newton to Compute Power Series Solutions of

 <dc:description>  We consider the extension of the method of Gauss-Newton from complex
floating-point arithmetic to the field of truncated power series with complex
floating-point coefficients. With linearization we formulate a linear system
where the coefficient matrix is a series with matrix coefficients, and provide
a characterization for when the matrix series is regular based on the algebraic
variety of an augmented system. The structure of the linear system leads to a
block triangular system. In the regular case, solving the linear system is
equivalent to solving a Hermite interpolation problem. We show that this
solution has cost cubic in the problem size. In general, at singular points, we
rely on methods of tropical algebraic geometry to compute Puiseux series. With
a few illustrative examples, we demonstrate the application to polynomial
homotopy continuation.

 <dc:description>  This report gives an overview of our efforts towards a formalization for a
food processing demonstrator plant. Our BeSpaceD framework is used for the
formalization. The formalization comprises properties of components and
relations between components. We present domain-specific constructs for the
formalization of industrial automation facilities and provide some insights
into the concrete food processing formalization. We are particularly interested
in spatio-temporal and other physical characteristics. Relation- ships are
formalized as graphs with annotated edges and components are represented as
nodes.

 <dc:title>A Fast Exact Quantum Algorithm for Solitude Verification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Solitude verification is arguably one of the simplest fundamental problems in
distributed computing, where the goal is to verify that there is a unique
contender in a network. This paper devises a quantum algorithm that exactly
solves the problem on an anonymous network, which is known as a network model
with minimal assumptions [Angluin, STOC'80]. The algorithm runs in $O(N)$
rounds if every party initially has the common knowledge of an upper bound $N$
on the number of parties. This implies that all solvable problems can be solved
in $O(N)$ rounds on average without error (i.e., with zero-sided error) on the
network. As a generalization, a quantum algorithm that works in $O(N\log_2
(\max\{k,2\}))$ rounds is obtained for the problem of exactly computing any
symmetric Boolean function, over $n$ distributed input bits, which is constant
over all the $n$ bits whose sum is larger than $k$ for $k\in \{0,1,\dots,
N-1\}$. All these algorithms work with the bit complexities bounded by a
polynomial in $N$.

 <dc:description>  Robust face detection is one of the most important pre-processing steps to
support facial expression analysis, facial landmarking, face recognition, pose
estimation, building of 3D facial models, etc. Although this topic has been
intensely studied for decades, it is still challenging due to numerous variants
of face images in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel
approach named Multiple Scale Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network
(MS-FRCNN) to robustly detect human facial regions from images collected under
various challenging conditions, e.g. large occlusions, extremely low
resolutions, facial expressions, strong illumination variations, etc. The
proposed approach is benchmarked on two challenging face detection databases,
i.e. the Wider Face database and the Face Detection Dataset and Benchmark
(FDDB), and compared against recent other face detection methods, e.g.
Two-stage CNN, Multi-scale Cascade CNN, Faceness, Aggregate Chanel Features,
HeadHunter, Multi-view Face Detection, Cascade CNN, etc. The experimental
results show that our proposed approach consistently achieves highly
competitive results with the state-of-the-art performance against other recent
face detection methods.

 <dc:description>  In the study of shapes of human organs using computational anatomy,
variations are found to arise from inter-subject anatomical differences,
disease-specific effects, and measurement noise. This paper introduces a
stochastic model for incorporating random variations into the Large Deformation
Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework. By accounting for randomness in
a particular setup which is crafted to fit the geometrical properties of LDDMM,
we formulate the template estimation problem for landmarks with noise and give
two methods for efficiently estimating the parameters of the noise fields from
a prescribed data set. One method directly approximates the time evolution of
the variance of each landmark by a finite set of differential equations, and
the other is based on an Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. In the second
method, the evaluation of the data likelihood is achieved without registering
the landmarks, by applying bridge sampling using a stochastically perturbed
version of the large deformation gradient flow algorithm. The method and the
estimation algorithms are experimentally validated on synthetic examples and
shape data of human corpora callosa.

from the FFT, we propose a Sparse Compositional Regression (SCR) framework,
which enables a significant speed up over classical dense regressors. Second,
we propose a binary approximation to SIFT features. Binary Approximated SIFT
(BASIFT) features, which are a computationally efficient approximation to SIFT,
a commonly used feature with SDM. We demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm on an iPhone 7, and show that we achieve similar accuracy to SDM.

to create an array of virtual cameras with overlapping field of view at

 <dc:description>  Topics generated by topic models are typically represented as list of terms.
To reduce the cognitive overhead of interpreting these topics for end-users, we
propose labelling a topic with a succinct phrase that summarises its theme or
idea. Using Wikipedia document titles as label candidates, we compute neural
embeddings for documents and words to select the most relevant labels for
topics. Compared to a state-of-the-art topic labelling system, our methodology
is simpler, more efficient, and finds better topic labels.

 <dc:description>  Despite its widespread use in Android apps, reflection poses graving problems
for static security analysis. Currently, string inference is applied to handle
reflection, resulting in significantly missed security vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we bring forward the ubiquity of incomplete information environments
(IIEs) for Android apps, where some critical data-flows are missing during
static analysis, and the need for resolving reflective calls under IIEs. We
present Ripple, the first IIE-aware static reflection analysis for Android apps
that resolves reflective calls more soundly than string inference. Validation
with 17 popular Android apps from Google Play demonstrates the effectiveness of
Ripple in discovering reflective targets with a low false positive rate. As a
result, Ripple enables FlowDroid, a taint analysis for Android apps, to find
hundreds of sensitive data leakages that would otherwise be missed. As a
fundamental analysis, Ripple will be valuable for many security analysis
clients, since more program behaviors can now be analyzed under IIEs.

 <dc:description>  Directed networks such as gene regulation networks and neural networks are
connected by arcs (directed links). The nodes in a directed network are often
strongly interwound by a huge number of directed cycles, which lead to complex
information-processing dynamics in the network and make it highly challenging
to infer the intrinsic direction of information flow. In this theoretical
paper, based on the principle of minimum-feedback, we explore the node
hierarchy of directed networks and distinguish feedforward and feedback arcs.
Nearly optimal node hierarchy solutions, which minimize the number of feedback
arcs from lower-level nodes to higher-level nodes, are constructed by
belief-propagation and simulated-annealing methods. For real-world networks, we
quantify the extent of feedback scarcity by comparison with the ensemble of
direction-randomized networks and identify the most important feedback arcs.
Our methods are also useful for visualizing directed networks.

 <dc:description>  Intelligent systems capable of automatically understanding natural language
text are important for many artificial intelligence applications including
mobile phone voice assistants, computer vision, and robotics. Understanding
language often constitutes fitting new information into a previously acquired
view of the world. However, many machine reading systems rely on the text alone
to infer its meaning. In this paper, we pursue a different approach; machine
reading methods that make use of background knowledge to facilitate language
understanding. To this end, we have developed two methods: The first method
addresses prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. It uses background
knowledge within a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that learns from
both labeled and unlabeled data. This approach yields state-of-the-art results
on two datasets against strong baselines; The second method extracts
relationships from compound nouns. Our knowledge-aware method for compound noun
analysis accurately extracts relationships and significantly outperforms a
baseline that does not make use of background knowledge.

 <dc:description>  We propose a projected semi-stochastic gradient descent method with
mini-batch for improving both the theoretical complexity and practical
performance of the general stochastic gradient descent method (SGD). We are
able to prove linear convergence under weak strong convexity assumption. This
requires no strong convexity assumption for minimizing the sum of smooth convex
functions subject to a compact polyhedral set, which remains popular across
machine learning community. Our PS2GD preserves the low-cost per iteration and
high optimization accuracy via stochastic gradient variance-reduced technique,
and admits a simple parallel implementation with mini-batches. Moreover, PS2GD
is also applicable to dual problem of SVM with hinge loss.

 <dc:description>  Electron microscopic connectomics is an ambitious research direction with the
goal of studying comprehensive brain connectivity maps by using
high-throughput, nano-scale microscopy. One of the main challenges in
connectomics research is developing scalable image analysis algorithms that
require minimal user intervention. Recently, deep learning has drawn much
attention in computer vision because of its exceptional performance in image
classification tasks. For this reason, its application to connectomic analyses
holds great promise, as well. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep neural
network architecture, FusionNet, for the automatic segmentation of neuronal
structures in connectomics data. FusionNet leverages the latest advances in
machine learning, such as semantic segmentation and residual neural networks,
with the novel introduction of summation-based skip connections to allow a much
deeper network architecture for a more accurate segmentation. We demonstrate
the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with state-of-the-art
electron microscopy (EM) segmentation methods from the ISBI EM segmentation
challenge. We also show the segmentation results on two different tasks
including cell membrane and cell body segmentation and a statistical analysis
of cell morphology.

 <dc:description>  Computed tomography (CT) is critical for various clinical applications, e.g.,
radiotherapy treatment planning and also PET attenuation correction. However,
CT exposes radiation during acquisition, which may cause side effects to
patients. Compared to CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is much safer and
does not involve any radiations. Therefore, recently, researchers are greatly
motivated to estimate CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same
subject for the case of radiotherapy planning. In this paper, we propose a
data-driven approach to address this challenging problem. Specifically, we
train a fully convolutional network to generate CT given an MR image. To better
model the nonlinear relationship from MRI to CT and to produce more realistic
images, we propose to use the adversarial training strategy and an image
gradient difference loss function. We further apply AutoContext Model to
implement a context-aware generative adversarial network. Experimental results
show that our method is accurate and robust for predicting CT images from MRI
images, and also outperforms three state-of-the-art methods under comparison.

 <dc:title>Learning Residual Images for Face Attribute Manipulation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Face attributes are interesting due to their detailed description of human
faces. Unlike prior researches working on attribute prediction, we address an
inverse and more challenging problem called face attribute manipulation which
aims at modifying a face image according to a given attribute value. Instead of
manipulating the whole image, we propose to learn the corresponding residual
image defined as the difference between images before and after the
manipulation. In this way, the manipulation can be operated efficiently with
modest pixel modification. The framework of our approach is based on the
Generative Adversarial Network. It consists of two image transformation
networks and a discriminative network. The transformation networks are
responsible for the attribute manipulation and its dual operation and the
discriminative network is used to distinguish the generated images from real
images. We also apply dual learning to allow transformation networks to learn
from each other. Experiments show that residual images can be effectively
learned and used for attribute manipulations. The generated images remain most
of the details in attribute-irrelevant areas.

 <dc:description>  Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) is one of the state-of-the-art object
trackers. However, it does not reasonably model the distribution of correlation
response during tracking process, which might cause the drifting problem,
especially when targets undergo significant appearance changes due to
occlusion, camera shaking, and/or deformation. In this paper, we propose an
Output Constraint Transfer (OCT) method that by modeling the distribution of
correlation response in a Bayesian optimization framework is able to mitigate
the drifting problem. OCT builds upon the reasonable assumption that the
correlation response to the target image follows a Gaussian distribution, which
we exploit to select training samples and reduce model uncertainty. OCT is
rooted in a new theory which transfers data distribution to a constraint of the
optimized variable, leading to an efficient framework to calculate correlation
filters. Extensive experiments on a commonly used tracking benchmark show that
the proposed method significantly improves KCF, and achieves better performance
than other state-of-the-art trackers. To encourage further developments, the
source code is made available https://github.com/bczhangbczhang/OCT-KCF.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network (NN) based EEG-speech
(NES) modeling framework, in which three network structures are developed to
map imagined EEG signals to phonemes. The proposed NES models incorporate a
language model based EEG feature extraction layer, an acoustic feature mapping
layer, and a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) based the feature learning
layer. The NES models can jointly realize the representation of multichannel
EEG signals and the projection of acoustic speech signals. Among three proposed
NES models, two augmented networks utilize spoken EEG signals as either bias or
gate information to strengthen the feature learning and translation of imagined
EEG signals. Experimental results show that all three proposed NES models
outperform the baseline support vector machine (SVM) method on EEG-speech
classification. With respect to binary classification, our approach achieves
comparable results relative to deep believe network approach.

 <dc:title>The VQA-Machine: Learning How to Use Existing Vision Algorithms to

 <dc:description>  One of the most intriguing features of the Visual Question Answering (VQA)
challenge is the unpredictability of the questions. Extracting the information
required to answer them demands a variety of image operations from detection
and counting, to segmentation and reconstruction. To train a method to perform
even one of these operations accurately from {image,question,answer} tuples
would be challenging, but to aim to achieve them all with a limited set of such
training data seems ambitious at best. We propose here instead a more general
and scalable approach which exploits the fact that very good methods to achieve
these operations already exist, and thus do not need to be trained. Our method
thus learns how to exploit a set of external off-the-shelf algorithms to
achieve its goal, an approach that has something in common with the Neural
Turing Machine. The core of our proposed method is a new co-attention model. In
addition, the proposed approach generates human-readable reasons for its
decision, and can still be trained end-to-end without ground truth reasons
being given. We demonstrate the effectiveness on two publicly available
datasets, Visual Genome and VQA, and show that it produces the state-of-the-art
results in both cases.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present cryptocurrency-based lottery protocols that do not require any
collateral from the players. Previous protocols for this task required a
security deposit that is $O(N^2)$ times larger than the bet amount, where $N$
is the number of players. Our protocols are based on a tournament bracket
construction, and require only $O(\log N)$ rounds. Our lottery protocols thus
represent a significant improvement, both because they allow players with
little money to participate, and because of the time value of money. The
Ethereum-based implementation of our lottery is highly efficient. The Bitcoin
implementation requires an $O(2^N)$ off-chain setup phase, which demonstrates
that the expressive power of the scripting language can have important
implications. We also describe a minimal modification to the Bitcoin protocol
that would eliminate the exponential blowup.

 <dc:description>  In this manuscript, inspired by a simpler reformulation of primary sample
space Metropolis light transport, we derive a novel family of general Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithms called charted Metropolis-Hastings, that
introduces the notion of sampling charts to extend a given sampling domain and
making it easier to sample the desired target distribution and escape from
local maxima through coordinate changes. We further apply the novel algorithms
to light transport simulation, obtaining a new type of algorithm called charted
Metropolis light transport, that can be seen as a bridge between primary sample
space and path space Metropolis light transport. The new algorithms require to
provide only right inverses of the sampling functions, a property that we
believe crucial to make them practical in the context of light transport
simulation. We further propose a method to integrate density estimation into
this framework through a novel scheme that uses it as an independence sampler.

 <dc:description>  Hashing aims at generating highly compact similarity preserving code words
which are well suited for large-scale image retrieval tasks.
  Most existing hashing methods first encode the images as a vector of
hand-crafted features followed by a separate binarization step to generate hash
codes. This two-stage process may produce sub-optimal encoding. In this paper,
for the first time, we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing
through residual learning, termed Deep Residual Hashing (DRH), for an
end-to-end simultaneous representation learning and hash coding. The DRH model
constitutes four key elements: (1) a sub-network with multiple stacked residual
blocks; (2) hashing layer for binarization; (3) supervised retrieval loss
function based on neighbourhood component analysis for similarity preserving
embedding; and (4) hashing related losses and regularisation to control the
quantization error and improve the quality of hash coding. We present results
of extensive experiments on a large public chest x-ray image database with
co-morbidities and discuss the outcome showing substantial improvements over
the latest state-of-the art methods.

 <dc:description>  This work is a comprehensive extension of Abu-Salem et al. (2015) that
investigates the prowess of the Funnel Heap for implementing sums of products
in the polytope method for factoring polynomials, when the polynomials are in
sparse distributed representation. We exploit that the work and cache
complexity of an Insert operation using Funnel Heap can be refined to de- pend
on the rank of the inserted monomial product, where rank corresponds to its
lifetime in Funnel Heap. By optimising on the pattern by which insertions and
extractions occur during the Hensel lifting phase of the polytope method, we
are able to obtain an adaptive Funnel Heap that minimises all of the work,
cache, and space complexity of this phase. Additionally, we conduct a detailed
empirical study confirming the superiority of Funnel Heap over the generic
Binary Heap once swaps to external memory begin to take place. We demonstrate
that Funnel Heap is a more efficient merger than the cache oblivious k-merger,
which fails to achieve its optimal (and amortised) cache complexity when used
for performing sums of products. This provides an empirical proof of concept
that the overlapping approach for perform- ing sums of products using one
global Funnel Heap is more suited than the serialised approach, even when the
latter uses the best merging structures available.

However, the large size of Web archives and their temporal nature pose many
challenges to researchers interested in working with these collections. In this
work, we describe the challenges of working with Web archives and propose the
research methodology of extracting and studying sub-collections of the archive
focused on specific topics and events. We discuss the opportunities and

 <dc:description>  The &quot;Smart City&quot; (SC) concept revolves around the idea of embodying
cutting-edge ICT solutions in the very fabric of future cities, in order to
offer new and better services to citizens while lowering the city management
costs, both in monetary, social, and environmental terms. In this framework,
communication technologies are perceived as subservient to the SC services,
providing the means to collect and process the data needed to make the services
function. In this paper, we propose a new vision in which technology and SC
services are designed to take advantage of each other in a symbiotic manner.
According to this new paradigm, which we call &quot;SymbioCity&quot;, SC services can
indeed be exploited to improve the performance of the same communication
systems that provide them with data. Suggestive examples of this symbiotic
ecosystem are discussed in the paper. The dissertation is then substantiated in
a proof-of-concept case study, where we show how the traffic monitoring service
provided by the London Smart City initiative can be used to predict the density
of users in a certain zone and optimize the cellular service in that area.

 <dc:title>Maximum Matching on Trees in the Online Preemptive and the Incremental
  Dynamic Graph Models</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the Maximum Cardinality Matching (MCM) and the Maximum Weight
Matching (MWM) problems, on trees and on some special classes of graphs, in the
Online Preemptive and the Incremental Dynamic Graph models. In the {\em Online
Preemptive} model, the edges of a graph are revealed one by one and the
algorithm is required to always maintain a valid matching. On seeing an edge,
the algorithm has to either accept or reject the edge. If accepted, then the
adjacent edges are discarded, and all rejections are permanent. In this model,
the complexity of the problems is settled for deterministic algorithms. Epstein
et al. gave a $5.356$-competitive randomized algorithm for MWM, and also proved
a lower bound of $1.693$ for MCM. The same lower bound applies for MWM.
  In this paper we show that some of the results can be improved in the case of
trees and some special classes of graphs. In the online preemptive model, we
present a $64/33$-competitive (in expectation) randomized algorithm for MCM on
trees.
  Inspired by the above mentioned algorithm for MCM, we present the main result
of the paper, a randomized algorithm for MCM with a &quot;worst case&quot; update time of
$O(1)$, in the incremental dynamic graph model, which is $3/2$-approximate (in
expectation) on trees, and $1.8$-approximate (in expectation) on general graphs
with maximum degree $3$. Note that this algorithm works only against an
oblivious adversary. Hence, we derandomize this algorithm, and give a $(3/2 +
\epsilon)$-approximate deterministic algorithm for MCM on trees, with an
amortized update time of $O(1/\epsilon)$.
  We also present a minor result for MWM in the online preemptive model, a
$3$-competitive (in expectation) randomized algorithm on growing trees (where
the input revealed upto any stage is always a tree, i.e. a new edge never
connects two disconnected trees).

 <dc:title>A Two-Phase Approach Towards Identifying Argument Structure in Natural

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new approach for extracting argument structure from natural
language texts that contain an underlying argument. Our approach comprises of
two phases: Score Assignment and Structure Prediction. The Score Assignment
phase trains models to classify relations between argument units (Support,
Attack or Neutral). To that end, different training strategies have been
explored. We identify different linguistic and lexical features for training
the classifiers. Through ablation study, we observe that our novel use of
word-embedding features is most effective for this task. The Structure
Prediction phase makes use of the scores from the Score Assignment phase to
arrive at the optimal structure. We perform experiments on three argumentation
datasets, namely, AraucariaDB, Debatepedia and Wikipedia. We also propose two
baselines and observe that the proposed approach outperforms baseline systems
for the final task of Structure Prediction.

 <dc:description>  Collecting well-annotated image datasets to train modern machine learning
algorithms is prohibitively expensive for many tasks. One appealing alternative
is rendering synthetic data where ground-truth annotations are generated
automatically. Unfortunately, models trained purely on rendered images often
fail to generalize to real images. To address this shortcoming, prior work
introduced unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms that attempt to map
representations between the two domains or learn to extract features that are
domain-invariant. In this work, we present a new approach that learns, in an
unsupervised manner, a transformation in the pixel space from one domain to the
other. Our generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method adapts
source-domain images to appear as if drawn from the target domain. Our approach
not only produces plausible samples, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art
on a number of unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios by large margins.
Finally, we demonstrate that the adaptation process generalizes to object
classes unseen during training.

 <dc:title>Basis-Function Modeling of Loudness Variations in Ensemble Performance</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a computational model of loudness variations in
expressive ensemble performance. The model predicts and explains the continuous
variation of loudness as a function of information extracted automatically from
the written score. Although such models have been proposed for expressive
performance in solo instruments, this is (to the best of our knowledge) the
first attempt to define a model for expressive performance in ensembles. To
that end, we extend an existing model that was designed to model expressive
piano performances, and describe the additional steps necessary for the model
to deal with scores of arbitrary instrumentation, including orchestral scores.
We test both linear and non-linear variants of the extended model n a data set
of audio recordings of symphonic music, in a leave-one-out setting. The
experiments reveal that the most successful model variant is a recurrent,
non-linear model. Even if the accuracy of the predicted loudness varies from
one recording to another, in several cases the model explains well over 50% of
the variance in loudness.

 <dc:description>  Graphs form a natural model for relationships and interactions between
entities, for example, between people in social and cooperation networks,
servers in computer networks, or tags and words in documents and tweets. But,
which of these relationships or interactions are the most lasting ones? In this
paper, we study the following problem: given a set of graph snapshots, which
may correspond to the state of an evolving graph at different time instances,
identify the set of nodes that are the most densely connected in all snapshots.
We call this problem the Best Friends For Ever (BFF) problem. We provide
definitions for density over multiple graph snapshots, that capture different
semantics of connectedness over time, and we study the corresponding variants
of the BFF problem. We then look at the On-Off BFF (O^2BFF) problem that
relaxes the requirement of nodes being connected in all snapshots, and asks for
the densest set of nodes in at least $k$ of a given set of graph snapshots. We
show that this problem is NP-complete for all definitions of density, and we
propose a set of efficient algorithms. Finally, we present experiments with
synthetic and real datasets that show both the efficiency of our algorithms and
the usefulness of the BFF and the O^2BFF problems.

 <dc:description>  We propose a dual decomposition and linear program relaxation of the NP -hard
minimum cost multicut problem. Unlike other polyhedral relaxations of the
multicut polytope, it is amenable to efficient optimization by message passing.
Like other polyhedral elaxations, it can be tightened efficiently by cutting
planes. We define an algorithm that alternates between message passing and
efficient separation of cycle- and odd-wheel inequalities. This algorithm is
more efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms based on linear programming,
including algorithms written in the framework of leading commercial software,
as we show in experiments with large instances of the problem from applications
in computer vision, biomedical image analysis and data mining.

  We also give a complete classification of deep holes of Reed Solomon codes

 <dc:title>Verification of Data-aware Business Processes in the Presence of
  Ontologies</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Santoso, Ario</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The meet up between data, processes and structural knowledge in modeling
enterprise systems is a challenging task that has led to the study of combining
formalisms from knowledge representation, database theory, and process
management. To ensure system correctness, formal verification also comes into
play and offers well-established techniques. In line with this, significant
results have been obtained within the research on data-aware business processes
(DABP), which studies the marriage between static and dynamic aspects of a
system within a unified framework.
  Here, we investigate the verification of DABP in the presence of ontologies,
and provide the following contributions: (1) We propose a formal framework
called Golog-KABs (GKABs), by leveraging on the state of the art formalisms for
DABP equipped with ontologies. GKABs enable us to specify semantically-rich
DABP, where the system dynamics are specified using a high-level action
language inspired by the Golog programming language. (2) We propose a
parametric execution semantics for GKABs that is able to elegantly accommodate
a plethora of inconsistency-aware semantics based on the well-known notion of
repair, and this leads us to several variants of inconsistency-aware GKABs. (3)
We enhance GKABs towards context-sensitive GKABs. (4) We introduce the
so-called Alternating-GKABs that allow for a more fine-grained analysis over
the systems. (5) We introduce a novel framework called Semantically-Enhanced
Data-Aware Processes (SEDAPs) that, by utilizing ontologies, enable us to have
a high-level conceptual view over the evolution of the underlying system.
  We also provide reductions for the verification of sophisticated first-order
temporal properties over all of the settings above, and show that verification
can be addressed using existing techniques developed for Data-Centric Dynamic
Systems (a well-established DABP framework).

 <dc:description>  Intuitionistic first-order logic extended with a restricted form of Markov's
principle is constructive and admits a Curry-Howard correspondence, as shown by
Herbelin. We provide a simpler proof of that result and then we study
intuitionistic first-order logic extended with unrestricted Markov's principle.
Starting from classical natural deduction, we restrict the excluded middle and
we obtain a natural deduction system and a parallel Curry-Howard isomorphism
for the logic. We show that proof terms for existentially quantified formulas
reduce to a list of individual terms representing all possible witnesses. As
corollary, we derive that the logic is Herbrand constructive: whenever it
proves any existential formula, it proves also an Herbrand disjunction for the
formula. Finally, using the techniques just introduced, we also provide a new
computational interpretation of Arithmetic with Markov's principle.

efficiency for a number of problems, so far there was no general algorithm
applicable to multiple problem types. In his work, we propose such a general
algorithm. It depends on several parameters, which can be used to optimize its
performance in each particular setting. We demonstrate efficacy of our method
on graph matching and multicut problems, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
solvers including those based on subgradient optimization and off-the-shelf
linear programming solvers.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new early termination method (ETM) for Luby

least reliable messages (LRM), observes only sign alterations of a small
cluster in log-likelihood ratio (LLR) messages passing between nodes in BP
decoder. Simulation results and complexity analyzes show that LRM significantly
lower computational complexity of early termination section in decoder without
any performance degradation and decreases the average decoding iteration
amounts compared to conventional ETMs in literature. The method can be easily
applied to code families which can be decoded by BP such as low density parity
check (LDPC) codes, polar codes and Raptor codes.

 <dc:title>A Generalized Approximation Framework for Fractional Network Flow and

 <dc:creator>Holzhauser, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Krumke, Sven O.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We generalize the fractional packing framework of Garg and Koenemann to the
case of linear fractional packing problems over polyhedral cones. More
precisely, we provide approximation algorithms for problems of the form
$\max\{c^T x : Ax \leq b, x \in C \}$, where the matrix $A$ contains no
negative entries and $C$ is a cone that is generated by a finite set $S$ of
non-negative vectors. While the cone is allowed to require an exponential-sized
representation, we assume that we can access it via one of three types of
oracles. For each of these oracles, we present positive results for the
approximability of the packing problem. In contrast to other frameworks, the
presented one allows the use of arbitrary linear objective functions and can be
applied to a large class of packing problems without much effort. In
particular, our framework instantly allows to derive fast and simple fully
polynomial-time approximation algorithms (FPTASs) for a large set of network
flow problems, such as budget-constrained versions of traditional network
flows, multicommodity flows, or generalized flows. Some of these FPTASs
represent the first ones of their kind, while others match existing results but
offer a much simpler proof.

 <dc:description>  We study the quadratic assignment problem, in computer vision also known as
graph matching. Two leading solvers for this problem optimize the Lagrange
decomposition duals with sub-gradient and dual ascent (also known as message
passing) updates. We explore s direction further and propose several additional
Lagrangean relaxations of the graph matching problem along with corresponding
algorithms, which are all based on a common dual ascent framework. Our
extensive empirical evaluation gives several theoretical insights and suggests
a new state-of-the-art any-time solver for the considered problem. Our
improvement over state-of-the-art is particularly visible on a new dataset with
large-scale sparse problem instances containing more than 500 graph nodes each.

 <dc:description>  Cloud performance diagnosis and prediction is a challenging problem due to
the stochastic nature of the cloud systems. Cloud performance is affected by a
large set of factors including (but not limited to) virtual machine types,
regions, workloads, wide area network delay and bandwidth. Therefore,
necessitating the determination of complex relationships between these factors.
The current research in this area does not address the challenge of building
models that capture the uncertain and complex relationships between these
factors. Further, the challenge of cloud performance prediction under
uncertainty has not garnered sufficient attention. This paper proposes develops
and validates ALPINE, a Bayesian system for cloud performance diagnosis and
prediction. ALPINE incorporates Bayesian networks to model uncertain and
complex relationships between several factors mentioned above. It handles
missing, scarce and sparse data to diagnose and predict stochastic cloud
performance efficiently. We validate our proposed system using extensive real
data and trace-driven analysis and show that it predicts cloud performance with
high accuracy of 91.93%.

 <dc:description>  We propose a technique that propagates information forward through video
data. The method is conceptually simple and can be applied to tasks that
require the propagation of structured information, such as semantic labels,
based on video content. We propose a 'Video Propagation Network' that processes
video frames in an adaptive manner. The model is applied online: it propagates
information forward without the need to access future frames. In particular we
combine two components, a temporal bilateral network for dense and video
adaptive filtering, followed by a spatial network to refine features and
increased flexibility. We present experiments on video object segmentation and
semantic video segmentation and show increased performance comparing to the
best previous task-specific methods, while having favorable runtime.
Additionally we demonstrate our approach on an example regression task of color
propagation in a grayscale video.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the emergence of strong controversial issues in modern
societies is a key issue in opinion studies. A commonly diffused idea is the
fact that the increasing of homophily in social networks, due to the modern
ICT, can be a driving force for opinion polariation. In this paper we address
the problem with a modelling approach following three basic steps. We first
introduce a network morphogenesis model to reconstruct network structures where
homophily can be tuned with a parameter. We show that as homophily increases
the emergence of marked topological community structures in the networks
raises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent
networks and we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps
consensus formation. Finally, we introduce a tunable external media pressure
and we show that, actually, the combination of homophily and media makes the
media effect less effective and leads to strongly polarized opinion clusters.

 <dc:description>  Fork-Join (FJ) queueing models capture the dynamics of system parallelization
under synchronization constraints, for example, for applications such as
MapReduce, multipath transmission and RAID systems. Arriving jobs are first
split into tasks and mapped to servers for execution, such that a job can only
leave the system when all of its tasks are executed.
  In this paper, we provide computable stochastic bounds for the waiting and
response time distributions for heterogeneous FJ systems under general
parallelization benefit. Our main contribution is a generalized mathematical
framework for probabilistic server scheduling strategies that are essentially
characterized by a probability distribution over the number of utilized
servers, and the optimization thereof. We highlight the trade-off between the
scaling benefit due to parallelization and the FJ inherent synchronization
penalty. Further, we provide optimal scheduling strategies for arbitrary
scaling regimes that map to different levels of parallelization benefit. One
notable insight obtained from our results is that different applications with
varying parallelization benefits result in different optimal strategies.
Finally, we complement our analytical results by applying them to various
applications showing the optimality of the proposed scheduling strategies.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel approach to studying animal behaviour and the context in
which it occurs, through the use of microphone backpacks carried on the backs
of individual free-flying birds. These sensors are increasingly used by animal
behaviour researchers to study individual vocalisations of freely behaving
animals, even in the field. However such devices may record more than an
animals vocal behaviour, and have the potential to be used for investigating
specific activities (movement) and context (background) within which
vocalisations occur. To facilitate this approach, we investigate the automatic
annotation of such recordings through two different sound scene analysis
paradigms: a scene-classification method using feature learning, and an
event-detection method using probabilistic latent component analysis (PLCA). We
analyse recordings made with Eurasian jackdaws (Corvus monedula) in both
captive and field settings. Results are comparable with the state of the art in
sound scene analysis; we find that the current recognition quality level
enables scalable automatic annotation of audio logger data, given partial
annotation, but also find that individual differences between animals and/or
their backpacks limit the generalisation from one individual to another. we
consider the interrelation of 'scenes' and 'events' in this particular task,
and issues of temporal resolution.

 <dc:description>  Bitcoin, the first peer-to-peer electronic cash system, opened the door to
permissionless, private, and trustless transactions. Attempts to repurpose
Bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology have run up against fundamental
limitations to privacy, faithful execution, and transaction finality. We
introduce \emph{Strong Federations}: publicly verifiable, Byzantine-robust
transaction networks that facilitate movement of any asset between disparate
markets, without requiring third-party trust. \emph{Strong Federations} enable
commercial privacy, with support for transactions where asset types and amounts
are opaque, while remaining publicly verifiable. As in Bitcoin, execution
fidelity is cryptographically enforced; however, \emph{Strong Federations}
significantly lower capital requirements for market participants by reducing
transaction latency and improving interoperability. To show how this innovative
solution can be applied today, we describe \emph{\liquid}: the first
implementation of \emph{Strong Federations} deployed in a Financial Market.

 <dc:description>  Simulink is a de-facto industrial standard for the design of embedded
systems. In previous work, we developed a compositional analysis framework for
Simulink models in Isabelle -- the Refinement Calculus of Reactive Systems
(RCRS), which allows checking compatibility and substitutability of components.
However, standard type checking was not considered in that work. In this paper
we present a method for the type inference of hierarchical block diagrams using
the Isabelle theorem prover. A Simulink diagram is translated into an (RCRS)
Isabelle theory. Then the Isabelle's powerful type inference mechanism is used
to infer the types of the diagram based on the types of the basic blocks. One
of the aims is to handle formally as many diagrams as possible. In particular,
we want to be able to handle even those diagrams that may have typing
ambiguities, provided that they are accepted by Simulink. This method is
implemented in our toolset that translates Simulink diagrams into Isabelle
theories and simplifies them. We evaluate our technique on several case
studies, most notably, an automotive fuel control system benchmark provided by
Toyota.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The National Basketball Association(NBA) has expanded their data gathering
and have heavily invested in new technologies to gather advanced performance
metrics on players. This expanded data set allows analysts to use unique
performance metrics in models to estimate and classify player performance.
Instead of grouping players together based on physical attributes and positions
played, analysts can group together players that play similar to each other
based on these tracked metrics. Existing methods for player classification have
typically used offensive metrics for clustering [1]. There have been attempts
to classify players using past defensive metrics, but the lack of quality
metrics has not produced promising results. The classifications presented in
the paper use newly introduced defensive metrics to find different defensive
positions for each player. Without knowing the number of categories that
players can be cast into, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be applied to find
the optimal number of clusters. In the model presented, five different
defensive player types can be identified.

 <dc:description>Comment: Methods provided in paper do not go into enough detail into how
  defensive formations are beneficial to teams. Needs more explanation behind
  formations</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Caching popular contents at base stations (BSs) of a heterogeneous cellular
network (HCN) avoids frequent information passage from content providers to the
network edge, thereby reducing latency and alleviating traffic congestion in
backhaul links. In general, the optimal strategies for content placement in
HCNs remain largely unknown and deriving them forms the theme of this paper. To
this end, we adopt the popular random HCN model where $K$ tiers of BSs are
modelled as independent Poisson point processes distributed in the plane with
different densities. Further, the random caching scheme is considered where
each of a given set of $M$ files with corresponding popularity measures is
placed at each BS of a particular tier with a corresponding probability, called
placement probability. The probabilities are identical for all BSs in the same
tier but vary over tiers, giving the name tier-level content placement. We
consider the network performance metric, hit probability, defined as the
probability that a file requested by the typical user is delivered successfully
to the user. We maximize the hit probability over content placement
probabilities, which yields the optimal tier-level placement policies. For the
case of uniform received signal-to-interference thresholds for successful
transmissions for BSs in different tiers, the policy is in closed-form where
the placement probability for a particular file is proportional to the
square-root of the corresponding popularity measure with an offset depending on
BS caching capacities. For the general case of non-uniform SIR thresholds, the
optimization problem is non-convex and a sub-optimal placement policy is
designed by approximation, which has a similar structure as in the case of
uniform SIR thresholds and shown by simulation to be close-to-optimal.

 <dc:description>  The performance of an iterative reconstruction algorithm for X-ray tomography
is strongly determined by the features of the used forward and backprojector.
For this reason, a large number of studies has focused on the to design of
projectors with increasingly higher accuracy and speed. To what extent the
accuracy of an iterative algorithm is affected by the mathematical affinity and
the similarity between the actual implementation of the forward and
backprojection, referred here as &quot;coupling projector-backprojector&quot;, has been
an overlooked aspect so far. The experimental study presented here shows that
the reconstruction quality and the convergence of an iterative algorithm
greatly rely on a good matching between the implementation of the tomographic
operators. In comparison, other aspects like the accuracy of the standalone
operators, the usage of physical constraints or the choice of stopping criteria
may even play a less relevant role.

 <dc:description>  Mahler equations relate evaluations of the same function $f$ at iterated
$b$th powers of the variable. They arise in particular in the study of
automatic sequences and in the complexity analysis of divide-and-conquer
algorithms. Recently, the problem of solving Mahler equations in closed form
has occurred in connection with number-theoretic questions. A difficulty in the
manipulation of Mahler equations is the exponential blow-up of degrees when
applying a Mahler operator to a polynomial. In this work, we present algorithms
for solving linear Mahler equations for series, polynomials, and rational
functions, and get polynomial-time complexity under a mild assumption.
Incidentally, we develop an algorithm for computing the gcrd of a family of
linear Mahler operators with nonzero constant terms.

 <dc:description>  We describe a general purpose algorithm for counting simple cycles and simple
paths of any length $\ell$ on a (weighted di)graph on $N$ vertices and $M$
edges, achieving a time complexity of
$O\left(N+M+\big(\ell^\omega+\ell\Delta\big) |S_\ell|\right)$. In this
expression, $|S_\ell|$ is the number of (weakly) connected induced subgraphs of
$G$ on at most $\ell$ vertices, $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of any vertex
and $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. We compare the algorithm
complexity both theoretically and experimentally with most of the existing
algorithms for the same task. These comparisons show that the algorithm
described here is the best general purpose algorithm for the class of graphs
where $(\ell^{\omega-1}\Delta^{-1}+1) |S_\ell|\leq |\text{Cycle}_\ell|$, with
$|\text{Cycle}_\ell|$ the total number of simple cycles of length at most
$\ell$, including backtracks and self-loops. On Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random
graphs, we find empirically that this happens when the edge probability is
larger than circa $4/N$. In addition, we show that some real-world networks
also belong to this class. Finally, the algorithm permits the enumeration of
simple cycles and simple paths on networks where vertices are labeled from an
alphabet on $n$ letters with a time complexity of
$O\left(N+M+\big(n^\ell\ell^\omega+\ell\Delta\big) |S_\ell|\right)$. A Matlab
implementation of the algorithm proposed here is available for download.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of robot navigation in simple maze-like
environments where the robot has to rely on its onboard sensors to perform the
navigation task. In particular, we are interested in solutions to this problem
that do not require localization, mapping or planning. Additionally, we require
that our solution can quickly adapt to new situations (e.g., changing
navigation goals and environments). To meet these criteria we frame this
problem as a sequence of related reinforcement learning tasks. We propose a
successor feature based deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn to
transfer knowledge from previously mastered navigation tasks to new problem
instances. Our algorithm substantially decreases the required learning time
after the first task instance has been solved, which makes it easily adaptable
to changing environments. We validate our method in both simulated and real
robot experiments with a Robotino and compare it to a set of baseline methods
including classical planning-based navigation.

 <dc:description>  We propose a quantum machine learning algorithm for efficiently solving a
class of problems encoded in quantum controlled unitary operations. The central
physical mechanism of the protocol is the iteration of a quantum time-delayed
equation that introduces feedback in the dynamics and eliminates the necessity
of intermediate measurements. The performance of the quantum algorithm is
analyzed by comparing the results obtained in numerical simulations with the
outcome of classical machine learning methods for the same problem. The use of
time-delayed equations enhances the toolbox of the field of quantum machine
learning, which may enable unprecedented applications in quantum technologies.

 <dc:description>  Cell formation is a critical step in the design of cellular manufacturing
systems. Recently, it was tackled using a cut-based-graph-partitioning model.
This model meets real-life production systems requirements as it uses the
actual amount of product flows, it looks for the suitable number of cells, and
it takes into account the natural constraints such as operation sequences,
maximum cell size, cohabitation and non-cohabitation constraints. Based on this
model, we propose an original encoding representation to solve the problem by
using a genetic algorithm. We discuss the performance of this new GA in
comparison to some approaches taken from the literature on a set of medium
sized instances. Given the results we obtained, it is reasonable to assume that
the new GA will provide similar results for large real-life problems. Keywords:
Group Technology, Manufacturing Cell Formation, Graph Partitioning, Graph Cuts,

 <dc:title>A Distributed Algorithm for Throughput Optimal Routing in Overlay
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rai, Anurag</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of optimal routing in overlay networks. An overlay
network is constructed by adding new overlay nodes on top of a legacy network.
The overlay nodes are capable of implementing any dynamic routing policy,
however, the legacy underlay has a fixed, single path routing scheme and uses a
simple work-conserving forwarding policy. Moreover, the underlay routes are
pre-determined and unknown to the overlay network. The overlay network can
increase the achievable throughput of the underlay by using multiple routes,
which consist of direct routes and indirect routes through other overlay nodes.
We develop a throughput optimal dynamic routing algorithm for such overlay
networks called the Optimal Overlay Routing Policy (OORP).
  OORP is derived using the classical dual subgradient descent method, and it
can be implemented in a distributed manner. We show that the underlay
queue-lengths can be used as a substitute for the dual variables. We also
propose various schemes to gather the information about the underlay that is
required by OORP and compare their performance via extensive simulations.

 <dc:description>  The algorithmic small-world phenomenon, empirically established by Milgram's
letter forwarding experiments from the 60s, was theoretically explained by
Kleinberg in 2000. However, from today's perspective his model has several
severe shortcomings that limit the applicability to real-world networks. In
order to give a more convincing explanation of the algorithmic small-world
phenomenon, we study decentralized greedy routing in a more flexible random
graph model (geometric inhomogeneous random graphs) which overcomes all
previous shortcomings. Apart from exhibiting good properties in theory, it has
also been extensively experimentally validated that this model reasonably
captures real-world networks.
  In this model, the greedy routing protocol is purely distributed as each
vertex only needs to know information about its direct neighbors. We prove that
it succeeds with constant probability, and in case of success almost surely
finds an almost shortest path of length {\theta}(loglog n), where our bound is
tight including the leading constant. Moreover, we study natural local patching
methods which augment greedy routing by backtracking and which do not require
any global knowledge. We show that such methods can ensure success probability
1 in an asymptotically tight number of steps.
  These results also address the question of Krioukov et al. whether there are
efficient local routing protocols for the internet graph. There were promising
experimental studies, but the question remained unsolved theoretically. Our
results give for the first time a rigorous and analytical affirmative answer.

 <dc:description>  Frameworks, such as MapReduce and Hadoop are abundant nowadays. They seek to
reap benefits of parallelization, albeit subject to a synchronization
constraint at the output. Fork-Join (FJ) queuing models are used to analyze
such systems. Arriving jobs are split into tasks each of which is mapped to
exactly one server. A job leaves the system when all of its tasks are executed.
  As a metric of performance, we consider waiting times for both
work-conserving and non-work conserving server systems under a mathematical
set-up general enough to take into account possible phase-type behavior of the
servers, and as suggested by recent evidences, bursty arrivals.
  To this end, we present a Markov-additive process framework for an FJ system
and provide computable bounds on tail probabilities of steady-state waiting
times, for both types of servers separately. We apply our results to three
scenarios, namely, non-renewal (Markov-modulated) arrivals, servers showing
phase-type behavior, and Markov-modulated arrivals and services. We compare our
bounds against estimates obtained through simulations and also provide a
theoretical conceptualization of provisions in FJ systems. Finally, we
calibrate our model with real data traces, and illustrate how our bounds can be
used to devise provisions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the last decade we have witnessed a rapid growth in data center systems,
requiring new and highly complex networking devices. The need to refresh
networking infrastructure whenever new protocols or functions are introduced,
and the increasing costs that this entails, are of a concern to all data center
providers. New generations of Systems on Chip (SoC), integrating
microprocessors and higher bandwidth interfaces, are an emerging solution to
this problem. These devices permit entirely new systems and architectures that
can obviate the replacement of existing networking devices while enabling
seamless functionality change. In this work, we explore open source, RISC
based, SoC architectures with high performance networking capabilities. The
prototype architectures are implemented on the NetFPGA-SUME platform. Beyond
details of the architecture, we also describe the hardware implementation and
the porting of operating systems to the platform. The platform can be exploited
for the development of practical networking appliances, and we provide use case
examples.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of securely estimating the states of an unstable
dynamical system subject to nonstochastic disturbances. The estimator obtains
all its information through an uncertain channel which is subject to
nonstochastic disturbances as well, and an eavesdropper obtains a disturbed
version of the channel inputs through a second uncertain channel. An encoder
observes and block-encodes the states in such a way that, upon sending the
generated codeword, the estimator's error is bounded and such that a security
criterion is satisfied ensuring that the eavesdropper obtains as little state
information as possible. Two security criteria are considered and discussed
with the help of a numerical example. A sufficient condition on the uncertain
wiretap channel, i.e., the pair formed by the uncertain channel from encoder to
estimator and the uncertain channel from encoder to eavesdropper, is derived
which ensures that a bounded estimation error and security are achieved. This
condition is also shown to be necessary for a subclass of uncertain wiretap
channels. To formulate the condition, the zero-error secrecy capacity of
uncertain wiretap channels is introduced, i.e., the maximal rate at which data
can be transmitted from the encoder to the estimator in such a way that the
eavesdropper is unable to reconstruct the transmitted data. Lastly, the
zero-error secrecy capacity of uncertain wiretap channels is studied.

 <dc:description>  Abstraction without regret refers to the vision of using high-level
programming languages for systems development without experiencing a negative
impact on performance. A database system designed according to this vision
offers both increased productivity and high performance, instead of sacrificing
the former for the latter as is the case with existing, monolithic
implementations that are hard to maintain and extend. In this article, we
realize this vision in the domain of analytical query processing. We present
LegoBase, a query engine written in the high-level language Scala. The key
technique to regain efficiency is to apply generative programming: LegoBase
performs source-to-source compilation and optimizes the entire query engine by
converting the high-level Scala code to specialized, low-level C code. We show
how generative programming allows to easily implement a wide spectrum of
optimizations, such as introducing data partitioning or switching from a row to
a column data layout, which are difficult to achieve with existing low-level
query compilers that handle only queries. We demonstrate that sufficiently
powerful abstractions are essential for dealing with the complexity of the
optimization effort, shielding developers from compiler internals and
decoupling individual optimizations from each other. We evaluate our approach
with the TPC-H benchmark and show that: (a) With all optimizations enabled,
LegoBase significantly outperforms a commercial database and an existing query
compiler. (b) Programmers need to provide just a few hundred lines of
high-level code for implementing the optimizations, instead of complicated
low-level code that is required by existing query compilation approaches. (c)
The compilation overhead is low compared to the overall execution time, thus
making our approach usable in practice for compiling query engines.

 <dc:description>  We examine a generalised Randomised Response (RR) technique in the context of
differential privacy and examine the optimality of such mechanisms. Strict and
relaxed differential privacy are considered for binary outputs. By examining
the error of a statistical estimator, we present closed solutions for the
optimal mechanism(s) in both cases. The optimal mechanism is also given for the
specific case of the original RR technique as introduced by Warner in 1965.

 <dc:description>  Many neural networks exhibit stability in their activation patterns over time
in response to inputs from sensors operating under real-world conditions. By
capitalizing on this property of natural signals, we propose a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) architecture called a delta network in which each neuron
transmits its value only when the change in its activation exceeds a threshold.
The execution of RNNs as delta networks is attractive because their states must
be stored and fetched at every timestep, unlike in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). We show that a naive run-time delta network implementation
offers modest improvements on the number of memory accesses and computes, but
optimized training techniques confer higher accuracy at higher speedup. With
these optimizations, we demonstrate a 9X reduction in cost with negligible loss
of accuracy for the TIDIGITS audio digit recognition benchmark. Similarly, on
the large Wall Street Journal speech recognition benchmark even existing
networks can be greatly accelerated as delta networks, and a 5.7x improvement
with negligible loss of accuracy can be obtained through training. Finally, on
an end-to-end CNN trained for steering angle prediction in a driving dataset,
the RNN cost can be reduced by a substantial 100X.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for constructing efficient code-based encryption
schemes from codes that do not hide any structure in their public matrix. The
framework is in the spirit of the schemes first proposed by Alekhnovich in 2003
and based on the difficulty of decoding random linear codes from random errors
of low weight. We depart somewhat from Aleknovich's approach and propose an
encryption scheme based on the difficulty of decoding random quasi-cyclic
codes. We propose two new cryptosystems instantiated within our framework: the
Hamming Quasi-Cyclic cryptosystem (HQC), based on the Hamming metric, and the
Rank Quasi-Cyclic cryptosystem (RQC), based on the rank metric. We give a
security proof, which reduces the IND-CPA security of our systems to a
decisional version of the well known problem of decoding random families of
quasi-cyclic codes for the Hamming and rank metrics (the respective QCSD and
RQCSD problems). We also provide an analysis of the decryption failure
probability of our scheme in the Hamming metric case: for the rank metric there
is no decryption failure. Our schemes benefit from a very fast decryption
algorithm together with small key sizes of only a few thousand bits. The
cryptosystems are very efficient for low encryption rates and are very well
suited to key exchange and authentication. Asymptotically, for \lambda the
security parameter, the public key sizes are respectively in $O(\lambda^{2})$
for HQC and in $O(\lambda^{4/3})$ for RQC. Practical parameter compares well to
systems based on ring-LPN or the recent MDPC system.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a sampling-based planning and optimal control
method of nonlinear systems under non-differentiable constraints. Motivated by
developing scalable planning algorithms, we consider the optimal motion plan to
be a feedback controller that can be approximated by a weighted sum of given
bases. Given this approximate optimal control formulation, our main
contribution is to introduce importance sampling, specifically, model-reference
adaptive search algorithm, to iteratively compute the optimal weight
parameters, i.e., the weights corresponding to the optimal policy function
approximation given chosen bases. The key idea is to perform the search by
iteratively estimating a parametrized distribution which converges to a Dirac's
Delta that infinitely peaks on the global optimal weights. Then, using this
direct policy search, we incorporated trajectory-based verification to ensure
that, for a class of nonlinear systems, the obtained policy is not only optimal
but robust to bounded disturbances. The correctness and efficiency of the
methods are demonstrated through numerical experiments including linear systems
with a nonlinear cost function and motion planning for a Dubins car.

 <dc:description>  An ongoing challenge in neuromorphic computing is to devise general and
computationally efficient models of inference and learning which are compatible
with the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. One increasingly
popular and successful approach is to take inspiration from inference and
learning algorithms used in deep neural networks. However, the workhorse of
deep learning, the gradient descent Back Propagation (BP) rule, often relies on
the immediate availability of network-wide information stored with
high-precision memory, and precise operations that are difficult to realize in
neuromorphic hardware. Remarkably, recent work showed that exact backpropagated
weights are not essential for learning deep representations. Random BP replaces
feedback weights with random ones and encourages the network to adjust its
feed-forward weights to learn pseudo-inverses of the (random) feedback weights.
Building on these results, we demonstrate an event-driven random BP (eRBP) rule
that uses an error-modulated synaptic plasticity for learning deep
representations in neuromorphic computing hardware. The rule requires only one
addition and two comparisons for each synaptic weight using a two-compartment
leaky Integrate &amp; Fire (I&amp;F) neuron, making it very suitable for implementation
in digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Our results show that using
eRBP, deep representations are rapidly learned, achieving nearly identical
classification accuracies compared to artificial neural network simulations on
GPUs, while being robust to neural and synaptic state quantizations during
learning.

 <dc:description>  Identifying and interpreting fetal standard scan planes during 2D ultrasound
mid-pregnancy examinations are highly complex tasks which require years of
training. Apart from guiding the probe to the correct location, it can be
equally difficult for a non-expert to identify relevant structures within the
image. Automatic image processing can provide tools to help experienced as well
as inexperienced operators with these tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel
method based on convolutional neural networks which can automatically detect 13
fetal standard views in freehand 2D ultrasound data as well as provide a
localisation of the fetal structures via a bounding box. An important
contribution is that the network learns to localise the target anatomy using
weak supervision based on image-level labels only. The network architecture is
designed to operate in real-time while providing optimal output for the
localisation task. We present results for real-time annotation, retrospective
frame retrieval from saved videos, and localisation on a very large and
challenging dataset consisting of images and video recordings of full clinical
anomaly screenings. We found that the proposed method achieved an average
F1-score of 0.798 in a realistic classification experiment modelling real-time
detection, and obtained a 90.09% accuracy for retrospective frame retrieval.
Moreover, an accuracy of 77.8% was achieved on the localisation task.

 <dc:description>  We consider a family of quantum spin systems which includes as special cases
the ferromagnetic XY model and ferromagnetic Ising model on any graph, with or
without a transverse magnetic field. We prove that the partition function of
any model in this family can be efficiently approximated to a given relative
error E using a classical randomized algorithm with runtime polynomial in 1/E,
system size, and inverse temperature. As a consequence we obtain a polynomial
time algorithm which approximates the free energy or ground energy to a given
additive error. We first show how to approximate the partition function by the
perfect matching sum of a finite graph with positive edge weights. Although the
perfect matching sum is not known to be efficiently approximable in general,
the graphs obtained by our method have a special structure which facilitates
efficient approximation via a randomized algorithm due to Jerrum and Sinclair.

particularly propose to construct public key cryptosystems based on the

properties provides fast and easy implementation and makes these systems
resistant to attacks like the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm. The only negative point
is that storing and transmitting permutations need large memory. Using together
the hyperoctahedral enumeration system and what is called subexceedant
functions, we define a one-to-one correspondance between natural numbers and
signed permutations with which we label the message units.

 <dc:title>Approximating Approximate Distance Oracles</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dinitz, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Zeyu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a finite metric space $(V,d)$, an approximate distance oracle is a data
structure which, when queried on two points $u,v \in V$, returns an
approximation to the the actual distance between $u$ and $v$ which is within
some bounded stretch factor of the true distance. There has been significant
work on the tradeoff between the important parameters of approximate distance
oracles (and in particular between the size, stretch, and query time), but in
this paper we take a different point of view, that of per-instance
optimization. If we are given an particular input metric space and stretch
bound, can we find the smallest possible approximate distance oracle for that
particular input? Since this question is not even well-defined, we restrict our
attention to well-known classes of approximate distance oracles, and study
whether we can optimize over those classes.
  In particular, we give an $O(\log n)$-approximation to the problem of finding
the smallest stretch $3$ Thorup-Zwick distance oracle, as well as the problem
of finding the smallest P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu-Roditty distance oracle. We also prove
a matching $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound for both problems, and an
$\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}})$ integrality gap for the more
general stretch $(2k-1)$ Thorup-Zwick distance oracle. We also consider the
problem of approximating the best TZ or PR approximate distance oracle
\emph{with outliers}, and show that more advanced techniques (SDP relaxations
in particular) allow us to optimize even in the presence of outliers.

 <dc:description>  Water is a crucial pre-requisite for all human activities. Due to growing
demand from population and shrinking supply of potable water, there is an
urgent need to use computational methods to manage available water
intelligently, and especially in developing countries like India where even
basic data to track water availability or physical infrastructure to process
water are inadequate. In this context, we present a dataset of water pollution
containing quantitative and qualitative data from a combination for modalities
- real-time sensors, lab results, and estimates from people using mobile apps.
The data on our API-accessible cloud platform covers more than 60 locations and
consists of both what we have ourselves collected from multiple location
following a novel process, and from others (lab-results) which were open but
hither-to difficult to access. Further, we discuss an application of released
data to understand spatio-temporal pollution impact of a large event with
hundreds of millions of people converging on a river during a religious
gathering (Ardh Khumbh 2016) spread over months. Such unprecedented details can
help authorities manage an ongoing event or plan for future ones. The community
can use the data for any application and also contribute new data to the
platform.

 <dc:title>Models, networks and algorithmic complexity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ruffini, Giulio</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  I aim to show that models, classification or generating functions,
invariances and datasets are algorithmically equivalent concepts once properly
defined, and provide some concrete examples of them. I then show that a) neural
networks (NNs) of different kinds can be seen to implement models, b) that
perturbations of inputs and nodes in NNs trained to optimally implement simple
models propagate strongly, c) that there is a framework in which recurrent,
deep and shallow networks can be seen to fall into a descriptive power
hierarchy in agreement with notions from the theory of recursive functions. The
motivation for these definitions and following analysis lies in the context of
cognitive neuroscience, and in particular in Ruffini (2016), where the concept
of model is used extensively, as is the concept of algorithmic complexity.

 <dc:description>  A softmax operator applied to a set of values acts somewhat like the
maximization function and somewhat like an average. In sequential decision
making, softmax is often used in settings where it is necessary to maximize
utility but also to hedge against problems that arise from putting all of one's
weight behind a single maximum utility decision. The Boltzmann softmax operator
is the most commonly used softmax operator in this setting, but we show that
this operator is prone to misbehavior. In this work, we study a differentiable
softmax operator that, among other properties, is a non-expansion ensuring a
convergent behavior in learning and planning. We introduce a variant of SARSA
algorithm that, by utilizing the new operator, computes a Boltzmann policy with
a state-dependent temperature parameter. We show that the algorithm is
convergent and that it performs favorably in practice.

 <dc:description>  Cloud Computing is a paradigm of both parallel processing and distributed
computing. It offers computing facilities as a utility service in pay as par
use manner. Virtualization, self service provisioning, elasticity and pay per
use are the key features of Cloud Computing. It provides different types of
resources over the Internet to perform user submitted tasks. In cloud
environment, huge number of tasks are executed simultaneously, an effective
Task Scheduling is required to gain better performance of the cloud system.
Various Cloud Based Task Scheduling algorithms are available that schedule the
task of user to resources for execution. Due to the novelty of Cloud Computing,
traditional scheduling algorithms cannot satisfy the needs of cloud , the
researchers are trying to modify traditional algorithms that can fulfill the
cloud requirements like rapid elasticity, resource pooling and on demand self
service. In this paper the current state of Task Scheduling algorithms has been
discussed and compared on the basis of various scheduling parameters like
execution time, throughput, make span, resource utilization, quality of
service, energy consumption, response time and cost.

 <dc:description>  Ordered (key-value) maps are an important and widely-used data structure for
large-scale data processing frameworks. Beyond simple search, insertion and
deletion, more advanced operations such as range extraction, filtering, and
bulk updates form a critical part of these frameworks.
  We describe an interface for ordered maps that is augmented to support fast
range queries and sums, and introduce a parallel and concurrent library called
PAM (Parallel Augmented Maps) that implements the interface. The interface
includes a wide variety of functions on augmented maps ranging from basic
insertion and deletion to more interesting functions such as union,
intersection, filtering, extracting ranges, splitting, and range-sums. We
describe algorithms for these functions that are efficient both in theory and
practice.
  As examples of the use of the interface and the performance of PAM we apply
the library to four applications: simple range sums, interval trees, 2D range
trees, and word index searching. The interface greatly simplifies the
implementation of these data structures over direct implementations.
Sequentially the code achieves performance that matches or exceeds exiting
libraries designed specially for a single application, and in parallel our
implementation gets speedups ranging from 40 to 90 on 72 cores with 2-way
hyperthreading.

 <dc:description>  Software deobfuscation is a crucial activity in security analysis and
especially, in malware analysis. While standard static and dynamic approaches
suffer from well-known shortcomings, Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) has
recently been proposed has an interesting alternative, more robust than static
analysis and more complete than dynamic analysis. Yet, DSE addresses certain
kinds of questions encountered by a reverser namely feasibility questions. Many
issues arising during reverse, e.g. detecting protection schemes such as opaque
predicates fall into the category of infeasibility questions. In this article,
we present the Backward-Bounded DSE, a generic, precise, efficient and robust
method for solving infeasibility questions. We demonstrate the benefit of the
method for opaque predicates and call stack tampering, and give some insight
for its usage for some other protection schemes. Especially, the technique has
successfully been used on state-of-the-art packers as well as on the
government-grade X-Tunnel malware -- allowing its entire deobfuscation.
Backward-Bounded DSE does not supersede existing DSE approaches, but rather
complements them by addressing infeasibility questions in a scalable and
precise manner. Following this line, we propose sparse disassembly, a
combination of Backward-Bounded DSE and static disassembly able to enlarge
dynamic disassembly in a guaranteed way, hence getting the best of dynamic and
static disassembly. This work paves the way for robust, efficient and precise
disassembly tools for heavily-obfuscated binaries.

 <dc:title>Canonical Duality Theory for Topology Optimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gao, David Yang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a canonical duality approach for solving a general
topology optimization problem of nonlinear elastic structures. By using finite
element method, this most challenging problem can be formulated as a mixed
integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP), i.e. for a given deformation,
the first-level optimization is a typical linear constrained 0-1 programming
problem, while for a given structure, the second-level optimization is a
general nonlinear continuous minimization problem in computational nonlinear
elasticity. It is discovered that for linear elastic structures, first-level
optimization is a typical Knapsack problem, which is considered to be
NP-complete in computer science. However, by using canonical duality theory,
this well-known problem can be solved analytically to obtain exact integer
solution. A perturbed canonical dual algorithm (CDT) is proposed and
illustrated by benchmark problems in topology optimization. Numerical results
show that the proposed CDT method produces desired optimal structure without
any gray elements. The checkerboard issue in traditional methods is much
reduced.

 <dc:description>  Despite widespread interests in reinforcement-learning for task-oriented
dialogue systems, several obstacles can frustrate research and development
progress. First, reinforcement learners typically require interaction with the
environment, so conventional dialogue corpora cannot be used directly. Second,
each task presents specific challenges, requiring separate corpus of
task-specific annotated data. Third, collecting and annotating human-machine or
human-human conversations for task-oriented dialogues requires extensive domain
knowledge. Because building an appropriate dataset can be both financially
costly and time-consuming, one popular approach is to build a user simulator
based upon a corpus of example dialogues. Then, one can train reinforcement
learning agents in an online fashion as they interact with the simulator.
Dialogue agents trained on these simulators can serve as an effective starting
point. Once agents master the simulator, they may be deployed in a real
environment to interact with humans, and continue to be trained online. To ease
empirical algorithmic comparisons in dialogues, this paper introduces a new,
publicly available simulation framework, where our simulator, designed for the
movie-booking domain, leverages both rules and collected data. The simulator
supports two tasks: movie ticket booking and movie seeking. Finally, we
demonstrate several agents and detail the procedure to add and test your own
agent in the proposed framework.

 <dc:description>  We study the TAPF (combined target-assignment and path-finding) problem for
teams of agents in known terrain, which generalizes both the anonymous and
non-anonymous multi-agent path-finding problems. Each of the teams is given the
same number of targets as there are agents in the team. Each agent has to move
to exactly one target given to its team such that all targets are visited. The
TAPF problem is to first assign agents to targets and then plan collision-free
paths for the agents to their targets in a way such that the makespan is
minimized. We present the CBM (Conflict-Based Min-Cost-Flow) algorithm, a
hierarchical algorithm that solves TAPF instances optimally by combining ideas
from anonymous and non-anonymous multi-agent path-finding algorithms. On the
low level, CBM uses a min-cost max-flow algorithm on a time-expanded network to
assign all agents in a single team to targets and plan their paths. On the high
level, CBM uses conflict-based search to resolve collisions among agents in
different teams. Theoretically, we prove that CBM is correct, complete and
optimal. Experimentally, we show the scalability of CBM to TAPF instances with
dozens of teams and hundreds of agents and adapt it to a simulated warehouse
system.

 <dc:description>  We investigate whether quantum annealers with select chip layouts can
outperform classical computers in reinforcement learning tasks. We associate a
transverse field Ising spin Hamiltonian with a layout of qubits similar to that
of a deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) and use simulated quantum annealing (SQA) to
numerically simulate quantum sampling from this system. We design a
reinforcement learning algorithm in which the set of visible nodes representing
the states and actions of an optimal policy are the first and last layers of
the deep network. In absence of a transverse field, our simulations show that
DBMs train more effectively than restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) with the
same number of weights. Since sampling from Boltzmann distributions of a DBM is
not classically feasible, this is evidence of advantage of a non-Turing
sampling oracle. We then develop a framework for training the network as a
quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM) in the presence of a significant transverse
field for reinforcement learning. This further improves the reinforcement
learning method using DBMs.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies dynamic spectrum leasing in a cognitive radio network.
There are two spectrum sellers, who are two primary networks, each with an
amount of licensed spectrum bandwidth. When a seller has some unused spectrum,
it would like to lease the unused spectrum to secondary users. A coordinator
helps to perform the spectrum leasing stage-by-stage. As the two sellers may
have different leasing period, there are three epochs, in which seller 1 has
spectrum to lease in Epochs II and III, while seller 2 has spectrum to lease in
Epochs I and II. Each seller needs to decide how much spectrum it should lease
to secondary users in each stage of its leasing period, with a target at
revenue maximization. It is shown that, when the two sellers both have spectrum
to lease (i.e., in Epoch II), the spectrum leasing can be formulated as a
non-cooperative game. Nash equilibria of the game are found in closed form.
Solutions of the two users in the three epochs are derived.

 <dc:description>  Deep nonlinear models pose a challenge for fitting parameters due to lack of
knowledge of the hidden layer and the potentially non-affine relation of the
initial and observed layers. In the present work we investigate the use of
information theoretic measures such as mutual information and Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence as objective functions for fitting such models without
knowledge of the hidden layer. We investigate one model as a proof of concept
and one application of cogntive performance. We further investigate the use of
optimizers with these methods. Mutual information is largely successful as an
objective, depending on the parameters. KL divergence is found to be similarly
succesful, given some knowledge of the statistics of the hidden layer.

 <dc:description>  Usage of mobile wireless Internet has grown very fast in recent years. This
radical change in availability of Internet has led to communication of big
amount of data over mobile networks and consequently new challenges and
opportunities for modeling of mobile Internet characteristics. While the
traditional approach toward network modeling suggests finding a generic traffic
model for the whole network, in this paper, we show that this approach does not
capture all the dynamics of big mobile networks and does not provide enough
accuracy. Our case study based on a big dataset including billions of netflow
records collected from a campus-wide wireless mobile network shows that user
interests acquired based on accessed domains and visited locations as well as
user behavioral groups have a significant impact on traffic characteristics of
big mobile networks. For this purpose, we utilize a novel graph-based approach
based on KS-test as well as a novel co-clustering technique. Our study shows
that interest-based modeling of big mobile networks can significantly improve
the accuracy and reduce the KS distance by factor of 5 comparing to the generic
approach.

 <dc:description>  Finger vein verification has developed a lot since its first proposal, but
there is still not a perfect algorithm. It is proved that algorithms with the
same overall accuracy may have different misclassified patterns. We could make
use of this complementation to fuse individual algorithms together for more
precise result. According to our observation, algorithm has different
confidence on its decisions but it is seldom considered in fusion methods. Our
work is first to define decision reliability ratio to quantify this confidence,
and then propose the Maximum Decision Reliability Ratio (MDRR) fusion method
incorporating Weighted Voting. Experiment conducted on a data set of 1000
fingers and 5 images per finger proves the effectiveness of the method. The
classifier obtained by MDRR method gets an accuracy of 99.42% while the maximum
accuracy of the original individual classifiers is 97.77%. The experiment
results also show the MDRR outperforms the traditional fusion methods as
Voting, Weighted Voting, Sum and Weighted Sum.

 <dc:title>Sparsity-Cognizant Multiple-Access Schemes for Large Wireless Networks
  With Node Buffers</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes efficient multiple-access schemes for large wireless
networks based on the transmitters' buffer state information and their
transceivers' duplex transmission capability. First, we investigate the case of
half-duplex nodes where a node can either transmit or receive in a given time
instant. The network is said to be naturally sparse if the number of
nonempty-queue transmitters in a given frame is much smaller than the number of
users, which is the case when the arrival rates to the queues are very small
and the number of users is large. If the network is not naturally sparse, we
design the user requests to be sparse such that only few requests are sent to
the destination. We refer to the detected nonempty-queue transmitters in a
given frame as frame owners. Our design goal is to minimize the nodes' total
transmit power in a given frame. In the case of unslotted-time data
transmission, the optimization problem is shown to be a convex optimization
program. We propose an approximate formulation to simplify the problem and
obtain a closed-form expression for the assigned time durations to the nodes.
The solution of the approximate optimization problem demonstrates that the time
duration assigned to a node in the set of frame owners is the ratio of the
square-root of the buffer occupancy of that node to the sum of the square-roots
of each occupancy of all the frame owners. We then investigate the slotted-time
data transmission scenario, where the time durations assigned for data
transmission are slotted. In addition, we show that the full-duplex capability
of a node increases the data transmission portion of the frame and enables a
distributed implementation of the proposed schemes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a robust image enhancement algorithm dedicated for muscle fiber
specimen images captured by optical microscopes. Blur or out of focus problems
are prevalent in muscle images during the image acquisition stage. Traditional
image deconvolution methods do not work since they assume the blur kernels are
known and also produce ring artifacts. We provide a compact framework which
involves a novel spatially non-uniform blind deblurring approach specialized to
muscle images which automatically detects and alleviates degraded regions. Ring
artifacts problems are addressed and a kernel propagation strategy is proposed
to speedup the algorithm and deals with the high non-uniformity of the blur
kernels on muscle images. Experiments show that the proposed framework performs
well on muscle images taken with modern advanced optical microscopes. Our
framework is free of laborious parameter settings and is computationally
efficient.

 <dc:description>  The increasing availability of implicit feedback datasets has raised the
interest in developing effective collaborative filtering techniques able to
deal asymmetrically with unambiguous positive feedback and ambiguous negative
feedback. In this paper, we propose a principled kernel-based collaborative
filtering method for top-N item recommendation with implicit feedback. We
present an efficient implementation using the linear kernel, and we show how to
generalize it to kernels of the dot product family preserving the efficiency.
We also investigate on the elements which influence the sparsity of a standard
cosine kernel. This analysis shows that the sparsity of the kernel strongly
depends on the properties of the dataset, in particular on the long tail
distribution. We compare our method with state-of-the-art algorithms achieving
good results both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a Wide Learning architecture is proposed that attempts to
automate the feature engineering portion of the machine learning (ML) pipeline.
Feature engineering is widely considered as the most time consuming and expert
knowledge demanding portion of any ML task. The proposed feature recommendation
approach is tested on 3 healthcare datasets: a) PhysioNet Challenge 2016
dataset of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, b) MIMIC II blood pressure
classification dataset of photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and c) an emotion
classification dataset of PPG signals. While the proposed method beats the
state of the art techniques for 2nd and 3rd dataset, it reaches 94.38% of the
accuracy level of the winner of PhysioNet Challenge 2016. In all cases, the
effort to reach a satisfactory performance was drastically less (a few days)
than manual feature engineering.

 <dc:description>  We extend the notion of a strong backdoor from the CSP setting to the Valued
CSP setting (VCSP, for short). This provides a means for augmenting a class of
tractable VCSP instances to instances that are outside the class but of small
distance to the class, where the distance is measured in terms of the size of a
smallest backdoor. We establish that VCSP is fixed-parameter tractable when
parameterized by the size of a smallest backdoor into every tractable class of
VCSP instances characterized by a (possibly infinite) tractable valued
constraint language of finite arity and finite domain. We further extend this
fixed-parameter tractability result to so-called &quot;scattered classes&quot; of VCSP
instances where each connected component may belong to a different tractable
class.

 <dc:description>  In this project we propose a new approach for emotion recognition using
web-based similarity (e.g. confidence, PMI and PMING). We aim to extract basic
emotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets,
captions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity
between each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological
model (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include:
text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine
automated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of
semantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The
main idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under
the assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search
engines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through
tags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions.
Training results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative
tests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g.
Kendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to
each single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a
deeper level of abstraction, aiming at recognizing specific emotions and not
only the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic
data.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we study the use of logistic regression in manufacturing
failures detection. As a data set for the analysis, we used the data from
Kaggle competition Bosch Production Line Performance. We considered the use of
machine learning, linear and Bayesian models. For machine learning approach, we
analyzed XGBoost tree based classifier to obtain high scored classification.
Using the generalized linear model for logistic regression makes it possible to
analyze the influence of the factors under study. The Bayesian approach for
logistic regression gives the statistical distribution for the parameters of
the model. It can be useful in the probabilistic analysis, e.g. risk
assessment.

 <dc:description>  Inter-relay interference (IRI) challenges the operation of two-path relaying
systems. Furthermore, the unavailability of the channel state information (CSI)
at the source and the limited detection capabilities at the relays prevent
neither eliminating the interference nor adopting joint detection at the relays
nodes. Improper signaling is a powerful signaling scheme that has the
capability to reduce the interference impact at the receiver side and improves
the achievable rate performance. Therefore, improper signaling is adopted at
both relays, which have access to the global CSI. Then, improper signal
characteristics are designed to maximize the total end-to-end achievable rate
at the relays. To this end, both the power and the circularity coefficient, a
measure of the impropriety degree of the signal, are optimized at the relays.
Although the optimization problem is not convex, optimal power allocation for
both relays for a fixed circularity coefficient is obtained. Moreover, the
circularity coefficient is tuned to maximize the rate for a given power
allocation. Finally, a joint solution of the optimization problem is proposed
using a coordinate descent method based on alternate optimization. The
simulation results show that employing improper signaling improves the
achievable rate at medium and high IRI.

environments where humans are actively engaged in tasks (e.g., sandwich making
and playing the video games). In this paper, we leverage Reinforcement Learning
(RL) to highlight task-relevant locations of input frames. We propose a soft
attention mechanism combined with the Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to teach an RL
agent how to play a game and where to look by focusing on the most pertinent
parts of its visual input. Our evaluations on several Atari 2600 games show
that the soft attention based model could predict fixation locations
significantly better than bottom-up models such as Itti-Kochs saliency and
Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) models.

 <dc:title>Kleinberg's Grid Reloaded</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the key features of small-worlds is the ability to route messages with
few hops only using local knowledge of the topology. In 2000, Kleinberg
proposed a model based on an augmented grid that asymptotically exhibits such
property. In this paper, we propose to revisit the original model from a
simulation-based perspective. Our approach is fueled by a new algorithm that
uses dynamic rejection sampling to draw augmenting links. The speed gain
offered by the algorithm enables a detailed numerical evaluation. We show for
example that in practice, the augmented scheme proposed by Kleinberg is more
robust than predicted by the asymptotic behavior, even for very large finite
grids. We also propose tighter bounds on the performance of Kleinberg's routing
algorithm. At last, we show that fed with realistic parameters, the model gives
results in line with real-life experiments.

 <dc:title>Fast Matrix Multiplication and Symbolic Computation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The complexity of matrix multiplication (hereafter MM) has been intensively
studied since 1969, when Strassen surprisingly decreased the exponent 3 in the
cubic cost of the straightforward classical MM to log 2 (7) $\approx$ 2.8074.
Applications to some fundamental problems of Linear Algebra and Computer
Science have been immediately recognized, but the researchers in Computer
Algebra keep discovering more and more applications even today, with no sign of
slowdown. We survey the unfinished history of decreasing the exponent towards
its information lower bound 2, recall some important techniques discovered in
this process and linked to other fields of computing, reveal sample surprising
applications to fast computation of the inner products of two vectors and
summation of integers, and discuss the curse of recursion, which separates the
progress in fast MM into its most acclaimed and purely theoretical part and
into valuable acceleration of MM of feasible sizes. Then, in the second part of
our paper, we cover fast MM in realistic symbolic computations and discuss
applications and implementation of fast exact matrix multiplication. We first
review how most of exact linear algebra can be reduced to matrix multiplication
over small finite fields. Then we highlight the differences in the design of
approximate and exact implementations of fast MM, taking into account nowadays
processor and memory hierarchies. In the concluding section we comment on
current perspectives of the study of fast MM.

 <dc:description>  We consider systems made of autonomous mobile robots evolving in highly
dynamic discrete environment i.e., graphs where edges may appear and disappear
unpredictably without any recurrence, stability, nor periodicity assumption.
Robots are uniform (they execute the same algorithm), they are anonymous (they
are devoid of any observable ID), they have no means allowing them to
communicate together, they share no common sense of direction, and they have no
global knowledge related to the size of the environment. However, each of them
is endowed with persistent memory and is able to detect whether it stands alone
at its current location. A highly dynamic environment is modeled by a graph
such that its topology keeps continuously changing over time. In this paper, we
consider only dynamic graphs in which nodes are anonymous, each of them is
infinitely often reachable from any other one, and such that its underlying
graph (i.e., the static graph made of the same set of nodes and that includes
all edges that are present at least once over time) forms a ring of arbitrary
size. In this context, we consider the fundamental problem of perpetual
exploration: each node is required to be infinitely often visited by a robot.
This paper analyzes the computability of this problem in (fully) synchronous
settings, i.e., we study the deterministic solvability of the problem with
respect to the number of robots. We provide three algorithms and two
impossibility results that characterize, for any ring size, the necessary and
sufficient number of robots to perform perpetual exploration of highly dynamic
rings.

 <dc:description>  Octal games are a well-defined family of two-player games played on heaps of
counters, in which the players remove alternately a certain number of counters
from a heap, sometimes being allowed to split a heap into two nonempty heaps,
until no counter can be removed anymore. We extend the definition of octal
games to play them on graphs: heaps are replaced by connected components and
counters by vertices. Thus, an octal game on a path $P\_n$ is equivalent to
playing the same octal game on a heap of $n$ counters. We study one of the
simplest octal games, called 0.33, in which the players can remove one vertex
or two adjacent vertices without disconnecting the graph. We study this game on
trees and give a complete resolution of this game on subdivided stars and
bistars.

 <dc:title>FPA-Debug: Effective Statistical Fault Localization Considering
  Fault-proneness Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The aim is to identify faulty predicates which have strong effect on program
failure. Statistical debugging techniques are amongst best methods for
pinpointing defects within the program source code. However, they have some
drawbacks. They require a large number of executions to identify faults, they
might be adversely affected by coincidental correctness, and they do not take
into consideration fault-proneness associated with different parts of the
program code while constructing behavioral models. Additionally, they do not
consider the simultaneous impact of predicates on program termination status.
To deal with mentioned problems, a new fault-proneness-aware approach based on
elastic net regression, namely FPA-Debug has been proposed in this paper.
FPA-Debug employs a clustering-based strategy to alleviate coincidental
correctness in fault localization and finds the smallest effective subset of
program predicates known as bug predictors. Moreover, the approach considers
fault-proneness of code during statistical modeling through applying different
regularization parameter to each program predicates depending on its location
within program source code. The experimental results on well-known test suite,
Siemens, reveal the effectiveness and accuracy of the FPA-Debug.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge bases such as Wikidata, DBpedia, or YAGO contain millions of
entities and facts. In some knowledge bases, the correctness of these facts has
been evaluated. However, much less is known about their completeness, i.e., the
proportion of real facts that the knowledge bases cover. In this work, we
investigate different signals to identify the areas where a knowledge base is
complete. We show that we can combine these signals in a rule mining approach,
which allows us to predict where facts may be missing. We also show that
completeness predictions can help other applications such as fact prediction.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of simultaneous 2-D room shape
reconstruction and self-localization without the requirement of any
pre-established infrastructure. A mobile device equipped with co-located
microphone and loudspeaker as well as internal motion sensors is used to emit
acoustic pulses and collect echoes reflected by the walls. Using only first
order echoes, room shape recovery and self-localization is feasible when
auxiliary information is obtained using motion sensors. In particular, it is
established that using echoes collected at three measurement locations and the
two distances between consecutive measurement points, unique localization and
mapping can be achieved provided that the three measurement points are not
collinear. Practical algorithms for room shape reconstruction and
self-localization in the presence of noise and higher order echoes are proposed
along with experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Faecal Calprotectin (FC) is a surrogate marker for intestinal inflammation,
termed Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), but not for cancer. In this
retrospective study of 804 patients, an enhanced benchmark predictive model for
analyzing FC is developed, based on a novel state-of-the-art Echo State Network
(ESN), an advanced dynamic recurrent neural network which implements a
biologically plausible architecture, and a supervised learning mechanism. The
proposed machine learning driven predictive model is benchmarked against a
conventional logistic regression model, demonstrating statistically significant

 <dc:title>iDroop: A dynamic droop controller to decouple power grid's steady-state
  and dynamic performance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mallada, Enrique</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel Dynam-i-c Droop (iDroop) control mechanism to
perform primary frequency control with gird-connected inverters that improves
the network dynamic performance. The work is motivated by the dynamic
degradation experienced by the power grid due to the increase in asynchronous
inverted-based generation. We show that the widely suggested virtual inertia
solution suffers from unbounded noise amplification (infinite $\mathcal H_2$
norm) when measurement noise is considered. This suggests that virtual inertia
could potentially further degrade the grid performance once broadly deployed.
  This motivates the proposed solution in this paper that overcomes the
limitations of virtual inertia controllers while sharing the same advantages of
traditional droop control. In particular, our iDroop controllers are
decentralized, rebalance supply and demand, and provide power sharing.
Furthermore, our solution can improve the dynamic performance without affecting
the steady state solution. Our algorithm can be incrementally deployed and can
be guaranteed to be stable using a decentralized sufficient stability condition
on the parameter values. We illustrate several features of our solution using
numerical simulations.

 <dc:title>Survey Paper on Rising Threats of Subverting Privacy Infrastructure</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the main challenges faced by a user today is protecting their privacy,
especially during widespread surveil- lance. This led to the development of
privacy infrastructures whose main purpose is to guarantee users privacy.
However, they are being misused by attackers who consider them to be an
exploitable resource to perform illegitimate activities. This paper proposes to
analyze and assess the threats that occur due to subverting privacy
infrastructures. It begins with an outline of critical privacy infrastructures
that were developed. An overview of rising threats of subverting the most
prominent privacy infrastructure, Tor is presented. Additionally, a brief
assessment of the severity of these threats is discussed and the paper
concludes by recommending the scope for further research to mitigate the risks
due to such threats.

 <dc:description>  Cities are engines of the knowledge-based economy, because they are the
primary sites of knowledge production activities that subsequently shape the
rate and direction of technological change and economic growth. Patents provide
a wealth of information to analyse the knowledge specialization at specific
places, such as technological details and information on inventors and entities
involved, including address information. The technology codes on each patent
document indicate the specialization and scope of the underlying technological
knowledge of a given invention. In this paper we introduce tools for portfolio
analysis in terms of patents that provide insights into the technological
specialization of cities. The mapping and analysis of patent portfolios of
cities using data of the Unites States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
website (at http://www.uspto.gov) and dedicated tools (at
http://www.leydesdorff.net/portfolio) can be used to analyse the specialisation
patterns of inventive activities among cities. The results allow policy makers
and other stakeholders to identify promising areas of further knowledge
development and 'smart specialisation' strategies.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes an alternative approach to the so-called lattice of
embedded subsets, which is included in the product of the subset and partition
lattices of a finite set, and whose elements are pairs consisting of a subset
and a partition where the former is a block of the latter. The lattice
structure proposed in a recent contribution relies on ad-hoc definitions of
both the join operator and the bottom element, while also including
join-irreducible elements distinct from atoms. Conversely, here embedded
subsets obtain through a closure operator defined over the product of the
subset and partition lattices, where elements are generic pairs of a subset and
a partition. Those such pairs that coincide with their closure are precisely
embedded subsets, and since the Steinitz exchange axiom is also satisfied, what
results is a geometric (hence atomic) lattice given by a simple matroid (or
combinatorial geometry) included in the product of the subset and partition
lattices (as the partition lattice itself is the polygon matroid defined on the
edges of a complete graph). By focusing on its M\&quot;obius function, this
geometric lattice of embedded subsets of a n-set is shown to be isomorphic to
the lattice of partitions of a n+1-set.

present a system to recommend scholarly venues rated in terms of relevance to a
given researcher's current scholarly pursuits and interests. We collected our
data from an academic social network and modeled researchers' scholarly reading
behavior in order to propose a new and adaptive implicit rating technique for
venues. We present a way to recommend relevant, specialized scholarly venues
using these implicit ratings that can provide quick results, even for new
researchers without a publication history and for emerging scholarly venues
that do not yet have an impact factor. We performed a large-scale experiment
with real data to evaluate the current scholarly recommendation system and
showed that our proposed system achieves better results than the baseline. The
results provide important up-to-the-minute signals that compared with
post-publication usage-based metrics represent a closer reflection of a
researcher's interests.

 <dc:description>  Cographs have always been a research target in areas such as coloring, graph
decomposition, and spectral theory. In this work, we present an algorithm to
generate all unlabeled cographs with $n$ vertices, based on the generation of
cotrees. The delay of our algorithm (time spent between two consecutive
outputs) is $O(n)$. The time needed to generate the first output is also
$O(n)$, which gives an overall $O(n\,M_n)$ time complexity, where $M_n$ is the
number of unlabeled cographs with $n$ vertices. The algorithm avoids the
generation of duplicates (isomorphic outputs) and produces, as a by-product, a
linear ordering of unlabeled cographs wih $n$ vertices.

 <dc:title>Inapproximability of the independent set polynomial below the Shearer

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of approximately evaluating the independent set
polynomial of bounded-degree graphs at a point lambda or, equivalently, the
problem of approximating the partition function of the hard-core model with
activity lambda on graphs G of max degree D. For lambda&gt;0, breakthrough results
of Weitz and Sly established a computational transition from easy to hard at
lambda_c(D)=(D-1)^(D-1)/(D-2)^D, which coincides with the tree uniqueness phase
transition from statistical physics.
  For lambda&lt;0, the evaluation of the independent set polynomial is connected
to the conditions of the Lovasz Local Lemma. Shearer identified the threshold
lambda*(D)=(D-1)^(D-1)/D^D as the maximum value p such that every family of
events with failure probability at most p and whose dependency graph has max
degree D has nonempty intersection. Very recently, Patel and Regts, and Harvey
et al. have independently designed FPTASes for approximating the partition
function whenever |lambda|&lt;lambda*(D).
  Our main result establishes for the first time a computational transition at
the Shearer threshold. We show that for all D&gt;=3, for all lambda&lt;-lambda*(D),
it is NP-hard to approximate the partition function on bipartite graphs of
maximum degree D, even within an exponential factor. Thus, our result, combined
with the FPTASes for lambda&gt;-lambda*(D), establishes a phase transition for
negative activities. In fact, we now have the following picture for the problem
of approximating the partition function with activity lambda on graphs G of max
degree D.
  (i) For -lambda*(D)&lt;lambda&lt;lambda_c(D), the problem admits an FPTAS.
  (ii) For lambda&lt;-lambda*(D) or lambda&gt;lambda_c(D), the problem is NP-hard.
  Rather than the tree uniqueness threshold of the positive case, the phase
transition for negative activities corresponds to the existence of zeros for
the partition function of the tree below -lambda*(D).

 <dc:description>  Mirror neurons have been observed in the primary motor cortex of primate
species, in particular in humans and monkeys. A mirror neuron fires when a
person performs a certain action, and also when he observes the same action
being performed by another person. A crucial step towards building fully
autonomous intelligent systems with human-like learning abilities is the
capability in modeling the mirror neuron. On one hand, the abundance of
egocentric cameras in the past few years has offered the opportunity to study a
lot of vision problems from the first-person perspective. A great deal of
interesting research has been done during the past few years, trying to explore
various computer vision tasks from the perspective of the self. On the other
hand, videos recorded by traditional static cameras, capture humans performing
different actions from an exocentric third-person perspective. In this work, we
take the first step towards relating motion information across these two
perspectives. We train models that predict motion in an egocentric view, by
observing it from an exocentric view, and vice versa. This allows models to
predict how an egocentric motion would look like from outside. To do so, we
train linear and nonlinear models and evaluate their performance in terms of
retrieving the egocentric (exocentric) motion features, while having access to
an exocentric (egocentric) motion feature. Our experimental results demonstrate
that motion information can be successfully transferred across the two views.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework to analyze and quantify the bias in adaptive data
analysis. It generalizes that proposed by Russo and Zou'15, applying to
measurements whose moment generating function exists, measurements with a
finite $p$-norm, and measurements in general Orlicz spaces. We introduce a new
class of dependence measures which retain key properties of mutual information
while more effectively quantifying the exploration bias for heavy tailed
distributions. We provide examples of cases where our bounds are nearly tight
in situations where the original framework of Russo and Zou'15 does not apply.

 <dc:description>  Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides the ability to reconstruct neuronal fibers in
the brain, $\textit{in vivo}$, by measuring water diffusion along angular
gradient directions in $q$-space. High angular resolution diffusion imaging
(HARDI) can produce better estimates of fiber orientation than the popularly
used diffusion tensor imaging, but the high number of samples needed to
estimate diffusivity requires lengthy patient scan times. To accelerate dMRI,
compressed sensing (CS) has been utilized by exploiting a sparse dictionary
representation of the data, discovered through sparse coding. The sparser the
representation, the fewer samples are needed to reconstruct a high resolution
signal with limited information loss, and so an important area of research has
focused on finding the sparsest possible representation of dMRI. Current
reconstruction methods however, rely on an angular representation $\textit{per
voxel}$ with added spatial regularization, and so, the global level of sparsity
can be no less than the number of voxels. Therefore, state-of-the-art dMRI CS
frameworks may have a fundamental limit to the rate acceleration that can be
achieved. In contrast, we propose a joint spatial-angular representation of
dMRI that will allow us to achieve levels of global sparsity that are below the
number of voxels. A major challenge, however, is the computational complexity
of solving a global sparse coding problem over large-scale dMRI. In this work,
we present novel adaptations of popular sparse coding algorithms that become
better suited for solving large-scale problems by exploiting spatial-angular
separability. Our experiments show that our method achieves significantly
sparser representations of HARDI than the state-of-the-art which has the
potential to increase HARDI acceleration to new levels.

 <dc:title>Partitioning, Indexing and Querying Spatial Data on Cloud</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Akdogan, Afsin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  The number of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, wearable technologies) is
rapidly growing. In line with this trend, a massive amount of spatial data is
being collected since these devices allow users to geo-tag user-generated
content. Clearly, a scalable computing infrastructure is needed to manage such
large datasets. Meanwhile, Cloud Computing service providers (e.g., Amazon,
Google, and Microsoft) allow users to lease computing resources. However, most
of the existing spatial indexing techniques are designed for the centralized
paradigm which is limited to the capabilities of a single sever. To address the
scalability shortcomings of existing approaches, we provide a study that focus
on generating a distributed spatial index structure that not only scales out to
multiple servers but also scales up since it fully exploits the multi-core CPUs
available on each server using Voronoi diagram as the partitioning and indexing
technique which we also use to process spatial queries effectively. More
specifically, since the data objects continuously move and issue position
updates to the index structure, we collect the latest positions of objects and
periodically generate a read-only index to eliminate costly distributed
updates. Our approach scales near-linearly in index construction and query
processing, and can efficiently construct an index for millions of objects
within a few seconds. In addition to scalability and efficiency, we also aim to
maximize the server utilization that can support the same workload with less
number of servers. Server utilization is a crucial point while using Cloud
Computing because users are charged based on the total amount of time they
reserve each server, with no consideration of utilization.

 <dc:description>  Recently we create so much data (2.5 quintillion bytes every day) that 90% of
the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone [1].
This data comes from sensors used to gather traffic or climate information,
posts to social media sites, photos, videos, emails, purchase transaction
records, call logs of cellular networks, etc. This data is big data. In this
report, we first briefly discuss what programming models are used for big data
processing, and focus on graph data and do a survey study about what
programming models/frameworks are used to solve graph problems at very
large-scale. In section 2, we introduce the programming models which are not
specifically designed to handle graph data but we include them in this survey
because we believe these are important frameworks and/or there have been
studies to customize them for more efficient graph processing. In section 3, we
discuss some techniques that yield up to 1340 times speedup for some certain
graph problems when applied to Hadoop. In section 4, we discuss vertex-based
programming model which is simply designed to process large graphs and the
frameworks adapting it. In section 5, we implement two of the fundamental graph
algorithms (Page Rank and Weight Bipartite Matching), and run them on a single
node as the baseline approach to see how fast they are for large datasets and
whether it is worth to partition them.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Adaptive Streaming using Index-Based Learning Algorithms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Singh, Rahul</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kumar, P. R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We provide a unified framework using which we design scalable dynamic
adaptive video streaming algorithms based on index based policies (dubbed
DAS-IP) to maximize the Quality of Experience (QoE) provided to clients using
video streaming services. Due to the distributed nature of our algorithm, it is
easily implementable.
  We begin by considering the simplest set-up of a one-hop wireless network in
which an Access Point (AP) transmits video packets to multiple clients over a
shared unreliable channel. The video file meant for each client has been
fragmented into several packets, and the server maintains multiple copies (each
of different quality) of the same video file. Clients maintain individual
packet buffers in order to mitigate the effect of uncertainty on video
iterruption. Streaming experience, or the Quality of Experience (QoE) of a
client depends on several factors: i) starvation/outage probability, i.e.,
average time duration for which the client does not play video because the
buffer is empty, ii) average video quality, iii) average number of starvation
periods, iv) temporal variations in video quality etc.
  We pose the problem of making dynamic streaming decisions in order to
maximize the total QoE as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). A
consideration of the associated dual MDP suggests us that the problem is vastly
simplified if the AP is allowed to charge a price per unit bandwidth usage from
the clients. More concretely, a &quot;client-by-client&quot; QoE optimization leads to
the networkwide QoE maximization, and thus provides us a decentralized
streaming algorithm.
  This enables the clients to themselves decide the optimal streaming choices
in each time-slot, and yields us a much desired client-level adaptation
algorithm. The optimal policy has an appealing simple threshold structure.

 <dc:title>3D Shape Induction from 2D Views of Multiple Objects</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the problem of inducing a distribution over
three-dimensional structures given two-dimensional views of multiple objects
taken from unknown viewpoints. Our approach called &quot;projective generative
adversarial networks&quot; (PrGANs) trains a deep generative model of 3D shapes
whose projections match the distributions of the input 2D views. The addition
of a projection module allows us to infer the underlying 3D shape distribution
without using any 3D, viewpoint information, or annotation during the learning
phase. We show that our approach produces 3D shapes of comparable quality to
GANs trained on 3D data for a number of shape categories including chairs,
airplanes, and cars. Experiments also show that the disentangled representation
of 2D shapes into geometry and viewpoint leads to a good generative model of 2D
shapes. The key advantage is that our model allows us to predict 3D, viewpoint,
and generate novel views from an input image in a completely unsupervised
manner.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, skeleton-based action recognition has become a popular 3D
classification problem. State-of-the-art methods typically first represent each
motion sequence as a high-dimensional trajectory on a Lie group with an
additional dynamic time warping, and then shallowly learn favorable Lie group
features. In this paper we incorporate the Lie group structure into a deep
network architecture to learn more appropriate Lie group features for 3D action
recognition. Within the network structure, we design rotation mapping layers to
transform the input Lie group features into desirable ones, which are aligned
better in the temporal domain. To reduce the high feature dimensionality, the
architecture is equipped with rotation pooling layers for the elements on the
Lie group. Furthermore, we propose a logarithm mapping layer to map the
resulting manifold data into a tangent space that facilitates the application
of regular output layers for the final classification. Evaluations of the
proposed network for standard 3D human action recognition datasets clearly
demonstrate its superiority over existing shallow Lie group feature learning
methods as well as most conventional deep learning methods.

 <dc:title>Graph-based Cyber Security Analysis of State Estimation in Smart Power

 <dc:description>  Smart power grid enables intelligent automation at all levels of power system
operation, from electricity generation at power plants to power usage at
households. The key enabling factor of an efficient smart grid is its built-in
information and communication technology (ICT) that monitors the real-time
system operating state and makes control decisions accordingly. As an important
building block of the ICT system, power system state estimation is of critical
importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which, however, is
under mounting threat from potential cyber attacks. In this article, we
introduce a graph-based framework for performing cyber-security analysis in
power system state estimation. Compared to conventional arithmetic-based
security analysis, the graphical characterization of state estimation security
provides intuitive visualization of some complex problem structures and enables
efficient graphical solution algorithms, which are useful for both defending
and attacking the ICT system of smart grid. We also highlight several promising
future research directions on graph-based security analysis and its
applications in smart power grid.

 <dc:description>  This paper is focused on the design of phase sequences with good (aperiodic)
autocorrelation properties in terms of Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL) and Integrated
Sidelobe Level (ISL). The problem is formulated as a bi-objective Pareto
optimization forcing either a continuous or a discrete phase constraint at the
design stage. An iterative procedure based on the coordinate descent method is
introduced to deal with the resulting optimization problems which are
non-convex and NP-hard in general. Each iteration of the devised method
requires the solution of a non-convex min-max problem. It is handled either
through a novel bisection or an FFT-based method for the continuous and the
discrete phase constraint, respectively. Additionally, a heuristic approach to
initialize the procedures employing the lp-norm minimization technique is
proposed. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed methodologies can
outperform some counterparts providing sequences with good autocorrelation
features especially in the discrete phase/binary case.

 <dc:description>  This letter proposes a novel hybrid half-/full-duplex relaying scheme to
enhance the relay channel security. A source node (Alice) communicates with her
destination node (Bob) in the presence of a buffer-aided full-duplex relay node
(Rooney) and a potential eavesdropper (Eve). Rooney adopts two different
relaying strategies, namely randomize-and-forward and decode-and-forward
relaying strategies, to improve the security of the legitimate system. In the
first relaying strategy, Rooney uses a codebook different from that used at
Alice. In the second relaying strategy, Rooney and Alice use the same
codebooks. In addition, Rooney switches between half-duplex and full-duplex
modes to further enhance the security of the legitimate system. The numerical
results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves a significant average
secrecy end-to-end throughput improvement relative to the conventional
bufferless full-duplex relaying scheme.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we investigate the security of a single-antenna rechargeable
source node in the presence of a multi-antenna rechargeable cooperative jammer
and a potential single-antenna eavesdropper. The batteries at the legitimate
transmitting nodes (i.e. the source node and the jamming node) are assumed to
be limited in capacity and are modeled as queueing systems. We investigate the
impact of the energy arrival rates at the batteries on the achievable secrecy
rates. In our energy-constrained network, we propose an efficient scheme to
enhance the system's security by optimizing the transmission times of the
source node. The jammer uses a subset of its antennas (and transmit
radio-frequency chains) to create a beamformer which maximizes the system's
secrecy rate while completely canceling the artificial noise at the legitimate
destination. Our numerical results demonstrate the significant average secrecy
rate gain of our proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  We consider a relay-assisted wireless network, where the energy-harvesting
buffer-aided relay node is powered by radio-frequency signals from a source
node wishing to communicate with its destination. We propose two secure
cooperative protocols for a network composed of a source node equipped with a
data buffer communicating with its destination in the presence of a
buffer-aided relay node and an eavesdropper. Our proposed protocols are
designed based on the channel state information and the buffer state
information at the source and relay nodes. The burstiness of data at the source
node queue (buffer) and the energy recycling process at the relay are taken
into account in our analysis. In addition, we take the decoding and signal
processing circuit power consumption constraints into consideration. For the
limiting case of an infinite-size battery at the relay, we derive a sufficient
condition for the energy queue to saturate. Our numerical results demonstrate
the throughput gains of our proposed protocols.

 <dc:description>  It is common that a trained classification model is applied to the operating
data that is deviated from the training data because of noise. This paper
demonstrates that an ensemble classifier, Diversified Multiple Tree (DMT), is
more robust in classifying noisy data than other widely used ensemble methods.
DMT is tested on three real world biomedical data sets from different
laboratories in comparison with four benchmark ensemble classifiers.
Experimental results show that DMT is significantly more accurate than other
benchmark ensemble classifiers on noisy test data. We also discuss a limitation
of DMT and its possible variations.

 <dc:description>  Numerous single-image super-resolution algorithms have been proposed in the
literature, but few studies address the problem of performance evaluation based
on visual perception. While most super-resolution images are evaluated by
fullreference metrics, the effectiveness is not clear and the required
ground-truth images are not always available in practice. To address these
problems, we conduct human subject studies using a large set of
super-resolution images and propose a no-reference metric learned from visual
perceptual scores. Specifically, we design three types of low-level statistical
features in both spatial and frequency domains to quantify super-resolved
artifacts, and learn a two-stage regression model to predict the quality scores
of super-resolution images without referring to ground-truth images. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed metric is effective and efficient
to assess the quality of super-resolution images based on human perception.

 <dc:description>  The ever-increasing demand of mobile Internet and multimedia services poses
unique and significant challenges for current and future generation wireless
networks. These challenges are mainly relating to the support of massive
ubiquitous connectivity, low latency and highly efficient utilization of
spectrum resources. Therefore, it is vital to consider them extensively prior
to design and deployment of future wireless networks. To this end, the present
article provides a comprehensive overview of a particularly promising and
effective wireless technology, namely, visible light communication (VLC). In
this context, we initially provide a thorough overview of frequency domain
multiple access techniques for single and multi-carrier systems, which is then
followed by an in depth discussion on the technical considerations of optical
code division multiple access techniques and their adoption in indoor VLC
applications. Furthermore, we address space division multiple access and,
finally, we revisit and analyze the distinct characteristics of a new
technology, namely, non-orthogonal multiple access, which has been proposed
recently as a particularly effective solution.

 <dc:title>Complexity-Theoretic Foundations of Quantum Supremacy Experiments</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the near future, there will likely be special-purpose quantum computers
with 40-50 high-quality qubits. This paper lays general theoretical foundations
for how to use such devices to demonstrate &quot;quantum supremacy&quot;: that is, a
clear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the
Extended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible. First, we study the
hardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along
the lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show
that there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with
sampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a
statistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass.
Compared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk
directly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being
sampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new
algorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates
in polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known
algorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of
Aaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem--of
the form &quot;if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then PH
collapses&quot;--must be non-relativizing. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson
and Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant
versus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities.
Fifth, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work
implies that, if OWFs exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to
such oracles. We show that some assumption is needed: if SampBPP=SampBQP and NP
is in BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to such oracles.

 <dc:description>  The immersed boundary method is an approach to fluid-structure interaction
that uses a Lagrangian description of the structural deformations, stresses,
and forces along with an Eulerian description of the momentum, viscosity, and
incompressibility of the fluid-structure system. The original immersed boundary
methods described immersed elastic structures using systems of flexible fibers,
and even now, most immersed boundary methods still require Lagrangian meshes
that are finer than the Eulerian grid. This work introduces a coupling scheme
for the immersed boundary method to link the Lagrangian and Eulerian variables
that facilitates independent spatial discretizations for the structure and
background grid. This approach employs a finite element discretization of the
structure while retaining a finite difference scheme for the Eulerian
variables. We apply this method to benchmark problems involving elastic, rigid,
and actively contracting structures, including an idealized model of the left
ventricle of the heart. Our tests include cases in which, for a fixed Eulerian
grid spacing, coarser Lagrangian structural meshes yield discretization errors
that are as much as several orders of magnitude smaller than errors obtained
using finer structural meshes. The Lagrangian-Eulerian coupling approach
developed in this work enables the effective use of these coarse structural
meshes with the immersed boundary method. This work also contrasts two
different weak forms of the equations, one of which is demonstrated to be more
effective for the coarse structural discretizations facilitated by our coupling
approach.

 <dc:description>  Rotman lens is a true-time-delay beam forming network with parallel plate
structure. Owing to its frequency- independency and wide-band operation, it has
gained vast applications as feeding element of linear array antennas. However,
the lens suffers from high intrinsic power loss and the problem worsens in
microstrip structures by their inevitable dielectric loss. On the other hand,
waveguides experience extremely lower loss and also have higher power capacity.
Thus, waveguides can be advantageously utilized in Rotman lens structure. Here,
a waveguide Rotman lens for the frequency range of 8 to 12 GHz is designed and
simulated in CST Microwave Studio. Phase error and power efficiency of the
proposed structure are satisfactory.

 <dc:title>SNKnock: A free security tool for Facebook users</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fayed, Mahmoud Samir</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Facebook Social network is very famous and widely used by millions of
users all over the world. Facebook comes with high level of usability so users
can easily find their friends and connect to them, but there are security
issues related to this process where the attacker can make same-site or
cross-site profile cloning attacks to get other users data. In this paper we
will identify advanced same-site or cross-site profile cloning attacks then we
will propose a security solution to these attacks where the user must record a
voice message and answer some questions when he sends a friend request to
another user, and then the other user will listen to this message before
deciding to accept or reject the request. We implemented this solution by
developing new web application called SNKnock which is available as free
service.

 <dc:description>  Winning probabilities of The Hat Game (Ebert's Hat Problem) with three
players and three colors are only known in the symmetric case: all
probabilities of the colors are equal. This paper solves the asymmetric case:
probabilities may be different. We find winning probabilies and optimal
strategies in all cases.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a proper display calculus for (non-distributive) Lattice Logic
which is sound, complete, conservative, and enjoys cut-elimination and
sub-formula property. Properness (i.e. closure under uniform substitution of
all parametric parts in rules) is the main interest and added value of the
present proposal, and allows for the smoothest Belnap-style proof of
cut-elimination. Our proposal builds on an algebraic and order-theoretic
analysis of the semantic environment of lattice logic, and applies the
guidelines of the multi-type methodology in the design of display calculi.

 <dc:title>A Probabilistic Representation for Dynamic Movement Primitives</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Meier, Franziska</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dynamic Movement Primitives have successfully been used to realize imitation
learning, trial-and-error learning, reinforce- ment learning, movement
recognition and segmentation and control. Because of this they have become a
popular represen- tation for motor primitives. In this work, we showcase how
DMPs can be reformulated as a probabilistic linear dynamical system with
control inputs. Through this probabilistic repre- sentation of DMPs, algorithms
such as Kalman filtering and smoothing are directly applicable to perform
inference on pro- prioceptive sensor measurements during execution. We show
that inference in this probabilistic model automatically leads to a feedback
term to online modulate the execution of a DMP. Furthermore, we show how
inference allows us to measure the likelihood that we are successfully
executing a given motion primitive. In this context, we show initial results of
using the probabilistic model to detect execution failures on a simulated
movement primitive dataset.

 <dc:description>  A group of $n$ users want to run a distributed protocol $\pi$ over a network
where communication occurs via private point-to-point channels. Unfortunately,
an adversary, who knows $\pi$, is able to maliciously flip bits on the
channels. Can we efficiently simulate $\pi$ in the presence of such an
adversary? We show that this is possible, even when $L$, the number of bits
sent in $\pi$, and $T$, the number of bits flipped by the adversary are not
known in advance. In particular, we show how to create a robust version of
$\pi$ that 1) fails with probability at most $\delta$, for any $\delta&gt;0$; and
2) sends $\tilde{O}(L + T)$ bits, where the $\tilde{O}$ notation hides a $\log
(nL/ \delta)$ term multiplying $L$. Additionally, we show how to improve this
result when the average message size $\alpha$ is not constant. In particular,
we give an algorithm that sends $O( L (1 + (1/\alpha) \log (n L/\delta) + T)$
bits. This algorithm is adaptive in that it does not require a priori knowledge
of $\alpha$. We note that if $\alpha$ is $\Omega\left( \log (n L/\delta)
\right)$, then this improved algorithm sends only $O(L+T)$ bits, and is
therefore within a constant factor of optimal.

 <dc:description>  We show that the conjugacy problem in a wreath product $A \wr B$ is
uniform-$\mathsf{TC}^0$-Turing-reducible to the conjugacy problem in the
factors $A$ and $B$ and the power problem in $B$. If $B$ is torsion free, the
power problem for $B$ can be replaced by the slightly weaker cyclic submonoid
membership problem for $B$. Moreover, if $A$ is abelian, the cyclic subgroup
membership problem suffices, which itself is
uniform-$\mathsf{AC}^0$-many-one-reducible to the conjugacy problem in $A \wr
B$.
  Furthermore, under certain natural conditions, we give a uniform
$\mathsf{TC}^0$ Turing reduction from the power problem in $A \wr B$ to the
power problems of $A$ and $B$. Together with our first result, this yields a
uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ solution to the conjugacy problem in iterated wreath
products of abelian groups - and, by the Magnus embedding, also in free
solvable groups.

 <dc:description>  Mammogram classification is directly related to computer-aided diagnosis of
breast cancer. Traditional methods requires great effort to annotate the
training data by costly manual labeling and specialized computational models to
detect these annotations during test. Inspired by the success of using deep
convolutional features for natural image analysis and multi-instance learning
for labeling a set of instances/patches, we propose end-to-end trained deep
multi-instance networks for mass classification based on whole mammogram
without the aforementioned costly need to annotate the training data. We
explore three different schemes to construct deep multi-instance networks for
whole mammogram classification. Experimental results on the INbreast dataset
demonstrate the robustness of proposed deep networks compared to previous work
using segmentation and detection annotations in the training.

 <dc:description>  Mass segmentation is an important task in mammogram analysis, providing
effective morphological features and regions of interest (ROI) for mass
detection and classification. Inspired by the success of using deep
convolutional features for natural image analysis and conditional random fields
(CRF) for structural learning, we propose an end-to-end network for
mammographic mass segmentation. The network employs a fully convolutional
network (FCN) to model potential function, followed by a CRF to perform
structural learning. Because the mass distribution varies greatly with pixel
position, the FCN is combined with position priori for the task. Due to the
small size of mammogram datasets, we use adversarial training to control
over-fitting. Four models with different convolutional kernels are further
fused to improve the segmentation results. Experimental results on two public
datasets, INbreast and DDSM-BCRP, show that our end-to-end network combined
with adversarial training achieves the-state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a realistic and meaningful scenario in the context
of smart grids where an electricity retailer serves three different types of
customers, i.e., customers with an optimal home energy management system
embedded in their smart meters (C-HEMS), customers with only smart meters
(C-SM), and customers without smart meters (C-NONE). The main objective of this
paper is to support the retailer to make optimal day-ahead dynamic pricing
decisions in such a mixed customer pool. To this end, we propose a two-level
decision-making framework where the retailer acting as upper-level agent
firstly announces its electricity prices of next 24 hours and customers acting
as lower-level agents subsequently schedule their energy usages accordingly.
For the lower level problem, we model the price responsiveness of different
customers according to their unique characteristics. For the upper level
problem, we optimize the dynamic prices for the retailer to maximize its profit
subject to realistic market constraints. The above two-level model is tackled
by genetic algorithms (GAs) based distributed optimization methods while its
feasibility and effectiveness are confirmed via simulation results.

 <dc:description>  Near-sensor data analytics is a promising direction for IoT endpoints, as it
minimizes energy spent on communication and reduces network load - but it also
poses security concerns, as valuable data is stored or sent over the network at
various stages of the analytics pipeline. Using encryption to protect sensitive
data at the boundary of the on-chip analytics engine is a way to address data
security issues. To cope with the combined workload of analytics and encryption
in a tight power envelope, we propose Fulmine, a System-on-Chip based on a
tightly-coupled multi-core cluster augmented with specialized blocks for
compute-intensive data processing and encryption functions, supporting software
programmability for regular computing tasks. The Fulmine SoC, fabricated in
65nm technology, consumes less than 20mW on average at 0.8V achieving an
efficiency of up to 70pJ/B in encryption, 50pJ/px in convolution, or up to
25MIPS/mW in software. As a strong argument for real-life flexible application
of our platform, we show experimental results for three secure analytics use
cases: secure autonomous aerial surveillance with a state-of-the-art deep CNN
consuming 3.16pJ per equivalent RISC op; local CNN-based face detection with
secured remote recognition in 5.74pJ/op; and seizure detection with encrypted
data collection from EEG within 12.7pJ/op.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present a complete architecture for designing Internet of
Things applications. While a main issue in this domain is the heterogeneity of
Objects hardware, networks and protocols, we propose D-LITe, a solution to hide
this wide range of low layer technologies. By abstracting the hardware, we
focus on object's features and not on its real characteristics. D-LITe aims to
give a universal access to object's internal processing and computational
power. A small virtual machine embedded in each object gives a universal view
of its functionalities. Each object's features are discovered and programmed
through the network, without any physical access. D-LITe comes with the SALT
language that describes the logical behaviour needed to include user's Objects
into an IoT application. This communication is based on REST architecture.
Gathering all these logical units into a global composition is our way to build
a services Choreography, in which each Object has its own task to achieve. This
paper presents also an analysis of the gain obtained when a Choreography is
used instead of the most common services.

 <dc:description>  We study the behavior of algebraic connectivity in a weighted graph that is
subject to site percolation, random deletion of the vertices. Using a refined
concentration inequality for random matrices we show in our main theorem that
the (augmented) Laplacian of the percolated graph concentrates around its
expectation. This concentration bound then provides a lower bound on the
algebraic connectivity of the percolated graph. As a special case for
$(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs (i.e., $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices with
non-trivial eigenvalues less than $\lambda$ in magnitude) our result shows
that, with high probability, the graph remains connected under a homogeneous
site percolation with survival probability $p\ge 1-C_{1}n^{-C_{2}/d}$ with
$C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ depending only on $\lambda/d$.

 <dc:description>  Let $f$ be a function on a finite field $F$. The decomposition of the
generalized Fermat variety $X$ defined by the multivariate polynomial of degree
$n$, $\phi(x,y,z)=f(x)+f(y)+f(z)$ in $\Bbb{P}^3(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2)$,
plays a crucial role in the study of almost perfect non-linear (APN) functions
and exceptional APN functions. Their structure depends fundamentally on the
Fermat varieties corresponding to the monomial functions of exceptional degrees
$n=2^k+1$ and $n=2^{2k}-2^k+1$ (Gold and Kasami-Welch numbers, respectively).
Very important results for these have been obtained by Janwa, McGuire and
Wilson in [12,13]. In this paper we study $X$ related to the Kasami-Welch
degree monomials and its decomposition into absolutely irreducible components.
We show that, in this decomposition, the components intersect transversally at
a singular point.
  This structural fact implies that the corresponding generalized Fermat
hypersurfaces, related to Kasami-Welch degree polynomial families, are
absolutely irreducible. In particular, we prove that if
$f(x)=x^{2^{2k}-2^k+1}+h(x)$, where ${\rm deg}(h)\equiv 3{\pmod 4}$, then the
corresponding APN multivariate hypersurface is absolutely irreducible, and
hence $f(x)$ is not exceptional APN function. We also prove conditional result
in the case when ${\rm deg}(h)\equiv 5{\pmod 8}$. Since for odd degree $f(x)$,
the conjecture needs to be resolved only for the Gold degree and the
Kasami-Welch degree cases our results contribute substantially to the proof of
the conjecture on exceptional APN functions---in the hardest case: the
Kasami-Welch degree.

 <dc:title>Towards Loop-Free Forwarding of Anonymous Internet Datagrams that
  Enforce Provenance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Garcia-Luna-Aceves, J. J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The way in which addressing and forwarding are implemented in the Internet
constitutes one of its biggest privacy and security challenges. The fact that
source addresses in Internet datagrams cannot be trusted makes the IP Internet
inherently vulnerable to DoS and DDoS attacks. The Internet forwarding plane is
open to attacks to the privacy of datagram sources, because source addresses in
Internet datagrams have global scope. The fact an Internet datagrams are
forwarded based solely on the destination addresses stated in datagram headers
and the next hops stored in the forwarding information bases (FIB) of relaying
routers allows Internet datagrams to traverse loops, which wastes resources and
leaves the Internet open to further attacks. We introduce PEAR (Provenance
Enforcement through Addressing and Routing), a new approach for addressing and
forwarding of Internet datagrams that enables anonymous forwarding of Internet
datagrams, eliminates many of the existing DDoS attacks on the IP Internet, and
prevents Internet datagrams from looping, even in the presence of routing-table
loops.

 <dc:description>  Representing a dialog policy as a recurrent neural network (RNN) is
attractive because it handles partial observability, infers a latent
representation of state, and can be optimized with supervised learning (SL) or
reinforcement learning (RL). For RL, a policy gradient approach is natural, but
is sample inefficient. In this paper, we present 3 methods for reducing the
number of dialogs required to optimize an RNN-based dialog policy with RL. The
key idea is to maintain a second RNN which predicts the value of the current
policy, and to apply experience replay to both networks. On two tasks, these
methods reduce the number of dialogs/episodes required by about a third, vs.
standard policy gradient methods.

 <dc:description>  Non-convex and non-smooth optimization plays an important role in machine
learning. Proximal gradient method is one of the most important methods for
solving the non-convex and non-smooth problems, where a proximal operator need
to be solved exactly for each step. However, in a lot of problems the proximal
operator does not have an analytic solution, or is expensive to obtain an exact
solution. In this paper, we propose inexact proximal gradient methods (not only
a basic inexact proximal gradient method (IPG), but also a Nesterov's
accelerated inexact proximal gradient method (AIPG)) for non-convex and
non-smooth optimization, which tolerate an error in the calculation of the
proximal operator. Theoretical analysis shows that IPG and AIPG have the same
convergence rates as in the error-free case, provided that the errors decrease
at appropriate rates.

 <dc:title>A Hidden Absorbing Semi-Markov Model for Informatively Censored Temporal
  Data: Learning and Inference</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Modeling continuous-time physiological processes that manifest a patient's
evolving clinical states is a key step in approaching many problems in
healthcare. In this paper, we develop the Hidden Absorbing Semi-Markov Model
(HASMM): a versatile probabilistic model that is capable of capturing the
modern electronic health record (EHR) data. Unlike exist- ing models, an HASMM
accommodates irregularly sampled, temporally correlated, and informatively
censored physiological data, and can describe non-stationary clinical state
transitions. Learning an HASMM from the EHR data is achieved via a novel
forward- filtering backward-sampling Monte-Carlo EM algorithm that exploits the
knowledge of the end-point clinical outcomes (informative censoring) in the EHR
data, and implements the E-step by sequentially sampling the patients' clinical
states in the reverse-time direction while conditioning on the future states.
Real-time inferences are drawn via a forward- filtering algorithm that operates
on a virtually constructed discrete-time embedded Markov chain that mirrors the
patient's continuous-time state trajectory. We demonstrate the di- agnostic and
prognostic utility of the HASMM in a critical care prognosis setting using a
real-world dataset for patients admitted to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical
Center.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses path planning of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with
remote sensing capabilities (or wireless communication capabilities). The goal
of the path planning is to find a minimum-flight-time closed tour of the UAV
visiting all executable areas of given remote sensing and communication tasks;
in order to incorporate the nonlinear vehicle dynamics, this problem is
regarded as a dynamically-constrained traveling salesman problem with
neighborhoods. To obtain a close-to-optimal solution for the path planning in a
tractable manner, a sampling-based roadmap algorithm that embeds an optimal
control-based path generation process is proposed. The algorithm improves the
computational efficiency by reducing numerical computations required for
optimizing inefficient local paths, and by extracting additional information
from a roadmap of a fixed number of samples. Comparative numerical simulations
validate the efficiency of the presented algorithm in reducing computation time
and improving the solution quality compared to previous roadmap-based planning
methods.

 <dc:title>A Characterization of Constant-Sample Testable Properties</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blais, Eric</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We characterize the set of properties of Boolean-valued functions on a finite
domain $\mathcal{X}$ that are testable with a constant number of samples.
Specifically, we show that a property $\mathcal{P}$ is testable with a constant
number of samples if and only if it is (essentially) a $k$-part symmetric
property for some constant $k$, where a property is {\em $k$-part symmetric} if
there is a partition $S_1,\ldots,S_k$ of $\mathcal{X}$ such that whether
$f:\mathcal{X} \to \{0,1\}$ satisfies the property is determined solely by the
densities of $f$ on $S_1,\ldots,S_k$. We use this characterization to obtain a
number of corollaries, namely: (i) A graph property $\mathcal{P}$ is testable
with a constant number of samples if and only if whether a graph $G$ satisfies
$\mathcal{P}$ is (essentially) determined by the edge density of $G$. (ii) An
affine-invariant property $\mathcal{P}$ of functions $f:\mathbb{F}_p^n \to
\{0,1\}$ is testable with a constant number of samples if and only if whether
$f$ satisfies $\mathcal{P}$ is (essentially) determined by the density of $f$.
(iii) For every constant $d \geq 1$, monotonicity of functions $f : [n]^d \to
\{0, 1\}$ on the $d$-dimensional hypergrid is testable with a constant number
of samples.

 <dc:title>Parsing Images of Overlapping Organisms with Deep Singling-Out Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yurchenko, Victor</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lempitsky, Victor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work is motivated by the mostly unsolved task of parsing biological
images with multiple overlapping articulated model organisms (such as worms or
larvae). We present a general approach that separates the two main challenges
associated with such data, individual object shape estimation and object groups
disentangling. At the core of the approach is a deep feed-forward singling-out
network (SON) that is trained to map each local patch to a vectorial descriptor
that is sensitive to the characteristics (e.g. shape) of a central object,
while being invariant to the variability of all other surrounding elements.
Given a SON, a local image patch can be matched to a gallery of isolated
elements using their SON-descriptors, thus producing a hypothesis about the
shape of the central element in that patch. The image-level optimization based
on integer programming can then pick a subset of the hypotheses to explain
(parse) the whole image and disentangle groups of organisms.
  While sharing many similarities with existing &quot;analysis-by-synthesis&quot;
approaches, our method avoids the need for stochastic search in the
high-dimensional configuration space and numerous rendering operations at
test-time. We show that our approach can parse microscopy images of three
popular model organisms (the C.Elegans roundworms, the Drosophila larvae, and
the E.Coli bacteria) even under significant crowding and overlaps between
organisms. We speculate that the overall approach is applicable to a wider
class of image parsing problems concerned with crowded articulated objects, for
which rendering training images is possible.

 <dc:description>  When an agent cannot represent a perfectly accurate model of its
environment's dynamics, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) can fail
catastrophically. Planning involves composing the predictions of the model;
when flawed predictions are composed, even minor errors can compound and render
the model useless for planning. Hallucinated Replay (Talvitie 2014) trains the
model to &quot;correct&quot; itself when it produces errors, substantially improving MBRL
with flawed models. This paper theoretically analyzes this approach,
illuminates settings in which it is likely to be effective or ineffective, and
presents a novel error bound, showing that a model's ability to self-correct is
more tightly related to MBRL performance than one-step prediction error. These
results inspire an MBRL algorithm for deterministic MDPs with performance
guarantees that are robust to model class limitations.

 <dc:description>  Buildings form an essential part of modern life; people spend a significant
amount of their time in them, and they consume large amounts of energy. A
variety of systems provide services such as lighting, air conditioning and
security which are managed using Building Management Systems (BMS) by building
operators. To better understand the capability of current BMS and characterize
common practices of building operators, we investigated their use across five
institutions in the US. We interviewed ten operators and discovered that BMS do
not address a number of key concerns for the management of buildings. Our
analysis is rooted in the everyday work of building operators and highlights a
number of design suggestions to help improve the user experience and management
of BMS, ultimately leading to improvements in productivity, as well as
buildings comfort and energy efficiency.

 <dc:description>  We explore the task of multi-source morphological reinflection, which
generalizes the standard, single-source version. The input consists of (i) a
target tag and (ii) multiple pairs of source form and source tag for a lemma.
The motivation is that it is beneficial to have access to more than one source
form since different source forms can provide complementary information, e.g.,
different stems. We further present a novel extension to the encoder- decoder
recurrent neural architecture, consisting of multiple encoders, to better solve
the task. We show that our new architecture outperforms single-source
reinflection models and publish our dataset for multi-source morphological
reinflection to facilitate future research.

 <dc:description>  The mathematical formalism of quantum theory exhibits significant
effectiveness when applied to cognitive phenomena that have resisted
traditional (set theoretical) modeling. Relying on a decade of research on the
operational foundations of micro-physical and conceptual entities, we present a
theoretical framework for the representation of concepts and their conjunctions
and disjunctions that uses the quantum formalism. This framework provides a
unified solution to the 'conceptual combinations problem' of cognitive
psychology, explaining the observed deviations from classical (Boolean, fuzzy
set and Kolmogorovian) structures in terms of genuine quantum effects. In
particular, natural concepts 'interfere' when they combine to form more complex
conceptual entities, and they also exhibit a 'quantum-type context-dependence',
which are responsible of the 'over- and under-extension' that are
systematically observed in experiments on membership judgments.

 <dc:title>An Empirical Study of Adequate Vision Span for Attention-Based Neural

 <dc:description>  Recently, the attention mechanism plays a key role to achieve high
performance for Neural Machine Translation models. However, as it computes a
score function for the encoder states in all positions at each decoding step,
the attention model greatly increases the computational complexity. In this
paper, we investigate the adequate vision span of attention models in the
context of machine translation, by proposing a novel attention framework that
is capable of reducing redundant score computation dynamically. The term
&quot;vision span&quot; means a window of the encoder states considered by the attention
model in one step. In our experiments, we found that the average window size of
vision span can be reduced by over 50% with modest loss in accuracy on
English-Japanese and German-English translation tasks.% This results indicate
that the conventional attention mechanism performs a significant amount of
redundant computation.

 <dc:description>  We present LBW-Net, an efficient optimization based method for quantization
and training of the low bit-width convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Specifically, we quantize the weights to zero or powers of two by minimizing
the Euclidean distance between full-precision weights and quantized weights
during backpropagation. We characterize the combinatorial nature of the low
bit-width quantization problem. For 2-bit (ternary) CNNs, the quantization of
$N$ weights can be done by an exact formula in $O(N\log N)$ complexity. When
the bit-width is three and above, we further propose a semi-analytical
thresholding scheme with a single free parameter for quantization that is
computationally inexpensive. The free parameter is further determined by
network retraining and object detection tests. LBW-Net has several desirable
advantages over full-precision CNNs, including considerable memory savings,
energy efficiency, and faster deployment. Our experiments on PASCAL VOC dataset
show that compared with its 32-bit floating-point counterpart, the performance
of the 6-bit LBW-Net is nearly lossless in the object detection tasks, and can
even do better in some real world visual scenes, while empirically enjoying
more than 4$\times$ faster deployment.

 <dc:description>  Visual tracking addresses the problem of identifying and localizing an
unknown target in a video given the target specified by a bounding box in the
first frame. In this paper, we propose a dual network to better utilize
features among layers for visual tracking. It is observed that features in
higher layers encode semantic context while its counterparts in lower layers
are sensitive to discriminative appearance. Thus we exploit the hierarchical
features in different layers of a deep model and design a dual structure to
obtain better feature representation from various streams, which is rarely
investigated in previous work. To highlight geometric contours of the target,
we integrate the hierarchical feature maps with an edge detector as the coarse
prior maps to further embed local details around the target. To leverage the
robustness of our dual network, we train it with random patches measuring the
similarities between the network activation and target appearance, which serves
as a regularization to enforce the dual network to focus on target object. The
proposed dual network is updated online in a unique manner based on the
observation that the target being tracked in consecutive frames should share
more similar feature representations than those in the surrounding background.
It is also found that for a target object, the prior maps can help further
enhance performance by passing message into the output maps of the dual
network. Therefore, an independent component analysis with reference algorithm
(ICA-R) is employed to extract target context using prior maps as guidance.
Online tracking is conducted by maximizing the posterior estimate on the final
maps with stochastic and periodic update. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on two large-scale benchmark data sets show that the proposed
algorithm performs favourably against the state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:title>Varieties of Metric and Quantitative Algebras</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hino, Wataru</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Metric algebras are metric variants of $\Sigma$-algebras. They are first
introduced in the field of universal algebra to deal with algebras equipped
with metric structures such as normed vector spaces. Recently a similar notion
of quantitative algebra is used in computer science to formulate computational
effects of probabilistic programs. In this paper we show that varieties of
metric algebras (classes defined by a set of metric equations) are exactly
classes closed under (metric versions of) subalgebras, products and quotients.
This result implies the class of normed vector spaces cannot be defined by
metric equations, differently from the classical case where the class of vector
spaces is equational. This phenomenon suggests that metric equations are not a
very natural class of formulas since they cannot express such a typical class
of metric algebras. Therefore we need a broader class of formulas to acquire an
appropriate metric counterpart of the classical variety theory.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new artificial-noise aided hybrid time-switching/power-splitting
scheme for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to
securely transmit data and transfer energy to a legitimate receiving node. In
our proposed scheme, the cyclic prefix has two more benefits in addition to the
cancellation of the inter-symbol interference between the OFDM blocks. Firstly,
it enables the legitimate transmitter to send artificial-noise (AN) vectors in
a way such that the interference can be canceled at the legitimate receiver
prior to information decoding. Secondly, its power is used to energize the
legitimate receiver. We optimize the cyclic prefix length, the time-switching
and power-splitting parameters, and the power allocation ratio between the data
and AN signals at the legitimate transmitter to maximize the average secrecy
rate subject to a constraint on the average energy transfer rate at the
legitimate receiver. Our numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme
can achieve up to 23% average secrecy rate gain relative to a pure
power-splitting scheme.

 <dc:title>Similarity preserving compressions of high dimensional sparse data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The rise of internet has resulted in an explosion of data consisting of
millions of articles, images, songs, and videos. Most of this data is high
dimensional and sparse. The need to perform an efficient search for similar
objects in such high dimensional big datasets is becoming increasingly common.
Even with the rapid growth in computing power, the brute-force search for such
a task is impractical and at times impossible. Therefore it is quite natural to
investigate the techniques that compress the dimension of the data-set while
preserving the similarity between data objects.
  In this work, we propose an efficient compression scheme mapping binary
vectors into binary vectors and simultaneously preserving Hamming distance and
Inner Product. The length of our compression depends only on the sparsity and
is independent of the dimension of the data. Moreover our schemes provide
one-shot solution for Hamming distance and Inner Product, and work in the
streaming setting as well. In contrast with the &quot;local projection&quot; strategies
used by most of the previous schemes, our scheme combines (using sparsity) the
following two strategies: $1.$ Partitioning the dimensions into several
buckets, $2.$ Then obtaining &quot;global linear summaries&quot; in each of these
buckets. We generalize our scheme for real-valued data and obtain compressions
for Euclidean distance, Inner Product, and $k$-way Inner Product.

 <dc:title>Comparative study of space filling curves for cache oblivious TU

 <dc:creator>Salem, Fatima K. Abu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Arab, Mira Al</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We examine several matrix layouts based on space-filling curves that allow
for a cache-oblivious adaptation of parallel TU decomposition for rectangular
matrices over finite fields. The TU algorithm of \cite{Dumas} requires index
conversion routines for which the cost to encode and decode the chosen curve is
significant. Using a detailed analysis of the number of bit operations required
for the encoding and decoding procedures, and filtering the cost of lookup
tables that represent the recursive decomposition of the Hilbert curve, we show
that the Morton-hybrid order incurs the least cost for index conversion
routines that are required throughout the matrix decomposition as compared to
the Hilbert, Peano, or Morton orders. The motivation lies in that cache
efficient parallel adaptations for which the natural sequential evaluation
order demonstrates lower cache miss rate result in overall faster performance
on parallel machines with private or shared caches, on GPU's, or even cloud
computing platforms. We report on preliminary experiments that demonstrate how
the TURBO algorithm in Morton-hybrid layout attains orders of magnitude
improvement in performance as the input matrices increase in size. For example,
when $N = 2^{13}$, the row major TURBO algorithm concludes within about 38.6
hours, whilst the Morton-hybrid algorithm with truncation size equal to $64$
concludes within 10.6 hours.

 <dc:description>  Recent work in the literature has shown experimentally that one can use the
lower layers of a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to model natural
textures. More interestingly, it has also been experimentally shown that only
one layer with random filters can also model textures although with less
variability. In this paper we ask the question as to why one layer CNNs with
random filters are so effective in generating textures? We theoretically show
that one layer convolutional architectures (without a non-linearity) paired
with the an energy function used in previous literature, can in fact preserve
and modulate frequency coefficients in a manner so that random weights and
pretrained weights will generate the same type of images. Based on the results
of this analysis we question whether similar properties hold in the case where
one uses one convolution layer with a non-linearity. We show that in the case
of ReLu non-linearity there are situations where only one input will give the
minimum possible energy whereas in the case of no nonlinearity, there are
always infinite solutions that will give the minimum possible energy. Thus we
can show that in certain situations adding a ReLu non-linearity generates less
variable images.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we tackle distributed detection of a non-cooperative target
with a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). When the target is present, sensors
observe an unknown random signal with amplitude attenuation depending on the
distance between the sensor and the target (unknown) positions, embedded in
white Gaussian noise. The Fusion Center (FC) receives sensors decisions through
error-prone Binary Symmetric Channels (BSCs) and is in charge of performing a
(potentially) more-accurate global decision. The resulting problem is a
one-sided testing with nuisance parameters present only under the
target-present hypothesis. We first focus on fusion rules based on Generalized
Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), Bayesian and hybrid approaches. Then, aimed at
reducing the computational complexity, we develop fusion rules based on
generalizations of the well-known Locally-Optimum Detection (LOD) framework.
Finally, all the proposed rules are compared in terms of performance and
complexity.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchy Of Multi-label classifiers (HOMER) is a multi-label learning
algorithm that breaks the initial learning task to several, easier sub-tasks by
first constructing a hierarchy of labels from a given label set and secondly
employing a given base multi-label classifier (MLC) to the resulting
sub-problems. The primary goal is to effectively address class imbalance and
scalability issues that often arise in real-world multi-label classification
problems. In this work, we present the general setup for a HOMER model and a
simple extension of the algorithm that is suited for MLCs that output rankings.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of the properties of the algorithm,
both from an aspect of effectiveness and computational complexity. A secondary
contribution involves the presentation of a balanced variant of the k means
algorithm, which serves in the first step of the label hierarchy construction.
We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, studying
empirically HOMER's parameters and providing examples of instantiations of the
algorithm with different clustering approaches and MLCs, The empirical results
demonstrate a significant improvement over the given base MLC.

 <dc:description>  We describe a strategy for code modernisation of Gadget, a widely used
community code for computational astrophysics. The focus of this work is on
node-level performance optimisation, targeting current multi/many-core IntelR
architectures. We identify and isolate a sample code kernel, which is
representative of a typical Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm.
The code modifications include threading parallelism optimisation, change of
the data layout into Structure of Arrays (SoA), auto-vectorisation and
algorithmic improvements in the particle sorting. We obtain shorter execution
time and improved threading scalability both on Intel XeonR ($2.6 \times$ on
Ivy Bridge) and Xeon PhiTM ($13.7 \times$ on Knights Corner) systems. First few
tests of the optimised code result in $19.1 \times$ faster execution on second
generation Xeon Phi (Knights Landing), thus demonstrating the portability of
the devised optimisation solutions to upcoming architectures.

 <dc:title>On the Hierarchies for Deterministic, Nondeterministic and Probabilistic
  Ordered Read-k-times Branching Programs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khadiev, Kamil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper examines hierarchies for nondeterministic and deterministic ordered
read-$k$-times Branching programs. The currently known hierarchies for
deterministic $k$-OBDD models of Branching programs for $
k=o(n^{1/2}/\log^{3/2}n)$ are proved by B. Bollig, M. Sauerhoff, D. Sieling,
and I. Wegener in 1998. Their lower bound technique was based on communication
complexity approach. For nondeterministic $k$-OBDD it is known that, if $k$ is
constant then polynomial size $k$-OBDD computes same functions as polynomial
size OBDD (The result of Brosenne, Homeister and Waack, 2006). In the same time
currently known hierarchies for nondeterministic read $k$-times Branching
programs for $k=o(\sqrt{\log{n}}/\log\log{n})$ are proved by Okolnishnikova in
1997, and for probabilistic read $k$-times Branching programs for $k\leq \log
n/3$ are proved by Hromkovic and Saurhoff in 2003.
  We show that increasing $k$ for polynomial size nodeterministic $k$-OBDD
makes model more powerful if $k$ is not constant. Moreover, we extend the
hierarchy for probabilistic and nondeterministic $k$-OBDDs for $ k=o(n/ \log
n)$. These results extends hierarchies for read $k$-times Branching programs,
but $k$-OBDD has more regular structure. The lower bound techniques we propose
are a &quot;functional description&quot; of Boolean function presented by
nondeterministic $k$-OBDD and communication complexity technique. We present
similar hierarchies for superpolynomial and subexponential width
nondeterministic $k$-OBDDs.
  Additionally we expand the hierarchies for deterministic $k$-OBDDs using our
lower bounds for $ k=o(n/ \log n)$. We also analyze similar hierarchies for
superpolynomial and subexponential width $k$-OBDDs.

 <dc:description>  One of the major distinguishing features of the dynamic multiobjective
optimization problems (DMOPs) is the optimization objectives will change over
time, thus tracking the varying Pareto-optimal front becomes a challenge. One
of the promising solutions is reusing the &quot;experiences&quot; to construct a
prediction model via statistical machine learning approaches. However most of
the existing methods ignore the non-independent and identically distributed
nature of data used to construct the prediction model. In this paper, we
propose an algorithmic framework, called Tr-DMOEA, which integrates transfer
learning and population-based evolutionary algorithm for solving the DMOPs.
This approach takes the transfer learning method as a tool to help reuse the
past experience for speeding up the evolutionary process, and at the same time,
any population based multiobjective algorithms can benefit from this
integration without any extensive modifications. To verify this, we incorporate
the proposed approach into the development of three well-known algorithms,
nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), multiobjective particle
swarm optimization (MOPSO), and the regularity model-based multiobjective
estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA), and then employ twelve
benchmark functions to test these algorithms as well as compare with some
chosen state-of-the-art designs. The experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed method through exploiting machine learning
technology.

 <dc:description>  X-ray radiography is the most readily available imaging modality and has a
broad range of applications that spans from diagnosis to intra-operative
guidance in cardiac, orthopedics, and trauma procedures. Proper interpretation
of the hidden and obscured anatomy in X-ray images remains a challenge and
often requires high radiation dose and imaging from several perspectives. In
this work, we aim at decomposing the conventional X-ray image into d X-ray
components of independent, non-overlapped, clipped sub-volumes using deep
learning approach. Despite the challenging aspects of modeling such a highly
ill-posed problem, exciting and encouraging results are obtained paving the
path for further contributions in this direction.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new scalable algorithm for cross-modal similarity
preserving retrieval in a learnt manifold space. Unlike existing approaches
that compromise between preserving global and local geometries, the proposed
technique respects both simultaneously during manifold alignment. The global
topologies are maintained by recovering underlying mapping functions in the
joint manifold space by deploying partially corresponding instances. The
inter-, and intra-modality affinity matrices are then computed to reinforce
original data skeleton using perturbed minimum spanning tree (pMST), and
maximizing the affinity among similar cross-modal instances, respectively. The
performance of proposed algorithm is evaluated upon two multimodal image
datasets (coronary atherosclerosis histology and brain MRI) for two
applications: classification, and regression. Our exhaustive validations and
results demonstrate the superiority of our technique over comparative methods
and its feasibility for improving computer-assisted diagnosis systems, where
disease-specific complementary information shall be aggregated and interpreted
across modalities to form the final decision.

 <dc:description>  We propose a generalized construction for binary polar codes based on mixing
multiple kernels of different sizes in order to construct polar codes of block
lengths that are not only powers of integers. This results in a multi kernel
polar code with very good performance while the encoding complexity remains low
and the decoding follows the same general structure as for the original Arikan
polar codes. The construction provides numerous practical advantages as more
code lengths can be achieved without puncturing or shortening. We observe
numerically that the error-rate performance of our construction outperforms
stateof the-art constructions using puncturing methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the implementation and application possibilities of a
compact full duplex multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture where
direct communication exists between users, e.g., device-to-device (D2D) and
cellular link coexisting on the same spectrum. For the architecture of the
compact full duplex radio, we combine an analog self-interference canceler
based dual-polarization with high cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and
Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based per-subcarrier digital self-interference
canceler. While we consider the compactness and power efficiency of an analog
solution, we focus on the digital canceler design with robustness to a
frequency-selective channel and high compatibility with a conventional LTE
system. For an over-the-air wireless experiment of full duplex testbed with a
two-user-pair, we implement a full duplex MIMO physical layer (PHY), supporting
20 MHz bandwidth, on an FPGA-based software-defined radio platform. Further, we
propose a novel timing synchronization method to construct a more viable full
duplex MIMO link. By having the full duplex link prototype fully operating in
real-time, we present the first characterization of the proposed compact full
duplex MIMO performance depending on the transmit power of the full duplex
node. We also show the link quality between nodes. One of the crucial insights
of this work is that the full duplex operation of a user is capable of
acquiring the throughput gain if the user has self-interference capability with
guaranteed performance.

 <dc:description>  Complex networks are nowadays employed in several applications. Modeling
urban street networks is one of them, and in particular to analyze criminal
aspects of a city. Several research groups have focused on such application,
but until now, there is a lack of a well-defined methodology for employing
complex networks in a whole crime analysis process, i.e. from data preparation
to a deep analysis of criminal communities. Furthermore, the &quot;toolset&quot;
available for those works is not complete enough, also lacking techniques to
maintain up-to-date, complete crime datasets and proper assessment measures. In
this sense, we propose a threefold methodology for employing complex networks
in the detection of highly criminal areas within a city. Our methodology
comprises three tasks: (i) Mapping of Urban Crimes; (ii) Criminal Community
Identification; and (iii) Crime Analysis. Moreover, it provides a proper set of
assessment measures for analyzing intrinsic criminality of communities,
especially when considering different crime types. We show our methodology by
applying it to a real crime dataset from the city of San Francisco - CA, USA.
The results confirm its effectiveness to identify and analyze high criminality
areas within a city. Hence, our contributions provide a basis for further
developments on complex networks applied to crime analysis.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the observability radius of network systems, which
measures the robustness of a network to perturbations of the edges. We consider
linear networks, where the dynamics are described by a weighted adjacency
matrix, and dedicated sensors are positioned at a subset of nodes. We allow for
perturbations of certain edge weights, with the objective of preventing
observability of some modes of the network dynamics. To comply with the network
setting, our work considers perturbations with a desired sparsity structure,
thus extending the classic literature on the observability radius of linear
systems. The paper proposes two sets of results. First, we propose an
optimization framework to determine a perturbation with smallest Frobenius norm
that renders a desired mode unobservable from the existing sensor nodes.
Second, we study the expected observability radius of networks with given
structure and random edge weights. We provide fundamental robustness bounds
dependent on the connectivity properties of the network and we analytically
characterize optimal perturbations of line and star networks, showing that line
networks are inherently more robust than star networks.

 <dc:description>  Free web proxies promise anonymity and censorship circumvention at no cost.
Several websites publish lists of free proxies organized by country, anonymity
level, and performance. These lists index hundreds of thousand of hosts
discovered via automated tools and crowd-sourcing. A complex free proxy
ecosystem has been forming over the years, of which very little is known. In
this paper we shed light on this ecosystem via ProxyTorrent, a distributed
measurement platform that leverages both active and passive measurements.
Active measurements discover free proxies, assess their performance, and detect
potential malicious activities. Passive measurements relate to proxy
performance and usage in the wild, and are collected by free proxies users via
a Chrome plugin we developed. ProxyTorrent has been running since January 2017,
monitoring up to 180,000 free proxies and totaling more than 1,500 users. Our
analysis shows that less than 2% of the proxies announced on the web indeed
proxy traffic on behalf of users; further, only half of these proxies have
decent performance and can be used reliably. Around 10% of the working proxies
exhibit malicious behaviors, e.g., ads injection and TLS interception, and
these proxies are also the ones providing the best performance. Through the
analysis of more than 2 Terabytes of proxied traffic, we show that web browsing
is the primary user activity. Geo-blocking avoidance is not a prominent
use-case, with the exception of countries hosting popular geo-blocked content.

 <dc:description>  The demands on visual recognition systems do not end with the complexity
offered by current large-scale image datasets, such as ImageNet. In
consequence, we need curious and continuously learning algorithms that actively
acquire knowledge about semantic concepts which are present in available
unlabeled data. As a step towards this goal, we show how to perform continuous
active learning and exploration, where an algorithm actively selects relevant
batches of unlabeled examples for annotation. These examples could either
belong to already known or to yet undiscovered classes. Our algorithm is based
on a new generalization of the Expected Model Output Change principle for deep
architectures and is especially tailored to deep neural networks. Furthermore,
we show easy-to-implement approximations that yield efficient techniques for
active selection. Empirical experiments show that our method outperforms
currently used heuristics.

 <dc:description>  Ranking evaluation metrics are a fundamental element of design and
improvement efforts in information retrieval. We observe that most popular
metrics disregard information portrayed in the scores used to derive rankings,
when available. This may pose a numerical scaling problem, causing an under- or
over-estimation of the evaluation depending on the degree of divergence between
the scores of ranked items. The purpose of this work is to propose a principled
way of quantifying multi-graded relevance judgments of items and enable a more
accurate penalization of ordering errors in rankings. We propose a data-driven
generation of relevance functions based on the degree of the divergence amongst
a set of items' scores and its application in the evaluation metric Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). We use synthetic data to demonstrate the
interest of our proposal and a combination of data on news items from Google
News and their respective popularity in Twitter to show its performance in
comparison to the standard nDCG. Results show that our proposal is capable of
providing a more fine-grained evaluation of rankings when compared to the
standard nDCG, and that the latter frequently under- or over-estimates its
evaluation scores in light of the divergence of items' scores.

 <dc:description>  Training efficiency is one of the main problems for Neural Machine
Translation (NMT). Deep networks need for very large data as well as many
training iterations to achieve state-of-the-art performance. This results in
very high computation cost, slowing down research and industrialisation. In
this paper, we propose to alleviate this problem with several training methods
based on data boosting and bootstrap with no modifications to the neural
network. It imitates the learning process of humans, which typically spend more
time when learning &quot;difficult&quot; concepts than easier ones. We experiment on an
English-French translation task showing accuracy improvements of up to 1.63
BLEU while saving 20% of training time.

 <dc:title>Neural Machine Translation from Simplified Translations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Text simplification aims at reducing the lexical, grammatical and structural
complexity of a text while keeping the same meaning. In the context of machine
translation, we introduce the idea of simplified translations in order to boost
the learning ability of deep neural translation models. We conduct preliminary
experiments showing that translation complexity is actually reduced in a
translation of a source bi-text compared to the target reference of the bi-text
while using a neural machine translation (NMT) system learned on the exact same
bi-text. Based on knowledge distillation idea, we then train an NMT system
using the simplified bi-text, and show that it outperforms the initial system
that was built over the reference data set. Performance is further boosted when
both reference and automatic translations are used to learn the network. We
perform an elementary analysis of the translated corpus and report accuracy
results of the proposed approach on English-to-French and English-to-German
translation tasks.

 <dc:description>  Machine translation systems are very sensitive to the domains they were
trained on. Several domain adaptation techniques have been deeply studied. We
propose a new technique for neural machine translation (NMT) that we call
domain control which is performed at runtime using a unique neural network
covering multiple domains. The presented approach shows quality improvements
when compared to dedicated domains translating on any of the covered domains
and even on out-of-domain data. In addition, model parameters do not need to be
re-estimated for each domain, making this effective to real use cases.
Evaluation is carried out on English-to-French translation for two different
testing scenarios. We first consider the case where an end-user performs
translations on a known domain. Secondly, we consider the scenario where the
domain is not known and predicted at the sentence level before translating.
Results show consistent accuracy improvements for both conditions.

 <dc:description>  Domain adaptation is a key feature in Machine Translation. It generally
encompasses terminology, domain and style adaptation, especially for human
post-editing workflows in Computer Assisted Translation (CAT). With Neural
Machine Translation (NMT), we introduce a new notion of domain adaptation that
we call &quot;specialization&quot; and which is showing promising results both in the
learning speed and in adaptation accuracy. In this paper, we propose to explore
this approach under several perspectives.

 <dc:description>  With the tremendous advances of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) on
object recognition, we can now obtain reliable enough machine-labeled
annotations easily by predictions from off-the-shelf ConvNets. In this work, we
present an abstraction memory based framework for few-shot learning, building
upon machine-labeled image annotations. Our method takes some large-scale
machine-annotated datasets (e.g., OpenImages) as an external memory bank. In
the external memory bank, the information is stored in the memory slots with
the form of key-value, where image feature is regarded as key and label
embedding serves as value. When queried by the few-shot examples, our model
selects visually similar data from the external memory bank, and writes the
useful information obtained from related external data into another memory
bank, i.e., abstraction memory. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) controllers and
attention mechanisms are utilized to guarantee the data written to the
abstraction memory is correlated to the query example. The abstraction memory
concentrates information from the external memory bank, so that it makes the
few-shot recognition effective. In the experiments, we firstly confirm that our
model can learn to conduct few-shot object recognition on clean human-labeled
data from ImageNet dataset. Then, we demonstrate that with our model,
machine-labeled image annotations are very effective and abundant resources to
perform object recognition on novel categories. Experimental results show that
our proposed model with machine-labeled annotations achieves great performance,
only with a gap of 1% between of the one with human-labeled annotations.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the monitoring of logic-independent linear-time
user-provided properties in multi-threaded component-based systems. We consider
intrinsically independent components that can be executed concurrently with a
centralized coordination for multiparty interactions. In this context, the
problem that arises is that a global state of the system is not available to
the monitor. A naive solution to this problem would be to plug in a monitor
which would force the system to synchronize in order to obtain the sequence of
global states at runtime. Such a solution would defeat the whole purpose of
having concurrent components. Instead, we reconstruct on-the-fly the global
states by accumulating the partial states traversed by the system at runtime.
We define transformations of components that preserve their semantics and
concurrency and, at the same time, allow to monitor global-state properties.
Moreover, we present RVMT-BIP, a prototype tool implementing the
transformations for monitoring multi-threaded systems described in the BIP
(Behavior, Interaction, Priority) framework, an expressive framework for the
formal construction of heterogeneous systems. Our experiments on several
multi-threaded BIP systems show that RVMT-BIP induces a cheap runtime overhead.

 <dc:description>  We develop a method for the accurate reconstruction of non-bandlimited finite
rate of innovation signals on the sphere. For signals consisting of a finite
number of Dirac functions on the sphere, we develop an annihilating filter
based method for the accurate recovery of parameters of the Dirac functions
using a finite number of observations of the bandlimited signal. In comparison
to existing techniques, the proposed method enables more accurate
reconstruction primarily due to better conditioning of systems involved in the
recovery of parameters. For the recovery of $K$ Diracs on the sphere, the
proposed method requires samples of the signal bandlimited in the spherical
harmonic~(SH) domain at SH degree equal or greater than $ K + \sqrt{K +
\frac{1}{4}} - \frac{1}{2}$. In comparison to the existing state-of-the art
technique, the required bandlimit, and consequently the number of samples, of
the proposed method is the same or less. We also conduct numerical experiments
to demonstrate that the proposed technique is more accurate than the existing
methods by a factor of $10^{7}$ or more for $2 \le K\le 20$.

 <dc:description>  Collections of Web documents about specific topics are needed for many areas
of current research. Focused crawling enables the creation of such collections
on demand. Current focused crawlers require the user to manually specify
starting points for the crawl (seed URLs). These are also used to describe the
expected topic of the collection. The choice of seed URLs influences the
quality of the resulting collection and requires a lot of expertise. In this
demonstration we present the iCrawl Wizard, a tool that assists users in
defining focused crawls efficiently and semi-automatically. Our tool uses major
search engines and Social Media APIs as well as information extraction
techniques to find seed URLs and a semantic description of the crawl intent.
Using the iCrawl Wizard even non-expert users can create semantic
specifications for focused crawlers interactively and efficiently.

 <dc:description>  Attaining animal-like legged locomotion on rough outdoor terrain with sparse
foothold affordances -a primary use-case for legs vs other forms of locomotion-
is a largely open problem. New advancements in control and perception have
enabled bipeds to walk on flat and uneven indoor environments. But tasks that
require reliable contact with unstructured world surfaces, for example walking
on natural rocky terrain, need new perception and control algorithms.
  This thesis introduces 3D perception algorithms for contact tasks such as
foot placement in rough terrain environments. We introduce a new method to
identify and model potential contact areas between the robot's foot and a
surface using a set of bounded curved patches. We present a patch
parameterization model and an algorithm to fit and perceptually validate
patches to 3D point samples. Having defined the environment representation
using the patch model, we introduce a way to assemble patches into a spatial
map. This map represents a sparse set of local areas potentially appropriate
for contact between the robot and the surface. The process of creating such a
map includes sparse seed point sampling, neighborhood searching, as well as
patch fitting and validation. Various ways of sampling are introduced including
a real time bio-inspired system for finding patches statistically similar to
those that humans select while traversing rocky trails. These sparse patch
algorithms are integrated with a dense volumetric fusion of range data from a
moving depth camera, maintaining a dynamic patch map of relevant contact
surfaces around a robot in real time. We integrate and test the algorithms as
part of a real-time foothold perception system on a mini-biped robot,
performing foot placements on rocks.

 <dc:title>Crowd collectiveness measure via graph-based node clique learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Collectiveness motions of crowd systems have attracted a great deal of
attentions in recently years. In this paper, we try to measure the
collectiveness of a crowd system by the proposed node clique learning method.
The proposed method is a graph based method, and investigates the influence
from one node to other nodes. A node is represented by a set of nodes which
named a clique, which is obtained by spreading information from this node to
other nodes in graph. Then only nodes with sufficient information are selected
as the clique of this node. The motion coherence between two nodes is defined
by node cliques comparing. The collectiveness of a node and the collectiveness
of the crowd system are defined by the nodes coherence. Self-driven particle
(SDP) model and the crowd motion database are used to test the ability of the
proposed method in measuring collectiveness.

 <dc:description>  The user equilibrium traffic assignment principle is very important in the
traffic assignment problem. Mathematical programming models are designed to
solve the user equilibrium problem in traditional algorithms. Recently, the
Physarum shows the ability to address the user equilibrium and system
optimization traffic assignment problems. However, the Physarum model are not
efficient in real traffic networks with two-way traffic characteristics and
multiple origin-destination pairs. In this article, a modified
Physarum-inspired model for the user equilibrium problem is proposed. By
decomposing traffic flux based on origin nodes, the traffic flux from different
origin-destination pairs can be distinguished in the proposed model. The
Physarum can obtain the equilibrium traffic flux when no shorter path can be
discovered between each origin-destination pair. Finally, numerical examples
use the Sioux Falls network to demonstrate the rationality and convergence
properties of the proposed model.

 <dc:title>An extended Perona-Malik model based on probabilistic models</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Perona-Malik model has been very successful at restoring images from
noisy input. In this paper, we reinterpret the Perona-Malik model in the
language of Gaussian scale mixtures and derive some extensions of the model.
Specifically, we show that the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm applied
to Gaussian scale mixtures leads to the lagged-diffusivity algorithm for
computing stationary points of the Perona-Malik diffusion equations. Moreover,
we show how mean field approximations to these Gaussian scale mixtures lead to
a modification of the lagged-diffusivity algorithm that better captures the
uncertainties in the restoration. Since this modification can be hard to
compute in practice we propose relaxations to the mean field objective to make
the algorithm computationally feasible. Our numerical experiments show that
this modified lagged-diffusivity algorithm often performs better at restoring
textured areas and fuzzy edges than the unmodified algorithm. As a second
application of the Gaussian scale mixture framework, we show how an efficient
sampling procedure can be obtained for the probabilistic model, making the
computation of the conditional mean and other expectations algorithmically
feasible. Again, the resulting algorithm has a strong resemblance to the
lagged-diffusivity algorithm. Finally, we show that a probabilistic version of
the Mumford-Shah segementation model can be obtained in the same framework with
a discrete edge-prior.

 <dc:description>  The initial theoretical connections between Leontief input-output models and
Markov chains were established back in 1950s. However, considering the wide
variety of mathematical properties of Markov chains, there has not been a full
investigation of evolving world economic networks with Markov chain formalism.
Using the recently available world input-output database, we modeled the
evolution of the world economic network from 1995 to 2011 through analysis of a
series of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving
system via different properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time,
Kemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the
transition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and
Kemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we
focused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of
the economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional
index of economies. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk,
called systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio
of number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock
in the activity of a node and the latter is based on the number of times a
specific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the
other nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of
monetary flow across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect
of a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the
network. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high
structural power results to a slower average monetary flow over the network,
there are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the
network in terms of connectivity and the average monetary flow.

 <dc:title>RFexpress! - Exploiting the wireless network edge for RF-based emotion

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present RFexpress! the first-ever network-edge based system to recognize
emotion from movement, gesture and pose via Device-Free Activity Recognition
(DFAR). With the proliferation of the IoT, also wireless access points are
deployed at increasingly dense scale. in particular, this includes vehicular
nodes (in-car WiFi or Bluetooth), office (Wlan APs, WiFi printer or projector)
and private indoor domains (home WiFi mesh, Wireless media access), as well as
public spaces (City/open WiFi, Cafes, shopping spaces). Processing
RF-fluctuation at such edge-devices, enables environmental perception. In this
paper, we focus on the distinction between neutral and agitated emotional
states of humans from RF-fluctuation at the wireless network edge in realistic
environments. In particular, the system is able to detect risky driving
behaviour in a vehicular setting as well as spotting angry conversations in an
indoor environment. We also study the effectiveness of edge-based DFAR emotion
and activity recognition systems in real environments such as cafes, malls,
outdoor and office spaces. We measure radio characteristics in these
environments at different days and times and analyse the impact of variations
in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) on the accuracy of DFAR emotion and activity
recognition. In a case study with 5 subjects, we then exploit the limits of
edge-based DFAR by deriving critical SNR values under which activity and
emotion recognition results are no longer reliable. In case studies with 8 and
5 subjects the system further could achieve recognition accuracies of 82.9\%
and 64\% for vehicular and stationary wireless network edge in the wild
(non-laboratory noisy environments and non-scripted, natural individual
behaviour patterns).

 <dc:description>  Constraints such as separation-of-duty are widely used to specify
requirements that supplement basic authorization policies. However, the
existence of constraints (and authorization policies) may mean that a user is
unable to fulfill her/his organizational duties because access to resources has
been denied. In short, there is a tension between the need to protect resources
(using policies and constraints) and the availability of resources. Recent work
on workflow satisfiability and resiliency in access control asks whether this
tension compromises the ability of an organization to achieve its objectives.
In this paper, we develop a new method of specifying constraints which subsumes
much related work and allows a wider range of constraints to be specified. The
use of such constraints leads naturally to a range of questions related to
&quot;policy existence&quot;, where a positive answer means that an organization's
objectives can be realized. We analyze the complexity of these policy existence
questions and, for particular sub-classes of constraints defined by our
language, develop fixed-parameter tractable algorithms to solve them.

 <dc:description>  Analyzing textual data is a very challenging task because of the huge volume
of data generated daily. Fundamental issues in text analysis include the lack
of structure in document datasets, the need for various preprocessing steps
%(e.g., stem or lemma extraction, part-of-speech tagging, named entities
recognition...), and performance and scaling issues. Existing text analysis
architectures partly solve these issues, providing restrictive data schemas,
addressing only one aspect of text preprocessing and focusing on one single
task when dealing with performance optimization. %As a result, no definite
solution is currently available. Thus, we propose in this paper a new generic
text analysis architecture, where document structure is flexible, many
preprocessing techniques are integrated and textual datasets are indexed for
efficient access. We implement our conceptual architecture using both a
relational and a document-oriented database. Our experiments demonstrate the
feasibility of our approach and the superiority of the document-oriented
logical and physical implementation.

 <dc:description>  Researchers in the Digital Humanities and journalists need to monitor,
collect and analyze fresh online content regarding current events such as the
Ebola outbreak or the Ukraine crisis on demand. However, existing focused
crawling approaches only consider topical aspects while ignoring temporal
aspects and therefore cannot achieve thematically coherent and fresh Web
collections. Especially Social Media provide a rich source of fresh content,
which is not used by state-of-the-art focused crawlers. In this paper we
address the issues of enabling the collection of fresh and relevant Web and
Social Web content for a topic of interest through seamless integration of Web
and Social Media in a novel integrated focused crawler. The crawler collects
Web and Social Media content in a single system and exploits the stream of
fresh Social Media content for guiding the crawler.

 <dc:description>  The Travelling Salesman Problem is one of the most famous problems in graph

computers could speed up algorithms for the problem. In this paper, we prove a
quadratic quantum speedup when the degree of each vertex is at most 3 by
applying a quantum backtracking algorithm to a classical algorithm by Xiao and
Nagamochi. We then use similar techniques to accelerate a classical algorithm
for when the degree of each vertex is at most 4, before speeding up
higher-degree graphs via reductions to these instances.

 <dc:description>  Personal devices (e.g. laptops, tablets, and mobile phones) are conventional
in daily life and have the ability to store users' private data. The security
problems related to these appliances have become a primary concern for both
users and researchers. In this paper, we analyse first-person-view videos to
develop a personalized user authentication mechanism. Our proposed algorithm
generates provisional image-based passwords which benefit a variety of purposes
such as unlocking a mobile device or fallback authentication. First,
representative frames are extracted from the egocentric videos. Then, they are
split into distinguishable segments before a clustering procedure is applied to
discard repetitive scenes. The whole process aims to retain memorable images to
form the authentication challenges. We integrate eye tracking data to select
informative sequences of video frames and suggest a blurriness-based method if
an eye-facing camera is not available. To evaluate our system, we perform
experiments in different settings including object-interaction activities and
traveling contexts. Even though our mechanism produces variable graphical
passwords, the log-in effort for the user is comparable with approaches based
on static challenges. We verified the authentication challenges in the presence
of a random and an informed attacker who is familiar with the environment and
observed that the time required and the number of attempts are significantly
higher than for the legitimate user, making it possible to detect attacks on
the authentication system.

 <dc:description>  IT-security experts engage in behavior-based malware analysis in order to
learn about previously unknown samples of malicious software (malware) or
malware families. For this, they need to find and categorize suspicious
patterns from large collections of execution traces. Currently available
systems do not meet the analysts' needs described as: visual access suitable
for complex data structures, visual representations appropriate for IT-security
experts, provide work flow-specific interaction techniques, and the ability to
externalize knowledge in the form of rules to ease analysis and for sharing
with colleagues. To close this gap, we designed and developed KAMAS, a
knowledge-assisted visualization system for behavior-based malware analysis.
KAMAS supports malware analysts with visual analytics and knowledge
externalization methods for the analysis process. The paper at hand is a design
study that describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of the
prototype. We report on the validation of KAMAS by expert reviews, a user study
with domain experts, and focus group meetings with analysts from industry.
Additionally, we reflect the gained insights of the design study and discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of the applied visualization methods.

 <dc:description>  We investigate a subclass of languages recognized by vector addition systems,
namely languages of nondeterministic Parikh automata. While the regularity
problem (is the language of a given automaton regular?) is undecidable for this
model, we show surprising decidability of the regular separability problem:
given two Parikh automata, is there a regular language that contains one of
them and is disjoint from the other?

 <dc:description>  Given a sparse undirected graph G with weights on the edges, a k-plex
partition of G is a partition of its set of nodes such that each component is a
k-plex. A subset of nodes S is a k-plex if the degree of every node in the
associated induced subgraph is at least |S|-k. The maximum edge-weight k-plex
partitioning (Max-EkPP) problem is to find a k-plex partition with maximum
total weight, where the partition's weight is the sum of the weights on the
edges in the solution. When k=1, all components in the partition are cliques
and the problem becomes the well-known maximum edge-weight clique partitioning
(Max-ECP). However, and to our best knowledge, when k&gt;1, the problem has never
been modeled. Actually, the literature on the k-plex addresses the search for a
single component in an unweighted graph. We propose a polynomial size integer
linear programming formulation for the Max-EkPP problem and consider the
inclusion of additional topological constraints in the model. These constraints
involve lower and upper limit capacity bounds in each component and upper bound
constraints on the number of components in the final solution. All these
characterizations preserve linearity and the initial polynomial size of the
model. We also present computational tests in order to show the models'
performance under different parameters' settings. These tests resort to
benchmark and real-world graphs.

 <dc:description>  Blockchain is a distributed database that keeps a chronologically-growing
list (chain) of records (blocks) secure from tampering and revision. While
computerisation has changed the nature of a ledger from clay tables in the old
days to digital records in modern days, blockchain technology is the first true
innovation in record keeping that could potentially revolutionise the basic
principles of information keeping. In this note, we provide a brief
self-contained introduction to how the blockchain works.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of combining multiple bandit algorithms (that is, online
learning algorithms with partial feedback) with the goal of creating a master
algorithm that performs almost as well as the best base algorithm if it were to
be run on its own. The main challenge is that when run with a master, base
algorithms unavoidably receive much less feedback and it is thus critical that
the master not starve a base algorithm that might perform uncompetitively
initially but would eventually outperform others if given enough feedback. We
address this difficulty by devising a version of Online Mirror Descent with a
special mirror map together with a sophisticated learning rate scheme. We show
that this approach manages to achieve a more delicate balance between
exploiting and exploring base algorithms than previous works yielding superior
regret bounds.
  Our results are applicable to many settings, such as multi-armed bandits,
contextual bandits, and convex bandits. As examples, we present two main
applications. The first is to create an algorithm that enjoys worst-case
robustness while at the same time performing much better when the environment
is relatively easy. The second is to create an algorithm that works
simultaneously under different assumptions of the environment, such as
different priors or different loss structures.

 <dc:description>  Coexistence with Wi-Fi is the key issue for unlicensed band LTE. The main
coexistence mechanism is Listen-Before-Talk, whereby radio frequency energy is
sensed over a short period of time and compared to a threshold. Given the
default energy thresholds, the energy sensing range is actually much less than
the cell range. Both technologies can experience collisions due to transmission
being below energy detection threshold. Currently Wi-Fi is agnostic of LTE
presence in the unlicensed spectrum. To improve coexistence a communications
channel via relaying is proposed to be used by the unlicensed band LTE, to
announce its presence on an unlicensed channel. Legacy Wi-Fi APs may be
programmed to interpret and respond by firmware upgrade at the AP to enhance
its channel selection algorithm. Higher performance for both networks is
demonstrated via more effective radio frequency channel selection and adaptive
energy detection thresholding.

 <dc:description>  Deployment of small cell base stations (SBSs) overlaying the coverage area of
a macrocell BS (MBS) results in a two-tier hierarchical small cell network.
Cross-tier and inter-tier interference not only jeopardize primary macrocell
communication but also limit the spectral efficiency of small cell
communication. This paper focuses on distributed interference management for
downlink small cell networks. We address the optimization of transmit
strategies from both the game theoretical and the network utility maximization
(NUM) perspectives and show that they can be unified in a generalized Nash
equilibrium problem (GNEP) framework. Specifically, the small cell network
design is first formulated as a GNEP, where the SBSs and MBS compete for the
spectral resources by maximizing their own rates while satisfying global
quality of service (QoS) constraints. We analyze the GNEP via variational
inequality theory and propose distributed algorithms, which only require the
broadcasting of some pricing information, to achieve a generalized Nash
equilibrium (GNE). Then, we also consider a nonconvex NUM problem that aims to
maximize the sum rate of all BSs subject to global QoS constraints. We
establish the connection between the NUM problem and a penalized GNEP and show
that its stationary solution can be obtained via a fixed point iteration of the
GNE. We propose GNEP-based distributed algorithms that achieve a stationary
solution of the NUM problem at the expense of additional signaling overhead and
complexity. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is proved and guaranteed
for properly chosen algorithm parameters. The proposed GNEP framework can scale
from a QoS constrained game to a NUM design for small cell networks by trading
off signaling overhead and complexity.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new paradigm for sound source lo-calization referred
to as virtual acoustic space traveling (VAST) and presents a first dataset
designed for this purpose. Existing sound source localization methods are
either based on an approximate physical model (physics-driven) or on a
specific-purpose calibration set (data-driven). With VAST, the idea is to learn
a mapping from audio features to desired audio properties using a massive
dataset of simulated room impulse responses. This virtual dataset is designed
to be maximally representative of the potential audio scenes that the
considered system may be evolving in, while remaining reasonably compact. We
show that virtually-learned mappings on this dataset generalize to real data,
overcoming some intrinsic limitations of traditional binaural sound
localization methods based on time differences of arrival.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks are powerful and popular learning models that achieve
state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance on many computer vision,
speech, and language processing tasks. However, these networks have also been
shown susceptible to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations which force
misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to
subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and
could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world.
  In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate
that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any
internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an
oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be
observed on the probed inputs. Our first attack is based on a simple idea of
adding perturbation to a randomly selected single pixel or a small set of them.
We then improve the effectiveness of this attack by carefully constructing a
small set of pixels to perturb by using the idea of greedy local-search. Our
proposed attacks also naturally extend to a stronger notion of
misclassification. Our extensive experimental results illustrate that even
these elementary attacks can reveal a deep neural network's vulnerabilities.
The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could
serve as a litmus test for designing robust networks.

 <dc:title>Hybrid Transactional Replication: State-Machine and Deferred-Update
  Replication Combined</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose Hybrid Transactional Replication (HTR), a novel replication scheme
for highly dependable services. It combines two schemes: a transaction is
executed either optimistically by only one service replica in the deferred
update mode (DU), or deterministically by all replicas in the state machine
mode (SM); the choice is made by an oracle. The DU mode allows for parallelism
and thus takes advantage of multicore hardware. In contrast to DU, the SM mode
guarantees abort-free execution, so it is suitable for irrevocable operations
and transactions generating high contention. For expressiveness, transactions
can be discarded or retried on demand. We formally prove that the higher
flexibility of the scheme does not come at the cost of weaker guarantees for
clients: HTR satisfies strong consistency guarantees akin to those provided by
other popular transactional replication schemes such as Deferred Update
Replication. We developed HTR-enabled Paxos STM, an object-based distributed
transactional memory system, and evaluated it thoroughly under various
workloads. We show the benefits of using a novel oracle, which relies on
machine learning techniques for automatic adaptation to changing conditions. In
our tests, the ML-based oracle provides up to 50% improvement in throughput
when compared to the system running with DU-only or SM-only oracles. Our
approach is inspired by a well known algorithm used in the context of the
multi-armed bandit problem.

 <dc:description>  Online signature verification technologies, such as those available in banks
and post offices, rely on dedicated digital devices such as tablets or smart
pens to capture, analyze and verify signatures. In this paper, we suggest a
novel method for online signature verification that relies on the increasingly
available hand-worn devices, such as smartwatches or fitness trackers, instead
of dedicated ad-hoc devices. Our method uses a set of known genuine and forged
signatures, recorded using the motion sensors of a hand-worn device, to train a
machine learning classifier. Then, given the recording of an unknown signature
and a claimed identity, the classifier can determine whether the signature is
genuine or forged. In order to validate our method, it was applied on 1980
recordings of genuine and forged signatures that we collected from 66 subjects
in our institution. Using our method, we were able to successfully distinguish
between genuine and forged signatures with a high degree of accuracy (0.98 AUC
and 0.05 EER).

 <dc:description>  We propose an attentive local feature descriptor suitable for large-scale
image retrieval, referred to as DELF (DEep Local Feature). The new feature is
based on convolutional neural networks, which are trained only with image-level
annotations on a landmark image dataset. To identify semantically useful local
features for image retrieval, we also propose an attention mechanism for
keypoint selection, which shares most network layers with the descriptor. This
framework can be used for image retrieval as a drop-in replacement for other
keypoint detectors and descriptors, enabling more accurate feature matching and
geometric verification. Our system produces reliable confidence scores to
reject false positives---in particular, it is robust against queries that have
no correct match in the database. To evaluate the proposed descriptor, we
introduce a new large-scale dataset, referred to as Google-Landmarks dataset,
which involves challenges in both database and query such as background
clutter, partial occlusion, multiple landmarks, objects in variable scales,
etc. We show that DELF outperforms the state-of-the-art global and local
descriptors in the large-scale setting by significant margins.

 <dc:title>Coding against deletions in oblivious and online models</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider binary error correcting codes when errors are deletions. A basic
challenge concerning deletion codes is determining $p_0^{(adv)}$, the zero-rate
threshold of adversarial deletions, defined to be the supremum of all $p$ for
which there exists a code family with rate bounded away from 0 capable of
correcting a fraction $p$ of adversarial deletions. A recent construction of
deletion-correcting codes [Bukh et al 17] shows that $p_0^{(adv)} \ge
\sqrt{2}-1$, and the trivial upper bound, $p_0^{(adv)}\le\frac{1}{2}$, is the
best known. Perhaps surprisingly, we do not know whether or not $p_0^{(adv)} =
1/2$.
  In this work, to gain further insight into deletion codes, we explore two
related error models: oblivious deletions and online deletions, which are in
between random and adversarial deletions in power. In the oblivious model, the
channel can inflict an arbitrary pattern of $pn$ deletions, picked without
knowledge of the codeword. We prove the existence of binary codes of positive
rate that can correct any fraction $p &lt; 1$ of oblivious deletions, establishing
that the associated zero-rate threshold $p_0^{(obliv)}$ equals $1$.
  For online deletions, where the channel decides whether to delete bit $x_i$
based only on knowledge of bits $x_1x_2\dots x_i$, define the deterministic
zero-rate threshold for online deletions $p_0^{(on,d)}$ to be the supremum of
$p$ for which there exist deterministic codes against an online channel causing
$pn$ deletions with low average probability of error. That is, the probability
that a randomly chosen codeword is decoded incorrectly is small. We prove
$p_0^{(adv)}=\frac{1}{2}$ if and only if $p_0^{(on,d)}=\frac{1}{2}$.

 <dc:description>  Consider an open set $\mathbb{D}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, equipped with a
probability measure $\mu$. An important characteristic of a smooth function
$f:\mathbb{D}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is its second-moment matrix
$\Sigma_{\mu}:=\int \nabla f(x) (\nabla f(x))^* \mu(dx) \in\mathbb{R}^{n\times
n}$, where $\nabla f(x)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is the gradient of $f(\cdot)$ at
$x\in\mathbb{D}$. For instance, the span of the leading $r$ eigenvectors of
$\Sigma_{\mu}$ forms an active subspace of $f(\cdot)$, thereby extending the
concept of principal component analysis to the problem of ridge approximation.
In this work, we propose a simple algorithm for estimating $\Sigma_{\mu}$ from
point values of $f(\cdot)$ without imposing any structural assumptions on
$\Sigma_{\mu}$. Theoretical guarantees for this algorithm are established with
the aid of the same technical tools that have proved valuable in the context of
covariance matrix estimation from partial measurements.

 <dc:description>  Algorithms for equilibrium computation generally make no attempt to ensure
that the computed strategies are understandable by humans. For instance the
strategies for the strongest poker agents are represented as massive binary
files. In many situations, we would like to compute strategies that can
actually be implemented by humans, who may have computational limitations and
may only be able to remember a small number of features or components of the
strategies that have been computed. We study poker games where private
information distributions can be arbitrary. We create a large training set of
game instances and solutions, by randomly selecting the information
probabilities, and present algorithms that learn from the training instances in
order to perform well in games with unseen information distributions. We are
able to conclude several new fundamental rules about poker strategy that can be
easily implemented by humans.

 <dc:title>Semantic Jitter: Dense Supervision for Visual Comparisons via Synthetic

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Distinguishing subtle differences in attributes is valuable, yet learning to
make visual comparisons remains non-trivial. Not only is the number of possible
comparisons quadratic in the number of training images, but also access to
images adequately spanning the space of fine-grained visual differences is
limited. We propose to overcome the sparsity of supervision problem via
synthetically generated images. Building on a state-of-the-art image generation
engine, we sample pairs of training images exhibiting slight modifications of
individual attributes. Augmenting real training image pairs with these
examples, we then train attribute ranking models to predict the relative
strength of an attribute in novel pairs of real images. Our results on datasets
of faces and fashion images show the great promise of bootstrapping imperfect
image generators to counteract sample sparsity for learning to rank.

 <dc:description>  For any Borel probability measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, we may define a family
of eccentricity tensors. This new notion, together with a tensorization trick,
allows us to prove an energy minimization property for rotationally invariant
probability measures. We use this theory to give a new proof of the Welch
bounds, and to improve upon them for collections of real vectors. In addition,
we are able to give elementary proofs for two theorems characterizing
probability measures optimizing one-parameter families of energy integrals on
the sphere. We are also able to explain why a phase transition occurs for
optimizers of these two families.

 <dc:title>Random linear systems with sparse solutions -- finite dimensions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In our companion work \cite{Stojnicl1RegPosasymldp} we revisited random
under-determined linear systems with sparse solutions. The main emphasis was on
the performance analysis of the $\ell_1$ heuristic in the so-called asymptotic
regime, i.e. in the regime where the systems' dimensions are large. Through an
earlier sequence of work
\cite{DonohoPol,DonohoUnsigned,StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}, it is now well
known that in such a regime the $\ell_1$ exhibits the so-called \emph{phase
transition} (PT) phenomenon. \cite{Stojnicl1RegPosasymldp} then went much
further and established the so-called \emph{large deviations principle} (LDP)
type of behavior that characterizes not only the breaking points of the
$\ell_1$'s success but also the behavior in the entire so-called
\emph{transition zone} around these points. Both of these concepts, the PTs and
the LDPs, are in fact defined so that one can use them to characterize the
asymptotic behavior. In this paper we complement the results of
\cite{Stojnicl1RegPosasymldp} by providing an exact detailed analysis in the
non-asymptotic regime. Of course, not only are the non-asymptotic results
complementing those from \cite{Stojnicl1RegPosasymldp}, they actually are the
ones that ultimately fully characterize the $\ell_1$'s behavior in the most
general sense. We introduce several novel high-dimensional geometry type of
strategies that enable us to eventually determine the $\ell_1$'s behavior.

 <dc:description>  The radiation pattern of an antenna array depends on the excitation weights
and the geometry of the array. Due to wind and atmospheric conditions, outdoor
millimeter wave antenna elements are subject to full or partial blockages from
a plethora of particles like dirt, salt, ice, and water droplets. Handheld
devices are also subject to blockages from random finger placement and/or
finger prints. These blockages cause absorption and scattering to the signal
incident on the array, and change the array geometry. This distorts the
far-field radiation pattern of the array leading to an increase in the sidelobe
level and decrease in gain. This paper studies the effects of blockages on the
far-field radiation pattern of linear arrays and proposes two array diagnosis
techniques for millimeter wave antenna arrays. The proposed techniques jointly
estimate the locations of the blocked antennas and the induced attenuation and
phase shifts. Numerical results show that the proposed techniques provide
satisfactory results in terms of fault detection with reduced number of
measurements (diagnosis time) provided that the number of blockages is small
compared to the array size.

 <dc:description>  In Amazon EC2, cloud resources are sold through a combination of an on-demand
market, in which customers buy resources at a fixed price, and a spot market,
in which customers bid for an uncertain supply of excess resources. Standard
market environments suggest that an optimal design uses just one type of
market. We show the prevalence of a dual market system can be explained by
heterogeneous risk attitudes of customers. In our stylized model, we consider
unit demand risk-averse bidders. We show the model admits a unique equilibrium,
with higher revenue and higher welfare than using only spot markets.
Furthermore, as risk aversion increases, the usage of the on-demand market
increases. We conclude that risk attitudes are an important factor in cloud
resource allocation and should be incorporated into models of cloud markets.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel yet intuitive approach to unsupervised feature
learning. Inspired by the human visual system, we explore whether low-level
motion-based grouping cues can be used to learn an effective visual
representation. Specifically, we use unsupervised motion-based segmentation on
videos to obtain segments, which we use as 'pseudo ground truth' to train a
convolutional network to segment objects from a single frame. Given the
extensive evidence that motion plays a key role in the development of the human
visual system, we hope that this straightforward approach to unsupervised
learning will be more effective than cleverly designed 'pretext' tasks studied
in the literature. Indeed, our extensive experiments show that this is the
case. When used for transfer learning on object detection, our representation
significantly outperforms previous unsupervised approaches across multiple
settings, especially when training data for the target task is scarce.

 <dc:description>  Actions are more than just movements and trajectories: we cook to eat and we
hold a cup to drink from it. A thorough understanding of videos requires going
beyond appearance modeling and necessitates reasoning about the sequence of
activities, as well as the higher-level constructs such as intentions. But how
do we model and reason about these? We propose a fully-connected temporal CRF
model for reasoning over various aspects of activities that includes objects,
actions, and intentions, where the potentials are predicted by a deep network.
End-to-end training of such structured models is a challenging endeavor: For
inference and learning we need to construct mini-batches consisting of whole
videos, leading to mini-batches with only a few videos. This causes
high-correlation between data points leading to breakdown of the backprop
algorithm. To address this challenge, we present an asynchronous variational
inference method that allows efficient end-to-end training. Our method achieves
a classification mAP of 22.4% on the Charades benchmark, outperforming the
state-of-the-art (17.2% mAP), and offers equal gains on the task of temporal
localization.

 <dc:description>  In meetings where important decisions get made, what items receive more
attention may influence the outcome. We examine how different types of
rhetorical (de-)emphasis -- including hedges, superlatives, and contrastive
conjunctions -- correlate with what gets revisited later, controlling for item
frequency and speaker. Our data consists of transcripts of recurring meetings
of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC), where important aspects
of U.S. monetary policy are decided on. Surprisingly, we find that words
appearing in the context of hedging, which is usually considered a way to
express uncertainty, are more likely to be repeated in subsequent meetings,
while strong emphasis indicated by superlatives has a slightly negative effect
on word recurrence in subsequent meetings. We also observe interesting patterns
in how these effects vary depending on social factors such as status and gender
of the speaker. For instance, the positive effects of hedging are more
pronounced for female speakers than for male speakers.

 <dc:title>Complexity theory for spaces of integrable functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Steinberg, Florian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates second-order representations in the sense of Kawamura
and Cook for spaces of integrable functions that regularly show up in analysis.
It builds upon prior work about the space of continuous functions on the unit
interval: Kawamura and Cook introduced a representation inducing the right
complexity classes and proved that it is the weakest second-order
representation such that evaluation is polynomial-time computable. The first
part of this paper provides a similar representation for the space of
integrable functions on a bounded subset of Euclidean space: The weakest
representation rendering integration over boxes is polynomial-time computable.
In contrast to the representation of continuous functions, however, this
representation turns out to be discontinuous with respect to both the norm and
the weak topology. The second part modifies the representation to be continuous
and generalizes it to Lp-spaces. The arising representations are proven to be
computably equivalent to the standard representations of these spaces as metric
spaces and to still render integration polynomial-time computable. The family
is extended to cover Sobolev spaces on the unit interval, where less basic
operations like differentiation and some Sobolev embeddings are shown to be
polynomial-time computable. Finally as a further justification quantitative
versions of the Arzel\`a-Ascoli and Fr\'echet-Kolmogorov Theorems are presented
and used to argue that these representations fulfill a minimality condition. To
provide tight bounds for the Fr\'echet-Kolmogorov Theorem, a form of
exponential time computability of the norm of Lp is proven.

 <dc:description>  Distributed surveillance systems have become popular in recent years due to
security concerns. However, transmitting high dimensional data in
bandwidth-limited distributed systems becomes a major challenge. In this paper,
we address this issue by proposing a novel probabilistic algorithm based on the
divergence between the probability distributions of the visual features in
order to reduce their dimensionality and thus save the network bandwidth in
distributed wireless smart camera networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach through extensive experiments on two surveillance
recognition tasks.

 <dc:title>Fractal Descriptors of Texture Images Based on the Triangular Prism

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work presents a novel descriptor for texture images based on fractal
geometry and its application to image analysis. The descriptors are provided by
estimating the triangular prism fractal dimension under different scales with a
weight exponential parameter, followed by dimensionality reduction using
Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve transform. The efficiency of the proposed descriptors is
tested on two well-known texture data sets, that is, Brodatz and Vistex, both
for classification and image retrieval. The novel method is also tested
concerning invariances in situations when the textures are rotated or affected
by Gaussian noise. The obtained results outperform other classical and
state-of-the-art descriptors in the literature and demonstrate the power of the
triangular descriptors in these tasks, suggesting their use in practical
applications of image analysis based on texture features.

 <dc:description>  Newly available data on the spatial distribution of retail activities in
cities makes it possible to build models formalized at the level of the single
retailer. Current models tackle consumer location choices at an aggregate level
and the opportunity new data offers for modeling at the retail unit level lacks
a theoretical framework. The model we present here helps to address these
issues. It is a particular case of the Cross-Nested Logit model, based on
random utility theory built with the idea of quantifying the role of floor
space and agglomeration in retail location choice. We test this model on the
city of London: the results are consistent with a super linear scaling of a
retailer's attractiveness with its floor space, and with an agglomeration
effect approximated as the total retail floorspace within a $325m$ radius from
each shop.

 <dc:description>  To recognize textures many methods have been developed along the years.
However, texture datasets may be hard to be classified due to artefacts such as
a variety of scale, illumination and noise. This paper proposes the application
of binary distance transform on the original dataset to add information to
texture representation and consequently improve recognition. Texture images,
usually in grayscale, suffers a binarization prior to distance transform and
one of the resulted images are combined with original texture to improve the
amount of information. Four datasets are used to evaluate our approach. For
Outex dataset, for instance, the proposal outperforms all rates, improvements
of an up to 10\%, compared to traditional approach where descriptors are
applied on the original dataset, showing the importance of this approach.

 <dc:title>Fine Asymptotics for Universal One-to-One Compression of Parametric

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Universal source coding at short blocklengths is considered for an
exponential family of distributions. The \emph{Type Size} code has previously
been shown to be optimal up to the third-order rate for universal compression
of all memoryless sources over finite alphabets. The Type Size code assigns
sequences ordered based on their type class sizes to binary strings ordered
lexicographically. To generalize this type class approach for parametric
sources, a natural scheme is to define two sequences to be in the same type
class if and only if they are equiprobable under any model in the parametric
class. This natural approach, however, is shown to be suboptimal. A variation
of the Type Size code is introduced, where type classes are defined based on
neighborhoods of minimal sufficient statistics. Asymptotics of the overflow
rate of this variation are derived and a converse result establishes its
optimality up to the third-order term. These results are derived for parametric
families of $i.i.d.$ sources as well as Markov sources.

 <dc:description>  The latest technological advancements in the telecommunications domain (e.g.,
widespread adoption of mobile devices, introduction of 5G wireless
communications, etc.) have brought new stakeholders into the spotlight. More
specifically, Over-the-Top (OTT) providers have recently appeared, offering
their services over the existing deployed telecommunication networks. The entry
of the new players has changed the dynamics in the domain, as it creates
conflicting situations with the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), who
traditionally dominate the area, motivating the necessity for novel analytical
studies for this relationship. However, despite the importance of accessing
real observational data, there is no database with the aggregate information
that can serve as a solid base for this research. To that end, this document
provides a detailed summary report for financial and statistic data for the
period 2008-2013 that can be exploited for realistic econometric models that
will provide useful insights on this topic. The document summarizes data from
various sources with regard to the ISP revenues and Capital Expenditures
(CAPEX), the OTT revenues, the Internet penetration and the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), taking into account three big OTT providers (i.e., Facebook,
Skype, WhatsApp) and ten major ISPs that operate in seven different countries.

 <dc:title>Exploring Structure for Long-Term Tracking of Multiple Objects in Sports

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for exploiting structural
relations to track multiple objects that may undergo long-term occlusion and
abrupt motion. We use a model-free approach that relies only on annotations
given in the first frame of the video to track all the objects online, i.e.
without knowledge from future frames. We initialize a probabilistic Attributed
Relational Graph (ARG) from the first frame, which is incrementally updated
along the video. Instead of using the structural information only to evaluate
the scene, the proposed approach considers it to generate new tracking
hypotheses. In this way, our method is capable of generating relevant object
candidates that are used to improve or recover the track of lost objects. The
proposed method is evaluated on several videos of table tennis, volleyball, and
on the ACASVA dataset. The results show that our approach is very robust,
flexible and able to outperform other state-of-the-art methods in sports videos
that present structural patterns.

 <dc:description>  Multispectral imaging is an important technique for improving the readability
of written or printed text where the letters have faded, either due to
deliberate erasing or simply due to the ravages of time. Often the text can be
read simply by looking at individual wavelengths, but in some cases the images
need further enhancement to maximise the chances of reading the text. There are
many possible enhancement techniques and this paper assesses and compares an
extended set of dimensionality reduction methods for image processing. We
assess 15 dimensionality reduction methods in two different manuscripts. This
assessment was performed both subjectively by asking the opinions of scholars
who were experts in the languages used in the manuscripts which of the
techniques they preferred and also by using the Davies-Bouldin and Dunn indexes
for assessing the quality of the resulted image clusters. We found that the
Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) method which was using a Matlab
implementation and we have used previously to enhance multispectral images, it
was indeed superior to all the other tested methods. However it is very likely
that other approaches will be more suitable in specific circumstance so we
would still recommend that a range of these techniques are tried. In
particular, CVA is a supervised clustering technique so it requires
considerably more user time and effort than a non-supervised technique such as
the much more commonly used Principle Component Analysis Approach (PCA). If the
results from PCA are adequate to allow a text to be read then the added effort
required for CVA may not be justified. For the purposes of comparing the
computational times and the image results, a CVA method is also implemented in
C programming language and using the GNU (GNUs Not Unix) Scientific Library
(GSL) and the OpenCV (OPEN source Computer Vision) computer vision programming
library.

bicycle model is used to define the non-holonomic system and a stability
analysis with different integration methods is performed on the dynamics of the
system. A proper integration method is chosen with a reasonably large step size
in order to decrease the computation time. When the tree is close enough to
destination the algorithm returns the path and in order to connect the tree to
destination point an optimal control problem using single shooting method is
defined. To test the algorithm different scenarios are tested and the
simulation results show the success of the algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The Nystrom method has been popular for generating the low-rank approximation
of kernel matrices that arise in many machine learning problems. The
approximation quality of the Nystrom method depends crucially on the number of
selected landmark points and the selection procedure. In this paper, we present
a novel algorithm to compute the optimal Nystrom low-approximation when the
number of landmark points exceed the target rank. Moreover, we introduce a
randomized algorithm for generating landmark points that is scalable to
large-scale data sets. The proposed method performs K-means clustering on
low-dimensional random projections of a data set and, thus, leads to
significant savings for high-dimensional data sets. Our theoretical results
characterize the tradeoffs between the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed
method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance as well
as the efficiency of our proposed method.

 <dc:description>  The sorting number of a graph with $n$ vertices is the minimum depth of a
sorting network with $n$ inputs and outputs that uses only the edges of the
graph to perform comparisons. Many known results on sorting networks can be
stated in terms of sorting numbers of different classes of graphs. In this
paper we show the following general results about the sorting number of graphs.
  Any $n$-vertex graph that contains a simple path of length $d$ has a sorting
network of depth $O(n \log(n/d))$.
  Any $n$-vertex graph with maximal degree $\Delta$ has a sorting network of
depth $O(\Delta n)$.
  We also provide several results that relate the sorting number of a graph
with its routing number, size of its maximal matching, and other well known
graph properties. Additionally, we give some new bounds on the sorting number
for some typical graphs.

 <dc:description>  Parsing accuracy using efficient greedy transition systems has improved
dramatically in recent years thanks to neural networks. Despite striking
results in dependency parsing, however, neural models have not surpassed
state-of-the-art approaches in constituency parsing. To remedy this, we
introduce a new shift-reduce system whose stack contains merely sentence spans,
represented by a bare minimum of LSTM features. We also design the first
provably optimal dynamic oracle for constituency parsing, which runs in
amortized O(1) time, compared to O(n^3) oracles for standard dependency
parsing. Training with this oracle, we achieve the best F1 scores on both
English and French of any parser that does not use reranking or external data.

 <dc:description>  We consider a committee voting setting in which each voter approves of a
subset of candidates and based on the approvals, a target number of candidates
are selected. Aziz et al. (2015) proposed two representation axioms called
justified representation and extended justified representation. Whereas the
former can be tested as well as achieved in polynomial time, the latter
property is coNP-complete to test and no polynomial-time algorithm is known to
achieve it. Interestingly, S{\'a}nchez-Fern{\'a}ndez et~al. (2016) proposed an
intermediate property called proportional justified representation that admits
a polynomial-time algorithm to achieve. The complexity of testing proportional
justified representation has remained an open problem. In this paper, we settle
the complexity by proving that testing proportional justified representation is
coNP-complete. We complement the complexity result by showing that the problem
admits efficient algorithms if any of the following parameters are bounded: (1)
number of voters (2) number of candidates (3) maximum number of candidates
approved by a voter (4) maximum number of voters approving a given candidate.

 <dc:description>  Image segmentation is a popular area of research in computer vision that has
many applications in automated image processing. A recent technique called
piecewise flat embeddings (PFE) has been proposed for use in image
segmentation; PFE transforms image pixel data into a lower dimensional
representation where similar pixels are pulled close together and dissimilar
pixels are pushed apart. This technique has shown promising results, but its
original formulation is not computationally feasible for large images. We
propose two improvements to the algorithm for computing PFE: first, we
reformulate portions of the algorithm to enable various linear algebra
operations to be performed in parallel; second, we propose utilizing an
iterative linear solver (preconditioned conjugate gradient) to quickly solve a
linear least-squares problem that occurs in the inner loop of a nested
iteration. With these two computational improvements, we show on a publicly
available image database that PFE can be sped up by an order of magnitude
without sacrificing segmentation performance. Our results make this technique
more practical for use on large data sets, not only for image segmentation, but
for general data clustering problems.

 <dc:description>  In pattern classification, polynomial classifiers are well-studied methods as
they are capable of generating complex decision surfaces. Unfortunately, the
use of multivariate polynomials is limited to kernels as in support vector
machines, because polynomials quickly become impractical for high-dimensional
problems. In this paper, we effectively overcome the curse of dimensionality by
employing the tensor train format to represent a polynomial classifier. Based
on the structure of tensor trains, two learning algorithms are proposed which
involve solving different optimization problems of low computational
complexity. Furthermore, we show how both regularization to prevent overfitting
and parallelization, which enables the use of large training sets, are
incorporated into these methods. Both the efficiency and efficacy of our
tensor-based polynomial classifier are then demonstrated on the two popular
datasets USPS and MNIST.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing has emerged as a powerful and elastic platform for internet
service hosting, yet it also draws concerns of the unpredictable performance of
cloud-based services due to network congestion. To offer predictable
performance, the virtual cluster abstraction of cloud services has been
proposed, which enables allocation and performance isolation regarding both
computing resources and network bandwidth in a simplified virtual network
model. One issue arisen in virtual cluster allocation is the survivability of
tenant services against physical failures. Existing works have studied virtual
cluster backup provisioning with fixed primary embeddings, but have not
considered the impact of primary embeddings on backup resource consumption. To
address this issue, in this paper we study how to embed virtual clusters
survivably in the cloud data center, by jointly optimizing primary and backup
embeddings of the virtual clusters. We formally define the survivable virtual
cluster embedding problem. We then propose a novel algorithm, which computes
the most resource-efficient embedding given a tenant request. Since the optimal
algorithm has high time complexity, we further propose a faster heuristic
algorithm, which is several orders faster than the optimal solution, yet able
to achieve similar performance. Besides theoretical analysis, we evaluate our
algorithms via extensive simulations.

 <dc:description>  Regularization-based image restoration has remained an active research topic
in computer vision and image processing. It often leverages a guidance signal
captured in different fields as an additional cue. In this work, we present a
general framework for image restoration, called deeply aggregated alternating
minimization (DeepAM). We propose to train deep neural network to advance two
of the steps in the conventional AM algorithm: proximal mapping and ?-
continuation. Both steps are learned from a large dataset in an end-to-end
manner. The proposed framework enables the convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
to operate as a prior or regularizer in the AM algorithm. We show that our
learned regularizer via deep aggregation outperforms the recent data-driven
approaches as well as the nonlocalbased methods. The flexibility and
effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated in several image restoration
tasks, including single image denoising, RGB-NIR restoration, and depth
super-resolution.

 <dc:title>Random linear under-determined systems with block-sparse solutions --

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider random linear under-determined systems with
block-sparse solutions. A standard subvariant of such systems, namely,
precisely the same type of systems without additional block structuring
requirement, gained a lot of popularity over the last decade. This is of course
in first place due to the success in mathematical characterization of an
$\ell_1$ optimization technique typically used for solving such systems,
initially achieved in \cite{CRT,DOnoho06CS} and later on perfected in
\cite{DonohoPol,DonohoUnsigned,StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}. The success
that we achieved in \cite{StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10} characterizing the
standard sparse solutions systems, we were then able to replicate in a sequence
of papers
\cite{StojnicCSetamBlock09,StojnicUpperBlock10,StojnicICASSP09block,StojnicJSTSP09}
where instead of the standard $\ell_1$ optimization we utilized its an
$\ell_2/\ell_1$ variant as a better fit for systems with block-sparse
solutions. All of these results finally settled the so-called threshold/phase
transitions phenomena (which naturally assume the asymptotic/large dimensional
scenario). Here, in addition to a few novel asymptotic considerations, we also
try to raise the level a bit, step a bit away from the asymptotics, and
consider the finite dimensions scenarios as well.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the research community has discovered that deep neural
networks (DNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield higher
accuracy than all previous solutions to a broad array of machine learning
problems. To our knowledge, there is no single CNN/DNN architecture that solves
all problems optimally. Instead, the &quot;right&quot; CNN/DNN architecture varies
depending on the application at hand. CNN/DNNs comprise an enormous design
space. Quantitatively, we find that a small region of the CNN design space
contains 30 billion different CNN architectures.
  In this dissertation, we develop a methodology that enables systematic
exploration of the design space of CNNs. Our methodology is comprised of the
following four themes.
  1. Judiciously choosing benchmarks and metrics.
  2. Rapidly training CNN models.
  3. Defining and describing the CNN design space.
  4. Exploring the design space of CNN architectures.
  Taken together, these four themes comprise an effective methodology for
discovering the &quot;right&quot; CNN architectures to meet the needs of practical
applications.

 <dc:description>  With the evolution of heterogeneous computing system, such as
network-on-chip, high-performance distributed computing, accelerator-rich
architectures and cluster computing, high-speed, energy-efficient and
low-latency interfaces among memory-to-processor and processor-to-processor
become the key technology to enable those technologies. Simultaneously, the
scaling of CMOS makes the switching speed of the transistor up to sub-THz.
Radio-frequency or even millimeter-wave modulated signaling interconnect has
unique features in ultra-low power operation, dynamic allocation of bandwidth
and low latency, compared with convention baseband signaling interconnect. In
this work, we overview the different generations of radio-frequency
interconnect (RF-I) technology, compare them with conventional baseband
signaling interconnect technologies. The limitations and potentials are also
discussed in the end.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We explore 3D human pose estimation from a single RGB image. While many
approaches try to directly predict 3D pose from image measurements, we explore
a simple architecture that reasons through intermediate 2D pose predictions.
Our approach is based on two key observations (1) Deep neural nets have
revolutionized 2D pose estimation, producing accurate 2D predictions even for
poses with self occlusions. (2) Big-data sets of 3D mocap data are now readily
available, making it tempting to lift predicted 2D poses to 3D through simple
memorization (e.g., nearest neighbors). The resulting architecture is trivial
to implement with off-the-shelf 2D pose estimation systems and 3D mocap
libraries. Importantly, we demonstrate that such methods outperform almost all
state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation systems, most of which directly try to
regress 3D pose from 2D measurements.

 <dc:description>  Axiomatizing mathematical structures is a goal of Mathematical Logic.
Axiomatizability of the theories of some structures have turned out to be quite
difficult and challenging, and some remain open. However axiomatization of some
mathematical structures are now classical theorems in Logic, Algebra and
Geometry. In this paper we will study the axiomatizability of the theories of
multiplication in the domains of natural, integer, rational, real, and complex
numbers. We will review some classical theorems, and will give some new proofs
for old results. We will see that some structures are missing in the
literature, thus leaving it open whether the theories of that structures are
axiomatizable (decidable) or not. We will answer one of those open questions in
this paper.

 <dc:description>  The theory of addition in the domains of natural (N), integer (Z), rational
(Q), real (R) and complex (C) numbers is decidable, so is the theory of
multiplication in all those domains. By Godel's Incompleteness Theorem the
theory of addition and multiplication is undecidable in the domains of N, Z and
Q, though Tarski proved that this theory is decidable in the domains of R and
C. The theory of multiplication and order (x,&lt;) behaves differently in the
above mentioned domains of numbers. By a theorem of Robinson, addition is
definable by multiplication and order in the domain of natural numbers, thus
the theory (N;x,&lt;) is undecidable. By a classical theorem in mathematical
logic, addition is not definable in terms of multiplication and order in R. In
this paper, we extend Robinson's theorem to the domain of integers (Z) by
showing the definability of addition in (Z;x,&lt;), this implies that (Z;x,&lt;) is
undecidable. We also show the decidability of (Q;x,&lt;) by the method of
quantifier elimination. Whence, addition is not definable in (Q;x,&lt;).

 <dc:description>  We investigate solving discrete optimisation problems using the estimation of
distribution (EDA) approach via a novel combination of deep belief
networks(DBN) and inductive logic programming (ILP).While DBNs are used to
learn the structure of successively better feasible solutions,ILP enables the
incorporation of domain-based background knowledge related to the goodness of
solutions.Recent work showed that ILP could be an effective way to use domain
knowledge in an EDA scenario.However,in a purely ILP-based EDA,sampling
successive populations is either inefficient or not straightforward.In our
Neuro-symbolic EDA,an ILP engine is used to construct a model for good
solutions using domain-based background knowledge.These rules are introduced as
Boolean features in the last hidden layer of DBNs used for EDA-based
optimization.This incorporation of logical ILP features requires some changes
while training and sampling from DBNs: (a)our DBNs need to be trained with data
for units at the input layer as well as some units in an otherwise hidden
layer, and (b)we would like the samples generated to be drawn from instances
entailed by the logical model.We demonstrate the viability of our approach on
instances of two optimisation problems: predicting optimal depth-of-win for the
KRK endgame,and jobshop scheduling.Our results are promising: (i)On each
iteration of distribution estimation,samples obtained with an ILP-assisted DBN
have a substantially greater proportion of good solutions than samples
generated using a DBN without ILP features, and (ii)On termination of
distribution estimation,samples obtained using an ILP-assisted DBN contain more
near-optimal samples than samples from a DBN without ILP features.These results
suggest that the use of ILP-constructed theories could be useful for
incorporating complex domain-knowledge into deep models for estimation of
distribution based procedures.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose the first model to be able to generate visually
grounded questions with diverse types for a single image. Visual question
generation is an emerging topic which aims to ask questions in natural language
based on visual input. To the best of our knowledge, it lacks automatic methods
to generate meaningful questions with various types for the same visual input.
To circumvent the problem, we propose a model that automatically generates
visually grounded questions with varying types. Our model takes as input both
images and the captions generated by a dense caption model, samples the most
probable question types, and generates the questions in sequel. The
experimental results on two real world datasets show that our model outperforms
the strongest baseline in terms of both correctness and diversity with a wide
margin.

 <dc:title>DOA Estimation of Coherent Signals on Coprime Arrays Exploiting
  Fourth-Order Cumulants</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of
coherent signals on passive coprime arrays, where we resort to the fourth-order
cumulants of the received signal to explore more information. A fourth-order
cumulant matrix (FCM) is introduced for the coprime arrays. The special
structure of the FCM is combined with the array configuration to resolve the
coherent signals. Since each sparse array of the coprime arrays is uniform, a
series of overlapping identical subarrays can be extracted. Using this
property, we propose a generalized spatial smoothing scheme applied to the FCM.
From the smoothed FCM, the DOAs of both the coherent and independent signals
can be successfully estimated on the pseudo-spectrum generated by the
fourth-order MUSIC algorithm. To overcome the problem of occasional false peak
appearing on the pseudo-spectrum, we use a supplementary sparse array whose
inter-sensor spacing is coprime to that of either existing sparse array. From
the combined spectrum aided by the supplementary sensors, the false peaks are
removed while the true peaks remain. The effectiveness of the proposed methods
is demonstrated by simulation examples.

 <dc:title>Wide-Slice Residual Networks for Food Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Food diary applications represent a tantalizing market. Such applications,
based on image food recognition, opened to new challenges for computer vision
and pattern recognition algorithms. Recent works in the field are focusing
either on hand-crafted representations or on learning these by exploiting deep
neural networks. Despite the success of such a last family of works, these
generally exploit off-the shelf deep architectures to classify food dishes.
Thus, the architectures are not cast to the specific problem. We believe that
better results can be obtained if the deep architecture is defined with respect
to an analysis of the food composition. Following such an intuition, this work
introduces a new deep scheme that is designed to handle the food structure.
Specifically, inspired by the recent success of residual deep network, we
exploit such a learning scheme and introduce a slice convolution block to
capture the vertical food layers. Outputs of the deep residual blocks are
combined with the sliced convolution to produce the classification score for
specific food categories. To evaluate our proposed architecture we have
conducted experimental results on three benchmark datasets. Results demonstrate
that our solution shows better performance with respect to existing approaches
(e.g., a top-1 accuracy of 90.27% on the Food-101 challenging dataset).

 <dc:description>  We show that any classical two-way communication protocol with shared
randomness that can approximately simulate the result of applying an arbitrary
measurement (held by one party) to a quantum state of $n$ qubits (held by
another), up to constant accuracy, must transmit at least $\Omega(2^n)$ bits.
This lower bound is optimal and matches the complexity of a simple protocol
based on discretisation using an $\epsilon$-net. The proof is based on a lower
bound on the classical communication complexity of a distributed variant of the
Fourier sampling problem. We obtain two optimal quantum-classical separations
as easy corollaries. First, a sampling problem which can be solved with one
quantum query to the input, but which requires $\Omega(N)$ classical queries
for an input of size $N$. Second, a nonlocal task which can be solved using $n$
Bell pairs, but for which any approximate classical solution must communicate
$\Omega(2^n)$ bits.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks with attention have proven effective for many natural
language processing tasks. In this paper, we develop attention mechanisms for
uncertainty detection. In particular, we generalize standardly used attention
mechanisms by introducing external attention and sequence-preserving attention.
These novel architectures differ from standard approaches in that they use
external resources to compute attention weights and preserve sequence
information. We compare them to other configurations along different dimensions
of attention. Our novel architectures set the new state of the art on a
Wikipedia benchmark dataset and perform similar to the state-of-the-art model
on a biomedical benchmark which uses a large set of linguistic features.

 <dc:title>The Impact of the Filter Bubble -- A Simulation Based Framework for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The term filter bubble has been coined to describe the situation of online
users which---due to filtering algorithms---live in a personalised information
universe biased towards their own interests.In this paper we use an agent-based
simulation framework to measure the actual risk and impact of filter bubble
effects occurring in online communities due to content or author based
personalisation algorithms. Observing the strength of filter bubble effects
allows for opposing the benefits to the risks of personalisation.In our
simulation we observed, that filter bubble effects occur as soon as users
indicate preferences towards certain topics.We also saw, that well connected
users are affected much stronger than average or poorly connected users.
Finally, our experimental setting indicated that the employed personalisation
algorithm based on content features seems to bear a lower risk of filter bubble
effects than one performing personalisation based on authors.

 <dc:title>Dictionary Learning Based Sparse Channel Representation and Estimation
  for FDD Massive MIMO Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ding, Yacong</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rao, Bhaskar D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Downlink beamforming in FDD Massive MIMO systems is challenging due to the
large training and feedback overhead, which is proportional to the number of
antennas deployed at the base station, incurred by traditional downlink channel
estimation techniques. Leveraging the compressive sensing framework, compressed
channel estimation algorithm has been applied to obtain accurate channel
estimation with reduced training and feedback overhead, proportional to the
sparsity level of the channel. The prerequisite for using compressed channel
estimation is the existence of a sparse channel representation. This paper
proposes a new sparse channel model based on dictionary learning which adapts
to the cell characteristics and promotes a sparse representation. The learned
dictionary is able to more robustly and efficiently represent the channel and
improve downlink channel estimation accuracy. Furthermore, observing the
identical AOA/AOD between the uplink and downlink transmission, a joint uplink
and downlink dictionary learning and compressed channel estimation algorithm is
proposed to perform downlink channel estimation utilizing information from the
simpler uplink training, which further improves downlink channel estimation.
Numerical results are presented to show the robustness and efficiency of the
proposed dictionary learning based channel model and compressed channel
estimation algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Traditional pedestrian collision warning systems sometimes raise alarms even
when there is no danger (e.g., when all pedestrians are walking on the
sidewalk). These false alarms can make it difficult for drivers to concentrate
on their driving. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for an end-to-end
pedestrian collision warning system based on a convolutional neural network.
Semantic segmentation information is used to train the convolutional neural
network and two loss functions, such as cross entropy and Euclidean losses, are
minimized. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing
false alarms and increasing warning accuracy compared to a traditional
histogram of oriented gradients (HoG)-based system.

 <dc:description>  Reconstructing the causal network in a complex dynamical system plays a
crucial role in many applications, from sub-cellular biology to economic
systems. Here we focus on inferring gene regulation networks (GRNs) from
perturbation or gene deletion experiments. Despite their scientific merit, such
perturbation experiments are not often used for such inference due to their
costly experimental procedure, requiring significant resources to complete the
measurement of every single experiment. To overcome this challenge, we develop
the Robust IDentification of Sparse networks (RIDS) method that reconstructs
the GRN from a small number of perturbation experiments. Our method uses the
gene expression data observed in each experiment and translates that into a
steady state condition of the system's nonlinear interaction dynamics. Applying
a sparse optimization criterion, we are able to extract the parameters of the
underlying weighted network, even from very few experiments. In fact, we
demonstrate analytically that, under certain conditions, the GRN can be
perfectly reconstructed using $K = \Omega (d_{max})$ perturbation experiments,
where $d_{max}$ is the maximum in-degree of the GRN, a small value for
realistic sparse networks, indicating that RIDS can achieve high performance
with a scalable number of experiments. We test our method on both synthetic and
experimental data extracted from the DREAM5 network inference challenge. We
show that the RIDS achieves superior performance compared to the
state-of-the-art methods, while requiring as few as ~60% less experimental
data. Moreover, as opposed to almost all competing methods, RIDS allows us to
infer the directionality of the GRN links, allowing us to infer empirical GRNs,
without relying on the commonly provided list of transcription factors.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new unsupervised approach for dialogue act induction.
Given the sequence of dialogue utterances, the task is to assign them the
labels representing their function in the dialogue.
  Utterances are represented as real-valued vectors encoding their meaning. We
model the dialogue as Hidden Markov model with emission probabilities estimated
by Gaussian mixtures. We use Gibbs sampling for posterior inference.
  We present the results on the standard Switchboard-DAMSL corpus. Our
algorithm achieves promising results compared with strong supervised baselines
and outperforms other unsupervised algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The detection of small road hazards, such as lost cargo, is a vital
capability for self-driving cars. We tackle this challenging and rarely
addressed problem with a vision system that leverages appearance, contextual as
well as geometric cues. To utilize the appearance and contextual cues, we
propose a new deep learning-based obstacle detection framework. Here a variant
of a fully convolutional network is used to predict a pixel-wise semantic
labeling of (i) free-space, (ii) on-road unexpected obstacles, and (iii)
background. The geometric cues are exploited using a state-of-the-art detection
approach that predicts obstacles from stereo input images via model-based
statistical hypothesis tests. We present a principled Bayesian framework to
fuse the semantic and stereo-based detection results. The mid-level Stixel
representation is used to describe obstacles in a flexible, compact and robust
manner. We evaluate our new obstacle detection system on the Lost and Found
dataset, which includes very challenging scenes with obstacles of only 5 cm
height. Overall, we report a major improvement over the state-of-the-art, with
relative performance gains of up to 50%. In particular, we achieve a detection
rate of over 90% for distances of up to 50 m. Our system operates at 22 Hz on
our self-driving platform.

 <dc:description>  The isiZulu verb is known for its morphological complexity, which is a
subject for on-going linguistics research, as well as for prospects of
computational use, such as controlled natural language interfaces, machine
translation, and spellcheckers. To this end, we seek to answer the question as
to what the precise grammar rules for the isiZulu complex verb are (and, by
extension, the Bantu verb morphology). To this end, we iteratively specify the
grammar as a Context Free Grammar, and evaluate it computationally. The grammar
presented in this paper covers the subject and object concords, negation,
present tense, aspect, mood, and the causative, applicative, stative, and the
reciprocal verbal extensions, politeness, the wh-question modifiers, and aspect
doubling, ensuring their correct order as they appear in verbs. The grammar
conforms to specification.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes customer product-choice behavior based on the recency and
frequency of each customer's page views on e-commerce sites. Recently, we
devised an optimization model for estimating product-choice probabilities that
satisfy monotonicity, convexity, and concavity constraints with respect to
recency and frequency. This shape-restricted model delivered high predictive
performance even when there were few training samples. However, typical
e-commerce sites deal in many different varieties of products, so the
predictive performance of the model can be further improved by integration of
such product heterogeneity. For this purpose, we develop a novel latent-class
shape-restricted model for estimating product-choice probabilities for each
latent class of products. We also give a tailored expectation-maximization
algorithm for parameter estimation. Computational results demonstrate that
higher predictive performance is achieved with our latent-class model than with
the previous shape-restricted model and common latent-class logistic
regression.

 <dc:description>  The Wisdom of Crowds (WOC), as a theory in the social science, gets a new
paradigm in computer science. The WOC theory explains that the aggregate
decision made by a group is often better than those of its individual members
if specific conditions are satisfied. This paper presents a novel framework for
unsupervised and semi-supervised cluster ensemble by exploiting the WOC theory.
We employ four conditions in the WOC theory, i.e., diversity, independency,
decentralization and aggregation, to guide both the constructing of individual
clustering results and the final combination for clustering ensemble. Firstly,
independency criterion, as a novel mapping system on the raw data set, removes
the correlation between features on our proposed method. Then, decentralization
as a novel mechanism generates high-quality individual clustering results.
Next, uniformity as a new diversity metric evaluates the generated clustering
results. Further, weighted evidence accumulation clustering method is proposed
for the final aggregation without using thresholding procedure. Experimental
study on varied data sets demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Robust visual tracking is a challenging computer vision problem, with many
real-world applications. Most existing approaches employ hand-crafted
appearance features, such as HOG or Color Names. Recently, deep RGB features
extracted from convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied for
tracking. Despite their success, these features only capture appearance
information. On the other hand, motion cues provide discriminative and
complementary information that can improve tracking performance. Contrary to
visual tracking, deep motion features have been successfully applied for action
recognition and video classification tasks. Typically, the motion features are
learned by training a CNN on optical flow images extracted from large amounts
of labeled videos.
  This paper presents an investigation of the impact of deep motion features in
a tracking-by-detection framework. We further show that hand-crafted, deep RGB,
and deep motion features contain complementary information. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to propose fusing appearance information with deep
motion features for visual tracking. Comprehensive experiments clearly suggest
that our fusion approach with deep motion features outperforms standard methods
relying on appearance information alone.

 <dc:description>  In this work we design and compare different supervised learning algorithms
to compute the cost of Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). The
motivation for quick calculation of OPF cost outcomes stems from the growing
need of algorithmic-based long-term and medium-term planning methodologies in
power networks. Integrated in a multiple time-horizon coordination framework,
we refer to this approximation module as a proxy for predicting short-term
decision outcomes without the need of actual simulation and optimization of
them. Our method enables fast approximate calculation of OPF cost with less
than 1% error on average, achieved in run-times that are several orders of
magnitude lower than of exact computation. Several test-cases such as
IEEE-RTS96 are used to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.

 <dc:description>  We present a linear functional calculus with both the safety guarantees
expressible with linear types and the rich language of combinators and
composition provided by functional programming. Unlike previous combinations of
linear typing and functional programming, we compromise neither the linear side
(for example, our linear values are first-class citizens of the language) nor
the functional side (for example, we do not require duplicate definitions of
compositions for linear and unrestricted functions). To do so, we must
generalize abstraction and application to encompass both linear and
unrestricted functions. We capture the typing of the generalized constructs
with a novel use of qualified types. Our system maintains the metatheoretic
properties of the theory of qualified types, including principal types and
decidable type inference. Finally, we give a formal basis for our claims of
expressiveness, by showing that evaluation respects linearity, and that our
language is a conservative extension of existing functional calculi.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of Target Activity Detection (TAD) for
binaural listening devices. TAD denotes the problem of robustly detecting the
activity of a target speaker in a harsh acoustic environment, which comprises
interfering speakers and noise (cocktail party scenario). In previous work, it
has been shown that employing a Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) for detecting
the target speaker activity is a promising approach to combine the advantage of
different TAD features (used as network inputs). In this contribution, we
exploit a larger context window for TAD and compare the performance of FNNs and
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with an explicit focus on small network
topologies as desirable for embedded acoustic signal processing systems. More
specifically, the investigations include a comparison between three different
types of RNNs, namely plain RNNs, Long Short-Term Memories, and Gated Recurrent
Units. The results indicate that all versions of RNNs outperform FNNs for the
task of TAD.

network detection algorithms, we set out to find the determinants of the
cosponsorship patterns. The algorithms detect the initiative networks core
communities, after which the variables characterizing the core communities can
be analyzed. We found legislative network communities being best characterized
by the MPs' party affiliations. The budget motion networks, which constitute
roughly half of the data, were found mostly characterized by the MPs' home
constituencies and only to a limited extent by the MPs' party affiliations. In
comparison to previous findings regarding certain presidential systems, MPs
committee assignments or gender were found irrelevant.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel directional modulation (DM) scheme based on
random frequency diverse arrays with artificial noise (RFDA-DM-AN) to enhance
physical layer security of wireless communications. Specifically, we first
design the RFDA-DM-AN scheme by randomly allocating frequencies to transmit
antennas, thereby achieving two-dimensionally (i.e., angle and range) secure
transmissions, and outperforming the state-of-the-art one-dimensional (i.e.,
angle) phase array (PA) based DM scheme. Then we develop the closed-form
expression of a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) of our
RFDA-DM-AN scheme. Based on the theoretical lower bound derived, we further
optimize the transmission power allocation between the useful signal and
artificial noise (AN) in order to enhance the ESC. Simulation results show that
1) our RFDA-DM-AN scheme achieves a higher secrecy capacity than that of the PA
based DM scheme, 2) the lower bound derived is shown to approach the ESC as the
number of transmit antennas N increases and precisely matches the ESC when N is
sufficiently large, and 3) the proposed optimum power allocation achieves the
highest ESC compared with other power allocations in the RFDA-DM-AN.

 <dc:title>Physical-Layer Security for Spectrum Sharing Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zou, Yulong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we examine the physical-layer security for a spectrum sharing
system consisting of multiple source-destination pairs, which dynamically
access their shared spectrum for data transmissions in the presence of an
eavesdropper. We propose a source cooperation (SC) aided opportunistic jamming
framework for protecting the transmission confidentiality of the spectrum
sharing system against eavesdropping. Specifically, when a source node is
allowed to access the shared spectrum for data transmissions, another source is
opportunistically selected in the spectrum sharing system to transmit an
artificial noise for disrupting the eavesdropper without affecting the
legitimate transmissions. We present two specific SC aided opportunistic
jamming schemes, namely the SC aided random jammer selection (RJS) and optimal
jammer selection (OJS), which are referred to as the SC-RJS and SC-OJS,
respectively. We also consider the conventional non-cooperation as a baseline.
We derive closed-form intercept probability expressions for the
non-cooperation, SC-RJS and SC-OJS schemes, based on which their secrecy
diversity gains are determined through an asymptotic intercept probability
analysis in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. It is proved that the
conventional non-cooperation exhibits a secrecy diversity of zero, whereas the
proposed SC-RJS and SC-OJS achieve a higher secrecy diversity of one. This also
surprisingly means that no additional secrecy diversity gain is achieved by the
optimal jammer selection compared to the random selection strategy. In
addition, numerical results show that the intercept probability performance of
the SC-OJS is always better than that of the SC-RJS and non-cooperation, even
when the legitimate channel is worse than the eavesdropping channel.

 <dc:description>  Methods of high-dimensional probability play a central role in applications
for statistics, signal processing theoretical computer science and related
fields. These lectures present a sample of particularly useful tools of
high-dimensional probability, focusing on the classical and matrix Bernstein's
inequality and the uniform matrix deviation inequality. We illustrate these
tools with applications for dimension reduction, network analysis, covariance
estimation, matrix completion and sparse signal recovery. The lectures are
geared towards beginning graduate students who have taken a rigorous course in
probability but may not have any experience in data science applications.

 <dc:description>  Stream processing is mainstream (again): Widely-used stream libraries are now
available for virtually all modern OO and functional languages, from Java to C#
to Scala to OCaml to Haskell. Yet expressivity and performance are still
lacking. For instance, the popular, well-optimized Java 8 streams do not
support the zip operator and are still an order of magnitude slower than
hand-written loops. We present the first approach that represents the full
generality of stream processing and eliminates overheads, via the use of
staging. It is based on an unusually rich semantic model of stream interaction.
We support any combination of zipping, nesting (or flat-mapping), sub-ranging,
filtering, mapping-of finite or infinite streams. Our model captures
idiosyncrasies that a programmer uses in optimizing stream pipelines, such as
rate differences and the choice of a &quot;for&quot; vs. &quot;while&quot; loops. Our approach
delivers hand-written-like code, but automatically. It explicitly avoids the
reliance on black-box optimizers and sufficiently-smart compilers, offering
highest, guaranteed and portable performance. Our approach relies on high-level
concepts that are then readily mapped into an implementation. Accordingly, we
have two distinct implementations: an OCaml stream library, staged via
MetaOCaml, and a Scala library for the JVM, staged via LMS. In both cases, we
derive libraries richer and simultaneously many tens of times faster than past
work. We greatly exceed in performance the standard stream libraries available
in Java, Scala and OCaml, including the well-optimized Java 8 streams.

 <dc:description>  Due to limited metering infrastructure, distribution grids are currently
challenged by observability issues. On the other hand, smart meter data,
including local voltage magnitudes and power injections, are communicated to
the utility operator from grid buses with renewable generation and
demand-response programs. This work employs grid data from metered buses
towards inferring the underlying grid state. To this end, a coupled formulation
of the power flow problem (CPF) is put forth. Exploiting the high variability
of injections at metered buses, the controllability of solar inverters, and the
relative time-invariance of conventional loads, the idea is to solve the
non-linear power flow equations jointly over consecutive time instants. An
intuitive and easily verifiable rule pertaining to the locations of metered and
non-metered buses on the physical grid is shown to be a necessary and
sufficient criterion for local observability in radial networks. To account for
noisy smart meter readings, a coupled power system state estimation (CPSSE)
problem is further developed. Both CPF and CPSSE tasks are tackled via
augmented semi-definite program relaxations. The observability criterion along
with the CPF and CPSSE solvers are numerically corroborated using synthetic and
actual solar generation and load data on the IEEE 34-bus benchmark feeder.

 <dc:description>  The Ring Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem, whose security is based on hard
ideal lattice problems, has proven to be a promising primitive with diverse
applications in cryptography. There are however recent discoveries of faster
algorithms for the principal ideal SVP problem, and attempts to generalize the
attack to non-principal ideals. In this work, we study the LWE problem on group
rings, and build cryptographic schemes based on this new primitive. One can
regard the LWE on cyclotomic integers as a special case when the underlying
group is cyclic, while our proposal utilizes non-commutative groups, which
eliminates the weakness associated with the principal ideal lattices. In
particular, we show how to build public key encryption schemes from dihedral
group rings, which maintains the efficiency of the ring-LWE and improves its
security.

 <dc:description>  For the purposes of computational dialectology or other geographically bound
text analysis tasks, texts must be annotated with their or their authors'
location. Many texts are locatable through explicit labels but most have no
explicit annotation of place. This paper describes a series of experiments to
determine how positionally annotated microblog posts can be used to learn
location-indicating words which then can be used to locate blog texts and their
authors. A Gaussian distribution is used to model the locational qualities of
words. We introduce the notion of placeness to describe how locational words
are.
  We find that modelling word distributions to account for several locations
and thus several Gaussian distributions per word, defining a filter which picks
out words with high placeness based on their local distributional context, and
aggregating locational information in a centroid for each text gives the most
useful results. The results are applied to data in the Swedish language.

 <dc:description>  An uncertain graph $\mathcal{G} = (V, E, p : E \rightarrow (0,1])$ can be
viewed as a probability space whose outcomes (referred to as \emph{possible
worlds}) are subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}$ where any edge $e\in E$ occurs with
probability $p(e)$, independently of the other edges. These graphs naturally
arise in many application domains where data management systems are required to
cope with uncertainty in interrelated data, such as computational biology,
social network analysis, network reliability, and privacy enforcement, among
the others. For this reason, it is important to devise fundamental querying and
mining primitives for uncertain graphs. This paper contributes to this endeavor
with the development of novel strategies for clustering uncertain graphs.
Specifically, given an uncertain graph $\mathcal{G}$ and an integer $k$, we aim
at partitioning its nodes into $k$ clusters, each featuring a distinguished
center node, so to maximize the minimum/average connection probability of any
node to its cluster's center, in a random possible world. We assess the
NP-hardness of maximizing the minimum connection probability, even in the
presence of an oracle for the connection probabilities, and develop efficient
approximation algorithms for both problems and some useful variants. Unlike
previous works in the literature, our algorithms feature provable approximation
guarantees and are capable to keep the granularity of the returned clustering
under control. Our theoretical findings are complemented with several
experiments that compare our algorithms against some relevant competitors, with
respect to both running-time and quality of the returned clusterings.

 <dc:description>  We adopted an approach based on an LSTM neural network to monitor and detect
faults in industrial multivariate time series data. To validate the approach we
created a Modelica model of part of a real gasoil plant. By introducing hacks
into the logic of the Modelica model, we were able to generate both the roots
and causes of fault behavior in the plant. Having a self-consistent data set
with labeled faults, we used an LSTM architecture with a forecasting error
threshold to obtain precision and recall quality metrics. The dependency of the
quality metric on the threshold level is considered. An appropriate mechanism
such as &quot;one handle&quot; was introduced for filtering faults that are outside of
the plant operator field of interest.

 <dc:description>  Reward function design and exploration time are arguably the biggest
obstacles to the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real
world. In many real-world tasks, designing a reward function takes considerable
hand engineering and often requires additional sensors to be installed just to
measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many
interesting tasks consist of multiple implicit intermediate steps that must be
executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not
necessarily provide feedback on these intermediate steps. To address these
issues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual
representations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward
functions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is
able to identify key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of
demonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative
features for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in
a pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit specification of
sub-goals. The resulting reward functions can then be used by an RL agent to
learn to perform the task in real-world settings. To evaluate the learned
reward, we present qualitative results on two real-world tasks and a
quantitative evaluation against a human-designed reward function. We also show
that our method can be used to learn a real-world door opening skill using a
real robot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by
a human using their own hand. To our knowledge, these are the first results
showing that complex robotic manipulation skills can be learned directly and
without supervised labels from a video of a human performing the task.

 <dc:description>  Miniature Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) are very suitable for flying in indoor
environments, but autonomous navigation is challenging due to their strict
hardware limitations. This paper presents a highly efficient computer vision
algorithm called Edge-FS for the determination of velocity and depth. It runs
at 20 Hz on a 4 g stereo camera with an embedded STM32F4 microprocessor (168
MHz, 192 kB) and uses feature histograms to calculate optical flow and stereo
disparity. The stereo-based distance estimates are used to scale the optical
flow in order to retrieve the drone's velocity. The velocity and depth
measurements are used for fully autonomous flight of a 40 g pocket drone only

and avoid obstacles.

 <dc:description>  Motivation: Recognizing human actions in a video is a challenging task which
has applications in various fields. Previous works in this area have either
used images from a 2D or 3D camera. Few have used the idea that human actions
can be easily identified by the movement of the joints in the 3D space and
instead used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for modeling. Convolutional
neural networks (CNN) have the ability to recognise even the complex patterns
in data which makes it suitable for detecting human actions. Thus, we modeled a
CNN which can predict the human activity using the joint data. Furthermore,
using the joint data representation has the benefit of lower dimensionality
than image or video representations. This makes our model simpler and faster
than the RNN models. In this study, we have developed a six layer convolutional
network, which reduces each input feature vector of the form 15x1961x4 to an
one dimensional binary vector which gives us the predicted activity. Results:
Our model is able to recognise an activity correctly upto 87% accuracy. Joint
data is taken from the Cornell Activity Datasets which have day to day
activities like talking, relaxing, eating, cooking etc.

 <dc:description>  A dominant paradigm for deep learning based object detection relies on a
&quot;bottom-up&quot; approach using &quot;passive&quot; scoring of class agnostic proposals. These
approaches are efficient but lack of holistic analysis of scene-level context.
In this paper, we present an &quot;action-driven&quot; detection mechanism using our
&quot;top-down&quot; visual attention model. We localize an object by taking sequential
actions that the attention model provides. The attention model conditioned with
an image region provides required actions to get closer toward a target object.
An action at each time step is weak itself but an ensemble of the sequential
actions makes a bounding-box accurately converge to a target object boundary.
This attention model we call AttentionNet is composed of a convolutional neural
network. During our whole detection procedure, we only utilize the actions from
a single AttentionNet without any modules for object proposals nor post
bounding-box regression. We evaluate our top-down detection mechanism over the
PASCAL VOC series and ILSVRC CLS-LOC dataset, and achieve state-of-the-art
performances compared to the major bottom-up detection methods. In particular,
our detection mechanism shows a strong advantage in elaborate localization by
outperforming Faster R-CNN with a margin of +7.1% over PASCAL VOC 2007 when we
increase the IoU threshold for positive detection to 0.7.

 <dc:title>Local Sparse Approximation for Image Restoration with Adaptive Block

 <dc:description>  In this paper the problem of image restoration (denoising and inpainting) is
approached using sparse approximation of local image blocks. The local image
blocks are extracted by sliding square windows over the image. An adaptive
block size selection procedure for local sparse approximation is proposed,
which affects the global recovery of underlying image. Ideally the adaptive
local block selection yields the minimum mean square error (MMSE) in recovered
image. This framework gives us a clustered image based on the selected block
size, then each cluster is restored separately using sparse approximation. The
results obtained using the proposed framework are very much comparable with the
recently proposed image restoration techniques.

 <dc:title>All the {\lambda}-Terms are Meaningful for the Infinitary Relational
  Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vial, Pierre</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Infinite types and formulas are known to have really curious and unsound
behaviors. For instance, they allow to type {\Omega}, the auto- autoapplication
and they thus do not ensure any form of normalization/productivity. Moreover,
in most infinitary frameworks, it is not difficult to define a type R that can
be assigned to every {\lambda}-term. However, these observations do not say
much about what coinductive (i.e. infinitary) type grammars are able to
provide: it is for instance very difficult to know what types (besides R) can
be assigned to a given term in this setting. We begin with a discussion on the
expressivity of different forms of infinite types. Then, using the
resource-awareness of sequential intersection types (system S) and tracking, we
prove that infinite types are able to characterize the order (arity) of every
{\lambda}-terms and that, in the infinitary extension of the relational model,
every term has a &quot;meaning&quot; i.e. a non-empty denotation. From the technical
point of view, we must deal with the total lack of productivity guarantee for
typable terms: we do so by importing methods inspired by first order model
theory.

 <dc:description>  Bitcoin is a digital currency and electronic payment system operating over a
peer-to-peer network on the Internet. One of its most important properties is
the high level of anonymity it provides for its users. The users are identified
by their Bitcoin addresses, which are random strings in the public records of
transactions, the blockchain. When a user initiates a Bitcoin-transaction, his
Bitcoin client program relays messages to other clients through the Bitcoin
network. Monitoring the propagation of these messages and analyzing them
carefully reveal hidden relations. In this paper, we develop a mathematical
model using a probabilistic approach to link Bitcoin addresses and transactions
to the originator IP address. To utilize our model, we carried out experiments
by installing more than a hundred modified Bitcoin clients distributed in the
network to observe as many messages as possible. During a two month observation
period we were able to identify several thousand Bitcoin clients and bind their
transactions to geographical locations.

 <dc:description>  Retrieval of live, user-broadcast video streams is an under-addressed and
increasingly relevant challenge. The on-line nature of the problem requires
temporal evaluation and the unforeseeable scope of potential queries motivates
an approach which can accommodate arbitrary search queries. To account for the
breadth of possible queries, we adopt a no-example approach to query retrieval,
which uses a query's semantic relatedness to pre-trained concept classifiers.
To adapt to shifting video content, we propose memory pooling and memory
welling methods that favor recent information over long past content. We
identify two stream retrieval tasks, instantaneous retrieval at any particular
time and continuous retrieval over a prolonged duration, and propose means for
evaluating them. Three large scale video datasets are adapted to the challenge
of stream retrieval. We report results for our search methods on the new stream
retrieval tasks, as well as demonstrate their efficacy in a traditional,
non-streaming video task.

 <dc:description>  We present a feature vector formation technique for documents - Sparse
Composite Document Vector (SCDV) - which overcomes several shortcomings of the
current distributional paragraph vector representations that are widely used
for text representation. In SCDV, word embedding's are clustered to capture
multiple semantic contexts in which words occur. They are then chained together
to form document topic-vectors that can express complex, multi-topic documents.
Through extensive experiments on multi-class and multi-label classification
tasks, we outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, NTSG (Liu et al.,
2015a). We also show that SCDV embedding's perform well on heterogeneous tasks
like Topic Coherence, context-sensitive Learning and Information Retrieval.
Moreover, we achieve significant reduction in training and prediction times
compared to other representation methods. SCDV achieves best of both worlds -
better performance with lower time and space complexity.

 <dc:description>  Texture is an important characteristic for many types of images. In recent
years very discriminative and computationally efficient local texture
descriptors based on local binary patterns (LBP) have been developed, which has
led to significant progress in applying texture methods to different problems
and applications. Due to this progress, the division between texture
descriptors and more generic image or video descriptors has been disappearing.
A large number of different variants of LBP have been developed to improve its
robustness, and to increase its discriminative power and applicability to
different types of problems. In this chapter, the most recent and important
variants of LBP in 2D, spatiotemporal, 3D, and 4D domains are surveyed.
Interesting new developments of LBP in 1D signal analysis are also considered.
Finally, some future challenges for research are presented.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In [1], we introduced a new, matrix algebraic, performance analysis framework
for wireless systems with fading channels based on the matrix exponential
distribution. The main idea was to use the compact, powerful, and easy-to-use,
matrix exponential (ME)-distribution for i) modeling the unprocessed channel
signal to noise ratio (SNR), ii) exploiting the closure property of the
ME-distribution for SNR processing operations to give the effective channel
random variable (r.v.) on ME-distribution form, and then to iii) express the
performance measure in a closed-form based on ME-distribution matrix/vector
parameters only. In this work, we aim to more clearly present, formalize,
refine and develop this unified bottom-up analysis framework, show its
versatility to handle important communication cases, performance evaluation
levels, and performance metrics. The bivariate ME-distribution is introduced
here as yet another useful ME-tool, e.g. to account for dependency among two
r.v.s. We propose that the ME-distribution may, in addition to fading, also
characterize the pdf of discrete-time signal r.v.s, thus extending the
ME-distribution matrix form to new generalized 1D/2D-Gaussian-, and Rayleigh-,
distribution-like matrix forms. Our findings here, strengthen the observation
from [1], [2], and indicates that the ME-distribution can be a promising tool
for wireless system modeling and performance analysis.

 <dc:description>  Review score prediction of text reviews has recently gained a lot of
attention in recommendation systems. A major problem in models for review score
prediction is the presence of noise due to user-bias in review scores. We
propose two simple statistical methods to remove such noise and improve review
score prediction. Compared to other methods that use multiple classifiers, one
for each user, our model uses a single global classifier to predict review
scores. We empirically evaluate our methods on two major categories
(\textit{Electronics} and \textit{Movies and TV}) of the SNAP published Amazon
e-Commerce Reviews data-set and Amazon \textit{Fine Food} reviews data-set. We
obtain improved review score prediction for three commonly used text feature
representations.

 <dc:description>  Classifying the various shapes and attributes of a glioma cell nucleus is
crucial for diagnosis and understanding the disease. We investigate automated
classification of glioma nuclear shapes and visual attributes using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on pathology images of automatically
segmented nuclei. We propose three methods that improve the performance of a
previously-developed semi-supervised CNN. First, we propose a method that
allows the CNN to focus on the most important part of an image- the image's
center containing the nucleus. Second, we inject (concatenate) pre-extracted
VGG features into an intermediate layer of our Semi-Supervised CNN so that
during training, the CNN can learn a set of complementary features. Third, we
separate the losses of the two groups of target classes (nuclear shapes and
attributes) into a single-label loss and a multi-label loss so that the prior
knowledge of inter-label exclusiveness can be incorporated. On a dataset of
2078 images, the proposed methods combined reduce the error rate of attribute
and shape classification by 21.54% and 15.07% respectively compared to the
existing state-of-the-art method on the same dataset.

 <dc:title>CannyFS: Opportunistically Maximizing I/O Throughput Exploiting the
  Transactional Nature of Batch-Mode Data Processing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nettelblad, Jessica</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nettelblad, Carl</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Operating Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a user mode file system, CannyFS, that hides latency by assuming
all I/O operations will succeed. The user mode process will in turn report
errors, allowing proper cleanup and a repeated attempt to take place. We
demonstrate benefits for the model tasks of extracting archives and removing
directory trees in a real-life HPC environment, giving typical reductions in
time use of over 80%.
  This approach can be considered a view of HPC jobs and their I/O activity as
transactions. In general, file systems lack clearly defined transaction
semantics. Over time, the competing trends to add cache and maintain data
integrity have resulted in different practical tradeoffs.
  High-performance computing is a special case where overall throughput demands
are high. Latency can also be high, with non-local storage. In addition, a
theoretically possible I/O error (like permission denied, loss of connection,
exceeding disk quota) will frequently warrant the resubmission of a full job or
task, rather than traditional error reporting or handling. Therefore,
opportunistically treating each I/O operation as successful, and part of a
larger transaction, can speed up some applications that do not leverage
asynchronous I/O.

 <dc:description>  In this chapter, we focus on the problem of containing the spread of diseases
taking place in both temporal and adaptive networks (i.e., networks whose
structure `adapts' to the state of the disease). We specifically focus on the
problem of finding the optimal allocation of containment resources (e.g.,
vaccines, medical personnel, traffic control resources, etc.) to eradicate
epidemic outbreaks over the following three models of temporal and adaptive
networks: (i) Markovian temporal networks, (ii) aggregated-Markovian temporal
networks, and (iii) stochastically adaptive models. For each model, we present
a rigorous and tractable mathematical framework to efficiently find the optimal
distribution of control resources to eliminate the disease. In contrast with
other existing results, our results are not based on heuristic control
strategies, but on a disciplined analysis using tools from dynamical systems
and convex optimization.

 <dc:title>Box constrained $\ell_1$ optimization in random linear systems --

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider box constrained adaptations of $\ell_1$
optimization heuristic when applied for solving random linear systems. These
are typically employed when on top of being sparse the systems' solutions are
also known to be confined in a specific way to an interval on the real axis.
Two particular $\ell_1$ adaptations (to which we will refer as the
\emph{binary} $\ell_1$ and \emph{box} $\ell_1$) will be discussed in great
detail. Many of their properties will be addressed with a special emphasis on
the so-called phase transitions (PT) phenomena and the large deviation
principles (LDP). We will fully characterize these through two different
mathematical approaches, the first one that is purely probabilistic in nature
and the second one that connects to high-dimensional geometry. Of particular
interest we will find that for many fairly hard mathematical problems a
collection of pretty elegant characterizations of their final solutions will
turn out to exist.

 <dc:title>From Images to 3D Shape Attributes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Our goal in this paper is to investigate properties of 3D shape that can be
determined from a single image. We define 3D shape attributes -- generic
properties of the shape that capture curvature, contact and occupied space. Our
first objective is to infer these 3D shape attributes from a single image. A
second objective is to infer a 3D shape embedding -- a low dimensional vector
representing the 3D shape.
  We study how the 3D shape attributes and embedding can be obtained from a
single image by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this task. We
start with synthetic images so that the contribution of various cues and
nuisance parameters can be controlled. We then turn to real images and
introduce a large scale image dataset of sculptures containing 143K images
covering 2197 works from 242 artists.
  For the CNN trained on the sculpture dataset we show the following: (i) which
regions of the imaged sculpture are used by the CNN to infer the 3D shape
attributes; (ii) that the shape embedding can be used to match previously
unseen sculptures largely independent of viewpoint; and (iii) that the 3D
attributes generalize to images of other (non-sculpture) object classes.

 <dc:title>Box constrained $\ell_1$ optimization in random linear systems -- finite

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Our companion work \cite{Stojnicl1BnBxasymldp} considers random
under-determined linear systems with box-constrained sparse solutions and
provides an asymptotic analysis of a couple of modified $\ell_1$ heuristics
adjusted to handle such systems (we refer to these modifications of the
standard $\ell_1$ as binary and box $\ell_1$). Our earlier work
\cite{StojnicISIT2010binary} established that the binary $\ell_1$ does exhibit
the so-called phase-transition phenomenon (basically the same phenomenon
well-known through earlier considerations to be a key feature of the standard
$\ell_1$, see, e.g.
\cite{DonohoPol,DonohoUnsigned,StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}). Moreover, in
\cite{StojnicISIT2010binary}, we determined the precise location of the
co-called phase-transition (PT) curve. On the other hand, in
\cite{Stojnicl1BnBxasymldp} we provide a much deeper understanding of the PTs
and do so through a large deviations principles (LDP) type of analysis. In this
paper we complement the results of \cite{Stojnicl1BnBxasymldp} by leaving the
asymptotic regime naturally assumed in the PT and LDP considerations aside and
instead working in a finite dimensional setting. Along the same lines, we
provide for both, the binary and the box $\ell_1$, precise finite dimensional
analyses and essentially determine their ultimate statistical performance
characterizations. On top of that, we explain how the results created here can
be utilized in the asymptotic setting, considered in
\cite{Stojnicl1BnBxasymldp}, as well. Finally, for the completeness, we also
present a collection of results obtained through numerical simulations and
observe that they are in a massive agreement with our theoretical calculations.

 <dc:title>Beyond Skip Connections: Top-Down Modulation for Object Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, we have seen tremendous progress in the field of object
detection. Most of the recent improvements have been achieved by targeting
deeper feedforward networks. However, many hard object categories such as
bottle, remote, etc. require representation of fine details and not just
coarse, semantic representations. But most of these fine details are lost in
the early convolutional layers. What we need is a way to incorporate finer
details from lower layers into the detection architecture. Skip connections
have been proposed to combine high-level and low-level features, but we argue
that selecting the right features from low-level requires top-down contextual
information. Inspired by the human visual pathway, in this paper we propose
top-down modulations as a way to incorporate fine details into the detection
framework. Our approach supplements the standard bottom-up, feedforward ConvNet
with a top-down modulation (TDM) network, connected using lateral connections.
These connections are responsible for the modulation of lower layer filters,
and the top-down network handles the selection and integration of contextual
information and low-level features. The proposed TDM architecture provides a
significant boost on the COCO testdev benchmark, achieving 28.6 AP for VGG16,
35.2 AP for ResNet101, and 37.3 for InceptionResNetv2 network, without any
bells and whistles (e.g., multi-scale, iterative box refinement, etc.).

 <dc:description>  This paper formulates the problem of learning discriminative features
(\textit{i.e.,} segments) from networked time series data considering the
linked information among time series. For example, social network users are
considered to be social sensors that continuously generate social signals
(tweets) represented as a time series. The discriminative segments are often
referred to as \emph{shapelets} in a time series. Extracting shapelets for time
series classification has been widely studied. However, existing works on
shapelet selection assume that the time series are independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption restricts their applications to social
networked time series analysis, since a user's actions can be correlated to
his/her social affiliations. In this paper we propose a new Network Regularized
Least Squares (NetRLS) feature selection model that combines typical time
series data and user network data for analysis. Experiments on real-world
networked time series Twitter and DBLP data demonstrate the performance of the
proposed method. NetRLS performs better than LTS, the state-of-the-art time
series feature selection approach, on real-world data.

 <dc:description>  Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a popular framework in the fields of statistics
and machine learning for modeling heterogeneity in data for regression,
classification and clustering. MoE for continuous data are usually based on the
normal distribution. However, it is known that for data with asymmetric
behavior, heavy tails and atypical observations, the use of the normal
distribution is unsuitable. We introduce a new robust non-normal mixture of
experts modeling using the skew $t$ distribution. The proposed skew $t$ mixture
of experts, named STMoE, handles these issues of the normal mixtures experts
regarding possibly skewed, heavy-tailed and noisy data. We develop a dedicated
expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm to estimate the model
parameters by monotonically maximizing the observed data log-likelihood. We
describe how the presented model can be used in prediction and in model-based
clustering of regression data. Numerical experiments carried out on simulated
data show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed model in fitting
non-linear regression functions as well as in model-based clustering. Then, the
proposed model is applied to the real-world data of tone perception for musical
data analysis, and the one of temperature anomalies for the analysis of climate
change data. The obtained results confirm the usefulness of the model for
practical data analysis applications.

 <dc:description>  When building artificial intelligence systems that can reason and answer
questions about visual data, we need diagnostic tests to analyze our progress
and discover shortcomings. Existing benchmarks for visual question answering
can help, but have strong biases that models can exploit to correctly answer
questions without reasoning. They also conflate multiple sources of error,
making it hard to pinpoint model weaknesses. We present a diagnostic dataset
that tests a range of visual reasoning abilities. It contains minimal biases
and has detailed annotations describing the kind of reasoning each question
requires. We use this dataset to analyze a variety of modern visual reasoning
systems, providing novel insights into their abilities and limitations.

 <dc:title>Fast Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Freitag, Markus</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Al-Onaizan, Yaser</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach for automatic translation
of text from one human language into another. The basic concept in NMT is to
train a large Neural Network that maximizes the translation performance on a
given parallel corpus. NMT is gaining popularity in the research community
because it outperformed traditional SMT approaches in several translation tasks
at WMT and other evaluation tasks/benchmarks at least for some language pairs.
However, many of the enhancements in SMT over the years have not been
incorporated into the NMT framework. In this paper, we focus on one such
enhancement namely domain adaptation. We propose an approach for adapting a NMT
system to a new domain. The main idea behind domain adaptation is that the
availability of large out-of-domain training data and a small in-domain
training data. We report significant gains with our proposed method in both
automatic metrics and a human subjective evaluation metric on two language
pairs. With our adaptation method, we show large improvement on the new domain
while the performance of our general domain only degrades slightly. In
addition, our approach is fast enough to adapt an already trained system to a
new domain within few hours without the need to retrain the NMT model on the
combined data which usually takes several days/weeks depending on the volume of
the data.

 <dc:title>Feedback Does Not Increase the Capacity of Compound Channels with
  Additive Noise</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Loyka, Sergey</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A discrete compound channel with memory is considered, where no stationarity,
ergodicity or information stability is required, and where the uncertainty set
can be arbitrary. When the discrete noise is additive but otherwise arbitrary
and there is no cost constraint on the input, it is shown that the causal
feedback does not increase the capacity. This extends the earlier result
obtained for general single-state channels with full transmitter (Tx) channel
state information (CSI) to the compound setting. It is further shown that, for
this compound setting and under a mild technical condition on the additive
noise, the addition of the full Tx CSI does not increase the capacity either,
so that the worst-case and compound channel capacities are the same. This can
also be expressed as a saddle-point in the information-theoretic game between
the transmitter (who selects the input distribution) and the nature (who
selects the channel state), even though the objective function (the
inf-information rate) is not convex/concave in the right way. Cases where the
Tx CSI does increase the capacity are identified.
  Conditions under which the strong converse holds for this channel are
studied. The ergodic behaviour of the worst-case noise in otherwise
information-unstable channel is shown to be both sufficient and necessary for
the strong converse to hold, including feedback and no feedback cases.

 <dc:title>AIVAT: A New Variance Reduction Technique for Agent Evaluation in

 <dc:description>  Evaluating agent performance when outcomes are stochastic and agents use
randomized strategies can be challenging when there is limited data available.
The variance of sampled outcomes may make the simple approach of Monte Carlo
sampling inadequate. This is the case for agents playing heads-up no-limit
Texas hold'em poker, where man-machine competitions have involved multiple days
of consistent play and still not resulted in statistically significant
conclusions even when the winner's margin is substantial. In this paper, we
introduce AIVAT, a low variance, provably unbiased value assessment tool that
uses an arbitrary heuristic estimate of state value, as well as the explicit
strategy of a subset of the agents. Unlike existing techniques which reduce the
variance from chance events, or only consider game ending actions, AIVAT
reduces the variance both from choices by nature and by players with a known
strategy. The resulting estimator in no-limit poker can reduce the number of
hands needed to draw statistical conclusions by more than a factor of 10.

 <dc:title>A Statistical Approach to Continuous Self-Calibrating Eye Gaze Tracking
  for Head-Mounted Virtual Reality Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tripathi, Subarna</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a novel, automatic eye gaze tracking scheme inspired by smooth
pursuit eye motion while playing mobile games or watching virtual reality
contents. Our algorithm continuously calibrates an eye tracking system for a
head mounted display. This eliminates the need for an explicit calibration step
and automatically compensates for small movements of the headset with respect
to the head. The algorithm finds correspondences between corneal motion and
screen space motion, and uses these to generate Gaussian Process Regression
models. A combination of those models provides a continuous mapping from
corneal position to screen space position. Accuracy is nearly as good as
achieved with an explicit calibration step.

 <dc:description>  In this study, we explore the use of deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs) in visual place classification for robotic mapping and localization. An
open question is how to partition the robot's workspace into places to maximize
the performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) of potential DCNN
classifiers. This is a chicken and egg problem: If we had a well-trained DCNN
classifier, it is rather easy to partition the robot's workspace into places,
but the training of a DCNN classifier requires a set of pre-defined place
classes. In this study, we address this problem and present several strategies
for unsupervised discovery of place classes (&quot;time cue,&quot; &quot;location cue,&quot;
&quot;time-appearance cue,&quot; and &quot;location-appearance cue&quot;). We also evaluate the
efficacy of the proposed methods using the publicly available University of
Michigan North Campus Long-Term (NCLT) Dataset.

 <dc:description>  The online videos are generated at an unprecedented speed in recent years. As
a result, how to generate personalized recommendation from the large volume of
videos becomes more and more challenging. In this paper, we propose to extract
the non-textual contents from the videos themselves to enhance the personalized
video recommendation. The change of the content types makes us study three
issues in this paper. The first issue is what non-textual contents are helpful.
Considering the users are attracted by the videos in different aspects,
multiple audio and visual features are extracted, encoded and transformed to
represent the video contents in the recommender system for the first time. The
second issue is how to use the non-textual contents to generate accurate
personalized recommendation. We reproduce the existing methods and find that
they do not perform well with the non-textual contents due to the mismatch
between the features and the learning methods. To address this problem, we
propose a new method in this paper. Our experiments show that the proposed
method is more accurate whether the video content features are non-textual or
textual.

 <dc:description>  We present a general approach to video understanding, inspired by semantic
transfer techniques that have been successfully used for 2D image analysis. Our
method considers a video to be a 1D sequence of clips, each one associated with
its own semantics. The nature of these semantics -- natural language captions
or other labels -- depends on the task at hand. A test video is processed by
forming correspondences between its clips and the clips of reference videos
with known semantics, following which, reference semantics can be transferred
to the test video. We describe two matching methods, both designed to ensure
that (a) reference clips appear similar to test clips and (b), taken together,
the semantics of the selected reference clips is consistent and maintains
temporal coherence. We use our method for video captioning on the LSMDC'16
benchmark, video summarization on the SumMe and TVSum benchmarks, Temporal
Action Detection on the Thumos2014 benchmark, and sound prediction on the
Greatest Hits benchmark. Our method not only surpasses the state of the art, in
four out of five benchmarks, but importantly, it is the only single method we
know of that was successfully applied to such a diverse range of tasks.

 <dc:description>  The registration, transfer, clearing and settlement of equities represents a
significant part of economic activity currently underserved by modern
technological innovation. In addition, recent events have revealed problems of
transparency, inviting public criticism and scrutiny from regulatory
authorities. A peer-to-peer platform facilitating the creation and exchange of
directly registered shares represents a shift in equity markets towards more
efficient, transparent operations as well as greater accessibility to the
investing public and issuing companies. Blockchain technology solves the
problem of transaction processing and clearing but the fungibility of their
units pose a challenge in identifying the issuers and holders of specific
equities. Furthermore, as the issuers are in a constant state of flux the
benefits of a decentralized network are lost if a central manager is required
to cancel equities from companies that no longer exist. We propose a solution
to these problems using digital signatures, based on blockchain technology.

 <dc:title>Colored stochastic dominance problems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the dominance relation under a stochastic setting.
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a set of $n$ colored stochastic points in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
each of which is associated with an existence probability. We investigate the
problem of computing the probability that a realization of $\mathcal{S}$
contains inter-color dominances, which we call the \textit{colored stochastic
dominance} (CSD) problem. We propose the first algorithm to solve the CSD
problem for $d=2$ in $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$ time. On the other hand, we prove that,
for $d \geq 3$, even the CSD problem with a restricted color pattern is
#P-hard. In addition, even if the existence probabilities are restricted to be
$\frac{1}{2}$, the problem remains #P-hard for $d \geq 7$. A simple FPRAS is
then provided to approximate the desired probability in any dimension. We also
study a variant of the CSD problem in which the dominance relation is
considered with respect to not only the standard basis but any orthogonal basis
of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, this variant, which we call the {\em
free-basis colored stochastic dominance} (FBCSD) problem, considers the
probability that a realization of $\mathcal{S}$ contains inter-color dominances
with respect to any orthogonal basis of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that the CSD
problem is polynomial-time reducible to the FBCSD problem in the same
dimension, which proves the #P-hardness of the latter for $d \geq 3$.
Conversely, we reduce the FBCSD problem in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the CSD problem in
$\mathbb{R}^2$, by which an $O(n^4 \log^2 n)$ time algorithm for the former is
obtained.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new design of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
under secrecy considerations. We focus on a NOMA system where a transmitter
sends confidential messages to multiple users in the presence of an external
eavesdropper. The optimal designs of decoding order, transmission rates, and
power allocated to each user are investigated. Considering the practical
passive eavesdropping scenario where the instantaneous channel state of the
eavesdropper is unknown, we adopt the secrecy outage probability as the secrecy
metric. We first consider the problem of minimizing the transmit power subject
to the secrecy outage and quality of service constraints, and derive the
closed-form solution to this problem. We then explore the problem of maximizing
the minimum confidential information rate among users subject to the secrecy
outage and transmit power constraints, and provide an iterative algorithm to
solve this problem. We find that the secrecy outage constraint in the studied
problems does not change the optimal decoding order for NOMA, and one should
increase the power allocated to the user whose channel is relatively bad when
the secrecy constraint becomes more stringent. Finally, we show the advantage
of NOMA over orthogonal multiple access in the studied problems both
analytically and numerically.

 <dc:description>  This article analyzes the stochastic runtime of a Cross-Entropy Algorithm on
two classes of traveling salesman problems. The algorithm shares main features
of the famous Max-Min Ant System with iteration-best reinforcement.
  For simple instances that have a $\{1,n\}$-valued distance function and a
unique optimal solution, we prove a stochastic runtime of $O(n^{6+\epsilon})$
with the vertex-based random solution generation, and a stochastic runtime of
$O(n^{3+\epsilon}\ln n)$ with the edge-based random solution generation for an
arbitrary $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. These runtimes are very close to the known
expected runtime for variants of Max-Min Ant System with best-so-far
reinforcement. They are obtained for the stronger notion of stochastic runtime,
which means that an optimal solution is obtained in that time with an
overwhelming probability, i.e., a probability tending exponentially fast to one
with growing problem size.
  We also inspect more complex instances with $n$ vertices positioned on an
$m\times m$ grid. When the $n$ vertices span a convex polygon, we obtain a
stochastic runtime of $O(n^{3}m^{5+\epsilon})$ with the vertex-based random
solution generation, and a stochastic runtime of $O(n^{2}m^{5+\epsilon})$ for
the edge-based random solution generation. When there are $k = O(1)$ many
vertices inside a convex polygon spanned by the other $n-k$ vertices, we obtain
a stochastic runtime of $O(n^{4}m^{5+\epsilon}+n^{6k-1}m^{\epsilon})$ with the
vertex-based random solution generation, and a stochastic runtime of
$O(n^{3}m^{5+\epsilon}+n^{3k}m^{\epsilon})$ with the edge-based random solution
generation. These runtimes are better than the expected runtime for the
so-called $(\mu\!+\!\lambda)$ EA reported in a recent article, and again
obtained for the stronger notion of stochastic runtime.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the problem of the joint transceiver and offset
design (JTOD) for point-to-point multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) and
multiple user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) visible light
communication (VLC) systems. Both uplink and downlink multi-user scenarios are
considered. The shot noise induced by the incoming signals is considered,
leading to a more realistic MIMO VLC channel model. Under key lighting
constraints, we formulate non-convex optimization problems aiming at minimizing
the sum mean squared error. To optimize the transceiver and the offset jointly,
a gradient projection based procedure is resorted to. When only imperfect
channel state information is available, a semidefinite programming (SDP) based
scheme is proposed to obtain robust transceiver and offset. The proposed method
is shown to non-trivially outperform the conventional scaled zero forcing (ZF)
and singular value decomposition (SVD) based equalization methods. The robust
scheme works particularly well when the signal is much stronger than the noise.

 <dc:description>  While analysis of medical images has practically taken place since the first
image was recorded, high throughput analysis of medical images is a more recent
phenomenon. The aim of such a radiomics process is to provide decision support
based on medical imaging. Part of the radiomics process is the conversion of
image data into numerical features which capture different medical image
aspects, and can be subsequently correlated as biomarkers to e.g. expected
oncological treatment outcome.
  With the growth of the radiomics field, it has become clear that results are
often difficult to reproduce, that standards for image processing and feature
extraction are missing, and that reporting guidelines are absent. The image
biomarker standardisation initiative (IBSI) seeks to address these issues. The
current document provides definitions for a large number of image features as
well as common image processing elements.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the width complexity of nondeterministic unitary OBDDs
(NUOBDDs). Firstly, we present a generic lower bound on their widths based on
the size of strong 1-fooling sets. Then, we present classically cheap functions
that are expensive for NUOBDDs and vice versa by improving the previous gap. We
also present a function for which neither classical nor unitary nondeterminism
does help. Moreover, based on our results, we present a width hierarchy for
NUOBDDs. Lastly, we provide the bounds on the widths of NUOBDDs for the basic
Boolean operations negation, union, and intersection.

 <dc:description>  Correntropy is a second order statistical measure in kernel space, which has
been successfully applied in robust learning and signal processing. In this
paper, we define a nonsecond order statistical measure in kernel space, called
the kernel mean-p power error (KMPE), including the correntropic loss (CLoss)
as a special case. Some basic properties of KMPE are presented. In particular,
we apply the KMPE to extreme learning machine (ELM) and principal component
analysis (PCA), and develop two robust learning algorithms, namely ELM-KMPE and
PCA-KMPE. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark data show that the
developed algorithms can achieve consistently better performance when compared
with some existing methods.

 <dc:description>  In many personalized recommendation problems available data consists only of
positive interactions (implicit feedback) between users and items. This problem
is also known as One-Class Collaborative Filtering (OC-CF). Linear models
usually achieve state-of-the-art performances on OC-CF problems and many
efforts have been devoted to build more expressive and complex representations
able to improve the recommendations. Recent analysis show that collaborative
filtering (CF) datasets have peculiar characteristics such as high sparsity and
a long tailed distribution of the ratings. In this paper we propose a boolean
kernel, called Disjunctive kernel, which is less expressive than the linear one
but it is able to alleviate the sparsity issue in CF contexts. The embedding of
this kernel is composed by all the combinations of a certain arity d of the
input variables, and these combined features are semantically interpreted as
disjunctions of the input variables. Experiments on several CF datasets show
the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed kernel.

 <dc:description>  The paper deals with using chaos to direct trajectories to targets and
analyzes ruggedness and fractality of the resulting fitness landscapes. The
targeting problem is formulated as a dynamic fitness landscape and four
different chaotic maps generating such a landscape are studied. By using a
computational approach, we analyze properties of the landscapes and quantify
their fractal and rugged characteristics. In particular, it is shown that
ruggedness measures such as correlation length and information content are
scale-invariant and self-similar.

 <dc:description>  Currently, a growing number of health consumers are asking health-related
questions online, at any time and from anywhere, which effectively lowers the
cost of health care. The most common approach is using online health expert
question-answering (HQA) services, as health consumers are more willing to
trust answers from professional physicians. However, these answers can be of
varying quality depending on circumstance. In addition, as the available HQA
services grow, how to predict the answer quality of HQA services via machine
learning becomes increasingly important and challenging. In an HQA service,
answers are normally short texts, which are severely affected by the data
sparsity problem. Furthermore, HQA services lack community features such as
best answer and user votes. Therefore, the wisdom of the crowd is not available
to rate answer quality. To address these problems, in this paper, the
prediction of HQA answer quality is defined as a classification task. First,
based on the characteristics of HQA services and feedback from medical experts,
a standard for HQA service answer quality evaluation is defined. Next, based on
the characteristics of HQA services, several novel non-textual features are
proposed, including surface linguistic features and social features. Finally, a
deep belief network (DBN)-based HQA answer quality prediction framework is
proposed to predict the quality of answers by learning the high-level hidden
semantic representation from the physicians' answers. Our results prove that
the proposed framework overcomes the problem of overly sparse textual features
in short text answers and effectively identifies high-quality answers.

 <dc:description>  We introduce ARES, an efficient approximation algorithm for generating
optimal plans (action sequences) that take an initial state of a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) to a state whose cost is below a specified (convergence)
threshold. ARES uses Particle Swarm Optimization, with adaptive sizing for both
the receding horizon and the particle swarm. Inspired by Importance Splitting,
the length of the horizon and the number of particles are chosen such that at
least one particle reaches a next-level state, that is, a state where the cost
decreases by a required delta from the previous-level state. The level relation
on states and the plans constructed by ARES implicitly define a Lyapunov
function and an optimal policy, respectively, both of which could be explicitly
generated by applying ARES to all states of the MDP, up to some topological
equivalence relation. We also assess the effectiveness of ARES by statistically
evaluating its rate of success in generating optimal plans. The ARES algorithm
resulted from our desire to clarify if flying in V-formation is a flocking
policy that optimizes energy conservation, clear view, and velocity alignment.
That is, we were interested to see if one could find optimal plans that bring a
flock from an arbitrary initial state to a state exhibiting a single connected
V-formation. For flocks with 7 birds, ARES is able to generate a plan that
leads to a V-formation in 95% of the 8,000 random initial configurations within
63 seconds, on average. ARES can also be easily customized into a
model-predictive controller (MPC) with an adaptive receding horizon and
statistical guarantees of convergence. To the best of our knowledge, our
adaptive-sizing approach is the first to provide convergence guarantees in
receding-horizon techniques.

$\text{Tr}$ be the trace function from $\mathbb{F}_q$ to $\mathbb{F}_p$. We

 <dc:description>  To answer traffic engineering goals, current backbone networks use expensive
and sophisticated equipments, that run distributed algorithms to imple- ment
dynamic multi-path routing (e.g., MPLS tunnels and dynamic trunk rerout- ing).
We think that the same goals can be fulfilled using a simpler approach, where
the core of the backbone only implements many a priori computed paths, and most
adaptation to traffic engineering goals only takes place at the edge of the
network. In the vein of Software Defined Networking, edge adaptation should be
driven by a logically centralized controller that leverages the available paths
to adapt traffic load balancing to the current demands and network status. In
this article we present two algorithms to help building this vision. The first
one selects sets of paths able to support future load balancing needs and
adaptation to network faults. As the total number of required paths is very
important, and their continuous availability requires many FIB entries in core
routers, we also present a second algorithm that aggregates these paths in a
reduced number of trees. This second algorithm achieves better results than
previously proposed algorithms for path aggregation. To conclude, we show that
off-the-shelf equipment supporting simple protocols may be used to implement
routing with these trees, what shows that simplicity in the core can be
achieved by using only trivially available proto- cols and their most common
and unsophisticated implementation

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, denial of service (DoS) attacks represent a significant fraction of
all attacks that take place in the Internet and their intensity is always
growing. The main DoS attack methods consist of flooding their victims with
bogus packets, queries or replies, so as to prevent them from fulfilling their
roles. Preventing DoS attacks at network level would be simpler if end-to-end
strong authentication in any packet exchange was mandatory. However, it is also
likely that its mandatory adoption would introduce more harm than benefits. In
this paper we present an end-point addressing scheme and a set of security
procedures which satisfy most of network level DoS prevention requirements.
Instead of being known by public stable IP addresses, hosts use ephemeral IP
Identifiers cryptographically generated and bound to its usage context.
Self-signed certificates and challenge-based protocols allow, without the need
of any third parties, the implementation of defenses against DoS attacks.
Communication in the open Internet while using these special IP addresses is
supported by the so-called Map/Encap approaches, which in our point of view
will be sooner or later required for the future Internet.

 <dc:description>  This article examines the application of a popular measure of sparsity, Gini
Index, on network graphs. A wide variety of network graphs happen to be sparse.
But the index with which sparsity is commonly measured in network graphs is
edge density, reflecting the proportion of the sum of the degrees of all nodes
in the graph compared to the total possible degrees in the corresponding fully
connected graph. Thus edge density is a simple ratio and carries limitations,
primarily in terms of the amount of information it takes into account in its
definition. In this paper, we have provided a formulation for defining sparsity
of a network graph by generalizing the concept of Gini Index and call it
sparsity index. A majority of the six properties (viz., Robin Hood, Scaling,
Rising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates and Babies) with which sparsity measures are
commonly compared are seen to be satisfied by the proposed index. A comparison
between edge density and the sparsity index has been drawn with appropriate
examples to highlight the efficacy of the proposed index. It has also been
shown theoretically that the two measures follow similar trend for a changing
graph, i.e., as the edge density of a graph increases its sparsity index
decreases. Additionally, the paper draws a relationship, analytically, between
the sparsity index and the exponent term of a power law distribution, a
distribution which is known to approximate the degree distribution of a wide
variety of network graphs. Finally, the article highlights how the proposed
index together with Gini index can reveal important properties of a network
graph.

 <dc:description>  We propose an information-theoretic private information retrieval (PIR)
scheme for distributed storage systems where data is stored using a linear
systematic code of rate $R &gt; 1/2$. The proposed scheme generalizes the PIR
scheme for data stored using maximum distance separable codes recently proposed
by Tajeddine and El Rouayheb for the scenario of a single spy node. We further
propose an algorithm to optimize the communication price of privacy (cPoP)
using the structure of the underlying linear code. As an example, we apply the
proposed algorithm to several distributed storage codes, showing that the cPoP
can be significantly reduced by exploiting the structure of the distributed
storage code.

 <dc:description>  Language Models based on recurrent neural networks have dominated recent
image caption generation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a Language CNN
model which is suitable for statistical language modeling tasks and shows
competitive performance in image captioning. In contrast to previous models
which predict next word based on one previous word and hidden state, our
language CNN is fed with all the previous words and can model the long-range
dependencies of history words, which are critical for image captioning. The
effectiveness of our approach is validated on two datasets MS COCO and
Flickr30K. Our extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms
the vanilla recurrent neural network based language models and is competitive
with the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Multidimensional Scaling</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a popular dimensionality reduction
techniques that has been widely used for network visualization and cooperative
localization. However, the traditional stress minimization formulation of MDS
necessitates the use of batch optimization algorithms that are not scalable to
large-sized problems. This paper considers an alternative stochastic stress
minimization framework that is amenable to incremental and distributed
solutions. A novel linear-complexity stochastic optimization algorithm is
proposed that is provably convergent and simple to implement. The applicability
of the proposed algorithm to localization and visualization tasks is also
expounded. Extensive tests on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  How much information do large brain networks integrate as a whole over the
sum of their parts? Can the dynamical complexity of such networks be globally
quantified in an information-theoretic way and be meaningfully coupled to brain
function? Recently, measures of dynamical complexity such as integrated
information have been proposed. However, problems related to the normalization
and Bell number of partitions associated to these measures make these
approaches computationally infeasible for large-scale brain networks. Our goal
in this work is to address this problem. Our formulation of network integrated
information is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
multivariate distribution on the set of network states versus the corresponding
factorized distribution over its parts. We find that implementing the maximum
information partition optimizes computations. These methods are well-suited for
large networks with linear stochastic dynamics. We compute the integrated
information for both, the system's attractor states, as well as non-stationary
dynamical states of the network. We then apply this formalism to brain networks
to compute the integrated information for the human brain's connectome.
Compared to a randomly re-wired network, we find that the specific topology of
the brain generates greater information complexity.

 <dc:description>  In the final project paper we consider a graph parameter called readability.
Motivation for readability comes from bioinformatics applications. Graphs
arising in problems related to genome sequencing are of small readability,
which motivates the study of graphs of small readability. We present an
algorithm due to Braga and Meidanis, which shows that every digraph is
isomorphic to the overlap graph of some set of strings. An upper bound on
readability is derived from the algorithm. The readability parameter can also
be defined for bipartite graphs; in the final project paper special emphasis is
given to the bipartite model. The complexity of computing the readability of a
given digraph (or of a given bipartite graph) is unknown. A way for the exact
computation of readability is presented using Integer Linear Programming. We
also present two approaches for computing upper and lower bounds for
readability due to Chikhi at al. Finally, the readability is computed exactly
for toroidal and two-dimensional grid graphs and a polynomial time algorithm
for constructing an optimal overlap labeling of a given two-dimensional or
toroidal grid graph is presented.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose two methods for tackling the problem of
cross-device matching for online advertising at CIKM Cup 2016. The first method
considers the matching problem as a binary classification task and solve it by
utilizing ensemble learning techniques. The second method defines the matching
problem as a ranking task and effectively solve it with using learning-to-rank
algorithms. The results show that the proposed methods obtain promising
results, in which the ranking-based method outperforms the classification-based
method for the task.

 <dc:description>  Frequency offset modulation (FOM) is proposed as a new concept to provide
both high energy efficiency and high spectral efficiency for communications. In
the FOM system, an array of transmitters (TXs) is deployed and only one TX is
activated for data transmission at any signaling time instance. The TX index
distinguished by a very slight frequency offset among the entire occupied
bandwidth is exploited to implicitly convey a bit unit without any power or
signal radiation, saving the power and spectral resources. Moreover, the FOM is
characterized by removing the stringent requirements on distinguishable spatial
channels and perfect priori channel knowledge, while retaining the advantages
of no inter-channel interference and no need of inter-antenna synchronization.
In addition, a hybrid solution integrating the FOM and the spatial modulation
is discussed to further improve the energy efficiency and spectral efficiency.
Consequently, the FOM will be an enabling and green solution to support
ever-increasing high-capacity data traffic in a variety of interdisciplinary
fields.

 <dc:description>  Research has shown that convolutional neural networks contain significant
redundancy, and high classification accuracy can be obtained even when weights
and activations are reduced from floating point to binary values. In this
paper, we present FINN, a framework for building fast and flexible FPGA
accelerators using a flexible heterogeneous streaming architecture. By
utilizing a novel set of optimizations that enable efficient mapping of
binarized neural networks to hardware, we implement fully connected,
convolutional and pooling layers, with per-layer compute resources being
tailored to user-provided throughput requirements. On a ZC706 embedded FPGA
platform drawing less than 25 W total system power, we demonstrate up to 12.3
million image classifications per second with 0.31 {\mu}s latency on the MNIST
dataset with 95.8% accuracy, and 21906 image classifications per second with
283 {\mu}s latency on the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets with respectively 80.1%
and 94.9% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the fastest
classification rates reported to date on these benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We have designed a single-pixel camera with imaging around corners based on
computational ghost imaging. It can obtain the image of an object when the
camera cannot look at the object directly. Our imaging system explores the fact
that a bucket detector in a ghost imaging setup has no spatial resolution
capability. A series of experiments have been designed to confirm our
predictions. This camera has potential applications for imaging around corner
or other similar environments where the object cannot be observed directly.

 <dc:description>  We consider the nonadaptive group testing with $N$ items, of which $K =
\Theta(N^\theta)$ are defective. We study test designs in which each item
appears in a constant number of tests chosen uniformly at random with
replacement, so that the testing matrix has near-constant column weights. We
analyse the performance of simple and practical decoding algorithms in a range
of sparsity regimes corresponding to $\theta \in (0,1)$, showing that the
performance is consistently improved in comparison with more standard Bernoulli
designs. First, we show that the very simple COMP algorithm requires 23% fewer
tests with a near-constant column weight design than with a Bernoulli design,
performing even better than optimal algorithms with Bernoulli designs for
$\theta &gt; 0.77$. Second, using a near-constant column weight design, the
practical DD algorithm again uses 23% fewer tests than with Bernoulli designs,
outperforms any possible algorithm for Bernoulli designs for $\theta &gt; 0.43$,
and beats the best-known theoretical guarantees of existing practical
algorithms for all $\theta \in (0,1)$. Third, we give an upper bound on the
performance of near-constant column weight designs regardless of the recovery
algorithm, showing that DD is optimal for this design when $\theta \geq 1/2$.
We complement our theoretical findings with simulations showing a notable
improvement over Bernoulli designs in both sparse and dense regimes.

 <dc:description>  High performance computing (HPC) devices is no longer exclusive for academic,
R&amp;D, or military purposes. The use of HPC device such as supercomputer now
growing rapidly as some new area arise such as big data, and computer
simulation. It makes the use of supercomputer more inclusive. Todays
supercomputer has a huge computing power, but requires an enormous amount of
energy to operate. In contrast a single board computer (SBC) such as Raspberry
Pi has minimum computing power, but require a small amount of energy to
operate, and as a bonus it is small and cheap. This paper covers the result of
utilizing many Raspberry Pi 2 SBCs, a quad-core Cortex A7 900 MHz, as a cluster
to compensate its computing power. The high performance linpack (HPL) is used
to benchmark the computing power, and a power meter with resolution 10mV / 10mA
is used to measure the power consumption. The experiment shows that the
increase of number of cores in every SBC member in a cluster is not giving
significant increase in computing power. This experiment give a recommendation
that 4 nodes is a maximum number of nodes for SBC cluster based on the
characteristic of computing performance and power consumption.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose and carefully evaluate a sequence labeling framework
which solely utilizes sparse indicator features derived from dense distributed
word representations. The proposed model obtains (near) state-of-the art
performance for both part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition for a
variety of languages. Our model relies only on a few thousand sparse
coding-derived features, without applying any modification of the word
representations employed for the different tasks. The proposed model has
favorable generalization properties as it retains over 89.8% of its average POS
tagging accuracy when trained at 1.2% of the total available training data,
i.e.~150 sentences per language.

 <dc:description>  Deep-learning has dramatically changed the world overnight. It greatly
boosted the development of visual perception, object detection, and speech
recognition, etc. That was attributed to the multiple convolutional processing
layers for abstraction of learning representations from massive data. The
advantages of deep convolutional structures in data processing motivated the
applications of artificial intelligence methods in robotic problems, especially
perception and control system, the two typical and challenging problems in
robotics. This paper presents a survey of the deep-learning research landscape
in mobile robotics. We start with introducing the definition and development of
deep-learning in related fields, especially the essential distinctions between
image processing and robotic tasks. We described and discussed several typical
applications and related works in this domain, followed by the benefits from
deep-learning, and related existing frameworks. Besides, operation in the
complex dynamic environment is regarded as a critical bottleneck for mobile
robots, such as that for autonomous driving. We thus further emphasize the
recent achievement on how deep-learning contributes to navigation and control
systems for mobile robots. At the end, we discuss the open challenges and

 <dc:description>  Demand for data science education is surging and traditional courses offered
by statistics departments are not meeting the needs of those seeking training.
This has led to a number of opinion pieces advocating for an update to the
Statistics curriculum. The unifying recommendation is computing should play a
more prominent role. We strongly agree with this recommendation, but advocate
the main priority is to bring applications to the forefront as proposed by
Nolan and Speed (1999). We also argue that the individuals tasked with
developing data science courses should not only have statistical training, but
also have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solving
real-world problems. Here, we share a set of general principles and offer a
detailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching a
graduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on case
studies. We argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined by
Wild and Pfannkuck (1999) and describe how our approach teaches students three
key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating,
connecting, and computing. This guide can also be used for statisticians
wanting to gain more practical knowledge about data science before embarking on
teaching an introductory course.

 <dc:title>Robust Classification of Graph-Based Data</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A graph-based classification method is proposed both for semi-supervised
learning in the case of Euclidean data and for classification in the case of
graph data. Our manifold learning technique is based on a convex optimization
problem involving a convex regularization term and a concave loss function with
a trade-off parameter carefully chosen so that the objective function remains
convex. As shown experimentally, the advantage of considering a concave loss
function is that the learning problem becomes more robust in the presence of
noisy labels. Furthermore, the loss function considered is then more similar to
a classification loss while several other methods treat graph-based
classification problems as regression problems.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have shown promise in collaborative filtering (CF).
However, existing neural approaches are either user-based or item-based, which
cannot leverage all the underlying information explicitly. We propose CF-UIcA,
a neural co-autoregressive model for CF tasks, which exploits the structural
correlation in the domains of both users and items. The co-autoregression
allows extra desired properties to be incorporated for different tasks.
Furthermore, we develop an efficient stochastic learning algorithm to handle
large scale datasets. We evaluate CF-UIcA on two popular benchmarks: MovieLens
1M and Netflix, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both rating
prediction and top-N recommendation tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness
of CF-UIcA.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we construct several new families of quantum codes with good
and asymptotically good parameters. These new quantum codes are derived from
(classical) algebraic geometry (AG) codes by applying the
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. Many of these codes have large
minimum distances when compared with its code length and they have relatively
small Singleton defect. For example, we construct a family [[46; 2(t_2 - t1);
d]]_25 of quantum codes, where t_1, t_2 are positive integers such that 1 &lt; t_1
&lt; t_2 &lt; 23 and d &gt;= min {46 - 2t_2, 2t_1-2}, of length n = 46, with minimum
distance in the range 2 =&lt; d =&lt; 20, having Singleton defect four. Additionally,
by utilizing t-point AG codes, with t &gt;= 2, we show how to obtain sequences of
asymptotically good quantum codes.

 <dc:title>Trilaminar Multiway Reconstruction Tree for Efficient Large Scale

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Accuracy and efficiency are two key problems in large scale incremental
Structure from Motion (SfM). In this paper, we propose a unified framework to
divide the image set into clusters suitable for reconstruction as well as find
multiple reliable and stable starting points. Image partitioning performs in
two steps. First, some small image groups are selected at places with high
image density, and then all the images are clustered according to their optimal
reconstruction paths to these image groups. This promises that the scene is
always reconstructed from dense places to sparse areas, which can reduce error
accumulation when images have weak overlap. To enable faster speed, images
outside the selected group in each cluster are further divided to achieve a
greater degree of parallelism. Experiments show that our method achieves
significant speedup, higher accuracy and better completeness.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we construct new families of convolutional codes. Such codes
are obtained by means of algebraic geometry codes. Additionally, more families
of convolutional codes are constructed by means of puncturing, extending,
expanding and by the direct product code construction applied to algebraic
geometry codes. The parameters of the new convolutional codes are better than
or comparable to the ones available in literature. In particular, a family of
almost near MDS codes is presented.

 <dc:description>  We show that there are CNF formulas which can be refuted in resolution in
both small space and small width, but for which any small-width proof must have
space exceeding by far the linear worst-case upper bound. This significantly
strengthens the space-width trade-offs in [Ben-Sasson '09]}, and provides one
more example of trade-offs in the &quot;supercritical&quot; regime above worst case
recently identified by [Razborov '16]. We obtain our results by using
Razborov's new hardness condensation technique and combining it with the space
lower bounds in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom '08].

 <dc:title>Transmission and Storage Rates for Sequential Massive Random Access</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new source coding paradigm called Sequential Massive
Random Access (SMRA). In SMRA, a set of correlated sources is encoded once for
all and stored on a server, and clients want to successively access to only a
subset of the sources. Since the number of simultaneous clients can be huge,
the server is only allowed to extract a bitstream from the stored data: no
re-encoding can be performed before the transmission of the specific client's
request. In this paper, we formally define the SMRA framework and introduce
both storage and transmission rates to characterize the performance of SMRA. We
derive achievable transmission and storage rates for lossless source coding of
i.i.d. and non i.i.d. sources, and transmission and storage rates-distortion
regions for Gaussian sources. We also show two practical implementations of
SMRA systems based on rate-compatible LDPC codes. Both theoretical and
experimental results demonstrate that SMRA systems can reach the same
transmission rates as in traditional point to point source coding schemes,
while having a reasonable overhead in terms of storage rate. These results
constitute a breakthrough for many recent data transmission applications in
which different parts of the data are requested by the clients.

 <dc:title>Nash Equilibrium Seeking with Non-doubly Stochastic Communication Weight

 <dc:description>  A distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm is presented for networked
games. We assume an incomplete information available to each player about the
other players' actions. The players communicate over a strongly connected
digraph to send/receive the estimates of the other players' actions to/from the
other local players according to a gossip communication protocol. Due to
asymmetric information exchange between the players, a non-doubly (row)
stochastic weight matrix is defined. We show that, due to the non-doubly
stochastic property, the total average of all players' estimates is not
preserved for the next iteration which results in having no exact convergence.
We present an almost sure convergence proof of the algorithm to a Nash
equilibrium of the game. Then, we extend the algorithm for graphical games in
which all players' cost functions are only dependent on the local neighboring
players over an interference digraph. We design an assumption on the
communication digraph such that the players are able to update all the
estimates of the players who interfere with their cost functions. It is shown
that the communication digraph needs to be a superset of a transitive reduction
of the interference digraph. Finally, we verify the efficacy of the algorithm
via a simulation on a social media behavioral case.

 <dc:description>  We present a unified framework to predict tumor proliferation scores from
breast histopathology whole slide images. Our system offers a fully automated
solution to predicting both a molecular data-based, and a mitosis
counting-based tumor proliferation score. The framework integrates three
modules, each fine-tuned to maximize the overall performance: An image
processing component for handling whole slide images, a deep learning based
mitosis detection network, and a proliferation scores prediction module. We
have achieved 0.567 quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa in mitosis counting-based
score prediction and 0.652 F1-score in mitosis detection. On Spearman's
correlation coefficient, which evaluates predictive accuracy on the molecular
data based score, the system obtained 0.6171. Our approach won first place in
all of the three tasks in Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge 2016 which
is MICCAI grand challenge.

 <dc:description>  The current mainstream approach to train natural language systems is to
expose them to large amounts of text. This passive learning is problematic if
we are interested in developing interactive machines, such as conversational
agents. We propose a framework for language learning that relies on multi-agent
communication. We study this learning in the context of referential games. In
these games, a sender and a receiver see a pair of images. The sender is told
one of them is the target and is allowed to send a message from a fixed,
arbitrary vocabulary to the receiver. The receiver must rely on this message to
identify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively
out of the need to communicate. We show that two networks with simple
configurations are able to learn to coordinate in the referential game. We
further explore how to make changes to the game environment to cause the &quot;word
meanings&quot; induced in the game to better reflect intuitive semantic properties
of the images. In addition, we present a simple strategy for grounding the
agents' code into natural language. Both of these are necessary steps towards
developing machines that are able to communicate with humans productively.

rule labeling in the theorem prover Isabelle. Moreover, we report on the
integration of this result into the certifier CeTA, facilitating the checking
of confluence certificates based on decreasing diagrams. The power of the
method is illustrated by an experimental evaluation on a (standard) collection
of confluence problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of authentication protocols
for Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, we select and in-detail examine
more than forty authentication protocols developed for or applied in the
context of the IoT under four environments, including: (1) Machine to machine
communications (M2M), (2) Internet of Vehicles (IoV), (3) Internet of Energy
(IoE), and (4) Internet of Sensors (IoS). We start by reviewing all survey
articles published in the recent years that focusing on different aspects of
the IoT idea. Then, we review threat models, countermeasures, and formal
security verification techniques used in authentication protocols for the IoT.
In addition, we provide a taxonomy and comparison of authentication protocols
for the IoT in form of tables in five terms, namely, network model, goals, main
processes, computation complexity, and communication overhead. Based on the
current survey, we identify open issues and suggest hints for future research.

 <dc:description>  International collaboration in science continues to grow at a remarkable
rate, but little agreement exists about dynamics of growth and organization at
the discipline level. Some suggest that disciplines differ in their
collaborative tendencies, reflecting their epistemic culture. This study
examines collaborative patterns in six previously studied specialties to add
new data and conduct analyses over time. Our findings show that the global
network of collaboration continues to add new nations and new participants;
each specialty has added many new nations to its lists of collaborating
partners since 1990. We also find that the scope of international collaboration
is positively related to impact. Network characteristics for the six
specialties are notable in that instead of reflecting underlying culture, they
tend towards convergence. This observation suggests that the global level may
represent next-order dynamics that feed back to the national and local levels
(as subsystems) in a complex, networked hierarchy.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel framework for secure and reliable authentication of
Distributed Energy Resources to the centralized secondary/tertiary control
system of a DC MicroGrid (MG), networked using the IEEE 802.11 wireless
interface. The key idea is to perform the authentication using power talk,
which is a powerline communication technique executed by the primary control
loops of the power electronic converters, without the use of a dedicated
hardware for its modem. In addition, the scheme also promotes direct and active
participation of the control system in the authentication process, a feature
not commonly encountered in current networked control systems for MicroGrids.
The PLECS-based simulations verifies the viability of our scheme.

 <dc:title>Inverted Bilingual Topic Models for Lexicon Extraction from Non-parallel

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Topic models have been successfully applied in lexicon extraction. However,
most previous methods are limited to document-aligned data. In this paper, we
try to address two challenges of applying topic models to lexicon extraction in
non-parallel data: 1) hard to model the word relationship and 2) noisy seed
dictionary. To solve these two challenges, we propose two new bilingual topic
models to better capture the semantic information of each word while
discriminating the multiple translations in a noisy seed dictionary. We extend
the scope of topic models by inverting the roles of &quot;word&quot; and &quot;document&quot;. In
addition, to solve the problem of noise in seed dictionary, we incorporate the
probability of translation selection in our models. Moreover, we also propose
an effective measure to evaluate the similarity of words in different languages
and select the optimal translation pairs. Experimental results using real world
data demonstrate the utility and efficacy of the proposed models.

 <dc:description>  The problem of determining whether an object is in motion, irrespective of
camera motion, is far from being solved. We address this challenging task by
learning motion patterns in videos. The core of our approach is a fully
convolutional network, which is learned entirely from synthetic video
sequences, and their ground-truth optical flow and motion segmentation. This
encoder-decoder style architecture first learns a coarse representation of the
optical flow field features, and then refines it iteratively to produce motion
labels at the original high-resolution. We further improve this labeling with
an objectness map and a conditional random field, to account for errors in
optical flow, and also to focus on moving &quot;things&quot; rather than &quot;stuff&quot;. The
output label of each pixel denotes whether it has undergone independent motion,
i.e., irrespective of camera motion. We demonstrate the benefits of this
learning framework on the moving object segmentation task, where the goal is to
segment all objects in motion. Our approach outperforms the top method on the
recently released DAVIS benchmark dataset, comprising real-world sequences, by
5.6%. We also evaluate on the Berkeley motion segmentation database, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  Building on the adoption of the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and
Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigms, 5G networks promise distinctive
features includ- ing the capability to support multi-tenancy. Virtual network
operators (VNOs) are expected to co-exist over the shared infrastructure,
realizing their network functionality on top of virtualized resources. In this
context, we observe the emerging opportunity for establishing synergies between
co-located tenants of the infrastructure, in the form of cache peering
relationships between co-located VNOs. Upon a cache miss, co-located caches
benefit from content cached at their peers, taking advantage of the shared
nature of the infrastructure in reducing latencies and traffic overheads. Our
approach allows VNOs to autonomously manage their peering links without the
involvement of the infrastructure operator.

 <dc:description>  Rank aggregation based on pairwise comparisons over a set of items has a wide
range of applications. Although considerable research has been devoted to the
development of rank aggregation algorithms, one basic question is how to
efficiently collect a large amount of high-quality pairwise comparisons for the
ranking purpose. Because of the advent of many crowdsourcing services, a crowd
of workers are often hired to conduct pairwise comparisons with a small
monetary reward for each pair they compare. Since different workers have
different levels of reliability and different pairs have different levels of
ambiguity, it is desirable to wisely allocate the limited budget for
comparisons among the pairs of items and workers so that the global ranking can
be accurately inferred from the comparison results. To this end, we model the
active sampling problem in crowdsourced ranking as a Bayesian Markov decision
process, which dynamically selects item pairs and workers to improve the
ranking accuracy under a budget constraint. We further develop a
computationally efficient sampling policy based on knowledge gradient as well
as a moment matching technique for posterior approximation. Experimental
evaluations on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed policy
achieves high ranking accuracy with a lower labeling cost.

 <dc:description>  In standard implementations of distributed secondary control for DC
MicroGrids (MGs), the exchange of local measurements among neighboring control
agents is enabled via off-the-shelf wireless solutions, such as IEEE 802.11.
However, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the wireless interface through
jamming prevents the secondary control system from performing its main tasks,
which might compromise the stability of the MG. In this paper, we propose
novel, robust and secure secondary control reconfiguration strategy, tailored
to counteract DoS attacks. Specifically, upon detecting the impairment of the
wireless interface, the jammed secondary control agent notifies its peers via a
secure, low-rate powerline channel based on Power Talk communication. This
triggers reconfiguration of the wireless communication graph through primary
control mode switching, where the jammed agents leave the secondary control by
switching to current source mode, and are replaced by nonjammed current sources
that switch to voltage source mode and join the secondary control. The strategy
fits within the software-defined networking framework, where the network
control is split from the data plane using reliable and secure side power talk
communication channel, created via software modification of the MG primary
control loops. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the
solution and prove that the MG resilience and performance can be indeed
improved via software-defined networking approaches.

 <dc:description>  Eklund et al. (2002) present a graphical technique aimed at simplifying the
verification of various category-theoretic constructions, notably the
composition of monads. In this note we take a different approach involving
string rewriting. We show that a given tuple $(T,\mu,\eta)$ is a monad if and
only if $T$ is a terminal object in a certain category of strings and rewrite
rules, and that this fact can be established by proving confluence of the
rewrite system. We illustrate the technique on the monad composition problem.
We also give a characterization of adjunctions in terms of rewrite categories.

 <dc:description>  Identifying influential nodes in networks is a significant and challenging
task. Among many centrality indices, the $k$-shell index performs very well in
finding out influential spreaders. However, the traditional method for
calculating the $k$-shell indices of nodes needs the global topological
information, which limits its applications in large-scale dynamically growing
networks. Recently, L\@\&quot;{u} \emph{et al.} [Nature Communications 7 (2016)
10168] proposed a novel asynchronous algorithm to calculate the $k$-shell
indices, which is suitable to deal with large-scale growing networks. In this
paper, we propose two algorithms to select nodes and update their intermediate
values towards the $k$-shell indices, which can help in accelerating the
convergence of the calculation of $k$-shell indices. The former algorithm takes
into account the degrees of nodes while the latter algorithm prefers to choose
the node whose neighbors' values have been changed recently. We test these two
methods on four real networks and three artificial networks. The results
suggest that the two algorithms can respectively reduce the convergence time up
to 75.4\% and 92.9\% in average, compared with the original asynchronous
updating algorithm.

 <dc:title>Poisson Cluster Process Based Analysis of HetNets with Correlated User
  and Base Station Locations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Afshang, Mehrnaz</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Dhillon, Harpreet S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper develops a new approach to the modeling and analysis of HetNets
that accurately incorporates coupling across the locations of users and base
stations, which exists due to the deployment of small cell base stations (SBSs)
at the places of high user density (termed user hotspots in this paper).
Modeling the locations of the geographical centers of user hotspots as a
homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP), we assume that the users and SBSs are
clustered around each user hotspot center independently with two different
distributions. The macrocell base station (BS) locations are modeled by an
independent PPP. This model is consistent with the user and SBS configurations
considered by 3GPP. Using this model, we study the performance of a typical
user in terms of coverage probability and throughput for two association
policies: i) Policy 1, under which a typical user is served by the open-access
BS that provides maximum averaged received power, and ii) Policy 2, under which
the typical user is served by the small cell tier if the maximum averaged
received power from the open-access SBSs is greater than a certain power
threshold; and macro tier otherwise. A key intermediate step in our analysis is
the derivation of distance distributions from a typical user to the open-access
and closed-access interfering SBSs. Our analysis demonstrates that as the
number of SBSs reusing the same resource block increases, coverage probability
decreases whereas throughput increases. Therefore, contrary to the usual
assumption of orthogonal channelization, it is reasonable to assign the same
resource block to multiple SBSs in a given cluster as long as the coverage
probability remains acceptable. This approach to HetNet modeling and analysis
significantly generalizes the state-of-the-art approaches that are based on
modeling the locations of BSs and users by independent PPPs.

 <dc:title>Real-Time Minimization of Average Error in the Presence of Uncertainty

 <dc:description>  We consider a two-level discrete-time control framework with real-time
constraints where a central controller issues setpoints to be implemented by
local controllers. The local controllers implement the setpoints with some
approximation and advertize a prediction of their constraints to the central
controller. The local controllers might not be able to implement the setpoint
exactly, due to prediction errors or because the central controller convexifies
the problem for tractability. In this paper, we propose to compensate for these
mismatches at the level of the local controller by using a variant of the error
diffusion algorithm. We give conditions under which the minimal (convex)
invariant set for the accumulated-error dynamics is bounded, and give a
computational method to construct this set. This can be used to compute a bound
on the accumulated error and hence establish convergence of the average error
to zero. We illustrate the approach in the context of real-time control of
electrical grids.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Full-duplex (FD) technology is envisaged as a key component for future mobile
broadband networks due to its ability to boost the spectral efficiency. FD
systems can transmit and receive simultaneously on the same frequency at the
expense of residual self-interference (SI) and additional interference to the
network compared with half-duplex (HD) transmission. This paper analyzes the
performance of wireless networks with FD multi-antenna base stations (BSs) and
HD user equipments (UEs) using stochastic geometry. Our analytical results
quantify the success probability and the achievable spectral efficiency and
indicate the amount of SI cancellation needed for beneficial FD operation. The
advantages of multi-antenna BSs/UEs are shown and the performance gains
achieved by balancing desired signal power increase and interference
cancellation are derived. The proposed framework aims at shedding light on the
system-level gains of FD mode with respect to HD mode in terms of network
throughput, and provides design guidelines for the practical implementation of
FD technology in large small-cell networks.

 <dc:title>Understanding Error Correction and its Role as Part of the Communication

 <dc:description>  The raise of complexity of technical systems also raises knowledge required
to set them up and to maintain them. The cost to evolve such systems can be
prohibitive. In the field of Autonomic Computing, technical systems should
therefore have various self-healing capabilities allowing system owners to
provide only partial, potentially inconsistent updates of the system. The
self-healing or self-integrating system shall find out the remaining changes to
communications and functionalities in order to accommodate change and yet still
restore function. This issue becomes even more interesting in context of
Internet of Things and Industrial Internet where previously unexpected device
combinations can be assembled in order to provide a surprising new function. In
order to pursue higher levels of self-integration capabilities I propose to
think of self-integration as sophisticated error correcting communications.
Therefore, this paper discusses an extended scope of error correction with the
purpose to emphasize error correction's role as an integrated element of
bi-directional communication channels in self-integrating, autonomic
communication scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world complex networks exhibit a community structure, in which the
modules correspond to actual functional units. Identifying these communities is
a key challenge for scientists. A common approach is to search for the network
partition that maximizes a quality function. Here, we present a detailed
analysis of a recently proposed function, namely modularity density. We show
that it does not incur in the drawbacks suffered by traditional modularity, and
that it can identify networks without ground-truth community structure,
deriving its analytical dependence on link density in generic random graphs. In
addition, we show that modularity density allows an easy comparison between
networks of different sizes, and we also present some limitations that methods
based on modularity density may suffer from. Finally, we introduce an
efficient, quadratic community detection algorithm based on modularity density
maximization, validating its accuracy against theoretical predictions and on a
set of benchmark networks.

 <dc:description>  Technology has become an essential part in every aspect of our lives. However
the key to a successful implementation of a technology depends on the
acceptance by the general public. In order to increase the acceptance various
approaches can be applied. In this paper, we will examine the human-robot
emotional interaction by investigating the capabilities of a developed
low-resolution RGB-LED display in the context of artificial emotions. We are
focusing on four of the most representative human emotions which include
happiness, anger, sadness and fear. We will work with colors and dynamic light
patterns which are supposed to evoke various associations. In an experiment,
the use these patterns as expressions of emotions are validated. The results of
the conducted study show that some of the considered basic emotions can be
recognized by human observers.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning optimizes policies for expected cumulative reward.
Need the supervision be so narrow? Reward is delayed and sparse for many tasks,
making it a difficult and impoverished signal for end-to-end optimization. To
augment reward, we consider a range of self-supervised tasks that incorporate
states, actions, and successors to provide auxiliary losses. These losses offer
ubiquitous and instantaneous supervision for representation learning even in
the absence of reward. While current results show that learning from reward
alone is feasible, pure reinforcement learning methods are constrained by
computational and data efficiency issues that can be remedied by auxiliary
losses. Self-supervised pre-training and joint optimization improve the data
efficiency and policy returns of end-to-end reinforcement learning.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel pseudo sequence based 2-D hierarchical
reference structure for light-field image compression. In the proposed scheme,
we first decompose the light-field image into multiple views and organize them
into a 2-D coding structure according to the spatial coordinates of the
corresponding microlens. Then we mainly develop three technologies to optimize
the 2-D coding structure. First, we divide all the views into four quadrants,
and all the views are encoded one quadrant after another to reduce the
reference buffer size as much as possible. Inside each quadrant, all the views
are encoded hierarchically to fully exploit the correlations between different
views. Second, we propose to use the distance between the current view and its
reference views as the criteria for selecting better reference frames for each
inter view. Third, we propose to use the spatial relative positions between
different views to achieve more accurate motion vector scaling. The whole
scheme is implemented in the reference software of High Efficiency Video
Coding. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed novel
pseudo-sequence based 2-D hierarchical structure can achieve maximum 14.2%
bit-rate savings compared with the state-of-the-art light-field image
compression method.

 <dc:description>  Important high-level vision tasks such as human-object interaction, image
captioning and robotic manipulation require rich semantic descriptions of
objects at part level. Based upon previous work on part localization, in this
paper, we address the problem of inferring rich semantics imparted by an object
part in still images. We propose to tokenize the semantic space as a discrete
set of part states. Our modeling of part state is spatially localized,
therefore, we formulate the part state inference problem as a pixel-wise
annotation problem. An iterative part-state inference neural network is
specifically designed for this task, which is efficient in time and accurate in
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
effectively predict the semantic states of parts and simultaneously correct
localization errors, thus benefiting a few visual understanding applications.
The other contribution of this paper is our part state dataset which contains
rich part-level semantic annotations.

 <dc:title>Improving the Quality of Random Number Generators by Applying a Simple

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is well-known that the quality of random number generators can often be
improved by combining several generators, e.g. by summing or subtracting their
results. In this paper we investigate the ratio of two random number generators
as an alternative approach: the smaller of two input random numbers is divided
by the larger, resulting in a rational number from $[0,1]$.
  We investigate theoretical properties of this approach and show that it
yields a good approximation to the ideal uniform distribution. To evaluate the
empirical properties we use the well-known test suite \textsc{TestU01}. We
apply the ratio transformation to moderately bad generators, i.e. those that
failed up to 40\% of the tests from the test battery \textsc{Crush} of
\textsc{TestU01}. We show that more than half of them turn into very good
generators that pass all tests of \textsc{Crush} and \textsc{BigCrush} from
\textsc{TestU01} when the ratio transformation is applied. In particular,
generators based on linear operations seem to benefit from the ratio, as this
breaks up some of the unwanted regularities in the input sequences. Thus the
additional effort to produce a second random number and to calculate the ratio
allows to increase the quality of available random number generators.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new family of RRT based algorithms, named RRT+ ,
that are able to find faster solutions in high-dimensional configuration spaces
compared to other existing RRT variants by finding paths in lower dimensional
subspaces of the configuration space. The method can be easily applied to
complex hyper-redundant systems and can be adapted by other RRT based planners.
We introduce RRT+ and develop some variants, called PrioritizedRRT+ ,
PrioritizedRRT+-Connect, and PrioritizedBidirectionalT-RRT+ , that use the new
sampling technique and we show that our method provides faster results than the
corresponding original algorithms. Experiments using the state-of-the-art
planners available in OMPL show superior performance of RRT+ for
high-dimensional motion planning problems.

 <dc:description>  The paper studies distributed Dictionary Learning (DL) problems where the
learning task is distributed over a multi-agent network with time-varying
(nonsymmetric) connectivity. This formulation is relevant, for instance, in
big-data scenarios where massive amounts of data are collected/stored in
different spatial locations and it is unfeasible to aggregate and/or process
all the data in a fusion center, due to resource limitations, communication
overhead or privacy considerations. We develop a general distributed
algorithmic framework for the (nonconvex) DL problem and establish its
asymptotic convergence. The new method hinges on Successive Convex
Approximation (SCA) techniques coupled with i) a gradient tracking mechanism
instrumental to locally estimate the missing global information; and ii) a
consensus step, as a mechanism to distribute the computations among the agents.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed algorithm with
provable convergence for the DL problem and, more in general, bi-convex
optimization problems over (time-varying) directed graphs.

the knowledge of kinesiology, it will be seen as un-natural. The proposed
technique generates motion of the shoulder complex about the orientation of the
upper arm by interpolating the measurement data. The shoulder IK method allows
novice animators to generate natural shoulder motions easily. As a result, this
technique improves the quality of character animation.

 <dc:description>  Neural image/video captioning models can generate accurate descriptions, but
their internal process of mapping regions to words is a black box and therefore
difficult to explain. Top-down neural saliency methods can find important
regions given a high-level semantic task such as object classification, but
cannot use a natural language sentence as the top-down input for the task. In
this paper, we propose Caption-Guided Visual Saliency to expose the
region-to-word mapping in modern encoder-decoder networks and demonstrate that
it is learned implicitly from caption training data, without any pixel-level
annotations. Our approach can produce spatial or spatiotemporal heatmaps for
both predicted captions, and for arbitrary query sentences. It recovers
saliency without the overhead of introducing explicit attention layers, and can
be used to analyze a variety of existing model architectures and improve their
design. Evaluation on large-scale video and image datasets demonstrates that
our approach achieves comparable captioning performance with existing methods
while providing more accurate saliency heatmaps. Our code is available at

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new graph proximity measure. This measure is a
derivative of network reliability. By analyzing its properties and comparing it
against other proximity measures through graph examples, we demonstrate that it
is more consistent with human intuition than competitors. A new deterministic
algorithm is developed to approximate this measure with practical complexity.
Empirical evaluation by two link prediction benchmarks, one in coauthorship
networks and one in Wikipedia, shows promising results. For example, a single
parameterization of this measure achieves accuracies that are 14-35% above the
best accuracy for each graph of all predictors reported in the 2007
Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg survey.

 <dc:description>  Despite tremendous progress in outlier detection research in recent years,
the majority of existing methods are designed only to detect unconditional
outliers that correspond to unusual data patterns expressed in the joint space
of all data attributes. Such methods are not applicable when we seek to detect
conditional outliers that reflect unusual responses associated with a given
context or condition. This work focuses on multivariate conditional outlier
detection, a special type of the conditional outlier detection problem, where
data instances consist of multi-dimensional input (context) and output
(responses) pairs. We present a novel outlier detection framework that
identifies abnormal input-output associations in data with the help of a
decomposable conditional probabilistic model that is learned from all data
instances. Since components of this model can vary in their quality, we combine
them with the help of weights reflecting their reliability in assessment of
outliers. We study two ways of calculating the component weights: global that
relies on all data, and local that relies only on instances similar to the
target instance. Experimental results on data from various domains demonstrate
the ability of our framework to successfully identify multivariate conditional
outliers.

 <dc:description>  Microalgae counting is used to measure biomass quantity. Usually, it is
performed in a manual way using a Neubauer chamber and expert criterion, with
the risk of a high error rate. This paper addresses the methodology for
automatic identification of Scenedesmus microalgae (used in the methane
production and food industry) and applies it to images captured by a digital
microscope. The use of contrast adaptive histogram equalization for
pre-processing, and active contours for segmentation are presented. The
calculation of statistical features (Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Hu and
Zernike moments) with texture features (Haralick and Local Binary Patterns
descriptors) are proposed for algae characterization. Scenedesmus algae can
build coenobia consisting of 1, 2, 4 and 8 cells. The amount of algae of each
coenobium helps to determine the amount of lipids, proteins, and other
substances in a given sample of a algae crop. The knowledge of the quantity of
those elements improves the quality of bioprocess applications. Classification
of coenobia achieves accuracies of 98.63% and 97.32% with Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), respectively. According to
the results it is possible to consider the proposed methodology as an
alternative to the traditional technique for algae counting. The database used
in this paper is publicly available for download.

 <dc:description>  Many important geometric estimation problems take the form of synchronization
over the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of poses given a
set of relative measurements between them. This problem is typically formulated
as a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to
solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is
able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the
special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime.
The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the
maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact MLE so long as
the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a
certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is
possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of
the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for
solving large-scale instances of this relaxation by exploiting its low-rank,
geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent
optimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and design a
truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently.
Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding
procedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync
is able to recover certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available
measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than
that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and
does so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based
approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An uplink cognitive radio system with a single primary user (PU) and multiple
secondary users (SUs) is considered. The SUs have an individual average delay
constraint and an aggregate average interference constraint to the PU. If the
interference channels between the SUs and the PU are statistically different
due to the different physical locations of the SUs, the SUs will experience
different delay performances. This is because SUs located closer to the PU
transmit with lower power levels. A dynamic scheduling-and-power-allocation
policy that uses the dynamic programming, is proposed. The proposed policy can
provide the required average delay guarantees to all SUs irrespective of their
location as well as protect the PU from harmful interference. The policy is
shown to be asymptotically delay optimal in the light traffic regime.
Motivated, by the high complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm in the
optimal policy we exploit the structure of the problem's solution to present an
alternative suboptimal policy. Through simulations we show that in both light
and heavy traffic regimes, the delay performance of the suboptimal policy is
within $0.3\%$ from the optimal policy and both outperforming existing methods.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we will show that uncomputability is a relative property not
only of oracle Turing machines, but also of subrecursive classes. We will
define the concept of a Turing submachine, and a recursive relative version for
the Busy Beaver function which we will call Busy Beaver Plus function.
Therefore, we will prove that the computable Busy Beaver Plus function defined
on any Turing submachine is not computable by any program running on this
submachine. We will thereby demonstrate the existence of a &quot;paradox&quot; of
computability a la Skolem: a function is computable when &quot;seen from the
outside&quot; the subsystem, but uncomputable when &quot;seen from within&quot; the same
subsystem. Finally, we will raise the possibility of defining universal
submachines, and a hierarchy of negative Turing degrees.

 <dc:description>  Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) aims to accelerate
optimal design of complex material systems by integrating material science and
design automation. For tractable ICME, it is required that (1) a structural
feature space be identified to allow reconstruction of new designs, and (2) the
reconstruction process be property-preserving. The majority of existing
structural presentation schemes rely on the designer's understanding of
specific material systems to identify geometric and statistical features, which
could be biased and insufficient for reconstructing physically meaningful
microstructures of complex material systems. In this paper, we develop a
feature learning mechanism based on convolutional deep belief network to
automate a two-way conversion between microstructures and their
lower-dimensional feature representations, and to achieves a 1000-fold
dimension reduction from the microstructure space. The proposed model is
applied to a wide spectrum of heterogeneous material systems with distinct
microstructural features including Ti-6Al-4V alloy, Pb63-Sn37 alloy,
Fontainebleau sandstone, and Spherical colloids, to produce material
reconstructions that are close to the original samples with respect to 2-point
correlation functions and mean critical fracture strength. This capability is
not achieved by existing synthesis methods that rely on the Markovian
assumption of material microstructures.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the joint learning of action recognition and temporal
localization in long, untrimmed videos. We employ a multi-task learning
framework that performs the three highly related steps of action proposal,
action recognition, and action localization refinement in parallel instead of
the standard sequential pipeline that performs the steps in order. We develop a
novel temporal actionness regression module that estimates what proportion of a
clip contains action. We use it for temporal localization but it could have
other applications like video retrieval, surveillance, summarization, etc. We
also introduce random shear augmentation during training to simulate viewpoint
change. We evaluate our framework on three popular video benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that our joint model is efficient in terms of storage and
computation in that we do not need to compute and cache dense trajectory
features, and that it is several times faster than its sequential ConvNets
counterpart. Yet, despite being more efficient, it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods with respect to accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We study distributed graph algorithms that adopt an iterative vertex-centric
framework for graph processing, popularized by the Google's Pregel system.
Since then, there are several attempts to implement many graph algorithms in a
vertex-centric framework, as well as efforts to design optimization techniques
for improving the efficiency. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has
not been any systematic study to compare these vertex-centric implementations
with their sequential counterparts. Our paper addresses this gap in two ways.
(1) We analyze the computational complexity of such implementations with the
notion of time-processor product, and benchmark several vertex-centric graph
algorithms whether they perform more work with respect to their best-known
sequential solutions. (2) Employing the concept of balanced practical Pregel
algorithms, we study if these implementations suffer from imbalanced workload
and large number of iterations. Our findings illustrate that with the exception
of Euler tour tree algorithm, all other algorithms either perform more work
than their best-known sequential approach, or suffer from imbalanced workload/
large number of iterations, or even both. We also emphasize on graph algorithms
that are fundamentally difficult to be expressed in vertex-centric frameworks,
and conclude by discussing the road ahead for distributed graph processing.

 <dc:description>  The $c$-approximate Near Neighbor problem in high dimensional spaces has been
mainly addressed by Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which offers polynomial
dependence on the dimension, query time sublinear in the size of the dataset,
and subquadratic space requirement. For practical applications, linear space is
typically imperative. Most previous work in the linear space regime focuses on
the case that $c$ exceeds $1$ by a constant term. In a recently accepted paper,
optimal bounds have been achieved for any $c&gt;1$ \cite{ALRW17}.
  Towards practicality, we present a new and simple data structure using linear
space and sublinear query time for any $c&gt;1$ including $c\to 1^+$. Given an LSH
family of functions for some metric space, we randomly project points to the
Hamming cube of dimension $\log n$, where $n$ is the number of input points.
The projected space contains strings which serve as keys for buckets containing
the input points. The query algorithm simply projects the query point, then
examines points which are assigned to the same or nearby vertices on the
Hamming cube. We analyze in detail the query time for some standard LSH
families.
  To illustrate our claim of practicality, we offer an open-source
implementation in {\tt C++}, and report on several experiments in dimension up
to 1000 and $n$ up to $10^6$. Our algorithm is one to two orders of magnitude
faster than brute force search. Experiments confirm the sublinear dependence on
$n$ and the linear dependence on the dimension. We have compared against
state-of-the-art LSH-based library {\tt FALCONN}: our search is somewhat
slower, but memory usage and preprocessing time are significantly smaller.

 <dc:description>  Neural network based sequence-to-sequence models in an encoder-decoder
framework have been successfully applied to solve Question Answering (QA)
problems, predicting answers from statements and questions. However, almost all
previous models have failed to consider detailed context information and
unknown states under which systems do not have enough information to answer
given questions. These scenarios with incomplete or ambiguous information are
very common in the setting of Interactive Question Answering (IQA). To address
this challenge, we develop a novel model, employing context-dependent
word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and
question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. We also
generate unique IQA datasets to test our model, which will be made publicly
available. Employing these attention mechanisms, our model accurately
understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a
supplementary question for additional input depending on different contexts.
When available, user's feedback is encoded and directly applied to update
sentence-level attention to infer an answer. Extensive experiments on QA and
IQA datasets quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with
significant improvement over state-of-the-art conventional QA models.

 <dc:description>  For greedy block sparse recovery where the sparsity level is unknown, we
derive a stopping condition to stop the iteration process. Focused on the block
orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm, we model the energy of residual
signals at each iteration from a probabilistic perspective. At the iteration
when the last supporting block is detected, the resulting energy of residual
signals is supposed to suffer an obvious decrease. Based on this, we stop the
iteration process when the energy of residual signals is below a given
threshold. Compared with other approaches, our derived condition works well for
the BOMP recovery. What is more, we promote our approach to the interference
cancellation based BOMP (ICBOMP) recovery in paper [1]. Simulation results show
that our derived condition can save many unnecessary iterations and at the same
time guarantees a favorable recovery accuracy, both for the BOMP and ICBOMP
recoveries.

 <dc:title>Cache-induced Hierarchical Cooperation in Wireless Device-to-Device

 <dc:description>  We consider a wireless device-to-device (D2D) caching network where n nodes
are placed on a regular grid of area A(n). Each node caches L_C*F (coded) bits
from a library of size L*F bits, where L is the number of files and F is the
size of each file. Each node requests a file from the library independently
according to a popularity distribution. Under a commonly used &quot;physical model&quot;
and Zipf popularity distribution, we characterize the optimal per-node capacity
scaling law for extended networks (i.e., A(n). Moreover, we propose a
cache-induced hierarchical cooperation scheme and associated cache content
placement optimization algorithm to achieve the optimal per-node capacity
scaling law. When the path loss exponent \alpha&lt;3, the optimal per-node
capacity scaling law achieved by the cache-induced hierarchical cooperation can
be significantly better than that achieved by the existing state-of-the-art
schemes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that completely
characterizes the per-node capacity scaling law for wireless caching networks
under the physical model and Zipf distribution with an arbitrary skewness
parameter \tau. While scaling law analysis yields clean results, it may not
accurately reflect the throughput performance of a large network with a finite
number of nodes. Therefore, we also analyze the throughput of the proposed
cache-induced hierarchical cooperation for networks of practical size. The
analysis and simulations verify that cache-induced hierarchical cooperation can
also achieve a large throughput gain over the cache-assisted multihop scheme
for networks of practical size.

 <dc:description>  Indoor scene understanding is central to applications such as robot
navigation and human companion assistance. Over the last years, data-driven
deep neural networks have outperformed many traditional approaches thanks to
their representation learning capabilities. One of the bottlenecks in training
for better representations is the amount of available per-pixel ground truth
data that is required for core scene understanding tasks such as semantic
segmentation, normal prediction, and object edge detection. To address this
problem, a number of works proposed using synthetic data. However, a systematic
study of how such synthetic data is generated is missing. In this work, we
introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset with 400K physically-based rendered
images from 45K realistic 3D indoor scenes. We study the effects of rendering
methods and scene lighting on training for three computer vision tasks: surface
normal prediction, semantic segmentation, and object boundary detection. This
study provides insights into the best practices for training with synthetic
data (more realistic rendering is worth it) and shows that pretraining with our
new synthetic dataset can improve results beyond the current state of the art
on all three tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this digitalised world where every information is stored, the data a are
growing exponentially. It is estimated that data are doubles itself every two
years. Geospatial data are one of the prime contributors to the big data
scenario. There are numerous tools of the big data analytics. But not all the
big data analytics tools are capabilities to handle geospatial big data. In the
present paper, it has been discussed about the recent two popular open source
geospatial big data analytical tools i.e. Spatial- Hadoop and GeoSpark which
can be used for analysis and process the geospatial big data in efficient
manner. It has compared the architectural view of SpatialHadoop and GeoSpark.
Through the architectural comparison, it has also summarised the merits and
demerits of these tools according the execution times and volume of the data
which has been used.

 <dc:description>  $\ell_1$ optimization is a well known heuristic often employed for solving
various forms of sparse linear problems. In this paper we look at its a variant
that we refer to as the \emph{partial} $\ell_1$ and discuss its mathematical
properties when used for solving linear under-determined systems of equations.
We will focus on large random systems and discuss the phase transition (PT)
phenomena and how they connect to the large deviation principles (LDP). Using a
variety of probabilistic and geometric techniques that we have developed in
recent years we will first present general guidelines that conceptually fully
characterize both, the PTs and the LDPs. After that we will put an emphasis on
providing a collection of explicit analytical solutions to all of the
underlying mathematical problems. As a nice bonus to the developed concepts,
the forms of the analytical solutions will, in our view, turn out to be fairly
elegant as well.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we provide a complementary set of results to those we present
in our companion work \cite{Stojnicl1HidParasymldp} regarding the behavior of
the so-called partial $\ell_1$ (a variant of the standard $\ell_1$ heuristic
often employed for solving under-determined systems of linear equations). As is
well known through our earlier works
\cite{StojnicICASSP10knownsupp,StojnicTowBettCompSens13}, the partial $\ell_1$
also exhibits the phase-transition (PT) phenomenon, discovered and well
understood in the context of the standard $\ell_1$ through Donoho's and our own
works \cite{DonohoPol,DonohoUnsigned,StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}.
\cite{Stojnicl1HidParasymldp} goes much further though and, in addition to the
determination of the partial $\ell_1$'s phase-transition curves (PT curves)
(which had already been done in
\cite{StojnicICASSP10knownsupp,StojnicTowBettCompSens13}), provides a
substantially deeper understanding of the PT phenomena through a study of the
underlying large deviations principles (LDPs). As the PT and LDP phenomena are
by their definitions related to large dimensional settings, both sets of our
works, \cite{StojnicICASSP10knownsupp,StojnicTowBettCompSens13} and
\cite{Stojnicl1HidParasymldp}, consider what is typically called the asymptotic
regime. In this paper we move things in a different direction and consider
finite dimensional scenarios. Basically, we provide explicit performance
characterizations for any given collection of systems/parameters dimensions. We
do so for two different variants of the partial $\ell_1$, one that we call
exactly the partial $\ell_1$ and another one, possibly a bit more practical,
that we call the hidden partial $\ell_1$.

 <dc:description>  Providing machine learning (ML) over relational data is a mainstream
requirement for data analytics systems. While almost all the ML tools require
the input data to be presented as a single table, many datasets are
multi-table, which forces data scientists to join those tables first, leading
to data redundancy and runtime waste. Recent works on &quot;factorized&quot; ML mitigate
this issue for a few specific ML algorithms by pushing ML through joins. But
their approaches require a manual rewrite of ML implementations. Such piecemeal
methods create a massive development overhead when extending such ideas to
other ML algorithms. In this paper, we show that it is possible to mitigate
this overhead by leveraging a popular formal algebra to represent the
computations of many ML algorithms: linear algebra. We introduce a new logical
data type to represent normalized data and devise a framework of algebraic
rewrite rules to convert a large set of linear algebra operations over
denormalized data into operations over normalized data. We show how this
enables us to automatically &quot;factorize&quot; several popular ML algorithms, thus
unifying and generalizing several prior works. We prototype our framework in
the popular ML environment R and an industrial R-over-RDBMS tool. Experiments
with both synthetic and real normalized data show that our framework also
yields significant speed-ups, up to 36x on real data.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the problem of extracting deeply learned features
directly from compressive measurements. There has been no work in this area.
Existing deep learning tools only give good results when applied on the full
signal, that too usually after preprocessing. These techniques require the
signal to be reconstructed first. In this work we show that by learning
directly from the compressed domain, considerably better results can be
obtained. This work extends the recently proposed framework of deep matrix
factorization in combination with blind compressed sensing; hence the term deep
blind compressed sensing. Simulation experiments have been carried out on
imaging via single pixel camera, under-sampled biomedical signals, arising in
wireless body area network and compressive hyperspectral imaging. In all cases,
the superiority of our proposed deep blind compressed sensing can be envisaged.

 <dc:title>How to Train Your Deep Neural Network with Dictionary Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Currently there are two predominant ways to train deep neural networks. The
first one uses restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and the second one
autoencoders. RBMs are stacked in layers to form deep belief network (DBN); the
final representation layer is attached to the target to complete the deep
neural network. Autoencoders are nested one inside the other to form stacked
autoencoders; once the stcaked autoencoder is learnt the decoder portion is
detached and the target attached to the deepest layer of the encoder to form
the deep neural network. This work proposes a new approach to train deep neural
networks using dictionary learning as the basic building block; the idea is to
use the features from the shallower layer as inputs for training the next
deeper layer. One can use any type of dictionary learning (unsupervised,
supervised, discriminative etc.) as basic units till the pre-final layer. In
the final layer one needs to use the label consistent dictionary learning
formulation for classification. We compare our proposed framework with existing
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques on benchmark problems; we are always
within the top 10 results. In actual problems of age and gender classification,
we are better than the best known techniques.

 <dc:description>  The 2-LCPS problem, first introduced by Chowdhury et al. [Fundam. Inform.,
129(4):329-340, 2014], asks one to compute (the length of) a longest
palindromic common subsequence between two given strings $A$ and $B$. We show
that the 2-LCPS problem is at least as hard as the well-studied longest common
subsequence problem for four strings (the 4-LCS problem). Then, we present a
new algorithm which solves the 2-LCPS problem in $O(\sigma M^2 + n)$ time,
where $n$ denotes the length of $A$ and $B$, $M$ denotes the number of matching
positions between $A$ and $B$, and $\sigma$ denotes the number of distinct
characters occurring in both $A$ and $B$. Our new algorithm is faster than
Chowdhury et al.'s sparse algorithm when $\sigma = o(\log^2n \log\log n)$.

 <dc:title>Continuous multilinguality with language vectors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Most existing models for multilingual natural language processing (NLP) treat
language as a discrete category, and make predictions for either one language
or the other. In contrast, we propose using continuous vector representations
of language. We show that these can be learned efficiently with a
character-based neural language model, and used to improve inference about
language varieties not seen during training. In experiments with 1303 Bible
translations into 990 different languages, we empirically explore the capacity
of multilingual language models, and also show that the language vectors
capture genetic relationships between languages.

 <dc:title>Science, AskScience, and BadScience: On the Coexistence of Highly
  Related Communities</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  When large social-media platforms allow users to easily form and
self-organize into interest groups, highly related communities can arise. For
example, the Reddit site hosts not just a group called food, but also
HealthyFood, foodhacks, foodporn, and cooking, among others. Are these highly
related communities created for similar classes of reasons (e.g., to focus on a
subtopic, to create a place for allegedly more &quot;high-minded&quot; discourse, etc.)?
How do users allocate attention between such close alternatives when they are
available or emerge over time? Are there different types of relations between
close alternatives such as sharing many users vs. a new community drawing away
members of an older one vs. a splinter group failing to cohere into a viable
separate community? We investigate the interactions between highly related
communities using data from reddit.com consisting of 975M posts and comments
spanning an 8-year period. We identify a set of typical affixes that users
adopt to create highly related communities and build a taxonomy of affixes. One
interesting finding regarding users' behavior is: after a newer community is
created, for several types of highly-related community pairs, users that engage
in a newer community tend to be more active in their original community than
users that do not explore, even when controlling for previous level of
engagement.

 <dc:title>Cube vs. Cube Low Degree Test</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We revisit the Raz-Safra plane-vs.-plane test and study the closely related
cube vs. cube test. In this test the tester has access to a &quot;cubes table&quot; which
assigns to every cube a low degree polynomial. The tester randomly selects two
cubes (affine sub-spaces of dimension $3$) that intersect on a point $x\in
\mathbf{F}^m$, and checks that the assignments to the cubes agree with each
other on the point $x$.
  Our main result is a new combinatorial proof for a low degree test that comes
closer to the soundness limit, as it works for all $\epsilon \ge
poly(d)/{\mathbf{F}}^{1/2}$, where $d$ is the degree. This should be compared
to the previously best soundness value of $\epsilon \ge poly(m,
d)/\mathbf{F}^{1/8}$. Our soundness limit improves upon the dependence on the
field size and does not depend on the dimension of the ambient space.
  Our proof is combinatorial and direct: unlike the Raz-Safra proof, it
proceeds in one shot and does not require induction on the dimension of the
ambient space. The ideas in our proof come from works on direct product testing
which are even simpler in the current setting thanks to the low degree.
  Along the way we also prove a somewhat surprising fact about connection
between different agreement tests: it does not matter if the tester chooses the
cubes to intersect on points or on lines: for every given table, its success
probability in either test is nearly the same.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given an array of $n$ elements from a total order, we propose encodings that
support various range queries (range minimum, range maximum and their
variants), and previous and next smaller/larger value queries. When query time
is not of concern, we obtain a $4.088n + o(n)$-bit encoding that supports all
these queries. For the case when we need to support all these queries in
constant time, we give an encoding that takes $4.585n + o(n)$ bits, where $n$
is the length of input array. This improves the $5.08n+o(n)$-bit encoding
obtained by encoding the colored $2d$-Min and Max heaps proposed by
Fischer~[TCS, 2011]. We first extend the original DFUDS [Algorithmica, 2005]
encoding of the colored 2d-Min (Max) heap that supports the queries in constant
time. Then, we combine the extended DFUDS of $2d$-Min heap and $2d$-Max heap
using the Min-Max encoding of Gawrychowski and Nicholson [ICALP, 2015] with
some modifications. We also obtain encodings that take lesser space and support
a subset of these queries.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address two different types of noise in information
extraction models: noise from distant supervision and noise from pipeline input
features. Our target tasks are entity typing and relation extraction. For the
first noise type, we introduce multi-instance multi-label learning algorithms
using neural network models, and apply them to fine-grained entity typing for
the first time. This gives our models comparable performance with the
state-of-the-art supervised approach which uses global embeddings of entities.
For the second noise type, we propose ways to improve the integration of noisy
entity type predictions into relation extraction. Our experiments show that
probabilistic predictions are more robust than discrete predictions and that
joint training of the two tasks performs best.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new family of graphical models that consists of graphs with
possibly directed, undirected and bidirected edges but without directed cycles.
We show that these models are suitable for representing causal models with
additive error terms. We provide a set of sufficient graphical criteria for the
identification of arbitrary causal effects when the new models contain directed
and undirected edges but no bidirected edge. We also provide a necessary and
sufficient graphical criterion for the identification of the causal effect of a
single variable on the rest of the variables. Moreover, we develop an exact
algorithm for learning the new models from observational and interventional
data via answer set programming. Finally, we introduce gated models for causal
effect identification, a new family of graphical models that exploits context
specific independences to identify additional causal effects.

 <dc:description>  The fuzzy $K$-means problem is a generalization of the $K$-means problem to
soft clusterings. Although popular in practice, the first
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for this problem have been proposed
only recently. In this paper, we pursue the analysis of the fuzzy $K$-means
problem further by making use of coresets. A coreset is an efficient
representative of the input data set that preserves certain properties of the
input, such as the quality of a solution.
  In this paper, we propose a novel proof technique for coresets, which makes
use of the notion of weak coresets. Following this approach, we are able to
show that small coresets for the fuzzy $K$-means problem exist. More precisely,
we show that coresets with size poly-logarithmic in the number of input data
points can be constructed in linear time. With these coresets, we are able to
improve the asymptotic runtime of one of the best approximation algorithms for
the fuzzy $K$-means problem.

 <dc:description>  Most of the existing studies on voice conversion (VC) are conducted in
acoustically matched conditions between source and target signal. However, the
robustness of VC methods in presence of mismatch remains unknown. In this
paper, we report a comparative analysis of different VC techniques under
mismatched conditions. The extensive experiments with five different VC
techniques on CMU ARCTIC corpus suggest that performance of VC methods
substantially degrades in noisy conditions. We have found that bilinear
frequency warping with amplitude scaling (BLFWAS) outperforms other methods in
most of the noisy conditions. We further explore the suitability of different
speech enhancement techniques for robust conversion. The objective evaluation
results indicate that spectral subtraction and log minimum mean square error
(logMMSE) based speech enhancement techniques can be used to improve the
performance in specific noisy conditions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an efficient divide-and-conquer (DC) algorithm is proposed for
the symmetric tridiagonal matrices based on ScaLAPACK and the hierarchically
semiseparable (HSS) matrices. HSS is an important type of rank-structured
matrices.Most time of the DC algorithm is cost by computing the eigenvectors
via the matrix-matrix multiplications (MMM). In our parallel hybrid DC (PHDC)
algorithm, MMM is accelerated by using the HSS matrix techniques when the
intermediate matrix is large. All the HSS algorithms are done via the package
STRUMPACK. PHDC has been tested by using many different matrices. Compared with
the DC implementation in MKL, PHDC can be faster for some matrices with few
deflations when using hundreds of processes. However, the gains decrease as the
number of processes increases. The comparisons of PHDC with ELPA (the
Eigenvalue soLvers for Petascale Applications library) are similar. PHDC is
usually slower than MKL and ELPA when using 300 or more processes on Tianhe-2
supercomputer.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art methods for handwriting recognition are based on Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN), which now provides very
impressive character recognition performance. The character recognition is
generally coupled with a lexicon driven decoding process which integrates
dictionaries. Unfortunately these dictionaries are limited to hundred of
thousands words for the best systems, which prevent from having a good language
coverage, and therefore limit the global recognition performance. In this
article, we propose an alternative to the lexicon driven decoding process based
on a lexicon verification process, coupled with an original cascade
architecture. The cascade is made of a large number of complementary networks
extracted from a single training (called cohort), making the learning process
very light. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the art word recognition
performance on the Rimes and IAM databases. Dealing with gigantic lexicon of 3
millions words, the methods also demonstrates interesting performance with a
fast decision stage.

 <dc:creator>Cai, Deng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in many
areas of machine learning and data mining. During the past decade, numerous
hashing algorithms are proposed to solve this problem. Every proposed algorithm
claims outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. However, there are serious
drawbacks in the evaluation of existing hashing papers and most of the claims
in these papers should be re-examined. 1) Most of the existing papers failed to
correctly measure the search time which is essential for the ANN search
problem. 2) As a result, most of the papers report the performance increases as
the code length increases, which is wrong if we measure the search time
correctly. 3) The performance of some hashing algorithms (e.g., LSH) can easily
be boosted if one uses multiple hash tables, which is an important factor
should be considered in the evaluation while most of the papers failed to do
so. In this paper, we carefully revisit many popular hashing algorithms and
suggest one possible promising direction. For the sake of reproducibility, all
the codes used in the paper are released on Github, which can be used as a
testing platform to fairly compare various hashing algorithms.

 <dc:title>Equilibrium Approximation Quality of Current No-Limit Poker Bots</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Approximating a Nash equilibrium is currently the best performing approach
for creating poker-playing programs. While for the simplest variants of the
game, it is possible to evaluate the quality of the approximation by computing
the value of the best response strategy, this is currently not computationally
feasible for larger variants of the game, such as heads-up no-limit Texas
hold'em. In this paper, we present a simple and computationally inexpensive
Local Best Response method for computing an approximate lower bound on the
value of the best response strategy. Using this method, we show that existing
poker-playing programs, based on solving abstract games, are remarkably poor
Nash equilibrium approximations.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a type of instability that is linked to the greedy
policy improvement in approximated reinforcement learning. We show empirically
that non-deterministic policy improvement can stabilize methods like LSPI by
controlling the improvements' stochasticity. Additionally we show that a
suitable representation of the value function also stabilizes the solution to
some degree. The presented approach is simple and should also be easily
transferable to more sophisticated algorithms like deep reinforcement learning.

 <dc:description>  There exist two conjectures for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) of
reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures: the first one states that
tractability of the CSP of such a structure is, when the structure is a
model-complete core, equivalent to its polymorphism clone satisfying a certain
non-trivial linear identity modulo outer embeddings. The second conjecture,
challenging the approach via model-complete cores by reflections, states that
tractability is equivalent to the linear identities (without outer embeddings)
satisfied by its polymorphisms clone, together with the natural uniformity on
it, being non-trivial.
  We prove that the identities satisfied in the polymorphism clone of a
structure allow for conclusions about the orbit growth of its automorphism
group, and apply this to show that the two conjectures are equivalent. We
contrast this with a counterexample showing that $\omega$-categoricity alone is
insufficient to imply the equivalence of the two conditions above in a
model-complete core.
  Taking a different approach, we then show how the Ramsey property of a
homogeneous structure can be utilized for obtaining a similar equivalence under
different conditions.
  We then prove that any polymorphism of sufficiently large arity which is
totally symmetric modulo outer embeddings of a finitely bounded structure can
be turned into a non-trivial system of linear identities, and obtain
non-trivial linear identities for all tractable cases of reducts of the
rational order, the random graph, and the random poset.
  Finally, we provide a new and short proof, in the language of monoids, of the
existence and uniqueness of the model-complete core of an $\omega$-categorical
structure.

 <dc:title>The SP Theory of Intelligence as a Foundation for the Development of a
  General, Human-Level Thinking Machine</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wolff, J Gerard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper summarises how the &quot;SP theory of intelligence&quot; and its realisation
in the &quot;SP computer model&quot; simplifies and integrates concepts across artificial
intelligence and related areas, and thus provides a promising foundation for
the development of a general, human-level thinking machine, in accordance with
the main goal of research in artificial general intelligence.
  The key to this simplification and integration is the powerful concept of
&quot;multiple alignment&quot;, borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. This concept
has the potential to be the &quot;double helix&quot; of intelligence, with as much
significance for human-level intelligence as has DNA for biological sciences.
  Strengths of the SP system include: versatility in the representation of
diverse kinds of knowledge; versatility in aspects of intelligence (including:
strengths in unsupervised learning; the processing of natural language; pattern
recognition at multiple levels of abstraction that is robust in the face of
errors in data; several kinds of reasoning (including: one-step `deductive'
reasoning; chains of reasoning; abductive reasoning; reasoning with
probabilistic networks and trees; reasoning with 'rules'; nonmonotonic
reasoning and reasoning with default values; Bayesian reasoning with
'explaining away'; and more); planning; problem solving; and more); seamless
integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence
in any combination; and potential for application in several areas (including:
helping to solve nine problems with big data; helping to develop human-level
intelligence in autonomous robots; serving as a database with intelligence and
with versatility in the representation and integration of several forms of
knowledge; serving as a vehicle for medical knowledge and as an aid to medical
diagnosis; and several more).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we obtain several error bounds on function approximation for
the policy evaluation algorithm proposed by Basu et al. when the aim is to find
the risk-sensitive cost represented using exponential utility. We also give
examples where all our bounds achieve the &quot;actual error&quot; whereas the earlier
bound given by Basu et al. is much weaker in comparison. We show that this
happens due to the absence of difference term in the earlier bound which is
always present in all our bounds when the state space is large. Additionally,
we discuss how all our bounds compare with each other.

 <dc:description>  Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are
increasingly being seen as a means of mitigating the pressing concerns of
traffic-related pollution. While hybrid vehicles are usually designed with the
objective of minimising fuel consumption, in this paper we propose engine
management strategies that also take into account environmental effects of the
vehicles to pedestrians outside of the vehicles. Specifically, we present
optimisation based engine energy management strategies for PHEVs, that attempt
to minimise the environmental impact of pedestrians along the route of the
vehicle, while taking account of route dependent uncertainties. We implement
the proposed approach in a real PHEV, and evaluate the performance in a
hardware-in-the-loop platform. A variety of simulation results are given to
illustrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Laguerre and Laguerre-type polynomials are orthogonal polynomials on the
interval $[0,\infty)$ with respect to a weight function of the form $w(x) =
x^{\alpha} e^{-Q(x)}, Q(x) = \sum_{k=0}^m q_k x^k, \alpha &gt; -1, q_m &gt; 0$. The
classical Laguerre polynomials correspond to $Q(x)=x$. The computation of
higher-order terms of the asymptotic expansions of these polynomials for large
degree becomes quite complicated, and a full description seems to be lacking in
literature. However, this information is implicitly available in the work of
Vanlessen, based on a non-linear steepest descent analysis of an associated
so-called Riemann--Hilbert problem. We will extend this work and show how to
efficiently compute an arbitrary number of higher-order terms in the asymptotic
expansions of Laguerre and Laguerre-type polynomials. This effort is similar to
the case of Jacobi and Jacobi-type polynomials in a previous paper. We supply
an implementation with explicit expansions in four different regions of the
complex plane. These expansions can also be extended to Hermite-type weights of
the form $\exp(-\sum_{k=0}^m q_k x^{2k})$ on $(-\infty,\infty)$, and to general
non-polynomial functions $Q(x)$ using contour integrals. The expansions may be
used, e.g., to compute Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rules in a lower computational
complexity than based on the recurrence relation, and with improved accuracy
for large degree. They are also of interest in random matrix theory.

 <dc:description>  We present DroidGen a tool for automatic anti-malware policy inference.
DroidGen employs a data-driven approach: it uses a training set of malware and
benign applications and makes call to a constraint solver to generate a policy
under which a maximum of malware is excluded and a maximum of benign
applications is allowed. Preliminary results are encouraging. We are able to
automatically generate a policy which filters out 91% of the tested Android
malware. Moreover, compared to black-box machine learning classifiers, our
method has the advantage of generating policies in a declarative readable
format. We illustrate our approach, describe its implementation and report on
the preliminary results.

 <dc:description>  Optimization - minimization or maximization - in the lattice of subsets is a
frequent operation in Artificial Intelligence tasks. Examples are
subset-minimal model-based diagnosis, nonmonotonic reasoning by means of
circumscription, or preferred extensions in abstract argumentation. Finding the
optimum among many admissible solutions is often harder than finding admissible
solutions with respect to both computational complexity and methodology. This
paper addresses the former issue by means of an effective method for finding
subset-optimal solutions. It is based on the relationship between
cardinality-optimal and subset-optimal solutions, and the fact that many
logic-based declarative programming systems provide constructs for finding
cardinality-optimal solutions, for example maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) or
weak constraints in Answer Set Programming (ASP). Clearly each
cardinality-optimal solution is also a subset-optimal one, and if the language
also allows for the addition of particular restricting constructs (both MaxSAT
and ASP do) then all subset-optimal solutions can be found by an iterative
computation of cardinality-optimal solutions. As a showcase, the computation of
preferred extensions of abstract argumentation frameworks using the proposed
method is studied.

 <dc:description>  In many data exploration tasks it is meaningful to identify groups of
attribute interactions that are specific to a variable of interest. For
instance, in a dataset where the attributes are medical markers and the
variable of interest (class variable) is binary indicating presence/absence of
disease, we would like to know which medical markers interact with respect to
the binary class label. These interactions are useful in several practical
applications, for example, to gain insight into the structure of the data, in
feature selection, and in data anonymisation. We present a novel method, based
on statistical significance testing, that can be used to verify if the data set
has been created by a given factorised class-conditional joint distribution,
where the distribution is parametrised by a partition of its attributes.
Furthermore, we provide a method, named ASTRID, for automatically finding a
partition of attributes describing the distribution that has generated the
data. State-of-the-art classifiers are utilised to capture the interactions
present in the data by systematically breaking attribute interactions and
observing the effect of this breaking on classifier performance. We empirically
demonstrate the utility of the proposed method with examples using real and
synthetic data.

 <dc:description>  The task of generating natural language descriptions from images has received
a lot of attention in recent years. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly
important to evaluate such image captioning approaches in an automatic manner.
In this paper, we provide an in-depth evaluation of the existing image
captioning metrics through a series of carefully designed experiments.
Moreover, we explore the utilization of the recently proposed Word Mover's
Distance (WMD) document metric for the purpose of image captioning. Our
findings outline the differences and/or similarities between metrics and their
relative robustness by means of extensive correlation, accuracy and distraction
based evaluations. Our results also demonstrate that WMD provides strong
advantages over other metrics.

 <dc:description>  While the solution counting problem for propositional satisfiability (#SAT)
has received renewed attention in recent years, this research trend has not
affected other AI solving paradigms like answer set programming (ASP). Although
ASP solvers are designed to enumerate all solutions, and counting can therefore
be easily done, the involved materialization of all solutions is a clear
bottleneck for the counting problem of ASP (#ASP). In this paper we propose
dynamic programming-based #ASP algorithms that exploit the structure of the
underlying (ground) ASP program. Experimental results for a prototype
implementation show promise when compared to existing solvers.
