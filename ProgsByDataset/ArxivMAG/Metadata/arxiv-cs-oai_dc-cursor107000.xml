 <dc:description>  For state-of-the-art semantic segmentation task, training convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) requires dense pixelwise ground truth (GT) labeling,
which is expensive and involves extensive human effort. In this work, we study
the possibility of using auxiliary ground truth, so-called \textit{pseudo
ground truth} (PGT) to improve the performance. The PGT is obtained by
propagating the labels of a GT frame to its subsequent frames in the video
using a simple CRF-based, cue integration framework. Our main contribution is
to demonstrate the use of noisy PGT along with GT to improve the performance of
a CNN. We perform a systematic analysis to find the right kind of PGT that
needs to be added along with the GT for training a CNN. In this regard, we
explore three aspects of PGT which influence the learning of a CNN: i) the PGT
labeling has to be of good quality; ii) the PGT images have to be different
compared to the GT images; iii) the PGT has to be trusted differently than GT.
We conclude that PGT which is diverse from GT images and has good quality of
labeling can indeed help improve the performance of a CNN. Also, when PGT is
multiple folds larger than GT, weighing down the trust on PGT helps in
improving the accuracy. Finally, We show that using PGT along with GT, the
performance of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) on Camvid data is increased by
$2.7\%$ on IoU accuracy. We believe such an approach can be used to train CNNs
for semantic video segmentation where sequentially labeled image frames are
needed. To this end, we provide recommendations for using PGT strategically for
semantic segmentation and hence bypass the need for extensive human efforts in
labeling.

 <dc:description>  Detecting emergence of a low-rank signal from high-dimensional data is an
important problem arising from many applications such as camera surveillance
and swarm monitoring using sensors. We consider a procedure based on the
largest eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix over a sliding window to
detect the change. To achieve dimensionality reduction, we present a
sketching-based approach for rank change detection using the low-dimensional
linear sketches of the original high-dimensional observations. The premise is
that when the sketching matrix is a random Gaussian matrix, and the dimension
of the sketching vector is sufficiently large, the rank of sample covariance
matrix for these sketches equals the rank of the original sample covariance
matrix with high probability. Hence, we may be able to detect the low-rank
change using sample covariance matrices of the sketches without having to
recover the original covariance matrix. We character the performance of the
largest eigenvalue statistic in terms of the false-alarm-rate and the expected
detection delay, and present an efficient online implementation via subspace
tracking.

 <dc:title>MatLM: a Matrix Formulation for Probabilistic Language Models</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Probabilistic language models are widely used in Information Retrieval (IR)
to rank documents by the probability that they generate the query. However, the
implementation of the probabilistic representations with programming languages
that favor matrix calculations is challenging. In this paper, we utilize matrix
representations to reformulate the probabilistic language models. The matrix
representation is a superstructure for the probabilistic language models to
organize the calculated probabilities and a potential formalism for
standardization of language models and for further mathematical analysis. It
facilitates implementations by matrix friendly programming languages. In this
paper, we consider the matrix formulation of conventional language model with
Dirichlet smoothing, and two language models based on Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), i.e., LBDM and LDI. We release a Java software
package--MatLM--implementing the proposed models. Code is available at:
https://github.com/yanshanwang/JGibbLDA-v.1.0-MatLM.

 <dc:description>  Pedestrian detection is one of the most popular topics in computer vision and
robotics. Considering challenging issues in multiple pedestrian detection, we
present a real-time depth-based template matching people detector. In this
paper, we propose different approaches for training the depth-based template.
We train multiple templates for handling issues due to various upper-body
orientations of the pedestrians and different levels of detail in depth-map of
the pedestrians with various distances from the camera. And, we take into
account the degree of reliability for different regions of sliding window by
proposing the weighted template approach. Furthermore, we combine the
depth-detector with an appearance based detector as a verifier to take
advantage of the appearance cues for dealing with the limitations of depth
data. We evaluate our method on the challenging ETH dataset sequence. We show
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:title>Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model to Evaluate &quot;Lane-Like

 <dc:description>  One of the objectives of the pedestrian analysis is to evaluate the effects
of proposed policy on the pedestrian facilities before its implementation. The
implementation of a policy without pedestrian analysis might lead to a very
costly trial and error due to the implementation cost (i.e. user cost,
construction time and cost, etc.). On the other hand, using good analysis
tools, the trial and error of policy could be done in the analysis level. Once
the analysis could prove a good performance, the implementation of the policy
is straightforward. The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy
quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation.
Since the interaction of pedestrians cannot be well address using a macroscopic
level of analysis, a microscopic level of analysis is the choice. However, the
analytical solution of the microscopic pedestrian model is very difficult and
simulation models are more practical approach. To evaluate the impact of the
policy quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its
implementation, a microscopic pedestrian simulation model was developed. The
model was based on physical forces, which work upon each pedestrian
dynamically. To demonstrate the numerical analysis of the model, an
experimental policy on pedestrian crossing was performed. The simulation
results showed that the keep right policy or the lane-like segregation policy
is inclined to be superior to do minimum or mix-lane policy in terms of average
speed, average delay and dissipation time.

 <dc:title>An overview about Networks-on-Chip with multicast suppor</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Berejuck, Marcelo Daniel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modern System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms typically consist of multiple
processors and a communication interconnect between them. Network-on-Chip (NoC)
arises as a solution to interconnect these systems, which provides a scalable,
reusable, and an efficient interconnect. For these SoC platforms, multicast
communication is significantly used for parallel applications. Cache coherency
in distributed sharedmemory,clock synchronization, replication, or barrier
synchronization are examples of these requests. This paper presents an overview
of research on NoC with support for multicast communication and delineates the
major issues addressed so far by the scientific community in this investigation
area.

 <dc:description>  Persistent homology is a method from computational algebraic topology that
can be used to study the &quot;shape&quot; of data. We illustrate two filtrations --- the
weight rank clique filtration and the Vietoris--Rips (VR) filtration --- that
are commonly used in persistent homology, and we apply these filtrations to a
pair of data sets that are both related to the 2016 European Union &quot;Brexit&quot;
referendum in the United Kingdom. These examples consider a topical situation
and give useful illustrations of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods.

 <dc:description>  Looking at a person's hands one often can tell what the person is going to do
next, how his/her hands are moving and where they will be, because an actor's
intentions shape his/her movement kinematics during action execution.
Similarly, active systems with real-time constraints must not simply rely on
passive video-segment classification, but they have to continuously update
their estimates and predict future actions. In this paper, we study the
prediction of dexterous actions. We recorded from subjects performing different
manipulation actions on the same object, such as &quot;squeezing&quot;, &quot;flipping&quot;,
&quot;washing&quot;, &quot;wiping&quot; and &quot;scratching&quot; with a sponge. In psychophysical
experiments, we evaluated human observers' skills in predicting actions from
video sequences of different length, depicting the hand movement in the
preparation and execution of actions before and after contact with the object.
We then developed a recurrent neural network based method for action prediction
using as input patches around the hand. We also used the same formalism to
predict the forces on the finger tips using for training synchronized video and
force data streams. Evaluations on two new datasets showed that our system
closely matches human performance in the recognition task, and demonstrate the
ability of our algorithm to predict what and how a dexterous action is
performed.

 <dc:description>  We present encube $-$ a qualitative, quantitative and comparative
visualisation and analysis system, with application to high-resolution,
immersive three-dimensional environments and desktop displays. encube extends
previous comparative visualisation systems by considering: 1) the integration
of comparative visualisation and analysis into a unified system; 2) the
documentation of the discovery process; and 3) an approach that enables
scientists to continue the research process once back at their desktop. Our
solution enables tablets, smartphones or laptops to be used as interaction
units for manipulating, organising, and querying data. We highlight the
modularity of encube, allowing additional functionalities to be included as
required. Additionally, our approach supports a high level of collaboration
within the physical environment. We show how our implementation of encube
operates in a large-scale, hybrid visualisation and supercomputing environment
using the CAVE2 at Monash University, and on a local desktop, making it a
versatile solution. We discuss how our approach can help accelerate the
discovery rate in a variety of research scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Lexical sets contain the words filling the argument positions of a verb in
one of its senses. They can be grounded empirically through their automatic
extraction from corpora. The purpose of this paper is demonstrating that their
vector representation based on word embedding provides insights onto many
linguistic phenomena, and in particular about verbs undergoing the
causative-inchoative alternation. A first experiment aims at investigating the
internal structure of the sets, which are known to be radial and continuous
categories cognitively. A second experiment shows that the distance between the
subject set and object set is correlated with a semantic factor, namely the
spontaneity of the verb.

 <dc:description>  \texttt{cleverhans} is a software library that provides standardized
reference implementations of \emph{adversarial example} construction techniques
and \emph{adversarial training}. The library may be used to develop more robust
machine learning models and to provide standardized benchmarks of models'
performance in the adversarial setting. Benchmarks constructed without a
standardized implementation of adversarial example construction are not
comparable to each other, because a good result may indicate a robust model or
it may merely indicate a weak implementation of the adversarial example
construction procedure.
  This technical report is structured as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:introduction} provides an overview of adversarial examples in
machine learning and of the \texttt{cleverhans} software.
Section~\ref{sec:core} presents the core functionalities of the library: namely
the attacks based on adversarial examples and defenses to improve the
robustness of machine learning models to these attacks.
Section~\ref{sec:benchmark} describes how to report benchmark results using the
library. Section~\ref{sec:version} describes the versioning system.

 <dc:description>  Networks represent relationships between entities in many complex systems,
spanning from online social interactions to biological cell development and
brain connectivity. In many cases, relationships between entities are
unambiguously known: are two users 'friends' in a social network? Do two
researchers collaborate on a published paper? Do two road segments in a
transportation system intersect? These are directly observable in the system in
question. In most cases, relationship between nodes are not directly observable
and must be inferred: does one gene regulate the expression of another? Do two
animals who physically co-locate have a social bond? Who infected whom in a
disease outbreak in a population?
  Existing approaches for inferring networks from data are found across many
application domains and use specialized knowledge to infer and measure the
quality of inferred network for a specific task or hypothesis. However, current
research lacks a rigorous methodology which employs standard statistical
validation on inferred models. In this survey, we examine (1) how network
representations are constructed from underlying data, (2) the variety of
questions and tasks on these representations over several domains, and (3)
validation strategies for measuring the inferred network's capability of
answering questions on the system of interest.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a distributed resource allocation game to study
countries' pursuit of targets such as self-survival in the networked
international environment. The contributions are two. First, the game
formalizes countries' power allocation behaviors which fall into the broad
category of humans resource allocation behaviors. Second, the game presents a
new technical problem, and establishes pure strategy Nash equilibrium
existence.

 <dc:description>  We present novel techniques to accelerate the convergence of Deep Learning
algorithms by conducting low overhead removal of redundant neurons -- apoptosis
of neurons -- which do not contribute to model learning, during the training
phase itself. We provide in-depth theoretical underpinnings of our heuristics
(bounding accuracy loss and handling apoptosis of several neuron types), and
present the methods to conduct adaptive neuron apoptosis. Specifically, we are
able to improve the training time for several datasets by 2-3x, while reducing
the number of parameters by up to 30x (4-5x on average) on datasets such as
ImageNet classification. For the Higgs Boson dataset, our implementation
improves the accuracy (measured by Area Under Curve (AUC)) for classification
from 0.88/1 to 0.94/1, while reducing the number of parameters by 3x in
comparison to existing literature. The proposed methods achieve a 2.44x speedup
in comparison to the default (no apoptosis) algorithm.

 <dc:description>  A distributed control architecture is presented that is intended to make a
collection of heterogeneous loads appear to the grid operator as a nearly
perfect battery. Local control is based on randomized decision rules advocated
in prior research, and extended in this paper to any load with a discrete
number of power states. Additional linear filtering at the load ensures that
the input-output dynamics of the aggregate has a nearly flat input-output
response: the behavior of an ideal, multi-GW battery system.

 <dc:title>Real Time Fine-Grained Categorization with Accuracy and Interpretability</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Shaoli</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A well-designed fine-grained categorization system usually has three
contradictory requirements: accuracy (the ability to identify objects among
subordinate categories); interpretability (the ability to provide
human-understandable explanation of recognition system behavior); and
efficiency (the speed of the system). To handle the trade-off between accuracy
and interpretability, we propose a novel &quot;Deeper Part-Stacked CNN&quot; architecture
armed with interpretability by modeling subtle differences between object
parts. The proposed architecture consists of a part localization network, a
two-stream classification network that simultaneously encodes object-level and
part-level cues, and a feature vectors fusion component. Specifically, the part
localization network is implemented by exploring a new paradigm for key point
localization that first samples a small number of representable pixels and then
determine their labels via a convolutional layer followed by a softmax layer.
We also use a cropping layer to extract part features and propose a scale
mean-max layer for feature fusion learning. Experimentally, our proposed method
outperform state-of-the-art approaches both in part localization task and
classification task on Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011. Moreover, by adopting a set
of sharing strategies between the computation of multiple object parts, our
single model is fairly efficient running at 32 frames/sec.

 <dc:description>  Dataflow matrix machines are self-referential generalized recurrent neural
nets. The self-referential mechanism is provided via a stream of matrices
defining the connectivity and weights of the network in question. A natural
question is: what should play the role of untyped lambda-calculus for this
programming architecture? The proposed answer is a discipline of programming
with only one kind of streams, namely the streams of appropriately shaped
matrices. This yields Pure Dataflow Matrix Machines which are networks of
transformers of streams of matrices capable of defining a pure dataflow matrix
machine.

 <dc:description>  We propose in this work a fast numerical algorithm for solving the equation
of radiative transfer (ERT) in isotropic media. The algorithm has two steps. In
the first step, we derive an integral equation for the angularly averaged ERT
solution by taking advantage of the isotropy of the scattering kernel, and
solve the integral equation with a fast multipole method (FMM). In the second
step, we solve a scattering-free transport equation to recover the original ERT
solution. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of
the algorithm for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media.

 <dc:description>  This survey aims at reviewing recent computer vision techniques used in the
assessment of image aesthetic quality. Image aesthetic assessment aims at
computationally distinguishing high-quality photos from low-quality ones based
on photographic rules, typically in the form of binary classification or
quality scoring. A variety of approaches has been proposed in the literature
trying to solve this challenging problem. In this survey, we present a
systematic listing of the reviewed approaches based on visual feature types
(hand-crafted features and deep features) and evaluation criteria (dataset
characteristics and evaluation metrics). Main contributions and novelties of
the reviewed approaches are highlighted and discussed. In addition, following
the emergence of deep learning techniques, we systematically evaluate recent
deep learning settings that are useful for developing a robust deep model for
aesthetic scoring. Experiments are conducted using simple yet solid baselines
that are competitive with the current state-of-the-arts. Moreover, we discuss
the possibility of manipulating the aesthetics of images through computational
approaches. We hope that our survey could serve as a comprehensive reference
source for future research on the study of image aesthetic assessment.

 <dc:description>  Revolution in the area of information technology has brought about changes in
many spheres of life. Today, information systems are being used in very
sensitive areas such as defence and missile control systems, nuclear plants,
etc. Not only has it changed how business is conducted, it has also brought
about entirely new paradigms like that of information and cyber warfare.
Similarly, one of the many impacts that it has made, is how wars are fought.
For all what it has contributed, the information stored on digital devices and
computers has become a precious resource and special measures are taken to
guard it against attacks from malicious users. These special measures are
needed by any enterprise be it a business firm, a commercial entity, a
government agency or a military organization. However, requirements and
specifications for information security and assurance for a military
organization are essentially different from those of commercial or business
applications. This paper highlights and discusses various aspects related to
the security of information resources of military importance and outlines
certain parameters that should be taken into consideration when talking about
the security of military information resources. W also describe the role
satellite reconnaissance can play in cyber war. Authors proclaim that this
paper is first such attempt to correlate cyber war with satellite
reconnaissance.

 <dc:title>Chinese Event Extraction Using DeepNeural Network with Word Embedding</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Xia, Yandi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Yang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A lot of prior work on event extraction has exploited a variety of features
to represent events. Such methods have several drawbacks: 1) the features are
often specific for a particular domain and do not generalize well; 2) the
features are derived from various linguistic analyses and are error-prone; and
3) some features may be expensive and require domain expert. In this paper, we
develop a Chinese event extraction system that uses word embedding vectors to
represent language, and deep neural networks to learn the abstract feature
representation in order to greatly reduce the effort of feature engineering. In
addition, in this framework, we leverage large amount of unlabeled data, which
can address the problem of limited labeled corpus for this task. Our
experiments show that our proposed method performs better compared to the
system using rich language features, and using unlabeled data benefits the word
embeddings. This study suggests the potential of DNN and word embedding for the
event extraction task.

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of learning the parameters of a {\em single} component
of a mixture model, for the case when we are given {\em side information} about
that component; we call this the &quot;search problem&quot; in mixture models. We would
like to solve this with computational and sample complexity lower than solving
the overall original problem, where one learns parameters of all components.
  Our main contributions are the development of a simple but general model for
the notion of side information, and a corresponding simple matrix-based
algorithm for solving the search problem in this general setting. We then
specialize this model and algorithm to four common scenarios: Gaussian mixture
models, LDA topic models, subspace clustering, and mixed linear regression. For
each one of these we show that if (and only if) the side information is
informative, we obtain better sample complexity than existing standard mixture
model algorithms (e.g. tensor methods). We also illustrate several natural ways
one can obtain such side information, for specific problem instances. Our
experiments on real datasets (NY Times, Yelp, BSDS500) further demonstrate the
practicality of our algorithms showing significant improvement in runtime and
accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Previous work in network analysis has focused on modeling the
mixed-memberships of node roles in the graph, but not the roles of edges. We
introduce the edge role discovery problem and present a generalizable framework
for learning and extracting edge roles from arbitrary graphs automatically.
Furthermore, while existing node-centric role models have mainly focused on
simple degree and egonet features, this work also explores graphlet features
for role discovery. In addition, we also develop an approach for automatically
learning and extracting important and useful edge features from an arbitrary
graph. The experimental results demonstrate the utility of edge roles for
network analysis tasks on a variety of graphs from various problem domains.

 <dc:description>  The performances of the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems
are significantly affected by edge cache and transport network. These emerging
components bring substantial costs of the placement and utilization, and the
evaluation of the cost impact is beyond the capability of traditional
performance metrics, including spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency
(EE). In this article, economical energy efficiency (E3) is proposed, whose
core idea is to take SE/EE and cost into account to evaluate comprehensive
gains when different kinds of advanced technologies are used in 5G systems. The
E3results are shown when the transport network and edge cache are separately or
jointly used. Open issues in terms of modeling the cost, E3optimization based
radio resource allocation, and E3optimization for internet of things, are
identified as well.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by recent advances in Deep Learning for robot control, this paper
considers two learning algorithms in terms of how they acquire demonstrations.
&quot;Human-Centric&quot; (HC) sampling is the standard supervised learning algorithm,
where a human supervisor demonstrates the task by teleoperating the robot to
provide trajectories consisting of state-control pairs. &quot;Robot-Centric&quot; (RC)
sampling is an increasingly popular alternative used in algorithms such as
DAgger, where a human supervisor observes the robot executing a learned policy
and provides corrective control labels for each state visited. RC sampling can
be challenging for human supervisors and prone to mislabeling. RC sampling can
also induce error in policy performance because it repeatedly visits areas of
the state space that are harder to learn. Although policies learned with RC
sampling can be superior to HC sampling for standard learning models such as
linear SVMs, policies learned with HC sampling may be comparable with
highly-expressive learning models such as deep learning and hyper-parametric
decision trees, which have little model error. We compare HC and RC using a
grid world and a physical robot singulation task, where in the latter the input
is a binary image of a connected set of objects on a planar worksurface and the
policy generates a motion of the gripper to separate one object from the rest.
We observe in simulation that for linear SVMs, policies learned with RC
outperformed those learned with HC but that with deep models this advantage
disappears. We also find that with RC, the corrective control labels provided
by humans can be highly inconsistent. We prove there exists a class of examples
where in the limit, HC is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy while RC
may fail to converge.

 <dc:description>  The evolution of the internet has created an abundance of unstructured data
on the web, a significant part of which is textual. The task of author
profiling seeks to find the demographics of people solely from their linguistic
and content-based features in text. The ability to describe traits of authors
clearly has applications in fields such as security and forensics, as well as
marketing. Instead of seeing age as just a classification problem, we also
frame age as a regression one, but use an ensemble chain method that
incorporates the power of both classification and regression to learn the
authors exact age.

cycle-free or every induced cycle is of length exactly $k, k \geq 3$. Strictly
chordality-3 and strictly chordality-4 graphs are well known chordal and
chordal bipartite graphs, respectively. For $k\geq 5$, the study has been
recently initiated in \cite{sadagopan} and various structural and algorithmic
results are reported. In this paper, we show that maximum independent set

odd cycle transversal (OCT), even cycle transversal (ECT) and Steiner tree

consider $2K_2$-free graphs and show that FVS, OCT, ECT, Steiner tree problem
are polynomial time solvable on subclasses of $2K_2$-free graphs.

 <dc:title>Hamiltonicity in Split Graphs- a dichotomy</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the well-studied Hamiltonian cycle problem, and
present an interesting dichotomy result on split graphs. T. Akiyama, T.
Nishizeki, and N. Saito \cite{akiyama} have shown that the Hamiltonian cycle
problem is NP-complete in planar bipartite graph with maximum degree $3$. Using
this reduction, we show that the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete in
split graphs. In particular, we show that the problem is NP-complete in
$K_{1,5}$-free split graphs. Further, we present polynomial-time algorithms for
Hamiltonian cycle in $K_{1,3}$-free and $K_{1,4}$-free split graphs. We believe
that the structural results presented in this paper can be used to show similar
dichotomy result for Hamiltonian path and other variants of Hamiltonian cycle
problem.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the first Network-Coded Multiple Access (NCMA) system
with multiple users adopting different signal modulations, referred to as
rate-diverse NCMA. A distinguishing feature of NCMA is the joint use of
physical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost
throughput of multipacket reception systems. In previous NCMA systems, users
adopt the same modulation regardless of their individual channel conditions.
This leads to suboptimal throughput for many practical scenarios, especially
when different users have widely varying channel conditions. A rate-diverse
NCMA system allows different users to use modulations that are commensurate
with their channel conditions. A key challenge is the design of the PNC mapping
and decoding mechanisms in NCMA when different users adopt different
modulations. While there have been past work on non-channel-coded rate-diverse
PNC, this paper is the first attempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC
to ensure the reliability of the overall NCMA system. Specifically, we put
forth a symbol-splitting channel coding and modulation design so that PNC/NCMA
can work over different modulations. We implemented our rate-diverse NCMA
system on software-defined radios. Experimental results show that the
throughput of rate-diverse NCMA can outperform the state-of-the-art
rate-homogeneous NCMA by 80%. Overall, the introduction of rate diversity
significantly boosts the NCMA system throughput in practical scenarios.

 <dc:title>Broadcast Function Computation with Complementary Side Information</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ravi, Jithin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the function computation problem in a three node network with one
encoder and two decoders. The encoder has access to two correlated sources $X$
and $Y$. The encoder encodes $X^n$ and $Y^n$ into a message which is given to
two decoders. Decoder 1 and decoder 2 have access to $X$ and $Y$ respectively,
and they want to compute two functions $f(X,Y)$ and $g(X,Y)$ respectively using
the encoded message and their respective side information. We want to find the
optimum (minimum) encoding rate under the zero error and $\epsilon$-error (i.e.
vanishing error) criteria. For the special case of this problem with $f(X,Y) =
Y$ and $g(X,Y) = X$, we show that the $\epsilon$-error optimum rate is also
achievable with zero error. This result extends to a more general
`complementary delivery index coding' problem with arbitrary number of messages
and decoders. For other functions, we show that the cut-set bound is achievable
under $\epsilon$-error if $X$ and $Y$ are binary, or if the functions are from
a special class of `compatible' functions which includes the case $f=g$.

 <dc:description>  The design of block codes for short information blocks (e.g., a thousand or

thanks to emerging applications in wireless communication networks. In this
work, we review some of the most recent code constructions targeting the short
block regime, and we compare then with both finite-length performance bounds
and classical error correction coding schemes. We will see how it is possible
to effectively approach the theoretical bounds, with different performance vs.
decoding complexity trade-offs.

of identifying whether a text was written when under the influence of alcohol.
We experiment with tweets labeled using hashtags as distant supervision. Our
classifiers use a set of N-gram and stylistic features to detect drunk tweets.
Our observations present the first quantitative evidence that text contains
signals that can be exploited to detect drunk-texting.

 <dc:description>  This paper makes a simple increment to state-of-the-art in sarcasm detection
research. Existing approaches are unable to capture subtle forms of context
incongruity which lies at the heart of sarcasm. We explore if prior work can be
enhanced using semantic similarity/discordance between word embeddings. We
augment word embedding-based features to four feature sets reported in the
past. We also experiment with four types of word embeddings. We observe an
improvement in sarcasm detection, irrespective of the word embedding used or
the original feature set to which our features are augmented. For example, this
augmentation results in an improvement in F-score of around 4\% for three out
of these four feature sets, and a minor degradation in case of the fourth, when
Word2Vec embeddings are used. Finally, a comparison of the four embeddings
shows that Word2Vec and dependency weight-based features outperform LSA and
GloVe, in terms of their benefit to sarcasm detection.

 <dc:description>  The growing popularity of mobile and wearable devices with built-in cameras,
the bright prospect of camera related applications such as augmented reality
and life-logging system, the increased ease of taking and sharing photos, and
advances in computer vision techniques have greatly facilitated people's lives
in many aspects, but have also inevitably raised people's concerns about visual
privacy at the same time. Motivated by recent user studies that people's
privacy concerns are dependent on the context, in this paper, we propose
Cardea, a context-aware and interactive visual privacy protection framework
that enforces privacy protection according to people's privacy preferences. The
framework provides people with fine-grained visual privacy protection using: i)
personal privacy profiles, with which people can define their context-dependent
privacy preferences; and ii) visual indicators: face features, for devices to
automatically locate individuals who request privacy protection; and iii) hand
gestures, for people to flexibly interact with cameras to temporarily change
their privacy preferences. We design and implement the framework consisting of
the client app on Android devices and the cloud server. Our evaluation results
confirm this framework is practical and effective with 86% overall accuracy,
showing promising future for context-aware visual privacy protection from
pervasive cameras.

 <dc:description>  Sparsity exploiting image reconstruction (SER) methods have been extensively
used with Total Variation (TV) regularization for tomographic reconstructions.
Local TV meth- ods fail to preserve texture details and often create additional
artifacts due to over-smoothing. Non-Local TV (NLTV) has been proposed as a
solution to this but lacks continuous update and is computationally complex. In
this paper we propose Adaptive Graph-based TV (AGT). Similar to NLTV our
proposed method goes beyond spatial similarity between different regions of an
image being reconstructed by establishing a connection between similar regions
in the image regardless of spatial distance. How- ever, it is computationally
more efficient and involves updating the graph prior during every iteration
making the connection between similar regions stronger. Since TV is a special
case of graph TV the proposed method can also be seen as a generalization of
SER and TV methods. It promotes sparsity in the wavelet and graph gradient
domains. Extensive experimentation shows that when compared to other methods we
achieve a better result with AGT in every case.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study self-dual codes over $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
(\mathbb{Z}_2+u\mathbb{Z}_2) $, where $u^2=0$. Three types of self-dual codes
are defined. For each type, the possible values $\alpha,\beta$ such that there
exists a code $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{2}^\alpha\times
(\mathbb{Z}_2+u\mathbb{Z}_2)^\beta$ are established. We also present several
approaches to construct self-dual codes over $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
(\mathbb{Z}_2+u\mathbb{Z}_2) $. Moreover, the structure of two-weight self-dual
codes is completely obtained for $\alpha \cdot\beta\neq 0$.

 <dc:description>  We study a type of reverse (procurement) auction problems in the presence of
budget constraints. The general algorithmic problem is to purchase a set of
resources, which come at a cost, so as not to exceed a given budget and at the
same time maximize a given valuation function. This framework captures the
budgeted version of several well known optimization problems, and when the
resources are owned by strategic agents the goal is to design truthful and
budget feasible mechanisms, i.e. elicit the true cost of the resources and
ensure the payments of the mechanism do not exceed the budget. Budget
feasibility introduces more challenges in mechanism design, and we study
instantiations of this problem for certain classes of submodular and XOS
valuation functions. We first obtain mechanisms with an improved approximation
ratio for weighted coverage valuations, a special class of submodular functions
that has already attracted attention in previous works. We then provide a
general scheme for designing randomized and deterministic polynomial time
mechanisms for a class of XOS problems. This class contains problems whose
feasible set forms an independence system (a more general structure than
matroids), and some representative problems include, among others, finding
maximum weighted matchings, maximum weighted matroid members, and maximum
weighted 3D-matchings. For most of these problems, only randomized mechanisms
with very high approximation ratios were known prior to our results.

 <dc:description>  We consider the optical fiber channel modelled by the nonlinear

Feynman path-integral approach for the model we find corrections to conditional
probability density function, output signal distribution, conditional and
output signal entropies, and the channel capacity at large signal-to-noise
ratio. We demonstrate that the correction to the channel capacity is positive
for large signal power. Therefore, this correction increases the earlier
calculated capacity for a nondispersive nonlinear optical fiber channel in the
intermediate power region.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the motion planning problem for a team of aerial agents
under high level goals. We propose a hybrid control strategy that guarantees
the accomplishment of each agent's local goal specification, which is given as
a temporal logic formula, while guaranteeing inter-agent collision avoidance.
In particular, by defining 3-D spheres that bound the agents' volume, we extend
previous work on decentralized navigation functions and propose control laws
that navigate the agents among predefined regions of interest of the workspace
while avoiding collision with each other. This allows us to abstract the motion
of the agents as finite transition systems and, by employing standard formal
verification techniques, to derive a high-level control algorithm that
satisfies the agents' specifications. Simulation and experimental results with
quadrotors verify the validity of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of cooperative manipulation of a single
object by N robotic agents under local goal specifications given as Metric
Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) formulas. In particular, we propose a
distributed model-free control protocol for the trajectory tracking of the
cooperatively manipulated object without necessitating feedback of the contact
forces/torques or inter-agent communication. This allows us to abstract the
motion of the coupled object-agents system as a finite transition system and,
by employing standard automata-based methodologies, we derive a hybrid control
algorithm for the satisfaction of a given MITL formula. In addition, we use
load sharing coefficients to represent potential differences in power
capabilities among the agents. Finally, simulation studies verify the validity
of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  Many fields are now snowed under with an avalanche of data, which raises

 <dc:description>  Due to increasing shares of renewable energy sources, more frequency reserves
are required to maintain power system stability. In this paper, we present a
decentralized control scheme that allows a large aggregation of refrigerators
to provide Primary Frequency Control (PFC) reserves to the grid based on local
frequency measurements and without communication.
  The control is based on stochastic switching of refrigerators depending on
the frequency deviation. We develop methods to account for typical lockout
constraints of compressors and increased power consumption during the startup
phase. In addition, we propose a procedure to dynamically reset the thermostat
temperature limits in order to provide reliable PFC reserves, as well as a
corrective temperature feedback loop to build robustness to biased frequency
deviations. Furthermore, we introduce an additional randomization layer in the
controller to account for thermostat resolution limitations, and finally, we
modify the control design to account for refrigerator door openings.
  Extensive simulations with actual frequency signal data and with different
aggregation sizes, load characteristics, and control parameters, demonstrate
that the proposed controller outperforms a relevant state-of-the-art
controller.

 <dc:description>  There is a practically unlimited amount of natural language data available.
Still, recent work in text comprehension has focused on datasets which are
small relative to current computing possibilities. This article is making a
case for the community to move to larger data and as a step in that direction
it is proposing the BookTest, a new dataset similar to the popular Children's
Book Test (CBT), however more than 60 times larger. We show that training on
the new data improves the accuracy of our Attention-Sum Reader model on the
original CBT test data by a much larger margin than many recent attempts to
improve the model architecture. On one version of the dataset our ensemble even
exceeds the human baseline provided by Facebook. We then show in our own human
study that there is still space for further improvement.

 <dc:description>  We consider the rates achievable by a user in a multibeam satellite system
for unicast applications, and propose alternatives to the conventional
single-user symbol-by-symbol detection applied at user terminals. Single-user
detection is known to suffer from strong degradation when the terminal is
located near the edge of the coverage area of a beam, and when aggressive
frequency reuse is adopted. For this reason, we consider multiuser detection,
and take into account the strongest interfering signal. We also analyze two
additional transmission strategies requiring modifications at medium access
control layer. We describe an information-theoretic framework to compare the
different strategies by computing the information rate of the user in the
reference beam. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of coded schemes that
could approach the information-theoretic limits. We show that classical codes
from the DVB-S2(X) standard are not suitable when multiuser detection is
adopted, and we propose two ways to improve the performance, based on the
redesign of the code and of the bit mapping.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic optimization algorithms with variance reduction have proven
successful for minimizing large finite sums of functions. Unfortunately, these
techniques are unable to deal with stochastic perturbations of input data,
induced for example by data augmentation. In such cases, the objective is no
longer a finite sum, and the main candidate for optimization is the stochastic
gradient descent method (SGD). In this paper, we introduce a variance reduction
approach for these settings when the objective is composite and strongly
convex. The convergence rate outperforms SGD with a typically much smaller
constant factor, which depends on the variance of gradient estimates only due
to perturbations on a single example.

 <dc:description>  The cooperative medium access control (CoopMAC) protocol in the presence of
randomly-distributed nodes and shadowing is considered. The nodes are assumed
to be distributed according to a homogeneous two-dimensional Poisson point
process. A new approach is proposed for helper selection and throughput
performance analysis which depends on the shadowing parameters as well as the
distribution of helpers. In the proposed protocol, the potential helpers are
divided into several tiers based on their distances from the source and
destination in a way that the lower the tier index, the higher its priority.
When there are several helpers of the same tier, the helper that is less
affected by shadowing is chosen for cooperation. Upper and lower bounds are
derived for the average cooperative throughput of the proposed CoopMAC
protocol. It is observed that the proposed scheme readily outperforms the
conventional CoopMAC protocol in having larger average throughput. It is also
seen that the cooperative throughput of the proposed scheme approaches the
upper bound when the density of nodes increases.

 <dc:description>  Over the years, several meta-heuristic algorithms were proposed and are now
emerging as common methods for constrained optimization problems. Among them,
genetic algorithms (GA's) shine as popular evolutionary algorithms (EA's) in
engineering optimization. Most engineering design problems are difficult to
resolve with conventional optimization algorithms because they are highly
nonlinear and contain constraints. In order to handle these constraints, the
most common technique is to apply penalty functions. The major drawback is that
they require tuning of parameters, which can be very challenging. In this
paper, we present a constraint-handling technique for GA's solely using the
violation factor, called VCH (Violation Constraint-Handling) method. Several
benchmark problems from the literature are examined. The VCH technique was able
to provide a consistent performance and match results from other GA-based
techniques.

 <dc:description>  We investigate transmission energy minimization via optimizing wireless relay
selection in orthogonal-frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) networks. We
take into account the impact of the load of cells on transmission energy. We
prove the NP-hardness of the energy-aware wireless relay selection problem. To
tackle the computational complexity, a partial optimality condition is derived
for providing insights in respect of designing an effective and efficient
algorithm. Numerical results show that the resulting algorithm achieves high
energy performance.

 <dc:description>  This paper lays out the current landscape of tools used in statistics
education. In particular, it considers graphing calculators, spreadsheets,
applets and microworlds, standalone educational software, statistical
programming tools, tools for reproducible research and bespoke tools. The
strengths and weaknesses of the tools are considered, particularly in the
context of McNamara (2016)'s list of attributes for a statistical computing
tool. Best practices for computing in introductory statistics are suggested.

 <dc:title>Key attributes of a modern statistical computing tool</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>McNamara, Amelia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the 1990s, statisticians began thinking in a principled way about how
computation could support statistics and statistics education. Since then, the
pace of software development has accelerated, advancements in computing and
data science have moved the goalposts, and it is time to reassess. Software
continues to be developed to help do and learn statistics, but there is little
critical evaluation of the resulting tools, and no accepted framework with
which to critique them. In this paper, we present a set of attributes necessary
for a modern statistical computing tool. This framework is designed to be
broadly applicable to both novice and expert users, but the particular focus is
on making a more supportive statistical computing environment.
  A modern statistical computing tool should be accessible, provide easy entry,
privilege data as a first-order object, support exploratory and confirmatory
analysis, allow for flexible plot creation, support randomization, be
interactive, include inherent documentation, support narrative, publishing, and
reproducibility, and be flexible to extensions. Ideally, all these attributes
could be incorporated into one tool, supporting users at all levels, but a more
reasonable goal is for tools designed for novices and professionals to `reach
across the gap,' taking inspiration from each others' strengths.

 <dc:description>  Transactional memory is a mechanism that manages thread synchronisation on
behalf of a programmer so that blocks of code execute with an illusion of
atomicity. The main safety criterion for transactional memory is opacity, which
defines conditions for serialising concurrent transactions.
  Proving opacity is complicated because it allows concurrent transactions to
observe distinct memory states, while TM implementations are typically based on
one single shared store. This paper presents a sound and complete method, based
on coarse-grained abstraction, for reducing proofs of opacity to the relatively
simpler correctness condition: linearizability. We use our methods to verify
TML and NORec from the literature and show our techniques extend to relaxed
memory models by showing that both are opaque under TSO without requiring
additional fences. Our methods also elucidate TM designs at higher level of
abstraction; as an application, we develop a variation of NORec with fast-path
reads transactions. All our proofs have been mechanised, either in the Isabelle
theorem prover or the PAT model checker.

 <dc:title>Towards a Characterization of Constant-Factor Approximable Finite-Valued
  CSPs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the approximability of (Finite-)Valued Constraint
Satisfaction Problems (VCSPs) with a fixed finite constraint language {\Gamma}
consisting of finitary functions on a fixed finite domain. An instance of VCSP
is given by a finite set of variables and a sum of functions belonging to
{\Gamma} and depending on a subset of the variables. Each function takes values
in [0, 1] specifying costs of assignments of labels to its variables, and the
goal is to find an assignment of labels to the variables that minimizes the
sum. A recent result of Ene et al. says that, under the mild technical
condition that {\Gamma} contains the equality relation, the basic LP relaxation
is optimal for constant-factor approximation for VCSP({\Gamma}) unless the
Unique Games Conjecture fails. Using the algebraic approach to the CSP, we give
new natural algebraic conditions for the finiteness of the integrality gap for
the basic LP relaxation of VCSP({\Gamma}). We also show how these algebraic
conditions can in principle be used to round solutions of the basic LP
relaxation, and how, for several examples that cover all previously known
cases, this leads to efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms.
Finally, we show that the absence of another algebraic condition leads to
NP-hardness of constant-factor approximation.

 <dc:description>  During natural or man-made disasters, humanitarian response organizations
look for useful information to support their decision-making processes. Social
media platforms such as Twitter have been considered as a vital source of
useful information for disaster response and management. Despite advances in
natural language processing techniques, processing short and informal Twitter
messages is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose to use Deep Neural
Network (DNN) to address two types of information needs of response
organizations: 1) identifying informative tweets and 2) classifying them into
topical classes. DNNs use distributed representation of words and learn the
representation as well as higher level features automatically for the
classification task. We propose a new online algorithm based on stochastic
gradient descent to train DNNs in an online fashion during disaster situations.
We test our models using a crisis-related real-world Twitter dataset.

 <dc:description>  We develop here a computationally effective approach for producing
high-quality $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-approximations to large scale linear
dynamical systems having multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO). We extend
an approach for $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ model reduction introduced by Flagg,
Beattie, and Gugercin for the single-input/single-output (SISO) setting, which
combined ideas originating in interpolatory $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model
reduction with complex Chebyshev approximation. Retaining this framework, our
approach to the MIMO problem has its principal computational cost dominated by
(sparse) linear solves, and so it can remain an effective strategy in many
large-scale settings. We are able to avoid computationally demanding
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm calculations that are normally required to monitor
progress within each optimization cycle through the use of &quot;data-driven&quot;
rational approximations that are built upon previously computed function
samples. Numerical examples are included that illustrate our approach. We
produce high fidelity reduced models having consistently better
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ performance than models produced via balanced truncation;
these models often are as good as (and occasionally better than) models
produced using optimal Hankel norm approximation as well. In all cases
considered, the method described here produces reduced models at far lower cost
than is possible with either balanced truncation or optimal Hankel norm
approximation.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the problem of fusing two random vectors with unknown
cross-correlations. We present a formulation and a numerical method for
computing the optimal estimate in the minimax sense. We extend our formulation
to linear measurement models that depend on two random vectors with unknown
cross-correlations. As an application we consider the problem of decentralized
state estimation for a group of agents. The proposed estimator takes
cross-correlations into account while being less conservative than the widely
used Covariance Intersection. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method compared to Covariance Intersection with numerical examples and
simulations within the specific application of decentralized state estimation
using relative position measurements.

 <dc:description>  We propose RSFT, which is an extension of the one dimensional Sparse Fourier
Transform algorithm to higher dimensions in a way that it can be applied to
real, noisy data. The RSFT allows for off-grid frequencies. Furthermore, by
incorporating Neyman-Pearson detection, the frequency detection stages in RSFT
do not require knowledge of the exact sparsity of the signal and are more
robust to noise. We analyze the asymptotic performance of RSFT, and study the
computational complexity versus the worst case signal SNR tradeoff. We show
that by choosing the proper parameters, the optimal tradeoff can be achieved.
We discuss the application of RSFT on short range ubiquitous radar signal
processing, and demonstrate its feasibility via simulations.

 <dc:description>  Protein tertiary structure defines its functions, classification and binding
sites. Similar structural characteristics between two proteins often lead to
the similar characteristics thereof. Determining structural similarity
accurately in real time is a crucial research issue. In this paper, we present
a novel and effective scoring scheme that is dependent on novel features
extracted from protein alpha carbon distance matrices. Our scoring scheme is
inspired from pattern recognition and computer vision. Our method is
significantly better than the current state of the art methods in terms of
family match of pairs of protein structures and other statistical measurements.
The effectiveness of our method is tested on standard benchmark structures. A
web service is available at http://research.buet.ac.bd:8080/Comograd/score.html
where you can get the similarity measurement score between two protein
structures based on our method.

 <dc:description>  Due to geometrical errors and possible misalignment of the sensors, wheel
speed measurements provided by incremental encoders in road vehicles are
usually affected by significant periodic noises. This paper presents an online
wheel speed filtering procedure, based on a model of the sensor, aimed at
processing the speed measurement to make it suitable for advanced vehicle
dynamics applications. In particular, differently from low-pass and notch
filtering, this strategy is reliable for the cycling cadence estimation from
the wheel speed on bicycles. Experimental data are used to show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Cheating is a real problem in the Internet of Things. The fundamental
question that needs to be answered is how we can trust the validity of the data
being generated in the first place. The problem, however, isn't inherent in
whether or not to embrace the idea of an open platform and open-source
software, but to establish a methodology to verify the trustworthiness and
control any access. This paper focuses on building an access control model and
system based on trust computing. This is a new field of access control
techniques which includes Access Control, Trust Computing, Internet of Things,
network attacks, and cheating technologies. Nevertheless, the target access
control systems can be very complex to manage. This paper presents an overview
of the existing work on trust computing, access control models and systems in
IoT. It not only summarizes the latest research progress, but also provides an
understanding of the limitations and open issues of the existing work. It is
expected to provide useful guidelines for future research.

 <dc:title>Sparsity-based Color Image Super Resolution via Exploiting Cross Channel
  Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sparsity constrained single image super-resolution (SR) has been of much
recent interest. A typical approach involves sparsely representing patches in a
low-resolution (LR) input image via a dictionary of example LR patches, and
then using the coefficients of this representation to generate the
high-resolution (HR) output via an analogous HR dictionary. However, most
existing sparse representation methods for super resolution focus on the
luminance channel information and do not capture interactions between color
channels. In this work, we extend sparsity based super-resolution to multiple
color channels by taking color information into account. Edge similarities
amongst RGB color bands are exploited as cross channel correlation constraints.
These additional constraints lead to a new optimization problem which is not
easily solvable; however, a tractable solution is proposed to solve it
efficiently. Moreover, to fully exploit the complementary information among
color channels, a dictionary learning method is also proposed specifically to
learn color dictionaries that encourage edge similarities. Merits of the
proposed method over state of the art are demonstrated both visually and
quantitatively using image quality metrics.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach to visual objects classification based
on generating simple fuzzy classifiers using local image features to
distinguish between one known class and other classes. Boosting meta learning
is used to find the most representative local features. The proposed approach
is tested on a state-of-the-art image dataset and compared with the
bag-of-features image representation model combined with the Support Vector
Machine classification. The novel method gives better classification accuracy
and the time of learning and testing process is more than 30% shorter.

 <dc:description>  Together with the development of more accurate methods in Computer Vision and
Natural Language Understanding, holistic architectures that answer on questions
about the content of real-world images have emerged. In this tutorial, we build
a neural-based approach to answer questions about images. We base our tutorial
on two datasets: (mostly on) DAQUAR, and (a bit on) VQA. With small tweaks the
models that we present here can achieve a competitive performance on both
datasets, in fact, they are among the best methods that use a combination of
LSTM with a global, full frame CNN representation of an image. We hope that
after reading this tutorial, the reader will be able to use Deep Learning
frameworks, such as Keras and introduced Kraino, to build various architectures
that will lead to a further performance improvement on this challenging task.

 <dc:description>  Detection rules have traditionally been designed for rational agents that
minimize the Bayes risk (average decision cost). With the advent of
crowd-sensing systems, there is a need to redesign binary hypothesis testing
rules for behavioral agents, whose cognitive behavior is not captured by
traditional utility functions such as Bayes risk. In this paper, we adopt
prospect theory based models for decision makers. We consider special agent
models namely optimists and pessimists in this paper, and derive optimal
detection rules under different scenarios. Using an illustrative example, we
also show how the decision rule of a human agent deviates from the Bayesian
decision rule under various behavioral models, considered in this paper.

 <dc:title>FLOCK: Combating Astroturfing on Livestreaming Platforms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shah, Neil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Livestreaming platforms have become increasingly popular in recent years as a
means of sharing and advertising creative content. Popular content streamers
who attract large viewership to their live broadcasts can earn a living by
means of ad revenue, donations and channel subscriptions. Unfortunately, this
incentivized popularity has simultaneously resulted in incentive for fraudsters
to provide services to astroturf, or artificially inflate viewership metrics by
providing fake &quot;live&quot; views to customers. Our work provides a number of major
contributions: (a) formulation: we are the first to introduce and characterize
the viewbot fraud problem in livestreaming platforms, (b) methodology: we
propose FLOCK, a principled and unsupervised method which efficiently and
effectively identifies botted broadcasts and their constituent botted views,
and (c) practicality: our approach achieves over 98% precision in identifying
botted broadcasts and over 90% precision/recall against sizable synthetically
generated viewbot attacks on a real-world livestreaming workload of over 16
million views and 92 thousand broadcasts. FLOCK successfully operates on larger
datasets in practice and is regularly used at a large, undisclosed
livestreaming corporation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we show how to transform any optimization problem that arises
from fitting a machine learning model into one that (1) detects and removes
contaminated data from the training set while (2) simultaneously fitting the
trimmed model on the uncontaminated data that remains. To solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we introduce a fast stochastic
proximal-gradient algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge through nonsmooth
regularization. For datasets of size $n$, our approach requires
$O(n^{2/3}/\varepsilon)$ gradient evaluations to reach $\varepsilon$-accuracy
and, when a certain error bound holds, the complexity improves to $O(\kappa
n^{2/3}\log(1/\varepsilon))$. These rates are $n^{1/3}$ times better than those
achieved by typical, full gradient methods.

 <dc:description>  The impact of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for providing situational
awareness to transmission system operators has been widely documented.
Micro-PMUs ($\mu$PMUs) are an emerging sensing technology that can provide
similar benefits to Distribution System Operators (DSOs), enabling a level of
visibility into the distribution grid that was previously unattainable. In
order to support the deployment of these high resolution sensors, the
automation of data analysis and prioritizing communication to the DSO becomes
crucial. In this paper, we explore the use of $\mu$PMUs to detect anomalies on
the distribution grid. Our methodology is motivated by growing concern about
failures and attacks to distribution automation equipment. The effectiveness of
our approach is demonstrated through both real and simulated data.

 <dc:description>  An ordered graph $G$ is a graph whose vertex set is a subset of integers. The
edges are interpreted as tuples $(u,v)$ with $u &lt; v$. For a positive integer
$s$, a matrix $M \in \mathbb{Z}^{s \times 4}$, and a vector $\mathbf{p} =
(p,\ldots,p) \in \mathbb{Z}^s$ we build a conflict graph by saying that edges
$(u,v)$ and $(x,y)$ are conflicting if $M(u,v,x,y)^\top \geq \mathbf{p}$ or
$M(x,y,u,v)^\top \geq \mathbf{p}$, where the comparison is componentwise. This
new framework generalizes many natural concepts of ordered and unordered
graphs, such as the page-number, queue-number, band-width, interval chromatic
number and forbidden ordered matchings.
  For fixed $M$ and $p$, we investigate how the chromatic number of $G$ depends
on the structure of its conflict graph. Specifically, we study the maximum
chromatic number $X_\text{cli}(M,p,w)$ of ordered graphs $G$ with no $w$
pairwise conflicting edges and the maximum chromatic number
$X_\text{ind}(M,p,a)$ of ordered graphs $G$ with no $a$ pairwise
non-conflicting edges. We determine $X_\text{cli}(M,p,w)$ and
$X_\text{ind}(M,p,a)$ exactly whenever $M$ consists of one row with entries in
$\{-1,0,+1\}$ and moreover consider several cases in which $M$ consists of two
rows or has arbitrary entries from $\mathbb{Z}$.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous learning of robotic skills can allow general-purpose robots to
learn wide behavioral repertoires without requiring extensive manual
engineering. However, robotic skill learning methods typically make one of
several trade-offs to enable practical real-world learning, such as requiring
manually designed policy or value function representations, initialization from
human-provided demonstrations, instrumentation of the training environment, or
extremely long training times. In this paper, we propose a new reinforcement
learning algorithm for learning manipulation skills that can train
general-purpose neural network policies with minimal human engineering, while
still allowing for fast, efficient learning in stochastic environments. Our
approach builds on the guided policy search (GPS) algorithm, which transforms
the reinforcement learning problem into supervised learning from a
computational teacher (without human demonstrations). In contrast to prior GPS
methods, which require a consistent set of initial states to which the system
must be reset after each episode, our approach can handle randomized initial
states, allowing it to be used in environments where deterministic resets are
impossible. We compare our method to existing policy search techniques in
simulation, showing that it can train high-dimensional neural network policies
with the same sample efficiency as prior GPS methods, and present real-world
results on a PR2 robotic manipulator.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a compact twisted string actuation system that
achieves a high contraction percentage (81%) on two phases: multi string twist
and overtwist. This type of system can be used in many robotic applications,
such as robotic hands and exoskeletons. The overtwist phase enables the
development of more compact actuators based on the twisted string systems.
Furthermore, by analyzing the previously developed mathematical models, we
found out that a constant radius model should be applied for the overtwisting
phase. Moreover, we propose an improvement of an existing model for prediction
of the radius of the multi string system after they twist around each other.
This model helps to better estimate the bundle diameter which results in a more
precise mathematical model for multi string systems. The model was validated by
performing experiments with 2, 4, 6 and 8 string systems. Finally, we performed
extensive life cycle tests with different loads and contractions to find out
the expected life of the system.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made remarkable progress on scene
recognition, partially due to these recent large-scale scene datasets, such as
the Places and Places2. Scene categories are often defined by multi-level
information, including local objects, global layout, and background
environment, thus leading to large intra-class variations. In addition, with
the increasing number of scene categories, label ambiguity has become another
crucial issue in large-scale classification. This paper focuses on large-scale
scene recognition and makes two major contributions to tackle these issues.
First, we propose a multi-resolution CNN architecture that captures visual
content and structure at multiple levels. The multi-resolution CNNs are
composed of coarse resolution CNNs and fine resolution CNNs, which are
complementary to each other. Second, we design two knowledge guided
disambiguation techniques to deal with the problem of label ambiguity. (i) We
exploit the knowledge from the confusion matrix computed on validation data to
merge ambiguous classes into a super category. (ii) We utilize the knowledge of
extra networks to produce a soft label for each image. Then the super
categories or soft labels are employed to guide CNN training on the Places2. We
conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale image datasets (ImageNet,
Places, and Places2), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
Furthermore, our method takes part in two major scene recognition challenges,
and achieves the second place at the Places2 challenge in ILSVRC 2015, and the
first place at the LSUN challenge in CVPR 2016. Finally, we directly test the
learned representations on other scene benchmarks, and obtain the new
state-of-the-art results on the MIT Indoor67 (86.7\%) and SUN397 (72.0\%). We

 <dc:description>  We give a novel formal theoretical framework for unsupervised learning with
two distinctive characteristics. First, it does not assume any generative model
and based on a worst-case performance metric. Second, it is comparative, namely
performance is measured with respect to a given hypothesis class. This allows
to avoid known computational hardness results and improper algorithms based on
convex relaxations. We show how several families of unsupervised learning
models, which were previously only analyzed under probabilistic assumptions and
are otherwise provably intractable, can be efficiently learned in our framework
by convex optimization.

 <dc:title>Mathematical Execution: A Unified Approach for Testing Numerical Code</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents Mathematical Execution (ME), a new, unified approach for
testing numerical code. The key idea is to (1) capture the desired testing
objective via a representing function and (2) transform the automated testing
problem to the minimization problem of the representing function. The
minimization problem is to be solved via mathematical optimization. The main
feature of ME is that it directs input space exploration by only executing the
representing function, thus avoiding static or symbolic reasoning about the
program semantics, which is particularly challenging for numerical code. To
illustrate this feature, we develop an ME-based algorithm for coverage-based
testing of numerical code. We also show the potential of applying and adapting
ME to other related problems, including path reachability testing, boundary
value analysis, and satisfiability checking.
  To demonstrate ME's practical benefits, we have implemented CoverMe, a
proof-of-concept realization for branch coverage based testing, and evaluated
it on Sun's C math library (used in, for example, Android, Matlab, Java and
JavaScript). We have compared CoverMe with random testing and Austin, a
publicly available branch coverage based testing tool that supports numerical
code (Austin combines symbolic execution and search-based heuristics). Our
experimental results show that CoverMe achieves near-optimal and substantially
higher coverage ratios than random testing on all tested programs, across all
evaluated coverage metrics. Compared with Austin, CoverMe improves branch
coverage from 43% to 91%, with significantly less time (6.9 vs. 6058.4 seconds
on average).

 <dc:title>Reasoning about identifier spaces: How to make Chord correct</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zave, Pamela</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Chord distributed hash table (DHT) is well-known and often used to
implement peer-to-peer systems. Chord peers find other peers, and access their
data, through a ring-shaped pointer structure in a large identifier space.
Despite claims of proven correctness, i.e., eventual reachability, previous
work has shown that the Chord ring-maintenance protocol is not correct under
its original operating assumptions. Previous work has not, however, discovered
whether Chord could be made correct under the same assumptions. The
contribution of this paper is to provide the first specification of correct
operations and initialization for Chord, an inductive invariant that is
necessary and sufficient to support a proof of correctness, and two independent
proofs of correctness. One proof is informal and intuitive, and applies to
networks of any size. The other proof is based on a formal model in Alloy, and
uses fully automated analysis to prove the assertions for networks of bounded
size. The two proofs complement each other in several important ways.

 <dc:description>  We study expressive power of shallow and deep neural networks with piece-wise

for the network complexity in the setting of approximations in Sobolev spaces.
In particular, we prove that deep ReLU networks more efficiently approximate

Lipschitz functions we describe adaptive depth-6 network architectures more
efficient than the standard shallow architecture.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of preventive maintenance (PM) scheduling
of pipelines subject to external corrosion defects. The preventive maintenance
strategy involves an inspection step at some epoch, together with a repair
schedule. This paper proposes to determine the repair schedule as well as an
inspection time minimizing the maintenance cost. This problem is formulated as
a binary integer non-linear programming model and we approach it under a
decision support framework. We derive a polynomial-time algorithm that computes
the optimum PM schedule and suggests different PM strategies in order to assist
practitioners in making decision.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modulo inverse is an important arithmetic operation. Many famous algorithms
in public key cryptography require to compute modulo inverse. It is argued that
the method of DaYan deriving one of Jiushao Qin provides the most concise and
transparent way of computing modulo inverse. Based on the rule of taking the
least positive remainder in division, this paper presents a more precise
algorithmic description of the method of DaYan deriving one to reflect Qin's
original idea. Our form of the algorithm is straightforward and different from
the ones in the literature. Some additional information can be revealed easily
from the process of DaYan deriving one, e.g., the invariance property of the
permanent of the state, natural connection to continued fractions. Comparison
of Qin'a algorithm and the modern form of the Extended Euclidean algorithm is
also given. Since DaYan deriving one is the key technical ingredient of Jiushao
Qin's DaYan aggregation method (aka the Chinese Remainder Theorem), we include
some explanation to the latter as well.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence employing deep neural
network architectures that has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in
computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and other
domains. In November 2015, Google released $\textit{TensorFlow}$, an open
source deep learning software library for defining, training and deploying
machine learning models. In this paper, we review TensorFlow and put it in
context of modern deep learning concepts and software. We discuss its basic
computational paradigms and distributed execution model, its programming
interface as well as accompanying visualization toolkits. We then compare
TensorFlow to alternative libraries such as Theano, Torch or Caffe on a
qualitative as well as quantitative basis and finally comment on observed
use-cases of TensorFlow in academia and industry.

 <dc:description>  The challenging requirements of 5G--from both the applications and the
architecture perspectives--motivate the need to explore the feasibility of
delivering services over new network architectures. As 5G proposes
application-centric network slicing, which enables the use of new data planes
realizable over a programmable compute, storage, and transport infrastructure,
we consider Information-centric Networking (ICN) as a candidate network
architecture to realize 5G objectives. This can co-exist with end-to-end IP
services that are offered today. To this effect, we first propose a 5G-ICN
architecture and compare its benefits (i.e., innovative services offered by
leveraging ICN features) to current 3GPP-based mobile architectures. We then
introduce a general application-driven framework that emphasizes on the
flexibility afforded by Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software
Defined Networking (SDN) over which 5G-ICN can be realized. We specifically
focus on the issue of how mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) can be realized as a
5G-ICN slice, and give an in-depth overview on resource provisioning and
inter-dependencies and -coordinations among functional 5G-ICN slices to meet
the MaaS objectives.

 <dc:description>  For which sets A does there exist a mapping, computed by a total or partial
recursive function, such that the mapping, when its domain is restricted to A,
is a 1-to-1, onto mapping to $\Sigma^*$? And for which sets A does there exist
such a mapping that respects the lexicographical ordering within A? Both cases
are types of perfect, minimal hash functions. The complexity-theoretic versions
of these notions are known as compression functions and ranking functions. The
present paper defines and studies the recursion-theoretic versions of
compression and ranking functions, and in particular studies the question of
which sets have, or lack, such functions. Thus, this is a case where, in
contrast to the usual direction of notion transferal, notions from complexity
theory are inspiring notions, and an investigation, in computability theory.
  We show that the rankable and compressible sets broadly populate the
1-truth-table degrees, and we prove that every nonempty coRE cylinder is
recursively compressible.

 <dc:title>Quantum-Secure Symmetric-Key Cryptography Based on Hidden Shifts</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alagic, Gorjan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Russell, Alexander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent results of Kaplan et al., building on previous work by Kuwakado and
Morii, have shown that a wide variety of classically-secure symmetric-key
cryptosystems can be completely broken by quantum chosen-plaintext attacks
(qCPA). In such an attack, the quantum adversary has the ability to query the
cryptographic functionality in superposition. The vulnerable cryptosystems
include the Even-Mansour block cipher, the three-round Feistel network, the
Encrypted-CBC-MAC, and many others. In this work, we study simple algebraic
adaptations of such schemes that replace $(\mathbb Z/2)^n$ addition with
operations over alternate finite groups--such as $\mathbb Z/{2^n}$--and provide
evidence that these adaptations are qCPA-secure. These adaptations furthermore
retain the classical security properties (and basic structural features)
enjoyed by the original schemes.
  We establish security by treating the (quantum) hardness of the well-studied
Hidden Shift problem as a basic cryptographic assumption. We observe that this
problem has a number of attractive features in this cryptographic context,
including random self-reducibility, hardness amplification, and--in many cases
of interest--a reduction from the &quot;search version&quot; to the &quot;decisional version.&quot;
We then establish, under this assumption, the qCPA-security of several such
Hidden Shift adaptations of symmetric-key constructions. We show that a Hidden
Shift version of the Even-Mansour block cipher yields a quantum-secure
pseudorandom function, and that a Hidden Shift version of the Encrypted CBC-MAC
yields a collision-resistant hash function. Finally, we observe that such
adaptations frustrate the direct Simon's algorithm-based attacks in more
general circumstances, e.g., Feistel networks and slide attacks.

 <dc:description>  We present a new dynamic partial-order reduction method for stateless model
checking of concurrent programs. A common approach for exploring program
behaviors relies on enumerating the traces of the program, without storing the
visited states (aka stateless exploration). As the number of distinct traces
grows exponentially, dynamic partial-order reduction (DPOR) techniques have
been successfully used to partition the space of traces into equivalence
classes (Mazurkiewicz partitioning), with the goal of exploring only few
representative traces from each class.
  We introduce a new equivalence on traces under sequential consistency
semantics, which we call the observation equivalence. Two traces are
observationally equivalent if every read event observes the same write event in
both traces. While the traditional Mazurkiewicz equivalence is control-centric,
our new definition is data-centric. We show that our observation equivalence is
coarser than the Mazurkiewicz equivalence, and in many cases even exponentially
coarser. We devise a DPOR exploration of the trace space, called data-centric
DPOR, based on the observation equivalence. For acyclic architectures, our
algorithm is guaranteed to explore exactly one representative trace from each
observation class, while spending polynomial time per class. Hence, our
algorithm is optimal wrt the observation equivalence, and in several cases
explores exponentially fewer traces than any enumerative method based on the
Mazurkiewicz equivalence. For cyclic architectures, we consider an equivalence
between traces which is finer than the observation equivalence; but coarser
than the Mazurkiewicz equivalence, and in some cases is exponentially coarser.
Our data-centric DPOR algorithm remains optimal under this trace equivalence.

 <dc:title>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring: A Review and Outlook</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Klemenjak, Christoph</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the roll-out of smart meters the importance of effective non-intrusive
load monitoring (NILM) techniques has risen rapidly. NILM estimates the power
consumption of individual devices given their aggregate consumption. In this
way, the combined consumption must only be monitored at a single, central point
in the household, providing various advantages such as reduced cost for
metering equipment. In this paper we discuss the fundamental building-blocks of
NILM, first giving a taxonomy of appliance models and device signatures and
then explaining common supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
Furthermore, we outline a fundamental algorithm that tackles the task of NILM.
Subsequently, this paper reviews recent research that has brought novel insight
to the field and more effective techniques. Finally, we formulate future
challenges in the domain of NILM and smart meters.

 <dc:title>Targeted Pseudorandom Generators, Simulation Advice Generators, and
  Derandomizing Logspace</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hoza, William M.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Assume that for every derandomization result for logspace algorithms, there
is a pseudorandom generator strong enough to nearly recover the derandomization
by iterating over all seeds and taking a majority vote. We prove under a
precise version of this assumption that $\mathbf{BPL} \subseteq \bigcap_{\alpha
&gt; 0} \mathbf{DSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n)$.
  We strengthen the theorem to an equivalence by considering two
generalizations of the concept of a pseudorandom generator against logspace. A
targeted pseudorandom generator against logspace takes as input a short uniform
random seed and a finite automaton; it outputs a long bitstring that looks
random to that particular automaton. A simulation advice generator for logspace
stretches a small uniform random seed into a long advice string; the
requirement is that there is some logspace algorithm that, given a finite
automaton and this advice string, simulates the automaton reading a long
uniform random input. We prove that $\bigcap_{\alpha &gt; 0}
\mathbf{promise\mbox{-}BPSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n) = \bigcap_{\alpha &gt; 0}
\mathbf{promise\mbox{-}DSPACE}(\log^{1 + \alpha} n)$ if and only if for every
targeted pseudorandom generator against logspace, there is a simulation advice
generator for logspace with similar parameters.
  Finally, we observe that in a certain uniform setting (namely, if we only
worry about sequences of automata that can be generated in logspace), targeted
pseudorandom generators against logspace can be transformed into simulation
advice generators with similar parameters.

 <dc:description>  Recently, multi-view representation learning has become a rapidly growing
direction in machine learning and data mining areas. This paper introduces
several principles for multi-view representation learning: correlation,
consensus, and complementarity principles. Consequently, we first review the
representative methods and theories of multi-view representation learning based
on correlation principle, especially on canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
and its several extensions. Then from the viewpoint of consensus and
complementarity principles we investigate the advancement of multi-view
representation learning that ranges from shallow methods including multi-modal
topic learning, multi-view sparse coding, and multi-view latent space Markov
networks, to deep methods including multi-modal restricted Boltzmann machines,
multi-modal autoencoders, and multi-modal recurrent neural networks. Further,
we also provide an important perspective from manifold alignment for multi-view
representation learning. Overall, this survey aims to provide an insightful
overview of theoretical basis and state-of-the-art developments in the field of
multi-view representation learning and to help researchers find the most
appropriate tools for particular applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an open platform, which collects multimodal environmental
data related to air quality from several sources including official open
sources, social media and citizens. Collecting and fusing different sources of
air quality data into a unified air quality indicator is a highly challenging
problem, leveraging recent advances in image analysis, open hardware, machine
learning and data fusion and is expected to result in increased geographical
coverage and temporal granularity of air quality data.

 <dc:description>  The logical technique of focusing can be applied to the $\lambda$-calculus;
in a simple type system with atomic types and negative type formers (functions,
products, the unit type), its normal forms coincide with $\beta\eta$-normal
forms. Introducing a saturation phase gives a notion of quasi-normal forms in
presence of positive types (sum types and the empty type). This rich structure
let us prove the decidability of $\beta\eta$-equivalence in presence of the
empty type, the fact that it coincides with contextual equivalence, and a
finite model property.

challenging task. The proliferation of network information and tools for data
analytics can provide an important insight into resource provisioning and
optimisation. The network knowledge incorporated in software defined networking
can facilitate the knowledge driven control, leveraging the network
programmability. We present Seer: a flexible, highly configurable data
analytics platform for network intelligence based on software defined
networking and big data principles. Seer combines a computational engine with a
distributed messaging system to provide a scalable, fault tolerant and
real-time platform for knowledge extraction. Our first prototype uses Apache
Spark for streaming analytics and open network operating system (ONOS)
controller to program a network in real-time. The first application we
developed aims to predict the mobility pattern of mobile devices inside a smart

 <dc:description>  Several methods have recently been proposed to analyze speech and
automatically infer the personality of the speaker. These methods often rely on
prosodic and other hand crafted speech processing features extracted with
off-the-shelf toolboxes. To achieve high accuracy, numerous features are
typically extracted using complex and highly parameterized algorithms. In this
paper, a new method based on feature learning and spectrogram analysis is
proposed to simplify the feature extraction process while maintaining a high
level of accuracy. The proposed method learns a dictionary of discriminant
features from patches extracted in the spectrogram representations of training
speech segments. Each speech segment is then encoded using the dictionary, and
the resulting feature set is used to perform classification of personality
traits. Experiments indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results with a significant reduction in complexity when compared to the most
recent reference methods. The number of features, and difficulties linked to
the feature extraction process are greatly reduced as only one type of
descriptors is used, for which the 6 parameters can be tuned automatically. In
contrast, the simplest reference method uses 4 types of descriptors to which 6
functionals are applied, resulting in over 20 parameters to be tuned.

 <dc:description>  If classifiers are selected from a hypothesis class to form an ensemble,
bounds on average error rate over the selected classifiers include a component
for selectivity, which grows as the fraction of hypothesis classifiers selected
for the ensemble shrinks, and a component for variety, which grows with the
size of the hypothesis class or in-sample data set. We show that the component
for selectivity asymptotically dominates the component for variety, meaning
that variety is essentially free.

 <dc:description>  We present a weakly-supervised approach to segmenting proposed drivable paths
in images with the goal of autonomous driving in complex urban environments.
Using recorded routes from a data collection vehicle, our proposed method
generates vast quantities of labelled images containing proposed paths and
obstacles without requiring manual annotation, which we then use to train a
deep semantic segmentation network. With the trained network we can segment
proposed paths and obstacles at run-time using a vehicle equipped with only a
monocular camera without relying on explicit modelling of road or lane
markings. We evaluate our method on the large-scale KITTI and Oxford RobotCar
datasets and demonstrate reliable path proposal and obstacle segmentation in a
wide variety of environments under a range of lighting, weather and traffic
conditions. We illustrate how the method can generalise to multiple path
proposals at intersections and outline plans to incorporate the system into a
framework for autonomous urban driving.

 <dc:description>  Beyond its highly publicized victories in Go, there have been numerous
successful applications of deep learning in information retrieval, computer
vision and speech recognition. In cybersecurity, an increasing number of
companies have become excited about the potential of deep learning, and have
started to use it for various security incidents, the most popular being
malware detection. These companies assert that deep learning (DL) could help
turn the tide in the battle against malware infections. However, deep neural
networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, a flaw that plagues most
if not all statistical learning models. Recent research has demonstrated that
those with malicious intent can easily circumvent deep learning-powered malware
detection by exploiting this flaw.
  In order to address this problem, previous work has developed various defense
mechanisms that either augmenting training data or enhance model's complexity.
However, after a thorough analysis of the fundamental flaw in DNNs, we discover
that the effectiveness of current defenses is limited and, more importantly,
cannot provide theoretical guarantees as to their robustness against
adversarial sampled-based attacks. As such, we propose a new adversary
resistant technique that obstructs attackers from constructing impactful
adversarial samples by randomly nullifying features within samples. In this
work, we evaluate our proposed technique against a real world dataset with
14,679 malware variants and 17,399 benign programs. We theoretically validate
the robustness of our technique, and empirically show that our technique
significantly boosts DNN robustness to adversarial samples while maintaining
high accuracy in classification. To demonstrate the general applicability of
our proposed method, we also conduct experiments using the MNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets, generally used in image recognition research.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of constructing in-block controllable (IBC)
regions for affine systems. That is, we are concerned with constructing regions
in the state space of affine systems such that all the states in the interior
of the region are mutually accessible through the region's interior by applying
uniformly bounded inputs. We first show that existing results for checking
in-block controllability on given polytopic regions cannot be easily extended
to address the question of constructing IBC regions. We then explore the
geometry of the problem to provide a computationally efficient algorithm for
constructing IBC regions. We also prove the soundness of the algorithm. We then
use the proposed algorithm to construct safe speed profiles for different
robotic systems, including fully-actuated robots, ground robots modeled as
unicycles with acceleration limits, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
Finally, we present several experimental results on UAVs to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. For instance, we use the proposed
algorithm for real-time collision avoidance for UAVs.

 <dc:title>A Model to Estimate First-Order Mutation Coverage from Higher-Order

 <dc:description>  The test suite is essential for fault detection during software development.
First-order mutation coverage is an accurate metric to quantify the quality of
the test suite. However, it is computationally expensive. Hence, the adoption
of this metric is limited. In this study, we address this issue by proposing a
realistic model able to estimate first-order mutation coverage using only
higher-order mutation coverage. Our study shows how the estimation evolves
along with the order of mutation. We validate the model with an empirical study
based on 17 open-source projects.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces the Event Capture Annotation Tool (ECAT), a
user-friendly, open-source interface tool for annotating events and their
participants in video, capable of extracting the 3D positions and orientations
of objects in video captured by Microsoft's Kinect(R) hardware. The modeling
language VoxML (Pustejovsky and Krishnaswamy, 2016) underlies ECAT's object,
program, and attribute representations, although ECAT uses its own spec for
explicit labeling of motion instances. The demonstration will show the tool's
workflow and the options available for capturing event-participant relations
and browsing visual data. Mapping ECAT's output to VoxML will also be
addressed.

 <dc:title>On the Safety of Machine Learning: Cyber-Physical Systems, Decision

 <dc:description>  Machine learning algorithms increasingly influence our decisions and interact
with us in all parts of our daily lives. Therefore, just as we consider the
safety of power plants, highways, and a variety of other engineered
socio-technical systems, we must also take into account the safety of systems
involving machine learning. Heretofore, the definition of safety has not been
formalized in a machine learning context. In this paper, we do so by defining
machine learning safety in terms of risk, epistemic uncertainty, and the harm
incurred by unwanted outcomes. We then use this definition to examine safety in
all sorts of applications in cyber-physical systems, decision sciences, and
data products. We find that the foundational principle of modern statistical
machine learning, empirical risk minimization, is not always a sufficient
objective. Finally, we discuss how four different categories of strategies for
achieving safety in engineering, including inherently safe design, safety
reserves, safe fail, and procedural safeguards can be mapped to a machine
learning context. We then discuss example techniques that can be adopted in
each category, such as considering interpretability and causality of predictive
models, objective functions beyond expected prediction accuracy, human
involvement for labeling difficult or rare examples, and user experience design
of software and open data.

 <dc:title>Advancing parabolic operators in thermodynamic MHD models: Explicit

 <dc:description>  We explore the performance and advantages/disadvantages of using
unconditionally stable explicit super time-stepping (STS) algorithms versus
implicit schemes with Krylov solvers for integrating parabolic operators in
thermodynamic MHD models of the solar corona. Specifically, we compare the
second-order Runge-Kutta Legendre (RKL2) STS method with the implicit backward
Euler scheme computed using the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solver
with both a point-Jacobi and a non-overlapping domain decomposition ILU0
preconditioner. The algorithms are used to integrate anisotropic Spitzer
thermal conduction and artificial kinematic viscosity at time-steps much larger
than classic explicit stability criteria allow. A key component of the
comparison is the use of an established MHD model (MAS) to compute a real-world
simulation on a large HPC cluster. Special attention is placed on the parallel
scaling of the algorithms. It is shown that, for a specific problem and model,
the RKL2 method is comparable or surpasses the implicit method with PCG solvers
in performance and scaling, but suffers from some accuracy limitations. These
limitations, and the applicability of RKL methods are briefly discussed.

 <dc:description>  Despite computation becomes much complex on data with an unprecedented scale,
we argue computers or smart devices should and will consistently provide
information and knowledge to human being in the order of a few tens
milliseconds. We coin a new term 10-millisecond computing to call attention to
this class of workloads. 10-millisecond computing raises many challenges for
both software and hardware stacks. In this paper, using a typical
workload-memcached on a 40-core server (a main-stream server in near future),
we quantitatively measure 10-ms computing's challenges to conventional
operating systems. For better communication, we propose a simple metric-outlier
proportion to measure quality of service: for N completed requests or jobs, if
M jobs or requests' latencies exceed the outlier threshold t, the outlier
proportion is M/N . For a 1K-scale system running Linux (version 2.6.32), LXC
(version 0.7.5) or XEN (version 4.0.0), respectively, we surprisingly find that
so as to reduce the service outlier proportion to 10% (10% users will feel QoS
degradation), the outlier proportion of a single server has to be reduced by
871X, 2372X, 2372X accordingly. Also, we discuss the possible design spaces of
10-ms computing systems from perspectives of datacenter architectures,
networking, OS and scheduling, and benchmarking.

 <dc:description>  It is known that a PR-BOX (PR), a non-local resource and $(2\rightarrow 1)$
random access code (RAC), a functionality (wherein Alice encodes 2 bits into 1
bit message and Bob learns one of randomly chosen Alice's inputs) are
equivalent under the no-signaling condition. In this work we introduce
generalizations to PR and $(2\rightarrow 1)$ RAC and study their
inter-convertibility. We introduce generalizations based on the number of
inputs provided to Alice, $B_n$-BOX and $(n\rightarrow 1)$ RAC. We show that a
$B_n$-BOX is equivalent to a no-signaling $(n\rightarrow 1)$ RACBOX (RB).
Further we introduce a signaling $(n\rightarrow 1)$ RB which cannot simulate a
$B_n$-BOX. Finally to quantify the same we provide a resource inequality
between $(n\rightarrow 1)$ RB and $B_n$-BOX, and show that it is saturated. As
an application we prove that one requires atleast $(n-1)$ PRs supplemented with
a bit of communication to win a $(n\rightarrow 1)$ RAC. We further introduce
generalizations based on the dimension of inputs provided to Alice and the
message she sends, $B_n^d(+)$-BOX, $B_n^d(-)$-BOX and $(n\rightarrow 1,d)$ RAC
($d&gt;2$). We show that no-signaling condition is not enough to enforce strict
equivalence in the case of $d&gt;2$. We introduce classes of no-signaling
$(n\rightarrow 1,d)$ RB, one which can simulate $B_n^d(+)$-BOX, second which
can simulate $B_n^d(-)$-BOX and third which cannot simulate either. Finally to
quantify the same we provide a resource inequality between $(n\rightarrow 1,d)$
RB and $B_n^d(+)$-BOX, and show that it is saturated.

 <dc:description>  Mobile network performance measurement is important for understanding mobile
user experience, problem diagnosis, and service comparison. A number of
crowdsourcing measurement apps (e.g., MobiPerf [4, 6] and Netalyzr [5, 7]) have
been embarked for the last few years. Unlike existing apps that use active
measurement methods, we employ a novel passive-active approach to continuously
monitor per-app network performance on unrooted smartphones without injecting
additional network traffic. By leveraging the VpnService API on Android,
MopEye, our measurement app, intercepts all network traffic and then relays
them to their destinations using socket APIs. Therefore, not only MopEye can
measure the round-trip time accurately, it can do so without injecting
additional traffic. As a result, the bandwidth cost (and monetary cost of data
usage) for conducting such a measurement is eliminated, and the measurement can
be conducted free of user intervention. Our evaluation shows that MopEye's RTT
measurement is very close to result of tcpdump and is more accurate than
MobiPerf. We have used MopEye to conduct a one-week measurement revealing
multiple interesting findings on different apps' performance.

 <dc:description>  Sample complexity and safety are major challenges when learning policies with
reinforcement learning for real-world tasks, especially when the policies are
represented using rich function approximators like deep neural networks.
Model-based methods where the real-world target domain is approximated using a
simulated source domain provide an avenue to tackle the above challenges by
augmenting real data with simulated data. However, discrepancies between the
simulated source domain and the target domain pose a challenge for simulated
training. We introduce the EPOpt algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated
source domains and a form of adversarial training to learn policies that are
robust and generalize to a broad range of possible target domains, including
unmodeled effects. Further, the probability distribution over source domains in
the ensemble can be adapted using data from target domain and approximate
Bayesian methods, to progressively make it a better approximation. Thus,
learning on a model ensemble, along with source domain adaptation, provides the
benefit of both robustness and learning/adaptation.

 <dc:description>  In this work we consider a communication problem in which a sender, Alice,
wishes to communicate with a receiver, Bob, over a channel controlled by an
adversarial jammer, James, who is {\em myopic}. Roughly speaking, for
blocklength $n$, the codeword $X^n$ transmitted by Alice is corrupted by James
who must base his adversarial decisions (of which locations of $X^n$ to corrupt
and how to corrupt them) not on the codeword $X^n$ but on $Z^n$, an image of
$X^n$ through a noisy memoryless channel. More specifically, our communication
model may be described by two channels. A memoryless channel $p(z|x)$ from
Alice to James, and an {\it Arbitrarily Varying Channel} from Alice to Bob,
$p(y|x,s)$ governed by a state $X^n$ determined by James. In standard
adversarial channels the states $S^n$ may depend on the codeword $X^n$, but in
our setting $S^n$ depends only on James's view $Z^n$.
  The myopic channel captures a broad range of channels and bridges between the
standard models of memoryless and adversarial (zero-error) channels. In this
work we present upper and lower bounds on the capacity of myopic channels. For
a number of special cases of interest we show that our bounds are tight. We
extend our results to the setting of {\em secure} communication in which we
require that the transmitted message remain secret from James. For example, we
show that if (i) James may flip at most a $p$ fraction of the bits communicated
between Alice and Bob, and (ii) James views $X^n$ through a binary symmetric
channel with parameter $q$, then once James is &quot;sufficiently myopic&quot; (in this
case, when $q&gt;p$), then the optimal communication rate is that of an adversary
who is &quot;blind&quot; (that is, an adversary that does not see $X^n$ at all), which is
$1-H(p)$ for standard communication, and $H(q)-H(p)$ for secure communication.
A similar phenomenon exists for our general model of communication.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and
distributed representations of words applied to the evaluation in machine
translation (MT). This study is made through the enrichment of a well-known MT
evaluation metric: METEOR. This metric enables an approximate match (synonymy
or morphological similarity) between an automatic and a reference translation.
Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of WMT 2014. We
show that distributed representations are a good alternative to lexico-semantic
resources for MT evaluation and they can even bring interesting additional
information. The augmented versions of METEOR, using vector representations,
are made available on our Github page.

 <dc:title>Channel Selection Scheme for Cooperative Routing Protocols in Cognitive
  Radio Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guirguis, Arsany</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>El-Nainay, Mustafa</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) propose a smart solution for spectrum usage
inefficiency. Routing protocols for CRNs follow different criteria to choose
the best route to the destination and to avoid the interference with primary
users. Some protocols use cooperative communication techniques to achieve the
full coexistence between secondary users (SUs) and primary users (PUs).
Although using such cross-layer techniques have a great impact on the quality
of the chosen routes, the existing work do not choose the best channel to send
the data over. Thus, the available spectrum is not utilized efficiently. In
this work, we propose CSCR, a channel selection scheme for cooperation-based
routing protocols in CRNs. The proposed scheme increases the spectrum
utilization through integrating the channels selection in the route discovery
phase of the cooperation-based routing protocols. The best channels, that are
less congested with primary users and that lead to minimum switching overhead,
are chosen while constructing the cooperative group. Evaluating CSCR via NS2
simulations shows that it outperforms its counterparts in terms of goodput,
end-to-end delay, and packet delivery ratio. The proposed scheme can enhance
the network goodput, in some cases, by more than 150%, as compared to other
related protocols.

 <dc:description>  This paper is about partitioning in parallel and distributed simulation. That
means decomposing the simulation model into a numberof components and to
properly allocate them on the execution units. An adaptive solution based on
self-clustering, that considers both communication reduction and computational
load-balancing, is proposed. The implementation of the proposed mechanism is
tested using a simulation model that is challenging both in terms of structure
and dynamicity. Various configurations of the simulation model and the
execution environment have been considered. The obtained performance results
are analyzed using a reference cost model. The results demonstrate that the
proposed approach is promising and that it can reduce the simulation execution
time in both parallel and distributed architectures.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a task-space control protocol for the collaborative
manipulation of a single object by N robotic agents. The proposed methodology
is decentralized in the sense that each agent utilizes information associated
with its own and the object's dynamic/kinematic parameters and no on-line
communication takes place. Moreover, no feedback of the contact forces/torques
is required, therefore employment of corresponding sensors is avoided. An
adaptive version of the control scheme is also introduced, where the agents'
and object's dynamic parameters are considered unknown. We also use unit
quaternions to represent the object's orientation. In addition, load sharing
coefficients between the agents are employed and internal force regulation is
guaranteed. Finally, experimental studies with two robotic arms verify the
validity and effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.

 <dc:description>  To reduce automobile exhaust pollution, traffic congestion and parking
difficulties, bike-sharing systems are rapidly developed in many countries and
more than 500 major cities in the world over the past decade. In this paper, we
discuss a large-scale bike-sharing system under Markovian environment, and
propose a mean-field matrix-analytic method in the study of bike-sharing
systems through combining the mean-field theory with the time-inhomogeneous
queues as well as the nonlinear QBD processes. Firstly, we establish an
empirical measure process to express the states of this bike-sharing system.
Secondly, we apply the mean-field theory to establishing a time-inhomogeneous
MAP(t)/MAP(t)/1/K+2L+1 queue, and then to setting up a system of mean-field
equations. Thirdly, we use the martingale limit theory to show the asymptotic
independence of this bike-sharing system, and further analyze the limiting
interchangeability as N goes to infinity and t goes to infinity. Based on this,
we discuss and compute the fixed point in terms of a nonlinear QBD process.
Finally, we analyze performance measures of this bike-sharing system, such as,
the mean of stationary bike number at any station and the stationary
probability of problematic stations. Furthermore, we use numerical examples to
show how the performance measures depend on the key parameters of this
bike-sharing system. We hope the methodology and results of this paper are
applicable in the study of more general large-scale bike-sharing systems.

 <dc:description>  Informative path planning (IPP) is used to design paths for robotic sensor
platforms to extract the best/maximum possible information about a quantity of
interest while operating under a set of constraints, such as the dynamic
feasibility of vehicles. The key challenges of IPP are the strong coupling in
multiple layers of decisions: the selection of locations to visit, the
allocation of sensor platforms to those locations; and the processing of the
gathered information along the paths. This paper presents a systematic
procedure for IPP and environmental mapping using multiple UAV sensor
platforms. It (a) selects the best locations to observe, (b) calculates the
cost and finds the best paths for each UAV, and (c) estimates the measurement
value within a given region using the Gaussian process (GP) regression
framework. An illustrative example of RF intensity field mapping is presented
to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  The current framework of Internet interconnections, based on transit and
settlement-free peering relations, has systemic problems that often cause
peering disputes. We propose a new techno-economic interconnection framework
called Nash-Peering, which is based on the principles of Nash Bargaining in
game theory and economics. Nash-Peering constitutes a radical departure from
current interconnection practices, providing a broader and more economically
efficient set of interdomain relations. In particular, the direction of payment
is not determined by the direction of traffic or by rigid customer-provider
relationships but based on which AS benefits more from the interconnection. We
argue that Nash-Peering can address the root cause of various types of peering
disputes.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel system for optical encryption based on an optical XOR and
optical Linear Feedback Shift Register (oLFSRs). Though we choose LFSR for its
ability to process optical signals at line rate, we consider the fact that it
offers no cryptographic security. To address the security shortfall, we propose
implementation of parallel oLFSRs, whereby the resulting key-stream at line
rate is controlled electronically by a nonlinear random number generator at
speeds much lower than the optical line rate, which makes the system
practically relevant. The analysis of computational security shows that the
proposed system is secure against wiretapping and can be engineered with the
state of the art optical components.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the numbers of life-size humanoids as well as their mobile
capabilities have steadily grown. Stable walking motion and control for
humanoid robots are active fields of research. In this scenario an open
question is how to model and analyse the scene so that a motion planning
algorithm can generate an appropriate walking pattern. This paper presents the
current work towards scene modelling and understanding, using an RGBD sensor.
The main objective is to provide the humanoid robot iCub with capabilities to
navigate safely and interact with various parts of the environment. In this
sense we address the problem of traversability analysis of the scene, focusing
on classification of point clouds as a function of mobility, and hence walking
safety.

 <dc:description>  Much of the information processed by Information Retrieval (IR) systems is
unreliable, biased, and generally untrustworthy [1], [2], [3]. Yet, factuality
&amp; objectivity detection is not a standard component of IR systems, even though
it has been possible in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the last decade.
Motivated by this, we ask if and how factuality &amp; objectivity detection may
benefit IR. We answer this in two parts. First, we use state-of-the-art NLP to
compute the probability of document factuality &amp; objectivity in two TREC
collections, and analyse its relation to document relevance. We find that
factuality is strongly and positively correlated to document relevance, but
objectivity is not. Second, we study the impact of factuality &amp; objectivity to
retrieval effectiveness by treating them as query independent features that we
combine with a competitive language modelling baseline. Experiments with 450
TREC queries show that factuality improves precision &gt;10% over strong
baselines, especially for uncurated data used in web search; objectivity gives
mixed results. An overall clear trend is that document factuality &amp; objectivity
is much more beneficial to IR when searching uncurated (e.g. web) documents vs.
curated (e.g. state documentation and newswire articles). To our knowledge,
this is the first study of factuality &amp; objectivity for back-end IR,
contributing novel findings about the relation between relevance and
factuality/objectivity, and statistically significant gains to retrieval
effectiveness in the competitive web search task.

 <dc:title>A Decision Procedure for String Logic with Equations, Regular Membership

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the satisfiability problem for string logic with
equations, regular membership and Presburger constraints over length functions.
The difficulty comes from multiple occurrences of string variables making
state-of-the-art algorithms non-terminating. Our main contribution is to show
that the satisfiability problem in a fragment where no string variable occurs
more than twice in an equation is decidable. In particular, we propose a
semi-decision procedure for arbitrary string formulae with word equations,
regular membership and length functions. The essence of our procedure is an
algorithm to enumerate an equivalent set of solvable disjuncts for the formula.
We further show that the algorithm always terminates for the aforementioned
decidable fragment. Finally, we provide a complexity analysis of our decision
procedure to prove that it runs, in the worst case, in factorial time.

 <dc:description>  While spectrum at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies is less scarce than at
traditional frequencies below 6 GHz, still it is not unlimited, in particular
if we consider the requirements from other services using the same band and the
need to license mmWave bands to multiple mobile operators. Therefore, an
efficient spectrum access scheme is critical to harvest the maximum benefit
from emerging mmWave technologies. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid
spectrum access scheme for mmWave networks, where data is aggregated through
two mmWave carriers with different characteristics. In particular, we consider
the case of a hybrid spectrum scheme between a mmWave band with exclusive
access and a mmWave band where spectrum is pooled between multiple operators.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing hybrid spectrum
access for mmWave networks and providing a quantitative assessment of its
benefits. Our results show that this approach provides major advantages with
respect to traditional fully licensed or fully unlicensed spectrum access
schemes, though further work is needed to achieve a more complete understanding
of both technical and non technical implications.

 <dc:description>  A $ B_h $ set (or Sidon set of order $ h $) in an Abelian group $ G $ is any
subset $ \{b_0, b_1, \ldots,b_{n}\} $ of $ G $ with the property that all the
sums $ b_{i_1} + \cdots + b_{i_h} $ are different up to the order of the
summands. Let $ \phi(h,n) $ denote the order of the smallest Abelian group
containing a $ B_h $ set of cardinality $ n + 1 $. It is shown that \[ \lim_{h
\to \infty} \frac{ \phi(h,n) }{ h^n } = \frac{1}{n! \delta_L(\triangle^n)} , \]
where $ \delta_L(\triangle^n) $ is the lattice packing density of an $ n
$-simplex in Euclidean space. This determines the asymptotics exactly in cases
where this density is known ($ n \leq 3 $) and gives improved bounds on $
\phi(h,n) $ in the remaining cases. The corresponding geometric
characterization of bases of order $ h $ in finite Abelian groups in terms of

 <dc:title>Improved Lower Bound on DHP: Towards the Equivalence of DHP and DLP for
  Important Elliptic Curves Used for Implementation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kushwaha, Prabhat</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 2004, Muzereau et al. showed how to use a reduction algorithm of the
discrete logarithm problem to Diffie-Hellman problem in order to estimate lower
bound on Diffie-Hellman problem on elliptic curves. They presented their
estimates for various elliptic curves that are used in practical applications.
In this paper, we show that a much tighter lower bound for Diffie-Hellman
problem on those curves can be achieved, if one uses the multiplicative group
of a finite field as an auxiliary group. Moreover, improved lower bound
estimates on Diffie-Hellman problem for various recommended curves are also
given which are the tightest; thus, leading us towards the equivalence of
Diffie-Hellman problem and the discrete logarithm problem for these recommended
elliptic curves.

 <dc:description>  We estimate sentiment categories proportions for retrieval within large
retrieval sets. In general, estimates are produced by counting the
classification outcomes and then by adjusting such category sizes taking into
account misclassification error matrix. However, both the accuracy of the
classifier and the precision of the retrieval produce a large number of errors
that makes difficult the application of an aggregative approach to sentiment
analysis as a reliable and efficient estimation of proportions for sentiment
categories.
  The challenge for real time analytics during retrieval is thus to overcome
misclassification errors, and more importantly, to apply sentiment
classification or any other similar post-processing analytics at retrieval
time. We present a non-aggregative approach that can be applied to very large
retrieval sets of queries.

 <dc:title>Monaural Multi-Talker Speech Recognition using Factorial Speech

 <dc:description>  A Pascal challenge entitled monaural multi-talker speech recognition was
developed, targeting the problem of robust automatic speech recognition against
speech like noises which significantly degrades the performance of automatic
speech recognition systems. In this challenge, two competing speakers say a
simple command simultaneously and the objective is to recognize speech of the
target speaker. Surprisingly during the challenge, a team from IBM research,
could achieve a performance better than human listeners on this task. The
proposed method of the IBM team, consist of an intermediate speech separation
and then a single-talker speech recognition. This paper reconsiders the task of
this challenge based on gain adapted factorial speech processing models. It
develops a joint-token passing algorithm for direct utterance decoding of both
target and masker speakers, simultaneously. Comparing it to the challenge
winner, it uses maximum uncertainty during the decoding which cannot be used in
the past two-phased method. It provides detailed derivation of inference on
these models based on general inference procedures of probabilistic graphical
models. As another improvement, it uses deep neural networks for joint-speaker
identification and gain estimation which makes these two steps easier than
before producing competitive results for these steps. The proposed method of
this work outperforms past super-human results and even the results were
achieved recently by Microsoft research, using deep neural networks. It
achieved 5.5% absolute task performance improvement compared to the first
super-human system and 2.7% absolute task performance improvement compared to
its recent competitor.

 <dc:description>  Face recognition (FR) is the most preferred mode for biometric-based
surveillance, due to its passive nature of detecting subjects, amongst all
different types of biometric traits. FR under surveillance scenario does not
give satisfactory performance due to low contrast, noise and poor illumination
conditions on probes, as compared to the training samples. A state-of-the-art
technology, Deep Learning, even fails to perform well in these scenarios. We
propose a novel soft-margin based learning method for multiple feature-kernel
combinations, followed by feature transformed using Domain Adaptation, which
outperforms many recent state-of-the-art techniques, when tested using three
real-world surveillance face datasets.

 <dc:title>Recognizing and Presenting the Storytelling Video Structure with Deep

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach for temporal and semantic segmentation
of edited videos into meaningful segments, from the point of view of the
storytelling structure. The objective is to decompose a long video into more
manageable sequences, which can in turn be used to retrieve the most
significant parts of it given a textual query and to provide an effective
summarization. Previous video decomposition methods mainly employed perceptual
cues, tackling the problem either as a story change detection, or as a
similarity grouping task, and the lack of semantics limited their ability to
identify story boundaries. Our proposal connects together perceptual, audio and
semantic cues in a specialized deep network architecture designed with a
combination of CNNs which generate an appropriate embedding, and clusters shots
into connected sequences of semantic scenes, i.e. stories. A retrieval
presentation strategy is also proposed, by selecting the semantically and
aesthetically &quot;most valuable&quot; thumbnails to present, considering the query in
order to improve the storytelling presentation. Finally, the subjective nature
of the task is considered, by conducting experiments with different annotators
and by proposing an algorithm to maximize the agreement between automatic
results and human annotators.

 <dc:title>The Predictive Context Tree: Predicting Contexts and Interactions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  With a large proportion of people carrying location-aware smartphones, we
have an unprecedented platform from which to understand individuals and predict
their future actions. This work builds upon the Context Tree data structure
that summarises the historical contexts of individuals from augmented
geospatial trajectories, and constructs a predictive model for their likely
future contexts. The Predictive Context Tree (PCT) is constructed as a
hierarchical classifier, capable of predicting both the future locations that a
user will visit and the contexts that a user will be immersed within. The PCT
is evaluated over real-world geospatial trajectories, and compared against
existing location extraction and prediction techniques, as well as a proposed
hybrid approach that uses identified land usage elements in combination with
machine learning to predict future interactions. Our results demonstrate that
higher predictive accuracies can be achieved using this hybrid approach over
traditional extracted location datasets, and the PCT itself matches the
performance of the hybrid approach at predicting future interactions, while
adding utility in the form of context predictions. Such a prediction system is
capable of understanding not only where a user will visit, but also their
context, in terms of what they are likely to be doing.

 <dc:description>  Besides spoken words, speech signals also carry information about speaker
gender, age, and emotional state which can be used in a variety of speech
analysis applications. In this paper, a divide and conquer strategy for
ensemble classification has been proposed to recognize emotions in speech.
Intrinsic hierarchy in emotions has been utilized to construct an emotions
tree, which assisted in breaking down the emotion recognition task into smaller
sub tasks. The proposed framework generates predictions in three phases.
Firstly, emotions are detected in the input speech signal by classifying it as
neutral or emotional. If the speech is classified as emotional, then in the
second phase, it is further classified into positive and negative classes.
Finally, individual positive or negative emotions are identified based on the
outcomes of the previous stages. Several experiments have been performed on a
widely used benchmark dataset. The proposed method was able to achieve improved
recognition rates as compared to several other approaches.

 <dc:description>  Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of
shape and heterogeneity features in both Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and
low-dose Computed Tomography (CT) components of PET/CT. A secondary objective
was to investigate the impact of image quantization.Material and methods: A
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -compliant secondary
analysis of deidentified prospectively acquired PET/CT test-retest datasets of
74 patients from multi-center Merck and ACRIN trials was performed.
Metabolically active volumes were automatically delineated on PET with Fuzzy
Locally Adaptive Bayesian algorithm. 3DSlicerTM was used to semi-automatically
delineate the anatomical volumes on low-dose CT components. Two quantization
methods were considered: a quantization into a set number of bins
(quantizationB) and an alternative quantization with bins of fixed width
(quantizationW). Four shape descriptors, ten first-order metrics and 26
textural features were computed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to quantify
repeatability. Features were subsequently categorized as very reliable,
reliable, moderately reliable and poorly reliable with respect to the
corresponding volume variability. Results: Repeatability was highly variable
amongst features. Numerous metrics were identified as poorly or moderately
reliable. Others were (very) reliable in both modalities, and in all categories
(shape, 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-order metrics). Image quantization played a major
role in the features repeatability. Features were more reliable in PET with
quantizationB, whereas quantizationW showed better results in CT.Conclusion:
The test-retest repeatability of shape and heterogeneity features in PET and
low-dose CT varied greatly amongst metrics. The level of repeatability also
depended strongly on the quantization step, with different optimal choices for
each modality. The repeatability of PET and low-dose CT features should be
carefully taken into account when selecting metrics to build multiparametric
models.

 <dc:title>Learning Optimal Parameters for Multi-target Tracking with Contextual

 <dc:creator>Wang, Shaofei</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe an end-to-end framework for learning parameters of min-cost flow
multi-target tracking problem with quadratic trajectory interactions including
suppression of overlapping tracks and contextual cues about cooccurrence of
different objects. Our approach utilizes structured prediction with a
tracking-specific loss function to learn the complete set of model parameters.
In this learning framework, we evaluate two different approaches to finding an
optimal set of tracks under a quadratic model objective, one based on an LP
relaxation and the other based on novel greedy variants of dynamic programming
that handle pairwise interactions. We find the greedy algorithms achieve almost
equivalent accuracy to the LP relaxation while being up to 10x faster than a
commercial LP solver. We evaluate trained models on three challenging
benchmarks. Surprisingly, we find that with proper parameter learning, our
simple data association model without explicit appearance/motion reasoning is
able to achieve comparable or better accuracy than many state-of-the-art
methods that use far more complex motion features or appearance affinity metric
learning.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that the emptiness problem for binary probabilistic automata
and so for quantum automata is undecidable. We present the current status of
the emptiness problems for unary probabilistic and quantum automata with
connections with Skolem's and positivity problems. We also introduce the
concept of linear recurrence automata in order to show the connection
naturally. Then, we also give possible generalizations of linear recurrence
relations and automata on vectors.

 <dc:description>  We investigate in this work a versatile convex framework for multiple image
segmentation, relying on the regularized optimal mass transport theory. In this
setting, several transport cost functions are considered and used to match
statistical distributions of features. In practice, global multidimensional
histograms are estimated from the segmented image regions, and are compared to
referring models that are either fixed histograms given a priori, or directly
inferred in the non-supervised case. The different convex problems studied are
solved efficiently using primal-dual algorithms. The proposed approach is
generic and enables multi-phase segmentation as well as co-segmentation of
multiple images.

 <dc:title>A Probably Approximately Correct Answer to Distributed Stochastic
  Optimization in a Non-stationary Environment</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bharath, B. N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>P, Vaishali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers a distributed stochastic optimization problem where the
goal is to minimize the time average of a cost function subject to a set of
constraints on the time averages of a related stochastic processes called
penalties. We assume that a delayed information about an event in the system is
available as a common information at every user, and the state of the system is
evolving in an independent and non-stationary fashion. We show that an
approximate Drift-plus-penalty (DPP) algorithm that we propose achieves a time
average cost that is within some positive constant epsilon of the optimal cost
with high probability. Further, we provide a condition on the waiting time for
this result to hold. The condition is shown to be a function of the mixing
coefficient, the number of samples (w) used to compute an estimate of the
distribution of the state, and the delay. Unlike the existing work, the method
used in the paper can be adapted to prove high probability results when the
state is evolving in a non-i.i.d and non-stationary fashion. Under mild
conditions, we show that the dependency of the error bound on w is exponential,
which is a significant improvement compared to the exiting work.

 <dc:description>  The recently introduced Intelligent Trial and Error algorithm (IT\&amp;E) enables
robots to creatively adapt to damage in a matter of minutes by combining an
off-line evolutionary algorithm and an on-line learning algorithm based on
Bayesian Optimization. We extend the IT\&amp;E algorithm to allow for robots to
learn to compensate for damages while executing their task(s). This leads to a
semi-episodic learning scheme that increases the robot's lifetime autonomy and
adaptivity. Preliminary experiments on a toy simulation and a 6-legged robot
locomotion task show promising results.

 <dc:title>A short introduction to process theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Middelburg, C. A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  These lecture notes concern the basics of the theory of process behaviour.
First the concept of a (labelled) transition system receives ample treatment
and then the following issues concerning process behaviour are elaborated in
the setting of transition systems: (i) concurrency and interaction, (ii)
abstraction, (iii) sequential composition, alternative composition, and
iteration, (iv) expressions that represent process behaviours, and (v)
structural operational semantics and equational laws for such expressions. To
quicken an intuitive understanding, direct connections with programs and
automata are established wherever appropriate. For the interested reader,
direct connections with Petri nets are also established. In each chapter,
except the last one, it shows that what has been dealt with so far still has
certain limitations. Each time, the next chapter is devoted to reducing the
limitations concerned.

 <dc:title>Decentralized Topic Modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Privacy preserving networks can be modelled as decentralized networks (e.g.,
sensors, connected objects, smartphones), where communication between nodes of
the network is not controlled by an all-knowing, central node. For this type of
networks, the main issue is to gather/learn global information on the network
(e.g., by optimizing a global cost function) while keeping the (sensitive)
information at each node. In this work, we focus on text information that
agents do not want to share (e.g., text messages, emails, confidential
reports). We use recent advances on decentralized optimization and topic models
to infer topics from a graph with limited communication. We propose a method to
adapt latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to decentralized optimization and
show on synthetic data that we still recover similar parameters and similar
performance at each node than with stochastic methods accessing to the whole
information in the graph.

 <dc:description>  The wait-free read-write memory model has been characterized as an iterated
\emph{Immediate Snapshot} (IS) task. The IS task is \emph{affine}---it can be
defined as a (sub)set of simplices of the standard chromatic subdivision. It is
known that the task of \emph{Weak Symmetry Breaking} (WSB) cannot be
represented as an affine task. In this paper, we highlight the phenomenon of a
&quot;natural&quot; model that can be captured by an iterated affine task and, thus, by a
subset of runs of the iterated immediate snapshot model. We show that the
read-write memory model in which, additionally, $k$-set-consensus objects can
be used is, unlike WSB, &quot;natural&quot; by presenting the corresponding simple affine
task captured by a subset of $2$-round IS runs. Our results imply the first
combinatorial characterization of models equipped with abstractions other than
read-write memory that applies to generic tasks.

 <dc:title>On the Joint Impact of Hardware Impairments and Imperfect CSI on
  Successive Decoding</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Miridakis, Nikolaos I.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tsiftsis, Theodoros A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a spatial multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system when hardware along with RF imperfections occur during the communication
setup is analytically investigated. More specifically, the scenario of hardware
impairments at the transceiver and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at
the receiver is considered, when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is
implemented. Two popular linear detection schemes are analyzed, namely, zero
forcing SIC (ZF-SIC) and minimum mean-square error SIC (MMSE-SIC). New
analytical expressions for the outage probability of each SIC stage are
provided, when independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels
are considered. In addition, the well-known error propagation effect between
consecutive SIC stages is analyzed, while closed-form expressions are derived
for some special cases of interest. Finally, useful engineering insights are
manifested, such as the achievable diversity order, the performance difference
between ZF- and MMSE-SIC, and the impact of imperfect CSI and/or the presence
of hardware impairments to the overall system performance.

 <dc:title>Effective Low-Complexity Optimization Methods for Joint Phase Noise and
  Channel Estimation in OFDM</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Phase noise correction is crucial to exploit full advantage of orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in modern high-data-rate communications.
OFDM channel estimation with simultaneous phase noise compensation has
therefore drawn much attention and stimulated continuing efforts. Existing
methods, however, either have not taken into account the fundamental properties
of phase noise or are only able to provide estimates of limited applicability
owing to considerable computational complexity. In this paper, we have
reformulated the joint estimation problem in the time domain as opposed to
existing frequency-domain approaches, which enables us to develop much more
efficient algorithms using the majorization-minimization technique. In
addition, we propose a method based on dimensionality reduction and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) that can adapt to various phase noise
levels and accomplish much lower mean squared error than the benchmarks without
incurring much additional computational cost. Several numerical examples with
phase noise generated by free-running oscillators or phase-locked loops
demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform existing methods with
respect to both computational efficiency and mean squared error within a large
range of signal-to-noise ratios.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks are known to be effective function approximators. Recently,
deep neural networks have proven to be very effective in pattern recognition,
classification tasks and human-level control to model highly nonlinear
realworld systems. This paper investigates the effectiveness of deep neural
networks in the modeling of dynamical systems with complex behavior. Three deep
neural network structures are trained on sequential data, and we investigate
the effectiveness of these networks in modeling associated characteristics of
the underlying dynamical systems. We carry out similar evaluations on select
publicly available system identification datasets. We demonstrate that deep
neural networks are effective model estimators from input-output data

 <dc:title>Efficiency and Budget Balance in General Quasi-linear Domains</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nath, Swaprava</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sandholm, Tuomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study efficiency and budget balance for designing mechanisms in general
quasi-linear domains. Green and Laffont (1979) proved that one cannot
generically achieve both. We consider strategyproof budget-balanced mechanisms
that are approximately efficient. For deterministic mechanisms, we show that a
strategyproof and budget-balanced mechanism must have a sink agent whose
valuation function is ignored in selecting an alternative, and she is
compensated with the payments made by the other agents. We assume the
valuations of the agents come from a bounded open interval. Using this result,
we find a tight lower bound on the inefficiencies of strategyproof,
budget-balanced mechanisms in this domain. The bound shows that the
inefficiency asymptotically disappears when the number of agents is large---a
result close in spirit to Green and Laffont (1979, Theorem 9.4). However, our
results provide worst-case bounds and the best possible rate of convergence.
  Next, we consider minimizing any convex combination of inefficiency and
budget imbalance. We show that if the valuations are unrestricted, no
deterministic mechanism can do asymptotically better than minimizing
inefficiency alone.
  Finally, we investigate randomized mechanisms and provide improved lower
bounds on expected inefficiency. We give a tight lower bound for an interesting
class of strategyproof, budget-balanced, randomized mechanisms. We also use an
optimization-based approach---in the spirit of automated mechanism design---to
provide a lower bound on the minimum achievable inefficiency of any randomized
mechanism.
  Experiments with real data from two applications show that the inefficiency
for a simple randomized mechanism is 5--100 times smaller than the worst case.
This relative difference increases with the number of agents.

 <dc:description>  The lack of large video databases obtained from real patients with
respiratory disorders makes the design and optimization of video-based
monitoring systems quite critical. The purpose of this study is the development
of suitable models and simulators of breathing behaviors and disorders, such as
respiratory pauses and apneas, in order to allow efficient design and test of
video-based monitoring systems. More precisely, a novel Continuous-Time Markov
Chain (CTMC) statistical model of breathing patterns is presented. The
Respiratory Rate (RR) pattern, estimated by measured vital signs of
hospital-monitored patients, is approximated as a CTMC, whose states and
parameters are selected through an appropriate statistical analysis. Then, two
simulators, software- and hardware-based, are proposed. After validation of the
CTMC model, the proposed simulators are tested with previously developed
video-based algorithms for the estimation of the RR and the detection of apnea
events. Examples of application to assess the performance of systems for
video-based RR estimation and apnea detection are presented. The results, in
terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, show that realistic breathing patterns,
including specific respiratory disorders, can be accurately described by the
proposed model; moreover, the simulators are able to reproduce practical
breathing patterns for video analysis. The presented CTMC statistical model can
be strategic to describe realistic breathing patterns and devise simulators
useful to develop and test novel and effective video processing-based
monitoring systems.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the operation and scheduling of electric loads in
micro-grid, a highly automated and distributed cyber-physical energy system
(CPES). We establish rigorous mathematical expressions for electric loads and
battery banks in the micro-grid by considering their characteristics and
constraints. Based on these mathematical models, we propose a novel real-time
scheduling analysis method for priority-based energy management in micro-grid,
named Significant Moments Analysis (SMA). SMA pinpoints all the crucial moments
when electrical operations are requested among the micro-grid and establishes a
dynamic model to describe the scheduling behavior of electric loads. Using SMA,
we can check the scheduling feasibility and predict whether the micro-grid can
generate enough power to support the execution of electric loads. In the case
where the power is insufficient to supply load demands, SMA can provide
accurate information about the amount of insufficient power and the time when
the insufficiency happens. Simulated results are presented to show the
effectiveness of the proposed analysis method.

 <dc:description>  We consider the following distributed pursuit-evasion problem. A team of
mobile agents called searchers starts at an arbitrary node of an unknown
$n$-node network. Their goal is to execute a search strategy that guarantees
capturing a fast and invisible intruder regardless of its movements using as
few agents as possible. We restrict our attention to networks that are embedded
into partial grids: nodes are placed on the plane at integer coordinates and
only nodes at distance one can be adjacent. We give a distributed algorithm for
the searchers that allow them to compute a connected and monotone strategy that
guarantees searching any unknown partial grid with the use of $O(\sqrt{n})$
searchers. As for a lower bound, not only there exist partial grids that
require $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ searchers, but we prove that for each distributed
searching algorithm there is a partial grid that forces the algorithm to use
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ searchers but $O(\log n)$ searchers are sufficient in the
offline scenario. This gives a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ in
terms of achievable competitive ratio of any distributed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the cooperative output regulation problem for
heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems in the presence of communication
constraints. Under standard assumptions on the agents dynamics, we propose a
distributed control algorithm relying on intermittent and asynchronous
discrete-time information exchange that can be subject to unknown time-varying
delays and information losses. We show that cooperative output regulation can
be reached for arbitrary characteristics of the discrete-time communication
process and under mild assumptions on the interconnection topology between
agents. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our
theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a recent problem in computer vision and
natural language processing that has garnered a large amount of interest from
the deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing
communities. In VQA, an algorithm needs to answer text-based questions about
images. Since the release of the first VQA dataset in 2014, additional datasets
have been released and many algorithms have been proposed. In this review, we
critically examine the current state of VQA in terms of problem formulation,
existing datasets, evaluation metrics, and algorithms. In particular, we
discuss the limitations of current datasets with regard to their ability to
properly train and assess VQA algorithms. We then exhaustively review existing
algorithms for VQA. Finally, we discuss possible future directions for VQA and
image understanding research.

 <dc:description>  Data vectors generalise finite multisets: they are finitely supported
functions into a commutative monoid. We study the question if a given data
vector can be expressed as a finite sum of others, only assuming that 1) the
domain is countable and 2) the given set of base vectors is finite up to
permutations of the domain.
  Based on a succinct representation of the involved permutations as integer
linear constraints, we derive that positive instances can be witnessed in a
bounded subset of the domain.
  For data vectors over a group we moreover study when a data vector is
reversible, that is, if its inverse is expressible using only nonnegative
coefficients. We show that if all base vectors are reversible then the
expressibility problem reduces to checking membership in finitely generated
subgroups. Moreover, checking reversibility also reduces to such membership
tests.
  These questions naturally appear in the analysis of counter machines extended
with unordered data: namely, for data vectors over $(\mathbb{Z}^d,+)$
expressibility directly corresponds to checking state equations for Coloured
Petri nets where tokens can only be tested for equality. We derive that in this
case, expressibility is in NP, and in P for reversible instances. These upper
bounds are tight: they match the lower bounds for standard integer vectors
(over singleton domains).

 <dc:description>  Let $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ be a finite field of cardinality $p^m$, where $p$ is a
prime, and $k, N$ be any positive integers. We denote $R_k=F_{p^m}[u]/\langle
u^k\rangle =F_{p^m}+uF_{p^m}+\ldots+u^{k-1}F_{p^m}$ ($u^k=0$) and
$\lambda=a_0+a_1u+\ldots+a_{k-1}u^{k-1}$ where $a_0, a_1,\ldots, a_{k-1}\in
F_{p^m}$ satisfying $a_0\neq 0$ and $a_1=1$. Let $r$ be a positive integer
satisfying $p^{r-1}+1\leq k\leq p^r$. We defined a Gray map from $R_k$ to
$F_{p^m}^{p^r}$ first, then prove that the Gray image of any linear
$\lambda$-constacyclic code over $R_k$ of length $N$ is a distance invariant
linear $a_0^{p^r}$-constacyclic code over $F_{p^m}$ of length $p^rN$.
Furthermore, the generator polynomials for each linear $\lambda$-constacyclic
code over $R_k$ of length $N$ and its Gray image are given respectively.
Finally, some optimal constacyclic codes over $F_{3}$ and $F_{5}$ are
constructed.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear
value function approximation. It is well known that most TD learning algorithms
are unstable with linear function approximation and off-policy learning. Recent
development of Gradient TD (GTD) algorithms has addressed this problem
successfully. However, the success of GTD algorithms requires a set of well
chosen features, which are not always available. When the number of features is
huge, the GTD algorithms might face the problem of overfitting and being
computationally expensive. To cope with this difficulty, regularization
techniques, in particular $\ell_1$ regularization, have attracted significant
attentions in developing TD learning algorithms. The present work combines the
GTD algorithms with $\ell_1$ regularization. We propose a family of $\ell_1$
regularized GTD algorithms, which employ the well known soft thresholding
operator. We investigate convergence properties of the proposed algorithms, and
depict their performance with several numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the probabilistic behaviour of a random Sturmian word.
It performs the probabilistic analysis of the recurrence function which can be
viewed as a waiting time to discover all the factors of length $n$ of the
Sturmian word. This parameter is central to combinatorics of words. Having
fixed a possible length $n$ for the factors, we let $\alpha$ to be drawn
uniformly from the unit interval $[0,1]$, thus defining a random Sturmian word
of slope $\alpha$. Thus the waiting time for these factors becomes a random
variable, for which we study the limit distribution and the limit density.

 <dc:description>  This work presents an on-going investigation of the control of a pneumatic
soft-robot actuator addressing accurate patient positioning systems in maskless
head and neck cancer radiotherapy. We employ two RGB-D sensors in a sensor
fusion scheme to better estimate a patient's head pitch motion. A system
identification prediction error model is used to obtain a linear time invariant
state space model. We then use the model to design a linear quadratic Gaussian
feedback controller to manipulate the patient head position based on sensed
head pitch motion. Experiments demonstrate the success of our approach.

 <dc:description>  We present DASH, a C++ template library that offers distributed data
structures and parallel algorithms and implements a compiler-free PGAS
(partitioned global address space) approach. DASH offers many productivity and
performance features such as global-view data structures, efficient support for
the owner-computes model, flexible multidimensional data distribution schemes
and inter-operability with STL (standard template library) algorithms. DASH
also features a flexible representation of the parallel target machine and
allows the exploitation of several hierarchically organized levels of locality
through a concept of Teams. We evaluate DASH on a number of benchmark
applications and we port a scientific proxy application using the MPI two-sided
model to DASH. We find that DASH offers excellent productivity and performance
and demonstrate scalability up to 9800 cores.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes a tentative model for the calculation of dimensionless
distances between phonemes; sounds are described with binary distinctive
features and distances show linear consistency in terms of such features. The
model can be used as a scoring function for local and global pairwise alignment
of phoneme sequences, and the distances can be used as prior probabilities for
Bayesian analyses on the phylogenetic relationship between languages,
particularly for cognate identification in cases where no empirical prior
probability is available.

 <dc:description>  Legged locomotion has received increasing attention from the robotics
community. In this respect, contact stability plays a critical role in ensuring
that robots maintain balance, and it is a key element for balancing and walking
controllers. The Center of Pressure is a contact stability criterion that
defines a point that must be kept strictly inside the support polygon in order
to ensure postural stability. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the
sensitivity of the static center of pressure: roughly speaking, the rate of
change of the center of pressure with respect to the system equilibrium
configurations. This new concept can be used as an additional criterion to
assess the robustness of the contact stability. We show how the sensitivity of
the center of pressure can also be used as a metric to assess balancing
controllers by considering two state-of-the-art control strategies. The
analytical analysis is performed on a simplified model, and validated during
balancing tasks on the iCub humanoid robot.

 <dc:title>From Tracking to Robust Maneuver Regulation: an Easy-to-Design Approach

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a maneuver regulation scheme for Vertical Take-Off
and Landing (VTOL) micro aerial vehicles (MAV). Differently from standard
trajectory tracking, maneuver regulation has an intrinsic robustness due to the
fact that the vehicle is not required to chase a virtual target, but just to
stay on a (properly designed) desired path with a given velocity profile. In
this paper we show how a robust maneuver regulation controller can be easily
designed by converting an existing tracking scheme. The resulting maneuvering
controller has three main appealing features, namely it: (i) inherits the
robustness properties of the tracking controller, (ii) gains the appealing
features of maneuver regulation, and (iii) does not need any additional tuning
with respect to the tracking controller. We prove the correctness of the
proposed scheme and show its effectiveness in experiments on a nano-quadrotor.
In particular, we show on a nontrivial maneuver how external disturbances
acting on the quadrotor cause instabilities in the standard tracking, while
marginally affect the maneuver regulation scheme.

 <dc:description>  We use tools from geometric statistics to analyze the usual estimation
procedure of a template shape. This applies to shapes from landmarks, curves,
surfaces, images etc. We demonstrate the asymptotic bias of the template shape
estimation using the stratified geometry of the shape space. We give a Taylor
expansion of the bias with respect to a parameter $\sigma$ describing the
measurement error on the data. We propose two bootstrap procedures that
quantify the bias and correct it, if needed. They are applicable for any type
of shape data. We give a rule of thumb to provide intuition on whether the bias
has to be corrected. This exhibits the parameters that control the bias'
magnitude. We illustrate our results on simulated and real shape data.

 <dc:description>  With current efforts to design Future Internet Architectures (FIAs), the
evaluation and comparison of different proposals is an interesting research
challenge. Previously, metrics such as bandwidth or latency have commonly been
used to compare FIAs to IP networks. We suggest the use of power consumption as
a metric to compare FIAs. While low power consumption is an important goal in
its own right (as lower energy use translates to smaller environmental impact
as well as lower operating costs), power consumption can also serve as a proxy
for other metrics such as bandwidth and processor load.
  Lacking power consumption statistics about either commodity FIA routers or
widely deployed FIA testbeds, we propose models for power consumption of FIA
routers. Based on our models, we simulate scenarios for measuring power
consumption of content delivery in different FIAs. Specifically, we address two
questions: 1) which of the proposed FIA candidates achieves the lowest energy
footprint; and 2) which set of design choices yields a power-efficient network
architecture? Although the lack of real-world data makes numerous assumptions
necessary for our analysis, we explore the uncertainty of our calculations
through sensitivity analysis of input parameters.

 <dc:description>  In vivo wireless medical devices have a critical role in healthcare
technologies due to their continuous health monitoring and noninvasive surgery
capabilities. In order to fully exploit the potential of such devices, it is
necessary to characterize the in vivo wireless communication channel which will
help to build reliable and high-performance communication systems. This paper
presents preliminary results of experimental characterization for this
fascinating communications medium on a human cadaver and compares the results
with numerical studies.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We discuss the use of elliptic curves in cryptography on high-dimensional
surfaces. In particular, instead of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol
written in the form of a bi-dimensional row, where the elements are made up
with 256 bits, we propose a key exchange protocol given in a matrix form, with
four independent entries each of them constructed with 64 bits. Apart from the
great advantage of significantly reducing the number of used bits, this
methodology appears to be immune to attacks of the style of Western, Miller,
and Adleman, and at the same time it is also able to reach the same level of
security as the cryptographic system presently obtained by the Microsoft
Digital Rights Management. A nonlinear differential equation (NDE) admitting
the elliptic curves as a special case is also proposed. The study of the class
of solutions of this NDE is in progress.

 <dc:description>  Word embeddings have been extensively studied in large text datasets.
However, only a few studies analyze semantic representations of small corpora,
particularly relevant in single-person text production studies. In the present
paper, we compare Skip-gram and LSA capabilities in this scenario, and we test
both techniques to extract relevant semantic patterns in single-series dreams
reports. LSA showed better performance than Skip-gram in small size training
corpus in two semantic tests. As a study case, we show that LSA can capture
relevant words associations in dream reports series, even in cases of small
number of dreams or low-frequency words. We propose that LSA can be used to
explore words associations in dreams reports, which could bring new insight
into this classic research area of psychology

 <dc:title>Lifted Message Passing for the Generalized Belief Propagation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We introduce the lifted Generalized Belief Propagation (GBP) message passing
algorithm, for the computation of sum-product queries in Probabilistic
Relational Models (e.g. Markov logic network). The algorithm forms a compact
region graph and establishes a modified version of message passing, which
mimics the GBP behavior in a corresponding ground model. The compact graph is
obtained by exploiting a graphical representation of clusters, which reduces
cluster symmetry detection to isomorphism tests on small local graphs. The
framework is thus capable of handling complex models, while remaining
domain-size independent.

 <dc:description>  Online social networks represent a main source of communication and
information exchange in today's life. They facilitate exquisitely news sharing,
knowledge elicitation, and forming groups of same interests. Researchers in the
last two decades studied the growth dynamics of the online social networks
extensively questing a clear understanding of the behavior of humans in online
social networks that helps in many directions, like engineering better
recommendation systems and attracting new members. However, not all of social
networks achieved the desired growth, for example, online social networks like
MySpace, Orkut, and Friendster are out of service today. In this work, we
present a probabilistic theoretical model that captures the dynamics of the
social decay due to the inactivity of the members of a social network. The
model is proved to have some interesting mathematical properties, namely
\textit{submodularity}, which imply achieving the model optimization in a
reasonable performance. That means the maximization problem can be approximated
within a factor of $(1-1/e)$ and the minimization problem can be achieved in
polynomial time.

 <dc:description>  We will demonstrate a conversational products recommendation agent. This
system shows how we combine research in personalized recommendation systems
with research in dialogue systems to build a virtual sales agent. Based on new
deep learning technologies we developed, the virtual agent is capable of
learning how to interact with users, how to answer user questions, what is the
next question to ask, and what to recommend when chatting with a human user.
  Normally a descent conversational agent for a particular domain requires tens
of thousands of hand labeled conversational data or hand written rules. This is
a major barrier when launching a conversation agent for a new domain. We will
explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning solution even when
there is no hand written rules or hand labeled training data.

 <dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become very popular for prediction in many
areas. Their strength is in representation with a high number of parameters
that are commonly learned via gradient descent or similar optimization methods.
However, the representation is non-standardized, and the gradient calculation
methods are often performed using component-based approaches that break
parameters down into scalar units, instead of considering the parameters as
whole entities. In this work, these problems are addressed. Standard notation
is used to represent DNNs in a compact framework. Gradients of DNN loss
functions are calculated directly over the inner product space on which the
parameters are defined. This framework is general and is applied to two common
network types: the Multilayer Perceptron and the Deep Autoencoder.

 <dc:description>  The use of microblogging platforms such as Twitter during crises has become
widespread. More importantly, information disseminated by affected people
contains useful information like reports of missing and found people, requests
for urgent needs etc. For rapid crisis response, humanitarian organizations
look for situational awareness information to understand and assess the
severity of the crisis. In this paper, we present a novel framework (i) to
generate abstractive summaries useful for situational awareness, and (ii) to
capture sub-topics and present a short informative summary for each of these
topics. A summary is generated using a two stage framework that first extracts
a set of important tweets from the whole set of information through an
Integer-linear programming (ILP) based optimization technique and then follows
a word graph and concept event based abstractive summarization technique to
produce the final summary. High accuracies obtained for all the tasks show the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

 <dc:description>  Here we present DeepGaze II, a model that predicts where people look in
images. The model uses the features from the VGG-19 deep neural network trained
to identify objects in images. Contrary to other saliency models that use deep
features, here we use the VGG features for saliency prediction with no
additional fine-tuning (rather, a few readout layers are trained on top of the
VGG features to predict saliency). The model is therefore a strong test of
transfer learning. After conservative cross-validation, DeepGaze II explains
about 87% of the explainable information gain in the patterns of fixations and
achieves top performance in area under the curve metrics on the MIT300 hold-out
benchmark. These results corroborate the finding from DeepGaze I (which
explained 56% of the explainable information gain), that deep features trained
on object recognition provide a versatile feature space for performing related
visual tasks. We explore the factors that contribute to this success and
present several informative image examples. A web service is available to
compute model predictions at http://deepgaze.bethgelab.org.

 <dc:description>  Identity verification based on authenticity assessment of a handwritten
signature is an important issue in biometrics. There are many effective methods
for signature verification taking into account dynamics of a signing process.
Methods based on partitioning take a very important place among them. In this
paper we propose a new approach to signature partitioning. Its most important
feature is the possibility of selecting and processing of hybrid partitions in
order to increase a precision of the test signature analysis. Partitions are
formed by a combination of vertical and horizontal sections of the signature.
Vertical sections correspond to the initial, middle, and final time moments of
the signing process. In turn, horizontal sections correspond to the signature
areas associated with high and low pen velocity and high and low pen pressure
on the surface of a graphics tablet. Our previous research on vertical and
horizontal sections of the dynamic signature (created independently) led us to
develop the algorithm presented in this paper. Selection of sections, among
others, allows us to define the stability of the signing process in the
partitions, promoting signature areas of greater stability (and vice versa). In
the test of the proposed method two databases were used: public MCYT-100 and
paid BioSecure.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of proactive deployment of cache-enabled unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) for optimizing the quality-of-experience (QoE) of
wireless devices in a cloud radio access network (CRAN) is studied. In the
considered model, the network can leverage human-centric information such as
users' visited locations, requested contents, gender, job, and device type to
predict the content request distribution and mobility pattern of each user.
Then, given these behavior predictions, the proposed approach seeks to find the
user-UAV associations, the optimal UAVs' locations, and the contents to cache
at UAVs. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to
maximize the users' QoE while minimizing the transmit power used by the UAVs.
To solve this problem, a novel algorithm based on the machine learning
framework of conceptor-based echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. Using
ESNs, the network can effectively predict each user's content request
distribution and its mobility pattern when limited information on the states of
users and the network is available. Based on the predictions of the users'
content request distribution and their mobility patterns, we derive the optimal
user-UAV association, optimal locations of the UAVs as well as the content to
cache at UAVs. Simulation results using real pedestrian mobility patterns from
BUPT and actual content transmission data from Youku show that the proposed
algorithm can yield 40% and 61% gains, respectively, in terms of the average
transmit power and the percentage of the users with satisfied QoE compared to a
benchmark algorithm without caching and a benchmark solution without UAVs.

 <dc:description>  For a seamless deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need
for self-organizing solutions to overcome key IoT challenges that include data
processing, resource management, coexistence with existing wireless networks,
and improved IoT-wide event detection. One of the most promising solutions to
address these challenges is via the use of innovative learning frameworks that
will enable the IoT devices to operate autonomously in a dynamic environment.
However, developing learning mechanisms for the IoT requires coping with unique
IoT properties in terms of resource constraints, heterogeneity, and strict
quality-of-service requirements. In this paper, a number of emerging learning
frameworks suitable for IoT applications are presented. In particular, the
advantages, limitations, IoT applications, and key results pertaining to
machine learning, sequential learning, and reinforcement learning are studied.
For each type of learning, the computational complexity, required information,
and learning performance are discussed. Then, to handle the heterogeneity of
the IoT, a new framework based on the powerful tools of cognitive hierarchy
theory is introduced. This framework is shown to efficiently capture the
different IoT device types and varying levels of available resources among the
IoT devices. In particular, the different resource capabilities of IoT devices

 <dc:description>  Measuring and forecasting opinion trends from real-time social media is a
long-standing goal of big-data analytics. Despite its importance, there has
been no conclusive scientific evidence so far that social media activity can
capture the opinion of the general population. Here we develop a method to
infer the opinion of Twitter users regarding the candidates of the 2016 US
Presidential Election by using a combination of statistical physics of complex
networks and machine learning based on hashtags co-occurrence to develop an
in-domain training set approaching 1 million tweets. We investigate the social
networks formed by the interactions among millions of Twitter users and infer
the support of each user to the presidential candidates. The resulting Twitter
trends follow the New York Times National Polling Average, which represents an
aggregate of hundreds of independent traditional polls, with remarkable
accuracy. Moreover, the Twitter opinion trend precedes the aggregated NYT polls
by 10 days, showing that Twitter can be an early signal of global opinion
trends. Our analytics unleash the power of Twitter to uncover social trends
from elections, brands to political movements, and at a fraction of the cost of
national polls.

 <dc:title>Neural Structural Correspondence Learning for Domain Adaptation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Domain adaptation, adapting models from domains rich in labeled training data
to domains poor in such data, is a fundamental NLP challenge. We introduce a
neural network model that marries together ideas from two prominent strands of
research on domain adaptation through representation learning: structural
correspondence learning (SCL, (Blitzer et al., 2006)) and autoencoder neural
networks. Particularly, our model is a three-layer neural network that learns
to encode the nonpivot features of an input example into a low-dimensional
representation, so that the existence of pivot features (features that are
prominent in both domains and convey useful information for the NLP task) in
the example can be decoded from that representation. The low-dimensional
representation is then employed in a learning algorithm for the task. Moreover,
we show how to inject pre-trained word embeddings into our model in order to
improve generalization across examples with similar pivot features. On the task
of cross-domain product sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007),
consisting of 12 domain pairs, our model outperforms both the SCL and the
marginalized stacked denoising autoencoder (MSDA, (Chen et al., 2012)) methods
by 3.77% and 2.17% respectively, on average across domain pairs.

 <dc:description>  In the IEEE 802.11p standard addressing vehicular communications, Basic
Safety Messages (BSMs) can be bundled together and relayed as to increase the
effective communication range of transmitting vehicles. This process forms a
vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) for the dissemination of safety information.
The number of &quot;shortest multihop paths&quot; (or geodesics) connecting two network
nodes is an important statistic which can be used to enhance throughput,
validate threat events, protect against collusion attacks, infer location
information, and also limit redundant broadcasts thus reducing interference. To
this end, we analytically calculate for the first time the mean and variance of
the number of geodesics in 1D VANETs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a machine learning approach for extracting fine-grained
representations of protein evolution from molecular dynamics datasets.
Metastable switching linear dynamical systems extend standard switching models
with a physically-inspired stability constraint. This constraint enables the
learning of nuanced representations of protein dynamics that closely match
physical reality. We derive an EM algorithm for learning, where the E-step
extends the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs and the M-step requires the
solution of large biconvex optimization problems. We construct an approximate
semidefinite program solver based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and use it to
solve the M-step. We apply our EM algorithm to learn accurate dynamics from
large simulation datasets for the opioid peptide met-enkephalin and the
proto-oncogene Src-kinase. Our learned models demonstrate significant
improvements in temporal coherence over HMMs and standard switching models for
met-enkephalin, and sample transition paths (possibly useful in rational drug
design) for Src-kinase.

 <dc:description>  Neural network models have a reputation for being black boxes. We propose a
new method to understand better the roles and dynamics of the intermediate
layers. This has direct consequences on the design of such models and it
enables the expert to be able to justify certain heuristics (such as the
auxiliary heads in the Inception model). Our method uses linear classifiers,
referred to as &quot;probes&quot;, where a probe can only use the hidden units of a given
intermediate layer as discriminating features. Moreover, these probes cannot
affect the training phase of a model, and they are generally added after
training. They allow the user to visualize the state of the model at multiple
steps of training. We demonstrate how this can be used to develop a better
intuition about a known model and to diagnose potential problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we provide a quantitative and qualitative analyses of the
viral tweets related to the US presidential election. In our study, we focus on
analyzing the most retweeted 50 tweets for everyday during September and
October 2016. The resulting set is composed 3,050 viral tweets, and they were
retweeted over 20.5 million times. We manually annotated the tweets as
favorable of Trump, Clinton, or neither. Our quantitative study shows that
tweets favoring Trump were usually retweeted more than pro-Clinton tweets, with
the exception of a few days in September and two days in October, especially
the day following the first presidential debate and following the release of
the Access Hollywood tape. On two days in October 2016, pro-Trump tweet volume
accounted for than 90\% of the total tweet volume.

 <dc:description>  We present a new game semantics for Martin-L\&quot;of type theory (MLTT), our aim
is to give a mathematical and intensional explanation of MLTT. Specifically, we
propose a category with families of a novel variant of games, which induces a
surjective and injective (when Id-types are excluded) interpretation of the
intensional variant of MLTT equipped with unit-, empty-, N-, dependent product,
dependent sum and Id-types as well as the cumulative hierarchy of universes for
the first time in the literature (as far as we are aware), though the
surjectivity is accomplished merely by an inductive definition of a certain
class of games and strategies. Our games generalize the existing notion of
games, and achieve an interpretation of dependent types and the hierarchy of
universes in an intuitive yet mathematically precise manner, our strategies can
be seen as algorithms underlying programs (or proofs) in MLTT. A more
fine-grained interpretation of Id-types is left as future work.

detailed information found in local news reports about gun violence, and is
constructed via a large-scale crowdsourced annotation effort through our web

available data about gun violence can facilitate scientific, fact-based
discussion about a topic that is often dominated by politics and emotion. We

enabling a fully-automated, highly-scalable resource for research on this
important public health problem.

 <dc:description>  The phylogenetic network emerged in the 1990s as a new model to represent the
evolution of species in the case where coexisting species transfer genetic
information through hybridization, recombination, lateral gene transfer, etc.
As is true for many rapidly evolving fields, there is considerable
fragmentation and diversity in methodologies, standards and vocabulary in
phylogenetic network research, thus creating the need for an integrated
database of articles, authors, techniques, keywords and software. We describe
such a database, &quot;Who is Who in Phylogenetic Networks&quot;, available at
http://phylnet.univ-mlv.fr. &quot;Who is Who in Phylogenetic Networks&quot; comprises
more than 600 publications and 500 authors interlinked with a rich set of more
than 200 keywords related to phylogenetic networks. The database is integrated
with web-based tools to visualize authorship and collaboration networks and
analyze these networks using common graph and social network metrics such as
centrality (betweenness, eigenvector, degree and closeness) and clustering. We
provide downloads of raw information about entries in the database, and a
facility to suggest modifications and contribute new information to the
database. We also present in this article common use cases of the database and
identify trends in the research on phylogenetic networks using the information
in the database and textual analysis.

 <dc:description>  Inverse classification is the process of perturbing an instance in a
meaningful way such that it is more likely to conform to a specific class.
Historical methods that address such a problem are often framed to leverage
only a single classifier, or specific set of classifiers. These works are often
accompanied by naive assumptions. In this work we propose generalized inverse
classification (GIC), which avoids restricting the classification model that
can be used. We incorporate this formulation into a refined framework in which
GIC takes place. Under this framework, GIC operates on features that are
immediately actionable. Each change incurs an individual cost, either linear or
non-linear. Such changes are subjected to occur within a specified level of
cumulative change (budget). Furthermore, our framework incorporates the
estimation of features that change as a consequence of direct actions taken
(indirectly changeable features). To solve such a problem, we propose three
real-valued heuristic-based methods and two sensitivity analysis-based
comparison methods, each of which is evaluated on two freely available
real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate the validity and benefits of our
formulation, framework, and methods.

 <dc:description>  We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic sleep stage
scoring based on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) to learn
task-specific filters for classification without using prior domain knowledge.
We used an openly available dataset from 20 healthy young adults for evaluation
and applied 20-fold cross-validation. We used class-balanced random sampling
within the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization of the CNN to avoid
skewed performance in favor of the most represented sleep stages. We achieved
high mean F1-score (81%, range 79-83%), mean accuracy across individual sleep
stages (82%, range 80-84%) and overall accuracy (74%, range 71-76%) over all
subjects. By analyzing and visualizing the filters that our CNN learns, we
found that rules learned by the filters correspond to sleep scoring criteria in
the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual that human experts follow.
Our method's performance is balanced across classes and our results are
comparable to state-of-the-art methods with hand-engineered features. We show
that, without using prior domain knowledge, a CNN can automatically learn to
distinguish among different normal sleep stages.

 <dc:description>  There has been a recent paradigm shift in robotics to data-driven learning
for planning and control. Due to large number of experiences required for
training, most of these approaches use a self-supervised paradigm: using
sensors to measure success/failure. However, in most cases, these sensors
provide weak supervision at best. In this work, we propose an adversarial
learning framework that pits an adversary against the robot learning the task.
In an effort to defeat the adversary, the original robot learns to perform the
task with more robustness leading to overall improved performance. We show that
this adversarial framework forces the the robot to learn a better grasping
model in order to overcome the adversary. By grasping 82% of presented novel
objects compared to 68% without an adversary, we demonstrate the utility of
creating adversaries. We also demonstrate via experiments that having robots in
adversarial setting might be a better learning strategy as compared to having
collaborative multiple robots.

 <dc:description>  Fictitious play is a simple and widely studied adaptive heuristic for playing
repeated games. It is well known that fictitious play fails to be Hannan
consistent. Several variants of fictitious play including regret matching,
generalized regret matching and smooth fictitious play, are known to be Hannan
consistent. In this note, we consider sampled fictitious play: at each round,
the player samples past times and plays the best response to previous moves of
other players at the sampled time points. We show that sampled fictitious play,
using Bernoulli sampling, is Hannan consistent. Unlike several existing Hannan
consistency proofs that rely on concentration of measure results, ours instead
uses anti-concentration results from Littlewood-Offord theory.

 <dc:description>  The low-tubal-rank tensor model has been recently proposed for real-world
multidimensional data. In this paper, we study the low-tubal-rank tensor
completion problem, i.e., to recover a third-order tensor by observing a subset
of its elements selected uniformly at random. We propose a fast iterative
algorithm, called {\em Tubal-Alt-Min}, that is inspired by a similar approach
for low-rank matrix completion. The unknown low-tubal-rank tensor is
represented as the product of two much smaller tensors with the low-tubal-rank
property being automatically incorporated, and Tubal-Alt-Min alternates between
estimating those two tensors using tensor least squares minimization. First, we
note that tensor least squares minimization is different from its matrix
counterpart and nontrivial as the circular convolution operator of the
low-tubal-rank tensor model is intertwined with the sub-sampling operator.
Second, the theoretical performance guarantee is challenging since
Tubal-Alt-Min is iterative and nonconvex in nature. We prove that 1)
Tubal-Alt-Min guarantees exponential convergence to the global optima, and 2)
for an $n \times n \times k$ tensor with tubal-rank $r \ll n$, the required
sampling complexity is $O(nr^2k \log^3 n)$ and the computational complexity is
$O(n^2rk^2 \log^2 n)$. Third, on both synthetic data and real-world video data,
evaluation results show that compared with tensor-nuclear norm minimization
(TNN-ADMM), Tubal-Alt-Min improves the recovery error dramatically (by orders
of magnitude). It is estimated that Tubal-Alt-Min converges at an exponential
rate $10^{-0.4423 \text{Iter}}$ where $\text{Iter}$ denotes the number of
iterations, which is much faster than TNN-ADMM's $10^{-0.0332 \text{Iter}}$,
and the running time can be accelerated by more than $5$ times for a $200
\times 200 \times 20$ tensor.

 <dc:description>  We present a system to capture video footage of human subjects in the real
world. Our system leverages a quadrotor camera to automatically capture
well-composed video of two subjects. Subjects are tracked in a large-scale
outdoor environment using RTK GPS and IMU sensors. Then, given the tracked
state of our subjects, our system automatically computes static shots based on
well-established visual composition principles and canonical shots from
cinematography literature. To transition between these static shots, we
calculate feasible, safe, and visually pleasing transitions using a novel
real-time trajectory planning algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our
tracking system, and experimentally show that RTK GPS significantly outperforms
conventional GPS in capturing a variety of canonical shots. Lastly, we
demonstrate our system guiding a consumer quadrotor camera autonomously
capturing footage of two subjects in a variety of use cases. This is the first
end-to-end system that enables people to leverage the mobility of quadrotors,
as well as the knowledge of expert filmmakers, to autonomously capture
high-quality footage of people in the real world.

 <dc:description>  We present an isogeometric analysis of time-harmonic exterior acoustic
problems. The infinite space is truncated by a fictitious boundary and (simple)
absorbing boundary conditions are applied. The truncation error is included in
the exact solution so that the reported error is an indicator of the
performance of the isogeometric analysis, in particular of the related
pollution error. Numerical results performed with high-order basis functions
(third or fourth orders) showed no visible pollution error even for very high
frequencies. This property combined with exact geometrical representation makes
isogeometric analysis a very promising platform to solve high-frequency
acoustic problems.

 <dc:description>  Subjective expected utility theory assumes that decision-makers possess
unlimited computational resources to reason about their choices; however,
virtually all decisions in everyday life are made under resource constraints -
i.e. decision-makers are bounded in their rationality. Here we experimentally
tested the predictions made by a formalization of bounded rationality based on
ideas from statistical mechanics and information-theory. We systematically
tested human subjects in their ability to solve combinatorial puzzles under
different time limitations. We found that our bounded-rational model accounts
well for the data. The decomposition of the fitted model parameter into the
subjects' expected utility function and resource parameter provide interesting
insight into the subjects' information capacity limits. Our results confirm
that humans gradually fall back on their learned prior choice patterns when
confronted with increasing resource limitations.

 <dc:description>  Augmenting RGB data with measured depth has been shown to improve the
performance of a range of tasks in computer vision including object detection
and semantic segmentation. Although depth sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect
have facilitated easy acquisition of such depth information, the vast majority
of images used in vision tasks do not contain depth information. In this paper,
we show that augmenting RGB images with estimated depth can also improve the
accuracy of both object detection and semantic segmentation. Specifically, we
first exploit the recent success of depth estimation from monocular images and
learn a deep depth estimation model. Then we learn deep depth features from the
estimated depth and combine with RGB features for object detection and semantic
segmentation. Additionally, we propose an RGB-D semantic segmentation method
which applies a multi-task training scheme: semantic label prediction and depth
value regression. We test our methods on several datasets and demonstrate that
incorporating information from estimated depth improves the performance of
object detection and semantic segmentation remarkably.

 <dc:title>A Deep Spatial Contextual Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network for
  Saliency Detection</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Nian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Han, Junwei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditional saliency models usually adopt hand-crafted image features and
human-designed mechanisms to calculate local or global contrast. In this paper,
we propose a novel computational saliency model, i.e., deep spatial contextual
long-term recurrent convolutional network (DSCLRCN) to predict where people
looks in natural scenes. DSCLRCN first automatically learns saliency related
local features on each image location in parallel. Then, in contrast with most
other deep network based saliency models which infer saliency in local
contexts, DSCLRCN can mimic the cortical lateral inhibition mechanisms in human
visual system to incorporate global contexts to assess the saliency of each
image location by leveraging the deep spatial long short-term memory (DSLSTM)
model. Moreover, we also integrate scene context modulation in DSLSTM for
saliency inference, leading to a novel deep spatial contextual LSTM (DSCLSTM)
model. The whole network can be trained end-to-end and works efficiently when
testing. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that DSCLRCN can
achieve state-of-the-art performance on saliency detection. Furthermore, the
proposed DSCLSTM model can significantly boost the saliency detection
performance by incorporating both global spatial interconnections and scene
context modulation, which may uncover novel inspirations for studies on them in
computational saliency models.

 <dc:title>A Methodology for Customizing Clinical Tests for Esophageal Cancer based

 <dc:description>  Tests for Esophageal cancer can be expensive, uncomfortable and can have side
effects. For many patients, we can predict non-existence of disease with 100%
certainty, just using demographics, lifestyle, and medical history information.
Our objective is to devise a general methodology for customizing tests using
user preferences so that expensive or uncomfortable tests can be avoided. We
propose to use classifiers trained from electronic health records (EHR) for
selection of tests. The key idea is to design classifiers with 100% false
normal rates, possibly at the cost higher false abnormals. We compare Naive
Bayes classification (NB), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM)
and Logistic Regression (LR), and find kernel Logistic regression to be most
suitable for the task. We propose an algorithm for finding the best probability
threshold for kernel LR, based on test set accuracy. Using the proposed
algorithm, we describe schemes for selecting tests, which appear as features in
the automatic classification algorithm, using preferences on costs and
discomfort of the users. We test our methodology with EHRs collected for more
than 3000 patients, as a part of project carried out by a reputed hospital in
Mumbai, India. Kernel SVM and kernel LR with a polynomial kernel of degree 3,
yields an accuracy of 99.8% and sensitivity 100%, without the MP features, i.e.
using only clinical tests. We demonstrate our test selection algorithm using
two case studies, one using cost of clinical tests, and other using
&quot;discomfort&quot; values for clinical tests. We compute the test sets corresponding
to the lowest false abnormals for each criterion described above, using
exhaustive enumeration of 15 clinical tests. The sets turn out to different,
substantiating our claim that one can customize test sets based on user
preferences.

 <dc:title>Generating Simulations of Motion Events from Verbal Descriptions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pustejovsky, James</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Krishnaswamy, Nikhil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we describe a computational model for motion events in natural
language that maps from linguistic expressions, through a dynamic event
interpretation, into three-dimensional temporal simulations in a model.
Starting with the model from (Pustejovsky and Moszkowicz, 2011), we analyze
motion events using temporally-traced Labelled Transition Systems. We model the
distinction between path- and manner-motion in an operational semantics, and
further distinguish different types of manner-of-motion verbs in terms of the
mereo-topological relations that hold throughout the process of movement. From
these representations, we generate minimal models, which are realized as
three-dimensional simulations in software developed with the game engine,
Unity. The generated simulations act as a conceptual &quot;debugger&quot; for the
semantics of different motion verbs: that is, by testing for consistency and
informativeness in the model, simulations expose the presuppositions associated
with linguistic expressions and their compositions. Because the model
generation component is still incomplete, this paper focuses on an
implementation which maps directly from linguistic interpretations into the
Unity code snippets that create the simulations.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays a lot of data is collected in online forums. One of the key tasks is
to determine the social structure of these online groups, for example the
identification of subgroups within a larger group. We will approach the
grouping of individual as a classification problem. The classifier will be
based on fuzzy logic. The input to the classifier will be linguistic features
and degree of relationships (among individuals). The output of the classifiers
are the groupings of individuals. We also incorporate a method that ranks the
members of the detected subgroup to identify the hierarchies in each subgroup.
Data from the HBO television show The Wire is used to analyze the efficacy and
usefulness of fuzzy logic based methods as alternative methods to classical
statistical methods usually used for these problems. The proposed methodology
could detect automatically the most influential members of each organization

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce Symbolic Alternating Finite Automata (s-AFA) as an expressive,
succinct, and decidable model for describing sets of finite sequences over
arbitrary alphabets. Boolean operations over s-AFAs have linear complexity,
which is in sharp contrast with the quadratic cost of intersection and union
for non-alternating symbolic automata. Due to this succinctness, emptiness and
equivalence checking are PSpace-hard.
  We introduce an algorithm for checking the equivalence of two s-AFAs based on
bisimulation up to congruence. This algorithm allows us to exploit the power of
SAT and SMT solvers to efficiently search the state space of the s-AFAs. We
evaluate our decision procedure on two verification and security applications:
1) checking satisfiability of linear temporal logic formulas over finite
traces, and 2) checking equivalence of Boolean combinations of regular
expressions. Our experiments show that our technique often outperforms existing
techniques and it can be beneficial in both such applications.

 <dc:description>  Machine-type devices (MTDs) will lie at the heart of the Internet of Things
(IoT) system. A key challenge in such a system is sharing network resources
between small MTDs, which have limited memory and computational capabilities.
In this paper, a novel learning \emph{with finite memory} framework is proposed
to enable MTDs to effectively learn about each others message state, so as to
properly adapt their transmission parameters. In particular, an IoT system in
which MTDs can transmit both delay tolerant, periodic messages and critical
alarm messages is studied. For this model, the characterization of the
exponentially growing delay for critical alarm messages and the convergence of
the proposed learning framework in an IoT are analyzed. Simulation results show
that the delay of critical alarm messages is significantly reduced up to $94\%$
with very minimal memory requirements. The results also show that the proposed
learning with finite memory framework is very effective in mitigating the
limiting factors of learning that prevent proper learning procedures.

 <dc:title>RedThreads: An Interface for Application-level Fault

 <dc:description>  In the presence of accelerated fault rates, which are projected to be the
norm on future exascale systems, it will become increasingly difficult for
high-performance computing (HPC) applications to accomplish useful computation.
Due to the fault-oblivious nature of current HPC programming paradigms and
execution environments, HPC applications are insufficiently equipped to deal
with errors. We believe that HPC applications should be enabled with
capabilities to actively search for and correct errors in their computations.
The redundant multithreading (RMT) approach offers lightweight replicated
execution streams of program instructions within the context of a single
application process. However, the use of complete redundancy incurs significant
overhead to the application performance.
  In this paper we present RedThreads, an interface that provides
application-level fault detection and correction based on RMT, but applies the
thread-level redundancy adaptively. We describe the RedThreads syntax and
semantics, and the supporting compiler infrastructure and runtime system. Our
approach enables application programmers to scope the extent of redundant
computation. Additionally, the runtime system permits the use of RMT to be
dynamically enabled, or disabled, based on the resiliency needs of the
application and the state of the system. Our experimental results demonstrate
how adaptive RMT exploits programmer insight and runtime inference to
dynamically navigate the trade-off space between an application's resilience
coverage and the associated performance overhead of redundant computation.

 <dc:description>  Semantic segmentation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) makes
great sense for pathology diagnosis and decision system of medical robots. The
multi-channel fMRI provides more information of the pathological features. But
the increased amount of data causes complexity in feature detections. This
paper proposes a principal component analysis (PCA)-aided fully convolutional
network to particularly deal with multi-channel fMRI. We transfer the learned
weights of contemporary classification networks to the segmentation task by
fine-tuning. The results of the convolutional network are compared with various
methods e.g. k-NN. A new labeling strategy is proposed to solve the semantic
segmentation problem with unclear boundaries. Even with a small-sized training
dataset, the test results demonstrate that our model outperforms other
pathological feature detection methods. Besides, its forward inference only
takes 90 milliseconds for a single set of fMRI data. To our knowledge, this is
the first time to realize pixel-wise labeling of multi-channel magnetic
resonance image using FCN.

 <dc:title>Towards Cognitive Exploration through Deep Reinforcement Learning for

 <dc:description>  Exploration in an unknown environment is the core functionality for mobile
robots. Learning-based exploration methods, including convolutional neural
networks, provide excellent strategies without human-designed logic for the
feature extraction. But the conventional supervised learning algorithms cost
lots of efforts on the labeling work of datasets inevitably. Scenes not
included in the training set are mostly unrecognized either. We propose a deep
reinforcement learning method for the exploration of mobile robots in an indoor
environment with the depth information from an RGB-D sensor only. Based on the
Deep Q-Network framework, the raw depth image is taken as the only input to
estimate the Q values corresponding to all moving commands. The training of the
network weights is end-to-end. In arbitrarily constructed simulation
environments, we show that the robot can be quickly adapted to unfamiliar
scenes without any man-made labeling. Besides, through analysis of receptive
fields of feature representations, deep reinforcement learning motivates the
convolutional networks to estimate the traversability of the scenes. The test
results are compared with the exploration strategies separately based on deep
learning or reinforcement learning. Even trained only in the simulated
environment, experimental results in real-world environment demonstrate that
the cognitive ability of robot controller is dramatically improved compared
with the supervised method. We believe it is the first time that raw sensor
information is used to build cognitive exploration strategy for mobile robots
through end-to-end deep reinforcement learning.

 <dc:title>Computer Network Defense Through Radial Wave Functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Malloy, Ian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The purpose of this research was to synthesize basic and fundamental findings
in quantum computing, as applied to the attack and defense of conventional
computer networks. The concept focuses on uses of radio waves as a shield for,
and attack against traditional computers. A logic bomb is analogous to a
landmine in a computer network, and if one was to implement it as non-trivial
mitigation, it will aid computer network defense. As has been seen in kinetic
warfare, the use of landmines has been devastating to geopolitical regions in
that they are severely difficult for a civilian to avoid triggering given the
unknown position of a landmine. Thus, the importance of understanding a logic
bomb is relevant and has corollaries to quantum mechanics as well. The research
synthesizes quantum logic phase shifts in certain respects using the Dynamic
Data Exchange protocol in software written for this work, as well as a C-NOT
gate applied to a virtual quantum circuit environment by implementing a Quantum
Fourier Transform. The research focus applies the principles of coherence and
entanglement from quantum physics, the concept of expert systems in artificial
intelligence, principles of prime number based cryptography with trapdoor
functions, and modeling radio wave propagation against an event from unknown
parameters. This comes as a program relying on the artificial intelligence
concept of an expert system in conjunction with trigger events for a trapdoor
function relying on infinite recursion, as well as system mechanics for
elliptic curve cryptography along orbital angular momenta. Here trapdoor both
denotes the form of cipher, as well as the implied relationship to logic bombs.

 <dc:description>  Sleep stages pattern provides important clues in diagnosing the presence of
sleep disorder. By analyzing sleep stages pattern and extracting its features
from EEG, EOG, and EMG signals, we can classify sleep stages. This study
presents a novel classification model for predicting sleep stages with a high
accuracy. The main idea is to combine the generative capability of Deep Belief
Network (DBN) with a discriminative ability and sequence pattern recognizing
capability of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM). We use DBN that is treated as an
automatic higher level features generator. The input to DBN is 28 &quot;handcrafted&quot;
features as used in previous sleep stages studies. We compared our method with
other techniques which combined DBN with Hidden Markov Model (HMM).In this
study, we exploit the sequence or time series characteristics of sleep dataset.
To the best of our knowledge, most of the present sleep analysis from
polysomnogram relies only on single instanced label (nonsequence) for
classification. In this study, we used two datasets: an open data set that is
treated as a benchmark; the other dataset is our sleep stages dataset
(available for download) to verify the results further. Our experiments showed
that the combination of DBN with LSTM gives better overall accuracy 98.75\%
(Fscore=0.9875) for benchmark dataset and 98.94\% (Fscore=0.9894) for MKG
dataset. This result is better than the state of the art of sleep stages
classification that was 91.31\%.

 <dc:description>  We derive a general formula of the minimum achievable rate for
fixed-to-variable length coding with a regular cost function by allowing the
error probability up to a constant $\varepsilon$. For a fixed-to-variable
length code, we call the set of source sequences that can be decoded without
error the dominant set of source sequences. For any two regular cost functions,
it is revealed that the dominant set of source sequences for a code attaining
the minimum achievable rate with a cost function is also the dominant set for a
code attaining the minimum achievable rate with the other cost function. We
also give a general formula of the second-order minimum achievable rate.

 <dc:description>  We consider collaborative graph exploration with a set of $k$ agents. All
agents start at a common vertex of an initially unknown graph and need to
collectively visit all other vertices. We assume agents are deterministic,
vertices are distinguishable, moves are simultaneous, and we allow agents to
communicate globally. For this setting, we give the first non-trivial lower
bounds that bridge the gap between small ($k \leq \sqrt n$) and large ($k \geq
n$) teams of agents. Remarkably, our bounds tightly connect to existing results
in both domains.
  First, we significantly extend a lower bound of $\Omega(\log k / \log\log k)$
by Dynia et al. on the competitive ratio of a collaborative tree exploration
strategy to the range $k \leq n \log^c n$ for any $c \in \mathbb{N}$. Second,
we provide a tight lower bound on the number of agents needed for any
competitive exploration algorithm. In particular, we show that any
collaborative tree exploration algorithm with $k = Dn^{1+o(1)}$ agents has a
competitive ratio of $\omega(1)$, while Dereniowski et al. gave an algorithm
with $k = Dn^{1+\varepsilon}$ agents and competitive ratio $O(1)$, for any
$\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and with $D$ denoting the diameter of the graph. Lastly, we
show that, for any exploration algorithm using $k = n$ agents, there exist
trees of arbitrarily large height $D$ that require $\Omega(D^2)$ rounds, and we
provide a simple algorithm that matches this bound for all trees.

 <dc:description>  In 2015, stroke was the number one cause of death in Indonesia. The majority
type of stroke is ischemic. The standard tool for diagnosing stroke is CT-Scan.
For developing countries like Indonesia, the availability of CT-Scan is very
limited and still relatively expensive. Because of the availability, another
device that potential to diagnose stroke in Indonesia is EEG. Ischemic stroke
occurs because of obstruction that can make the cerebral blood flow (CBF) on a
person with stroke has become lower than CBF on a normal person (control) so
that the EEG signal have a deceleration. On this study, we perform the ability
of 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) to construct classification model
that can distinguish the EEG and EOG stroke data from EEG and EOG control data.
To accelerate training process our model we use Batch Normalization. Involving
62 person data object and from leave one out the scenario with five times
repetition of measurement we obtain the average of accuracy 0.86 (F-Score
0.861) only at 200 epoch. This result is better than all over shallow and
popular classifiers as the comparator (the best result of accuracy 0.69 and
F-Score 0.72 ). The feature used in our study were only 24 handcrafted feature
with simple feature extraction process.

 <dc:description>  Civic Crowdfunding is emerging as a popular means to mobilize funding from
citizens for public projects. A popular mechanism deployed on civic
crowdfunding platforms is a provision point mechanism, wherein, the total
contributions must reach a predetermined threshold in order for the project to
be provisioned (undertaken). Such a mechanism may have multiple equilibria;
unfortunately, in many of these equilibria, the project is not funded even if
it is highly valued among the agents. Recent work has proposed mechanisms with
refund bonuses where the project gets funded in equilibrium if its net value is
higher than a threshold among the agents who are aware of the crowdfunding
effort. In this paper, we formalize the notion of social desirability of a
public project and propose mechanisms which use the idea of referrals to expand
the pool of participants and achieve an equilibrium in which the project gets
funded if its net value exceeds a threshold among the entire agent population.
We call this new class of mechanisms Referral-Embedded Provision Point
Mechanisms (REPPM). We specifically propose two variants of REPPM and both
these mechanisms have the remarkable property that, at equilibrium, referral
bonuses are offered but there is no need for actual payment of these bonuses.
We establish that any given agent's equilibrium strategy is to refer other
agents and to contribute in proportion to the agent's true value for the
project. By referring others to contribute, an agent can, in fact, reduce his
equilibrium contribution. In our view, the proposed mechanisms will lead to an
increase in the number of projects that are funded on civic crowdfunding
platforms.

 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency has become one of the top design criteria for current
computing systems. The dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been
widely adopted by laptop computers, servers, and mobile devices to conserve
energy, while the GPU DVFS is still at a certain early age. This paper aims at
exploring the impact of GPU DVFS on the application performance and power
consumption, and furthermore, on energy conservation. We survey the
state-of-the-art GPU DVFS characterizations, and then summarize recent research
works on GPU power and performance models. We also conduct real GPU DVFS
experiments on NVIDIA Fermi and Maxwell GPUs. According to our experimental
results, GPU DVFS has significant potential for energy saving. The effect of
scaling core voltage/frequency and memory voltage/frequency depends on not only
the GPU architectures, but also the characteristic of GPU applications.

 <dc:description>  Despite an extensive literature has been devoted to mine and model mobility
features, forecasting where, when and whom people will encounter/colocate still
deserve further research efforts. Forecasting people's encounter and colocation
features is the key point for the success of many applications ranging from
epidemiology to the design of new networking paradigms and services such as
delay tolerant and opportunistic networks. While many algorithms which rely on
both mobility and social information have been proposed, we propose a novel
encounter and colocation predictive model which predicts user's encounter and
colocation events and their features by exploiting the spatio-temporal
regularity in the history of these events. We adopt weighted features Bayesian
predictor and evaluate its accuracy on two large scales WiFi and cellular
datasets. Results show that our approach could improve prediction accuracy
w.r.t standard naive Bayesian and some of the state-of-the-art predictors.

 <dc:description>  This study uses remote sensing technology that can provide information about
the condition of the earth's surface area, fast, and spatially. The study area
was in Karawang District, lying in the Northern part of West Java-Indonesia. We
address a paddy growth stages classification using LANDSAT 8 image data
obtained from multi-sensor remote sensing image taken in October 2015 to August
2016. This study pursues a fast and accurate classification of paddy growth
stages by employing multiple regularizations learning on some deep learning
methods such as DNN (Deep Neural Networks) and 1-D CNN (1-D Convolutional
Neural Networks). The used regularizations are Fast Dropout, Dropout, and Batch
Normalization. To evaluate the effectiveness, we also compared our method with
other machine learning methods such as (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random
Forest, and XGBoost). The data used are seven bands of LANDSAT-8 spectral data
samples that correspond to paddy growth stages data obtained from i-Sky (eye in
the sky) Innovation system. The growth stages are determined based on paddy
crop phenology profile from time series of LANDSAT-8 images. The classification
results show that MLP using multiple regularization Dropout and Batch
Normalization achieves the highest accuracy for this dataset.

 <dc:description>  Audio tagging aims to assign one or several tags to an audio clip. Most of
the datasets are weakly labelled, which means only the tags of the clip are
known, without knowing the occurrence time of the tags. The labeling of an
audio clip is often based on the audio events in the clip and no event level
label is provided to the user. Previous works have used the bag of frames model
assume the tags occur all the time, which is not the case in practice. We
propose a joint detection-classification (JDC) model to detect and classify the
audio clip simultaneously. The JDC model has the ability to attend to
informative and ignore uninformative sounds. Then only informative regions are
used for classification. Experimental results on the &quot;CHiME Home&quot; dataset show
that the JDC model reduces the equal error rate (EER) from 19.0% to 16.9%. More
interestingly, the audio event detector is trained successfully without needing
the event level label.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose to represent a scene as an abstraction of 'things'.
We start from 'things' as generated by modern object proposals, and we
investigate their immediately observable properties: position, size, aspect
ratio and color, and those only. Where the recent successes and excitement of
the field lie in object identification, we represent the scene composition
independent of object identities. We make three contributions in this work.
First, we study simple observable properties of 'things', and call it things
syntax. Second, we propose translating the things syntax in linguistic abstract
statements and study their descriptive effect to retrieve scenes. Thirdly, we
propose querying of scenes with abstract block illustrations and study their
effectiveness to discriminate among different types of scenes. The benefit of
abstract statements and block illustrations is that we generate them directly
from the images, without any learning beforehand as in the standard attribute
learning. Surprisingly, we show that even though we use the simplest of
features from 'things' layout and no learning at all, we can still retrieve
scenes reasonably well.

 <dc:description>  The rapid growth of emerging information technologies and application
patterns in modern society, e.g., Internet, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing
and Tri-network Convergence, has caused the advent of the era of big data. Big
data contains huge values, however, mining knowledge from big data is a
tremendously challenging task because of data uncertainty and inconsistency.
Attribute reduction (also known as feature selection) can not only be used as
an effective preprocessing step, but also exploits the data redundancy to
reduce the uncertainty. However, existing solutions are designed 1) either for
a single machine that means the entire data must fit in the main memory and the
parallelism is limited; 2) or for the Hadoop platform which means that the data
have to be loaded into the distributed memory frequently and therefore become
inefficient. In this paper, we overcome these shortcomings for maximum
efficiency possible, and propose a unified framework for Parallel Large-scale
Attribute Reduction, termed PLAR, for big data analysis. PLAR consists of three
components: 1) Granular Computing (GrC)-based initialization: it converts a
decision table (i.e., original data representation) into a granularity
representation which reduces the amount of space and hence can be easily cached
in the distributed memory: 2) model-parallelism: it simultaneously evaluates
all feature candidates and makes attribute reduction highly parallelizable; 3)
data-parallelism: it computes the significance of an attribute in parallel
using a MapReduce-style manner. We implement PLAR with four representative
heuristic feature selection algorithms on Spark, and evaluate them on various
huge datasets, including UCI and astronomical datasets, finding our method's
advantages beyond existing solutions.

 <dc:title>What are teachers interested in toward educational examples? A study of

 <dc:description>  This article reports on a case study on teachers' video-enhanced education.
Considering the fact that video exemplification is a thriving practice in the
field although there is little consensus in the literature regarding its
instructional issues, it seems appropriate to focus on the activity carried out
by teachers in video-enhanced devices in order to identify promising
characteristics (nature of the examples, types of associations between them,
documentation methods, organization and scenarization, etc.). This study
involved six trainees who used, during two sessions of 45 minutes, a digital
device based on a &quot; pedagogy of typical professional paths &quot; (Durand, 2014; Ria
\&amp; Leblanc, 2011). The goal was to better understand their use of video
exemplification and sense-making. The results indicate that student teachers
(i) preferentially target resources about &quot;economic rules&quot;; (ii) plebiscite
classroom situations, always consulted; (iii) are particularly interested (even
if they are sometimes disappointed) in the experts' testimonies; (iv) initially
show a distrust toward resources assumed to be theoretical; (v) get gradually
interested in these resources during the second session. We conclude with
several empirical and technological prospects for the design of video-enhanced
devices for teacher induction.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new compressive imaging method for reconstructing 2D or 3D
objects from their scattered wave-field measurements. Our method relies on a
novel, nonlinear measurement model that can account for the multiple scattering
phenomenon, which makes the method preferable in applications where linear
measurement models are inaccurate. We construct the measurement model by
expanding the scattered wave-field with an accelerated-gradient method, which
is guaranteed to converge and is suitable for large-scale problems. We provide
explicit formulas for computing the gradient of our measurement model with
respect to the unknown image, which enables image formation with a sparsity-
driven numerical optimization algorithm. We validate the method both
analytically and with numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  We study to what extend Chinese, Japanese and Korean faces can be classified
and which facial attributes offer the most important cues. First, we propose a
novel way of obtaining large numbers of facial images with nationality labels.
Then we train state-of-the-art neural networks with these labeled images. We
are able to achieve an accuracy of 75.03% in the classification task, with
chances being 33.33% and human accuracy 38.89% . Further, we train multiple
facial attribute classifiers to identify the most distinctive features for each
group. We find that Chinese, Japanese and Koreans do exhibit substantial
differences in certain attributes, such as bangs, smiling, and bushy eyebrows.
Along the way, we uncover several gender-related cross-country patterns as
well. Our work, which complements existing APIs such as Microsoft Cognitive
Services and Face++, could find potential applications in tourism, e-commerce,
social media marketing, criminal justice and even counter-terrorism.

 <dc:description>  An emerging challenge in the online classification of social media data
streams is to keep the categories used for classification up-to-date. In this
paper, we propose an innovative framework based on an Expert-Machine-Crowd
(EMC) triad to help categorize items by continuously identifying novel concepts
in heterogeneous data streams often riddled with outliers. We unify constrained
clustering and outlier detection by formulating a novel optimization problem:
COD-Means. We design an algorithm to solve the COD-Means problem and show that
COD-Means will not only help detect novel categories but also seamlessly
discover human annotation errors and improve the overall quality of the
categorization process. Experiments on diverse real data sets demonstrate that
our approach is both effective and efficient.

 <dc:description>  The distortion varieties of a given projective variety are parametrized by
duplicating coordinates and multiplying them with monomials. We study their
degrees and defining equations. Exact formulas are obtained for the case of
one-parameter distortions. These are based on Chow polytopes and Gr\&quot;obner
bases. Multi-parameter distortions are studied using tropical geometry. The
motivation for distortion varieties comes from multi-view geometry in computer
vision. Our theory furnishes a new framework for formulating and solving
minimal problems for camera models with image distortion.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by real world examples, e.g. the Internet, researchers have
introduced an abundance of strategic games to study natural phenomena in
networks. Unfortunately, almost all of these games have the conceptual drawback
of being computationally intractable, i.e. computing a best response strategy
or checking if an equilibrium is reached is NP-hard. Thus, a main challenge in
the field is to find tractable realistic network formation models.
  We address this challenge by investigating a very recently introduced model
by Goyal et al. [WINE'16] which focuses on robust networks in the presence of a
strong adversary who attacks (and kills) nodes in the network and lets this
attack spread virus-like to neighboring nodes and their neighbors. Our main
result is to establish that this natural model is one of the few exceptions
which are both realistic and computationally tractable. In particular, we
answer an open question of Goyal et al. by providing an efficient algorithm for
computing a best response strategy, which implies that deciding whether the
game has reached a Nash equilibrium can be done efficiently as well. Our
algorithm essentially solves the problem of computing a minimal connection to a
network which maximizes the reachability while hedging against severe attacks
on the network infrastructure and may thus be of independent interest.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we apply an equivalent color transform (ECT) for a minimal
$k$-coloring of any graph $G$. It contracts each color class of the graph to a
single vertex and produces a complete graph $K_k$ for $G$ by removing redundant
edges between any two vertices. Based on ECT, a simple proof for four color
theorem for planar graph is then proposed.

 <dc:description>  Word embeddings have been demonstrated to benefit NLP tasks impressively.
Yet, there is room for improvement in the vector representations, because
current word embeddings typically contain unnecessary information, i.e., noise.
We propose two novel models to improve word embeddings by unsupervised
learning, in order to yield word denoising embeddings. The word denoising
embeddings are obtained by strengthening salient information and weakening
noise in the original word embeddings, based on a deep feed-forward neural
network filter. Results from benchmark tasks show that the filtered word
denoising embeddings outperform the original word embeddings.

 <dc:title>A framework for small but rich vehicle routing problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider a 2-vehicle routing problem which can be viewed as
a building block for the varieties of the vehicle routing problems (VRPs). To
approach this problem, we suggest a framework based on the Held and Karp
dynamic programming algorithm for the classical travelling salesman problem. An
algorithm based on this framework shows an exceptionally good performance on
published test data. Our approach can be easily extended to a variety of
constraints/attributes in the VRP, hence the wording &quot;small but rich&quot; in the
title of our paper.

 <dc:description>  One essential task in information extraction from the medical corpus is drug
name recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the
medical text is special and has unique characteristics. In addition, the
medical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the
fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same
drug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset
sources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a
single drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although
many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems
remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a
new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those
challenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the
characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word
embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN
model, i.e., MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). The second technique involves two
deep network classifiers, i.e., DBN (Deep Belief Networks), and SAE (Stacked
Denoising Encoders). The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence
that is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, i.e., LSTM (Long Short Term
Memory). In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the
best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average
F-score being 0.8645.

 <dc:description>  We consider a gossip approach for finding a Nash equilibrium in a distributed
multi-player network game. We extend previous results on Nash equilibrium
seeking to the case when the players' cost functions may be affected by the
actions of any subset of players. An interference graph is employed to
illustrate the partially-coupled cost functions and the asymmetric information
requirements. For a given interference graph, we design a generalized
communication graph so that players with possibly partially-coupled cost
functions exchange only their required information and make decisions based on
them. Using a set of standard assumptions on the cost functions, interference
and communication graphs, we prove almost sure convergence to a Nash
equilibrium for diminishing step sizes. We then quantify the effect of the
second largest eigenvalue of the expected communication matrix on the
convergence rate, and illustrate the trade-off between the parameters
associated with the communication and the interference graphs. Finally, the
efficacy of the proposed algorithm on a large-scale networked game is
demonstrated via simulation.

 <dc:title>Distance rationalization of anonymous and homogeneous voting rules</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>91B12</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The concept of distance rationalizability of voting rules has been explored
in recent years by several authors. Most previous work has dealt with a
definition in terms of preference profiles. However, most voting rules in
common use are anonymous and homogeneous. In this case there is a much more
succinct representation (using the voting simplex) of the inputs to the rule.
This representation has been widely used in the voting literature, but rarely
in the context of distance rationalizability.
  Recently, the present authors showed, as a special case of general results on
quotient spaces, exactly how to connect distance rationalizability on profiles
for anonymous and homogeneous rules to geometry in the simplex. In this article
we develop the connection for the important special case of votewise distances,
recently introduced and studied by Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko in several
papers. This yields a direct interpretation in terms of well-developed
mathematical topics not seen before in the voting literature, namely
Kantorovich (also called Wasserstein) distances and the geometry of Minkowski
spaces.
  As an application of this approach, we prove some positive and some negative
results about the decisiveness of distance rationalizable anonymous and
homogeneous rules. The positive results connect with the recent theory of
hyperplane rules, while the negative ones deal with distances that are not
metrics, controversial notions of consensus, and the fact that the
$\ell^1$-norm is not strictly convex.
  We expect that the above novel geometric interpretation will aid the analysis
of rules defined by votewise distances, and the discovery of new rules with
desirable properties.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for discriminative Information Retrieval (IR) atop

candidate passage retrieval, the initial step in text-based Question Answering
(QA). We formalize this as an instance of linear feature-based IR (Metzler and

captured under this approach, leading to a 44% improvement in recall for
candidate triage for QA.

 <dc:subject>91B12</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The concept of distance rationalizability of social choice rules has been
explored in recent years by several authors. We deal here with several
foundational questions, and unify, correct, and generalize previous work. For
example, we study a new question involving uniqueness of representation in the
distance rationalizability framework, and present a counterexample.
  For rules satisfying various axiomatic properties such as anonymity,
neutrality and homogeneity, the standard profile representation of input can be
compressed substantially. We explain in detail using quotient constructions and
symmetry groups how distance rationalizability is interpreted in this
situation. This enables us to connect the theory of distance rationalizability
with geometric concepts such as Earth Mover distance and optimal
transportation. We expect this connection to prove fruitful in future work.
  We improve on the best-known sufficient conditions for rules rationalized via
votewise distances to satisfy anonymity, neutrality, homogeneity, consistency
and continuity. This leads to a class of well-behaved rules which deserve
closer scrutiny in future.

 <dc:description>  Towards robust and convenient indoor shopping mall navigation, we propose a
novel learning-based scheme to utilize the high-level visual information from
the storefront images captured by personal devices of users. Specifically, we
decompose the visual navigation problem into localization and map generation
respectively. Given a storefront input image, a novel feature fusion scheme
(denoted as FusionNet) is proposed by fusing the distinguishing DNN-based
appearance feature and text feature for robust recognition of store brands,
which serves for accurate localization. Regarding the map generation, we
convert the user-captured indicator map of the shopping mall into a topological
map by parsing the stores and their connectivity. Experimental results
conducted on the real shopping malls demonstrate that the proposed system
achieves robust localization and precise map generation, enabling accurate
navigation.

 <dc:description>  Understanding expressions of emotions in support forums has considerable
value and NLP methods are key to automating this. Many approaches
understandably use subjective categories which are more fine-grained than a
straightforward polarity-based spectrum. However, the definition of such
categories is non-trivial and, in fact, we argue for a need to incorporate
communicative elements even beyond subjectivity. To support our position, we
report experiments on a sentiment-labelled corpus of posts taken from a medical
support forum. We argue that not only is a more fine-grained approach to text
analysis important, but simultaneously recognising the social function behind
affective expressions enable a more accurate and valuable level of
understanding.

 <dc:description>  Simon's problem is one of the most important problems demonstrating the power
of quantum computers, which achieves a large separation between quantum and
classical query complexities. However, Simon's discussion on his problem was
limited to bounded-error setting, which means his algorithm can not always get
the correct answer. Exact quantum algorithms for Simon's problem have also been
proposed, which deterministically solve the problem with O(n) queries. Also the
quantum lower bound \Omega(n) for Simon's problem is known. Although these
algorithms are either complicated or specialized, their results give an O(n)
versus \Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}) separation in exact query complexities for Simon's
problem (\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}) is the lower bound for classical probabilistic
algorithms), but it has not been proved whether this separation is optimal. In
this paper, we propose another exact quantum algorithm for solving Simon's
problem with O(n) queries, which is simple, concrete and does not rely on
special query oracles. Our algorithm combines Simon's algorithm with the
quantum amplitude amplification technique to ensure its determinism. In
particular, we show that Simon's problem can be solved by a classical
deterministic algorithm with O(\sqrt{2^{n}}) queries (as we are aware, there
were no classical deterministic algorithms for solving Simon's problem with
O(\sqrt{2^{n}}) queries). Combining some previous results, we obtain the
optimal separation in exact query complexities for Simon's problem: \Theta({n})
versus \Theta({\sqrt{2^{n}}}).

 <dc:description>  A machine learning method needs to adapt to over time changes in the
environment. Such changes are known as concept drift. In this paper, we propose
concept drift tackling method as an enhancement of Online Sequential Extreme
Learning Machine (OS-ELM) and Constructive Enhancement OS-ELM (CEOS-ELM) by
adding adaptive capability for classification and regression problem. The
scheme is named as adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM). It is a single classifier scheme
that works well to handle real drift, virtual drift, and hybrid drift. The
AOS-ELM also works well for sudden drift and recurrent context change type. The
scheme is a simple unified method implemented in simple lines of code. We
evaluated AOS-ELM on regression and classification problem by using concept
drift public data set (SEA and STAGGER) and other public data sets such as
MNIST, USPS, and IDS. Experiments show that our method gives higher kappa value
compared to the multiclassifier ELM ensemble. Even though AOS-ELM in practice
does not need hidden nodes increase, we address some issues related to the
increasing of the hidden nodes such as error condition and rank values. We
propose taking the rank of the pseudoinverse matrix as an indicator parameter
to detect underfitting condition.

 <dc:description>  A typical modern optimization technique is usually either heuristic or
metaheuristic. This technique has managed to solve some optimization problems
in the research area of science, engineering, and industry. However,
implementation strategy of metaheuristic for accuracy improvement on
convolution neural networks (CNN), a famous deep learning method, is still
rarely investigated. Deep learning relates to a type of machine learning
technique, where its aim is to move closer to the goal of artificial
intelligence of creating a machine that could successfully perform any
intellectual tasks that can be carried out by a human. In this paper, we
propose the implementation strategy of three popular metaheuristic approaches,
that is, simulated annealing, differential evolution, and harmony search, to
optimize CNN. The performances of these metaheuristic methods in optimizing CNN
on classifying MNIST and CIFAR dataset were evaluated and compared.
Furthermore, the proposed methods are also compared with the original CNN.
Although the proposed methods show an increase in the computation time, their
accuracy has also been improved (up to 7.14 percent).

 <dc:title>Harris's lopsidependency criterion can be stronger than Shearer's

 <dc:description>  The Lopsided Lov\'asz Local Lemma (LLLL) is a probabilistic tool which is a
cornerstone of the probabilistic method of combinatorics, which shows that it
is possible to avoid a collection of &quot;bad&quot; events as long as their
probabilities and interdependencies are sufficiently small. The strongest
possible criterion that can be stated in these terms is due to Shearer (1985),
although it is technically difficult to apply to constructions in
combinatorics.
  The original formulation of the LLLL was non-constructive, a seminal
algorithm of Moser &amp; Tardos (2010) gave an efficient constructive algorithm for
nearly all applications of it, including applications to $k$-SAT instances with
a bounded number of occurrences per variables. Harris (2015) later gave an
alternate criterion for this algorithm to converge, which appeared to give
stronger bounds than the standard LLL. Unlike the LLL criterion or its
variants, this criterion depends in a fundamental way on the decomposition of
bad-events into variables.
  In this note, we show that the criterion given by Harris can be stronger in
some cases even than Shearer's criterion. We construct $k$-SAT formulas with
bounded variable occurrence, and show that the criterion of Harris is satisfied
while the criterion of Shearer is violated. In fact, there is an exponentially
growing gap between the bounds provable from any form of the LLLL and from the
bound shown by Harris.

 <dc:description>  Trial-offer markets, where customers can sample a product before deciding
whether to buy it, are ubiquitous in the online experience. Their static and
dynamic properties are often studied by assuming that consumers follow a
multinomial logit model and try exactly one product. In this paper, we study
how to generalize existing results to a more realistic setting where consumers
can try multiple products. We show that a multinomial logit model with
continuation can be reduced to a standard multinomial logit model with
different appeal and product qualities. We examine the consequences of this
reduction on the performance and predictability of the market, the role of
social influence, and the ranking policies.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have proven to be quite effective in a wide variety of
machine learning tasks, ranging from improved speech recognition systems to
advancing the development of autonomous vehicles. However, despite their
superior performance in many applications, these models have been recently
shown to be susceptible to a particular type of attack possible through the
generation of particular synthetic examples referred to as adversarial samples.
These samples are constructed by manipulating real examples from the training
data distribution in order to &quot;fool&quot; the original neural model, resulting in
misclassification (with high confidence) of previously correctly classified
samples. Addressing this weakness is of utmost importance if deep neural
architectures are to be applied to critical applications, such as those in the
domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we present an analysis of this
fundamental flaw lurking in all neural architectures to uncover limitations of
previously proposed defense mechanisms. More importantly, we present a unifying
framework for protecting deep neural models using a non-invertible data
transformation--developing two adversary-resilient architectures utilizing both
linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Empirical results indicate that
our framework provides better robustness compared to state-of-art solutions
while having negligible degradation in accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Sleep signals from a polysomnographic database are sequences in nature.
Commonly employed analysis and classification methods, however, ignored this
fact and treated the sleep signals as non-sequence data. Treating the sleep
signals as sequences, this paper compared two powerful unsupervised feature
extractors and three sequence-based classifiers regarding accuracy and
computational (training and testing) time after 10-folds cross-validation. The
compared feature extractors are Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and Fuzzy C-Means
(FCM) clustering. Whereas the compared sequence-based classifiers are Hidden
Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and its variants, i.e.,
Hidden-state CRF (HCRF) and Latent-Dynamic CRF (LDCRF); and Conditional Neural
Fields (CNF) and its variant (LDCNF). In this study, we use two datasets. The
first dataset is an open (public) polysomnographic dataset downloadable from
the Internet, while the second dataset is our polysomnographic dataset (also
available for download). For the first dataset, the combination of FCM and CNF
gives the highest accuracy (96.75\%) with relatively short training time (0.33
hours). For the second dataset, the combination of DBN and CRF gives the
accuracy of 99.96\% but with 1.02 hours training time, whereas the combination
of DBN and CNF gives slightly less accuracy (99.69\%) but also less computation
time (0.89 hours).

 <dc:description>  The development of powerful 3D scanning hardware and reconstruction
algorithms has strongly promoted the generation of 3D surface reconstructions
in different domains. An area of special interest for such 3D reconstructions
is the cultural heritage domain, where surface reconstructions are generated to
digitally preserve historical artifacts. While reconstruction quality nowadays
is sufficient in many cases, the robust analysis (e.g. segmentation, matching,
and classification) of reconstructed 3D data is still an open topic. In this
paper, we target the automatic and interactive segmentation of high-resolution
3D surface reconstructions from the archaeological domain. To foster research
in this field, we introduce a fully annotated and publicly available
large-scale 3D surface dataset including high-resolution meshes, depth maps and
point clouds as a novel benchmark dataset to the community. We provide baseline
results for our existing random forest-based approach and for the first time
investigate segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on the data.
Results show that both approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses
and that the provided dataset represents a challenge for future research.

 <dc:description>  Both generative adversarial networks (GAN) in unsupervised learning and
actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning (RL) have gained a reputation
for being difficult to optimize. Practitioners in both fields have amassed a
large number of strategies to mitigate these instabilities and improve
training. Here we show that GANs can be viewed as actor-critic methods in an
environment where the actor cannot affect the reward. We review the strategies
for stabilizing training for each class of models, both those that generalize
between the two and those that are particular to that model. We also review a
number of extensions to GANs and RL algorithms with even more complicated
information flow. We hope that by highlighting this formal connection we will
encourage both GAN and RL communities to develop general, scalable, and stable
algorithms for multilevel optimization with deep networks, and to draw
inspiration across communities.

 <dc:description>  We consider the future cyber security of industrial control systems. As best
as we can see, much of this future unfolds in the context of the Internet of
Things (IoT). In fact, we envision that all industrial and infrastructure
environments, and cyber-physical systems in general, will take the form
reminiscent of what today is referred to as the IoT. IoT is envisioned as
multitude of heterogeneous devices densely interconnected and communicating
with the objective of accomplishing a diverse range of objectives, often
collaboratively. One can argue that in the relatively near future, the IoT
construct will subsume industrial plants, infrastructures, housing and other
systems that today are controlled by ICS and SCADA systems. In the IoT
environments, cybersecurity will derive largely from system agility,
moving-target defenses, cybermaneuvering, and other autonomous or
semi-autonomous behaviors. Cyber security of IoT may also benefit from new
design methods for mixed-trusted systems; and from big data analytics --
predictive and autonomous.

 <dc:description>  It was shown recently that the $K$ L1-norm principal components (L1-PCs) of a
real-valued data matrix $\mathbf X \in \mathbb R^{D \times N}$ ($N$ data
samples of $D$ dimensions) can be exactly calculated with cost
$\mathcal{O}(2^{NK})$ or, when advantageous, $\mathcal{O}(N^{dK - K + 1})$
where $d=\mathrm{rank}(\mathbf X)$, $K&lt;d$ [1],[2]. In applications where
$\mathbf X$ is large (e.g., &quot;big&quot; data of large $N$ and/or &quot;heavy&quot; data of
large $d$), these costs are prohibitive. In this work, we present a novel
suboptimal algorithm for the calculation of the $K &lt; d$ L1-PCs of $\mathbf X$
of cost $\mathcal O(ND \mathrm{min} \{ N,D\} + N^2(K^4 + dK^2) + dNK^3)$, which
is comparable to that of standard (L2-norm) PC analysis. Our theoretical and
experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm calculates the exact
optimal L1-PCs with high frequency and achieves higher value in the L1-PC
optimization metric than any known alternative algorithm of comparable
computational cost. The superiority of the calculated L1-PCs over standard
L2-PCs (singular vectors) in characterizing potentially faulty
data/measurements is demonstrated with experiments on data dimensionality
reduction and disease diagnosis from genomic data.

 <dc:title>Fast Hierarchy Construction for Dense Subgraphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sariyuce, A. Erdem</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pinar, Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Discovering dense subgraphs and understanding the relations among them is a
fundamental problem in graph mining. We want to not only identify dense
subgraphs, but also build a hierarchy among them (e.g., larger but sparser
subgraphs formed by two smaller dense subgraphs). Peeling algorithms (k-core,
k-truss, and nucleus decomposition) have been effective to locate many dense
subgraphs. However, constructing a hierarchical representation of density
structure, even correctly computing the connected k-cores and k-trusses, have
been mostly overlooked. Keeping track of connected components during peeling
requires an additional traversal operation, which is as expensive as the
peeling process. In this paper, we start with a thorough survey and point to
nuances in problem formulations that lead to significant differences in
runtimes. We then propose efficient and generic algorithms to construct the
hierarchy of dense subgraphs for k-core, k-truss, or any nucleus decomposition.
Our algorithms leverage the disjoint-set forest data structure to efficiently
construct the hierarchy during traversal. Furthermore, we introduce a new idea
to avoid traversal. We construct the subgraphs while visiting neighborhoods in
the peeling process, and build the relations to previously constructed
subgraphs. We also consider an existing idea to find the k-core hierarchy and
adapt for our objectives efficiently. Experiments on different types of large
scale real-world networks show significant speedups over naive algorithms and
existing alternatives. Our algorithms also outperform the hypothetical limits
of any possible traversal-based solution.

 <dc:description>  Many malware families utilize domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to
establish command and control (C&amp;C) connections. While there are many methods
to pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and
generating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible
means to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA
detection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce
names of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat
blind to new DGA variants.
  In this paper, we leverage the concept of generative adversarial networks to
construct a deep learning based DGA that is designed to intentionally bypass a
deep learning based detector. In a series of adversarial rounds, the generator
learns to generate domain names that are increasingly more difficult to detect.
In turn, a detector model updates its parameters to compensate for the
adversarially generated domains. We test the hypothesis of whether
adversarially generated domains may be used to augment training sets in order
to harden other machine learning models against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. We
detail solutions to several challenges in training this character-based
generative adversarial network (GAN). In particular, our deep learning
architecture begins as a domain name auto-encoder (encoder + decoder) trained
on domains in the Alexa one million. Then the encoder and decoder are
reassembled competitively in a generative adversarial network (detector +
generator), with novel neural architectures and training strategies to improve
convergence.

 <dc:description>  In this paper a mesoscopic hybrid model, i.e. a microscopic hybrid model that
takes into account macroscopic parameters, is introduced for designing a
human-inspired Adaptive Cruise Control. A control law is proposed with the
design goal of replacing and imitating the behaviour of a human driver in a
car-following situation where lane changes are possible. First, a microscopic
hybrid automaton model is presented, based on human psycho-physical behavior,
for both longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. Then a rule for changing
time headway on the basis of macroscopic quantities is used to describe the
interaction among next vehicles and their impact on driver performance.
Simulation results show the advantages of the mesoscopic model. A feasibility
analysis of the needed communication network is also presented.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the ability of a homogeneous collection of deferrable energy
loads to behave as a battery; that is, to absorb and release energy in a
controllable fashion up to fixed and predetermined limits on volume, charge
rate and discharge rate. We derive bounds on the battery capacity that can be
realized and show that there are fundamental trade-offs between battery
parameters. By characterizing the state trajectories under scheduling policies
that emulate two illustrative batteries, we show that the trade-offs occur
because the states that allow the loads to absorb and release energy at high
aggregate rates are conflicting.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of optimized beam alignment for wearable
device-to-device (D2D) communications over millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies is
studied. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between wearable
communication pairs that engage in D2D communications. In this game, wearable
devices acting as transmitters autonomously select the directions of their
beams so as to maximize the data rate to their receivers. To solve the game, an
algorithm based on best response dynamics is proposed that allows the
transmitters to reach a Nash equilibrium in a distributed manner. To further
improve the performance of mmW D2D communications, a novel quantum game model
is formulated to enable the wearable devices to exploit new quantum directions
during their beam alignment so as to further enhance their data rate.
Simulation results show that the proposed game-theoretic approach improves the
performance, in terms of data rate, of about 75% compared to a uniform beam
alignment. The results also show that the quantum game model can further yield
up to 20% improvement in data rates, relative to the classical game approach.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning has rapidly transformed the state of the art algorithms used to
address a variety of problems in computer vision and robotics. These
breakthroughs have relied upon massive amounts of human annotated training
data. This time consuming process has begun impeding the progress of these deep
learning efforts. This paper describes a method to incorporate photo-realistic
computer images from a simulation engine to rapidly generate annotated data
that can be used for the training of machine learning algorithms. We
demonstrate that a state of the art architecture, which is trained only using
these synthetic annotations, performs better than the identical architecture
trained on human annotated real-world data, when tested on the KITTI data set
for vehicle detection. By training machine learning algorithms on a rich
virtual world, real objects in real scenes can be learned and classified using
synthetic data. This approach offers the possibility of accelerating deep
learning's application to sensor-based classification problems like those that
appear in self-driving cars. The source code and data to train and validate the
networks described in this paper are made available for researchers.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods with continuous actions
are playing a prominent role when dealing with real-world applications such as
Robotics. However, when confronted to non-stationary environments, these
methods crucially rely on an exploration-exploitation trade-off which is rarely
dynamically and automatically adjusted to changes in the environment. Here we
propose an active exploration algorithm for RL in structured (parameterized)
continuous action space. This framework deals with a set of discrete actions,
each of which is parameterized with continuous variables. Discrete exploration
is controlled through a Boltzmann softmax function with an inverse temperature
$\beta$ parameter. In parallel, a Gaussian exploration is applied to the
continuous action parameters. We apply a meta-learning algorithm based on the
comparison between variations of short-term and long-term reward running
averages to simultaneously tune $\beta$ and the width of the Gaussian
distribution from which continuous action parameters are drawn. When applied to
a simple virtual human-robot interaction task, we show that this algorithm
outperforms continuous parameterized RL both without active exploration and
with active exploration based on uncertainty variations measured by a
Kalman-Q-learning algorithm.

 <dc:title>Fundamental properties of solutions to utility maximization problems in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We introduce a unified framework for the study of the utility and the energy
efficiency of solutions to a large class of weighted max-min utility
maximization problems in interference-coupled wireless networks. In more
detail, given a network utility maximization problem parameterized by a maximum
power budget $\bar{p}$ available to network elements, we define two functions
that map the power budget $\bar{p}$ to the energy efficiency and to the utility
achieved by the solution. Among many interesting properties, we prove that
these functions are continuous and monotonic. In addition, we derive bounds
revealing that the solutions to utility maximization problems are characterized
by a low and a high power regime. In the low power regime, the energy
efficiency of the solution can decrease slowly as the power budget increases,
and the network utility grows linearly at best. In contrast, in the high power
regime, the energy efficiency typically scales as $\Theta(1/\bar{p})$ as
$\bar{p}\to\infty$, and the network utility scales as $\Theta(1)$. We apply the
theoretical findings to a novel weighted rate maximization problem involving
the joint optimization of the uplink power and the base station assignment.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Delay Pruning, a simple yet powerful technique to regularize
dynamic Boltzmann machines (DyBM). The recently introduced DyBM provides a
particularly structured Boltzmann machine, as a generative model of a
multi-dimensional time-series. This Boltzmann machine can have infinitely many
layers of units but allows exact inference and learning based on its
biologically motivated structure. DyBM uses the idea of conduction delays in
the form of fixed length first-in first-out (FIFO) queues, with a neuron
connected to another via this FIFO queue, and spikes from a pre-synaptic neuron
travel along the queue to the post-synaptic neuron with a constant period of
delay. Here, we present Delay Pruning as a mechanism to prune the lengths of
the FIFO queues (making them zero) by setting some delay lengths to one with a
fixed probability, and finally selecting the best performing model with fixed
delays. The uniqueness of structure and a non-sampling based learning rule in
DyBM, make the application of previously proposed regularization techniques
like Dropout or DropConnect difficult, leading to poor generalization. First,
we evaluate the performance of Delay Pruning to let DyBM learn a
multidimensional temporal sequence generated by a Markov chain. Finally, we
show the effectiveness of delay pruning in learning high dimensional sequences
using the moving MNIST dataset, and compare it with Dropout and DropConnect
methods.

 <dc:title>Scalable Machine Translation in Memory Constrained Environments</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Baltescu, Paul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Machine translation is the discipline concerned with developing automated
tools for translating from one human language to another. Statistical machine
translation (SMT) is the dominant paradigm in this field. In SMT, translations
are generated by means of statistical models whose parameters are learned from
bilingual data. Scalability is a key concern in SMT, as one would like to make
use of as much data as possible to train better translation systems.
  In recent years, mobile devices with adequate computing power have become
widely available. Despite being very successful, mobile applications relying on
NLP systems continue to follow a client-server architecture, which is of
limited use because access to internet is often limited and expensive. The goal
of this dissertation is to show how to construct a scalable machine translation
system that can operate with the limited resources available on a mobile
device.
  The main challenge for porting translation systems on mobile devices is
memory usage. The amount of memory available on a mobile device is far less
than what is typically available on the server side of a client-server
application. In this thesis, we investigate alternatives for the two components
which prevent standard translation systems from working on mobile devices due
to high memory usage. We show that once these standard components are replaced
with our proposed alternatives, we obtain a scalable translation system that
can work on a device with limited memory.

 <dc:description>  This article is about a decoding algorithm for error-correcting subspace
codes. A version of this algorithm was previously described by Rosenthal,
Silberstein and Trautmann. The decoding algorithm requires the code to be
defined as the intersection of the Pl\&quot;ucker embedding of the Grassmannian and
an algebraic variety. We call such codes \emph{geometric subspace codes}.
Complexity is substantially improved compared to the algorithm by Rosenthal,
Silberstein and Trautmann and connections to finite geometry are given. The
decoding algorithm is applied to Desarguesian spread codes, which are known to
be defined as the intersection of the Pl\&quot;ucker embedding of the Grassmannian
with a linear space.

The increases in size and complexity of power systems have cast a shadow on
efficiency of conventional method. New control strategies have been proposed in

 <dc:description>  The rise of multi-million-item dataset initiatives has enabled data-hungry
machine learning algorithms to reach near-human semantic classification at
tasks such as object and scene recognition. Here we describe the Places
Database, a repository of 10 million scene photographs, labeled with scene
semantic categories and attributes, comprising a quasi-exhaustive list of the
types of environments encountered in the world. Using state of the art
Convolutional Neural Networks, we provide impressive baseline performances at
scene classification. With its high-coverage and high-diversity of exemplars,
the Places Database offers an ecosystem to guide future progress on currently
intractable visual recognition problems.

 <dc:title>Constant Approximation Algorithm for Non-Uniform Capacitated Multi-Item
  Lot-Sizing via Strong Covering Inequalities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Shi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the non-uniform capacitated multi-item lot-sizing (\lotsizing)
problem. In this problem, there is a set of demands over a planning horizon of
$T$ time periods and all demands must be satisfied on time. We can place an
order at the beginning of each period $s$, incurring an ordering cost $K_s$.
The total quantity of all products ordered at time $s$ can not exceed a given
capacity $C_s$. On the other hand, carrying inventory from time to time incurs
inventory holding cost. The goal of the problem is to find a feasible solution
that minimizes the sum of ordering and holding costs.
  Levi et al.\ (Levi, Lodi and Sviridenko, Mathmatics of Operations Research
33(2), 2008) gave a 2-approximation for the problem when the capacities $C_s$
are the same. In this paper, we extend their result to the case of non-uniform
capacities. That is, we give a constant approximation algorithm for the
capacitated multi-item lot-sizing problem with general capacities.
  The constant approximation is achieved by adding an exponentially large set
of new covering inequalities to the natural facility-location type linear
programming relaxation for the problem. Along the way of our algorithm, we
reduce the \lotsizing problem to two generalizations of the classic knapsack
covering problem. We give LP-based constant approximation algorithms for both
generalizations, via the iterative rounding technique.

 <dc:description>  The mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school on December 14, 2012
catalyzed a year of active debate and legislation on gun control in the United
States. Social media hosted an active public discussion where people expressed
their support and opposition to a variety of issues surrounding gun
legislation. In this paper, we show how a content-based analysis of Twitter
data can provide insights and understanding into this debate. We estimate the
relative support and opposition to gun control measures, along with a topic
analysis of each camp by analyzing over 70 million gun-related tweets from
2013. We focus on spikes in conversation surrounding major events related to
guns throughout the year. Our general approach can be applied to other
important public health and political issues to analyze the prevalence and
nature of public opinion.

 <dc:title>Towards an Autonomous System Monitor for Mitigating Correlation Attacks
  in the Tor Network</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hoang, Nguyen Phong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  After carefully considering the scalability problem in Tor and exhaustively
evaluating related works on AS-level adversaries, the author proposes
ASmoniTor, which is an autonomous system monitor for mitigating correlation
attacks in the Tor network. In contrast to prior works, which often released
offline packets, including the source code of a modified Tor client and a
snapshot of the Internet topology, ASmoniTor is an online system that assists
end users with mitigating the threat of AS-level adversaries in a near
real-time fashion. For Tor clients proposed in previous works, users need to
compile the source code on their machine and continually update the snapshot of
the Internet topology in order to obtain accurate AS-path inferences. On the
contrary, ASmoniTor is an online platform that can be utilized easily by not
only technical users, but also by users without a technical background, because
they only need to access it via Tor and input two parameters to execute an
AS-aware path selection algorithm. With ASmoniTor, the author makes three key
technical contributions to the research against AS-level adversaries in the Tor
network. First, ASmoniTor does not require the users to initiate complicated
source code compilations. Second, it helps to reduce errors in AS-path
inferences by letting users input a set of suspected ASes obtained directly
from their own traceroute measurements. Third, the Internet topology database
at the back-end of ASmoniTor is periodically updated to assure near real-time
AS-path inferences between Tor exit nodes and the most likely visited websites.
Finally, in addition to its convenience, ASmoniTor gives users full control
over the information they want to input, thus preserving their privacy.

 <dc:title>A Hybrid Sampling Scheme for Triangle Counting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kallaugher, John</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Price, Eric</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of estimating the number of triangles in a graph stream.
No streaming algorithm can get sublinear space on all graphs, so methods in
this area bound the space in terms of parameters of the input graph such as the
maximum number of triangles sharing a single edge. We give a sampling algorithm
that is additionally parameterized by the maximum number of triangles sharing a
single vertex. Our bound matches the best known turnstile results in all
graphs, and gets better performance on simple graphs like $G(n, p)$ or a set of
independent triangles.
  We complement the upper bound with a lower bound showing that no sampling
algorithm can do better on those graphs by more than a log factor. In
particular, any insertion stream algorithm must use $\sqrt{T}$ space when all
the triangles share a common vertex, and any sampling algorithm must take
$T^\frac{1}{3}$ samples when all the triangles are independent. We add another
lower bound, also matching our algorithm's performance, which applies to all
graph classes. This lower bound covers &quot;triangle-dependent&quot; sampling
algorithms, a subclass that includes our algorithm and all previous sampling
algorithms for the problem.
  Finally, we show how to generalize our algorithm to count arbitrary subgraphs
of constant size.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of smart grid energy management under stochastic
dynamics is investigated. In the considered model, at the demand side, it is
assumed that customers can act as prosumers who own renewable energy sources
and can both produce and consume energy. Due to the coupling between the
prosumers' decisions and the stochastic nature of renewable energy, the
interaction among prosumers is formulated as a stochastic game, in which each
prosumer seeks to maximize its payoff, in terms of revenues, by controlling its
energy consumption and demand. In particular, the subjective behavior of
prosumers is explicitly reflected into their payoff functions using prospect
theory, a powerful framework that allows modeling real-life human choices. For
this prospect-based stochastic game, it is shown that there always exists a
stationary Nash equilibrium where the prosumers' trading policies in the
equilibrium are independent of the time and their histories of the play.
Moreover, a novel distributed algorithm with no information sharing among
prosumers is proposed and shown to converge to an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.
On the other hand, at the supply side, the interaction between the utility
company and the prosumers is formulated as an online optimization problem in
which the utility company's goal is to learn its optimal energy allocation
rules. For this case, it is shown that such an optimization problem admits a
no-regret algorithm meaning that regardless of the actual outcome of the game
among the prosumers, the utility company can follow a strategy that mitigates
its allocation costs as if it knew the entire demand market a priori.
Simulation results show the convergence of the proposed algorithms to their
predicted outcomes and present new insights resulting from prospect theory that
contribute toward more efficient energy management in the smart grids.

 <dc:description>  We initiate a line of investigation into biological neural networks from an
algorithmic perspective. We develop a simplified but biologically plausible
model for distributed computation in stochastic spiking neural networks and
study tradeoffs between computation time and network complexity in this model.
Our aim is to abstract real neural networks in a way that, while not capturing
all interesting features, preserves high-level behavior and allows us to make
biologically relevant conclusions.
  In this paper, we focus on the important `winner-take-all' (WTA) problem,
which is analogous to a neural leader election unit: a network consisting of
$n$ input neurons and $n$ corresponding output neurons must converge to a state
in which a single output corresponding to a firing input (the `winner') fires,
while all other outputs remain silent. Neural circuits for WTA rely on
inhibitory neurons, which suppress the activity of competing outputs and drive
the network towards a converged state with a single firing winner. We attempt
to understand how the number of inhibitors used affects network convergence
time.
  We show that it is possible to significantly outperform naive WTA
constructions through a more refined use of inhibition, solving the problem in
$O(\theta)$ rounds in expectation with just $O(\log^{1/\theta} n)$ inhibitors
for any $\theta$. An alternative construction gives convergence in
$O(\log^{1/\theta} n)$ rounds with $O(\theta)$ inhibitors. We compliment these
upper bounds with our main technical contribution, a nearly matching lower
bound for networks using $\ge \log\log n$ inhibitors. Our lower bound uses
familiar indistinguishability and locality arguments from distributed computing
theory. It lets us derive a number of interesting conclusions about the
structure of any network solving WTA with good probability, and the use of
randomness and inhibition within such a network.

 <dc:description>  Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk
for several chronic diseases. Although this knowledge is widely recognized,
adults and children in many countries around the world do not get recommended
amounts of physical activity. While many interventions are found to be
ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations,
there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due to novel
mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent and
salient example of such a game is Pok\'emon Go, which has reportedly reached
tens of millions of users in the US and worldwide.
  We study the effect of Pok\'emon Go on physical activity through a
combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and
search engine logs for 32 thousand users over a period of three months.
Pok\'emon Go players are identified through search engine queries and activity
is measured through accelerometry. We find that Pok\'emon Go leads to
significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with
particularly engaged users (i.e., those making multiple search queries for
details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on
average, a more than 25% increase compared to their prior activity level
($p&lt;10^{-15}$). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pok\'emon
Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore,
Pok\'emon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women
of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game
leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for
public health. We find that Pok\'emon Go is able to reach low activity
populations while all four leading mobile health apps studied in this work
largely draw from an already very active population.

 <dc:description>  We have designed, fabricated, and successfully tested a prototype
mixed-signal, 28x28-binary-input, 10-output, 3-layer neuromorphic network (&quot;MLP
perceptron&quot;). It is based on embedded nonvolatile floating-gate cell arrays
redesigned from a commercial 180-nm NOR flash memory. The arrays allow precise
(~1%) individual tuning of all memory cells, having long-term analog-level
retention and low noise. Each array performs a very fast and energy-efficient
analog vector-by-matrix multiplication, which is the bottleneck for signal
propagation in most neuromorphic networks. All functional components of the
prototype circuit, including 2 synaptic arrays with 101,780 floating-gate
synaptic cells, 74 analog neurons, and the peripheral circuitry for weight
adjustment and I/O operations, have a total area below 1 mm^2. Its testing on
the common MNIST benchmark set (at this stage, with a relatively low weight
import precision) has shown a classification fidelity of 94.65%, close to the
96.2% obtained in simulation. The classification of one pattern takes less than
1 us time and ~20 nJ energy - both numbers much better than for digital
implementations of the same task. Estimates show that this performance may be
further improved using a better neuron design and a more advanced memory
technology, leading to a &gt;10^2 advantage in speed and a &gt;10^4 advantage in
energy efficiency over the state-of-the-art purely digital (GPU and custom)
circuits, at classification of large, complex patterns.

 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency is essential for Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)

throughput, delay, quality of service, and security levels also need to be
considered in optimizing the network design. In this paper, we study the case
in which the nodes access the medium probabilistically and we formulate an
energy efficiency optimization problem under the rate and access probability
constraints for IEEE 802.15.6 Impulse Radio Ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) WBANs. The
proposed algorithm, dubbed Energy Efficiency Optimization of Channel Access
Probabilities (EECAP), determines the optimal access probability and payload
frame size for each node. The simulation results show that our algorithm
rapidly converges to the optimal solution. We also provide detailed insights on
the relationship between the optimal access probabilities and other network
parameters such as the link distance, the number of nodes, and the minimum rate
constraints.

 <dc:description>  Cycle-accurate software simulation of multicores with complex
microarchitectures is often excruciatingly slow. People use simplified core
models to gain simulation speed. However, a persistent question is to what
extent the results derived from a simplified core model can be used to
characterize the behavior of a real machine.
  We propose a new methodology of validating simplified simulation models,
which focuses on the trends of metric values across benchmarks and
architectures, instead of errors of absolute metric values. To illustrate this
methodology, we conduct a case study using an FPGA-accelerated cycle-accurate
full system simulator. We evaluated three cache replacement polices on a
10-stage in-order core model, and then re-conducted all the experiments by
substituting a 1-IPC core model for the 10-stage core model. We found that the
1-IPC core model generally produces qualitatively the same results as the
accurate core model except for a few mismatches. We argue that most observed
mismatches were either indistinguishable from experimental noise or
corresponded to the cases where the policy differences even in the accurate
model showed inconclusive results. We think it is fair to use simplified core
models to study a feature once the influence of the simplification is
understood. Additional studies on branch predictors and scaling properties of
multithread benchmarks reinforce our argument. However, the validation of a
simplified model requires a detailed cycle-accurate model!

 <dc:description>  A large number of web applications is based on a relational database together
with a program, typically a script, that enables the user to interact with the
database through embedded SQL queries and commands. In this paper, we introduce
a method for formal automated verification of such systems which connects
database theory to mainstream program analysis. We identify a fragment of SQL
which captures the behavior of the queries in our case studies, is
algorithmically decidable, and facilitates the construction of weakest
preconditions. Thus, we can integrate the analysis of SQL queries into a
program analysis tool chain. To this end, we implement a new decision procedure
for the SQL fragment that we introduce. We demonstrate practical applicability
of our results with three case studies, a web administrator, a simple firewall,
and a conference management system.

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of distributed generation and storage units is leading to
the development of local, small-scale distribution grids, known as microgrids
(MGs). In this paper, the problem of optimizing the energy trading decisions of
MG operators (MGOs) is studied using game theory. In the formulated game, each
MGO chooses the amount of energy that must be sold immediately or stored for
future emergencies, given the prospective market prices which are influenced by
other MGOs' decisions. The problem is modeled using a Bayesian game to account
for the incomplete information that MGOs have about each others' levels of
surplus. The proposed game explicitly accounts for each MGO's subjective
decision when faced with the uncertainty of its opponents' energy surplus. In
particular, the so-called framing effect, from the framework of prospect theory
(PT), is used to account for each MGO's valuation of its gains and losses with
respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference point is
typically different for each individual and originates from its past
experiences and future aspirations. A closed-form expression for the Bayesian
Nash equilibrium is derived for the standard game formulation. Under PT, a best
response algorithm is proposed to find the equilibrium. Simulation results show
that, depending on their individual reference points, MGOs can tend to store
more or less energy under PT compared to classical game theory. In addition,
the impact of the reference point is found to be more prominent as the
emergency price set by the power company increases.

 <dc:description>  In order to reduce the computational cost of the simulation of
electromagnetic responses in geophysical settings that involve highly
heterogeneous media, we develop a multiscale finite volume method with
oversampling for the quasi-static Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain.
We assume a coarse mesh nested within a fine mesh that accurately discretizes
the problem. For each coarse cell, we independently solve a local version of
the original Maxwell's system subject to linear boundary conditions on an
extended domain, which includes the coarse cell and a neighborhood of fine
cells around it. The local Maxwell's system is solved using the fine mesh
contained in the extended domain and the mimetic finite volume method. Next,
these local solutions (basis functions) together with a weak-continuity
condition are used to construct a coarse-mesh version of the global problem.
The basis functions can be used to obtain the fine-mesh details from the
solution of the coarse-mesh problem. Our approach leads to a significant
reduction in the size of the final system of equations and the computational
time, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions.
We demonstrate the performance of our method using a synthetic 3D example of a
mineral deposit.

 <dc:title>On Bounded Rationality in Cyber-Physical Systems Security:
  Game-Theoretic Analysis with Application to Smart Grid Protection</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that
captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system,
is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the
interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game,
the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS
to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator
chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize
potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts
for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational
capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such
bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from
the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this
framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have
different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and
computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each
attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing
these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart
grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets
implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium
strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is
considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender's incentive to deviate
from the Nash equilibrium decreases when faced with an attacker that has high
computational ability.

 <dc:description>  Current methods for automatically evaluating grammatical error correction
(GEC) systems rely on gold-standard references. However, these methods suffer
from penalizing grammatical edits that are correct but not in the gold
standard. We show that reference-less grammaticality metrics correlate very
strongly with human judgments and are competitive with the leading
reference-based evaluation metrics. By interpolating both methods, we achieve
state-of-the-art correlation with human judgments. Finally, we show that GEC
metrics are much more reliable when they are calculated at the sentence level
instead of the corpus level. We have set up a CodaLab site for benchmarking GEC
output using a common dataset and different evaluation metrics.

 <dc:description>  In the last few years it has been seen that many software vendors have
started delivering projects incrementally with very short release cycles. Best
examples of success of this approach has been Ubuntu Operating system that has
a 6 months release cycle and popular web browsers such as Google Chrome, Opera,
Mozilla Firefox. However there is very little knowledge available to the
project managers to validate the chosen release cycle length. We propose a
decision support system that helps to validate and estimate release cycle
length in the early development phase by assuming that release cycle length is
directly affected by three factors, (i) choosing right requirements for current
cycle, (ii) estimating proximal time for each requirement, (iii) requirement
wise feedback from last iteration based on product reception, model accuracy
and failed requirements. We have altered and used the EVOLVE technique proposed
by G. Ruhe to select best requirements for current cycle and map it to time
domain using UCP (Use Case Points) based estimation and feedback factors. The
model has been evaluated on both in-house as well as industry projects.

 <dc:description>  Fifth generation (5G) dense small cell networks (SCNs) are expected to meet
the thousand-fold mobile traffic challenge within the next few years. When
developing solution schemes for resource allocation problems in such networks,
conventional centralized control is no longer viable due to excessive
computational complexity and large signaling overhead caused by the large
number of users and network nodes in such a network. Instead, distributed
resource allocation (or decision making) methods with low complexity would be
desirable to make the network self-organizing and autonomous. Minority game
(MG) has recently gained attention of the research community as a tool to model
and solve distributed resource allocation problems. The main objective of this
article is to study the applicability of the MG to solve the distributed
decision making problems in future wireless networks. We present the
fundamental theoretical aspects of basic MG, some variants of MG, and the
notion of equilibrium. We also study the current state-of-the-art on the
applications of MGs in communication networks. Furthermore, we describe an
example application of MG to SCNs, where the problem of computation offloading
by users in an SCN is modeled and analyzed using MG.

 <dc:description>  Parallel implementations of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have received
significant research attention, thanks to excellent scalability properties of
this algorithm, and to its efficiency in the context of training deep neural
networks. A fundamental barrier for parallelizing large-scale SGD is the fact
that the cost of communicating the gradient updates between nodes can be very
large. Consequently, lossy compression heuristics have been proposed, by which
nodes only communicate quantized gradients. Although effective in practice,
these heuristics do not always provably converge, and it is not clear whether
they are optimal.
  In this paper, we propose Quantized SGD (QSGD), a family of compression
schemes which allow the compression of gradient updates at each node, while
guaranteeing convergence under standard assumptions. QSGD allows the user to
trade off compression and convergence time: it can communicate a sublinear
number of bits per iteration in the model dimension, and can achieve
asymptotically optimal communication cost. We complement our theoretical
results with empirical data, showing that QSGD can significantly reduce
communication cost, while being competitive with standard uncompressed
techniques on a variety of real tasks.
  In particular, experiments show that gradient quantization applied to
training of deep neural networks for image classification and automated speech
recognition can lead to significant reductions in communication cost, and
end-to-end training time. For instance, on 16 GPUs, we are able to train a
ResNet-152 network on ImageNet 1.8x faster to full accuracy. Of note, we show
that there exist generic parameter settings under which all known network
architectures preserve or slightly improve their full accuracy when using
quantization.

misclassified or out-of-distribution. We present a simple baseline that
utilizes probabilities from softmax distributions. Correctly classified
examples tend to have greater maximum softmax probabilities than erroneously
classified and out-of-distribution examples, allowing for their detection. We
assess performance by defining several tasks in computer vision, natural
language processing, and automatic speech recognition, showing the
effectiveness of this baseline across all. We then show the baseline can
sometimes be surpassed, demonstrating the room for future research on these
underexplored detection tasks.

 <dc:description>  Existing approaches to resource allocation for nowadays stochastic networks
are challenged to meet fast convergence and tolerable delay requirements. The
present paper leverages online learning advances to facilitate stochastic
resource allocation tasks. By recognizing the central role of Lagrange
multipliers, the underlying constrained optimization problem is formulated as a
machine learning task involving both training and operational modes, with the
goal of learning the sought multipliers in a fast and efficient manner. To this
end, an order-optimal offline learning approach is developed first for batch
training, and it is then generalized to the online setting with a procedure
termed learn-and-adapt. The novel resource allocation protocol permeates
benefits of stochastic approximation and statistical learning to obtain
low-complexity online updates with learning errors close to the statistical
accuracy limits, while still preserving adaptation performance, which in the
stochastic network optimization context guarantees queue stability. Analysis
and simulated tests demonstrate that the proposed data-driven approach improves
the delay and convergence performance of existing resource allocation schemes.

 <dc:description>  The ability to record and replay program executions with low overhead enables
many applications, such as reverse-execution debugging, debugging of
hard-to-reproduce test failures, and &quot;black box&quot; forensic analysis of failures
in deployed systems. Existing record-and-replay approaches rely on recording an
entire virtual machine (which is heavyweight), modifying the OS kernel (which
adds deployment and maintenance costs), or pervasive code instrumentation
(which imposes significant performance and complexity overhead). We
investigated whether it is possible to build a practical record-and-replay
system avoiding all these issues. The answer turns out to be yes --- if the CPU
and operating system meet certain non-obvious constraints. Fortunately modern
Intel CPUs, Linux kernels and user-space frameworks meet these constraints,
although this has only become true recently. With some novel optimizations, our
system RR records and replays real-world workloads with low overhead with an
entirely user-space implementation running on stock hardware and operating
systems. RR forms the basis of an open-source reverse-execution debugger seeing
significant use in practice. We present the design and implementation of RR,
describe its performance on a variety of workloads, and identify constraints on
hardware and operating system design required to support our approach.

 <dc:description>  Using current reinforcement learning methods, it has recently become possible
to learn to play unknown 3D games from raw pixels. In this work, we study the
challenges that arise in such complex environments, and summarize current
methods to approach these. We choose a task within the Doom game, that has not
been approached yet. The goal for the agent is to fight enemies in a 3D world
consisting of five rooms. We train the DQN and LSTM-A3C algorithms on this
task. Results show that both algorithms learn sensible policies, but fail to
achieve high scores given the amount of training. We provide insights into the
learned behavior, which can serve as a valuable starting point for further
research in the Doom domain.

 <dc:description>  Automatic segmentation of the liver and its lesion is an important step
towards deriving quantitative biomarkers for accurate clinical diagnosis and
computer-aided decision support systems. This paper presents a method to
automatically segment liver and lesions in CT abdomen images using cascaded
fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) and dense 3D conditional random
fields (CRFs). We train and cascade two FCNs for a combined segmentation of the
liver and its lesions. In the first step, we train a FCN to segment the liver
as ROI input for a second FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions from the
predicted liver ROIs of step 1. We refine the segmentations of the CFCN using a
dense 3D CRF that accounts for both spatial coherence and appearance. CFCN
models were trained in a 2-fold cross-validation on the abdominal CT dataset
3DIRCAD comprising 15 hepatic tumor volumes. Our results show that CFCN-based
semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94% for liver
with computation times below 100s per volume. We experimentally demonstrate the
robustness of the proposed method as a decision support system with a high
accuracy and speed for usage in daily clinical routine.

 <dc:title>An Algebraic Approach to a Class of Rank-Constrained Semi-Definite
  Programs With Applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Morency, Matthew W.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Algebraic Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new approach to solving a class of rankconstrained semi-definite
programming (SDP) problems, which appear in many signal processing applications
such as transmit beamspace design in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
radar, downlink beamforming design in MIMO communications, generalized sidelobe
canceller design, phase retrieval, etc., is presented. The essence of the
approach is the use of underlying algebraic structure enforced in such problems
by other practical constraints such as, for example, null shaping constraint.
According to this approach, instead of relaxing the non-convex rankconstrained
SDP problem to a feasible set of positive semidefinite matrices, we restrict it
to a space of polynomials whose dimension is equal to the desired rank. The
resulting optimization problem is then convex as its solution is required to be
full rank, and can be efficiently and exactly solved. A simple matrix
decomposition is needed to recover the solution of the original problem from
the solution of the restricted one. We show how this approach can be applied to
solving some important signal processing problems that contain null-shaping
constraints. As a byproduct of our study, the conjugacy of beamfoming and
parameter estimation problems leads us to formulation of a new and rigorous
criterion for signal/noise subspace identification. Simulation results are
performed for the problem of rank-constrained beamforming design and show an
exact agreement of the solution with the proposed algebraic structure, as well
as significant performance improvements in terms of sidelobe suppression
compared to the existing methods.

 <dc:title>Morphology Generation for Statistical Machine Translation using Deep

 <dc:description>  Morphology in unbalanced languages remains a big challenge in the context of
machine translation. In this paper, we propose to de-couple machine translation
from morphology generation in order to better deal with the problem. We
investigate the morphology simplification with a reasonable trade-off between
expected gain and generation complexity. For the Chinese-Spanish task, optimum
morphological simplification is in gender and number. For this purpose, we
design a new classification architecture which, compared to other standard
machine learning techniques, obtains the best results. This proposed
neural-based architecture consists of several layers: an embedding, a
convolutional followed by a recurrent neural network and, finally, ends with
sigmoid and softmax layers. We obtain classification results over 98% accuracy
in gender classification, over 93% in number classification, and an overall
translation improvement of 0.7 METEOR.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses challenges of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on
non-canonical multilingual data in which two or more languages are mixed. It
refers to code-switching which has become more popular in our daily life and
therefore obtains an increasing amount of attention from the research
community. We report our experience that cov- ers not only core NLP tasks such
as normalisation, language identification, language modelling, part-of-speech
tagging and dependency parsing but also more downstream ones such as machine
translation and automatic speech recognition. We highlight and discuss the key
problems for each of the tasks with supporting examples from different language
pairs and relevant previous work.

 <dc:description>  In large-scale emergencies social media has become a key source of
information for public awareness, government authorities and relief agencies.
However, the sheer volume of data and the low signal-to- noise ratio limit the
effectiveness and the efficiency of using social media as an intelligence
resource. We describe Australian Crisis Tracker (ACT), a tool designed for
agencies responding to large- scale emergency events, to facilitate the
understanding of critical information in Twitter. ACT was piloted by the
Australian Red Cross (ARC) during the 2013-2014 Australian bushfires season.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an approach for weakly supervised learning of human actions from
video transcriptions. Our system is based on the idea that, given a sequence of
input data and a transcript, i.e. a list of the order the actions occur in the
video, it is possible to infer the actions within the video stream, and thus,
learn the related action models without the need for any frame-based
annotation. Starting from the transcript information at hand, we split the
given data sequences uniformly based on the number of expected actions. We then
learn action models for each class by maximizing the probability that the
training video sequences are generated by the action models given the sequence
order as defined by the transcripts. The learned model can be used to
temporally segment an unseen video with or without transcript. We evaluate our
approach on four distinct activity datasets, namely Hollywood Extended, MPII
Cooking, Breakfast and CRIM13. We show that our system is able to align the
scripted actions with the video data and that the learned models localize and
classify actions competitively in comparison to models trained with full
supervision, i.e. with frame level annotations, and that they outperform any
current state-of-the-art approach for aligning transcripts with video data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for training deep
neural networks in a semi-supervised setting where only a small portion of
training data is labeled. We introduce self-ensembling, where we form a
consensus prediction of the unknown labels using the outputs of the
network-in-training on different epochs, and most importantly, under different
regularization and input augmentation conditions. This ensemble prediction can
be expected to be a better predictor for the unknown labels than the output of
the network at the most recent training epoch, and can thus be used as a target
for training. Using our method, we set new records for two standard
semi-supervised learning benchmarks, reducing the (non-augmented)
classification error rate from 18.44% to 7.05% in SVHN with 500 labels and from
18.63% to 16.55% in CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels, and further to 5.12% and 12.16%
by enabling the standard augmentations. We additionally obtain a clear
improvement in CIFAR-100 classification accuracy by using random images from
the Tiny Images dataset as unlabeled extra inputs during training. Finally, we
demonstrate good tolerance to incorrect labels.

 <dc:title>Logic as a distributive law</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Stay, Mike</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm for deriving a spatial-behavioral type system from a
formal presentation of a computational calculus. Given a 2-monad Calc:
Catv$\to$ Cat for the free calculus on a category of terms and rewrites and a
2-monad BoolAlg for the free Boolean algebra on a category, we get a 2-monad
Form = BoolAlg + Calc for the free category of formulae and proofs. We also get
the 2-monad BoolAlg $\circ$ Calc for subsets of terms. The interpretation of
formulae is a natural transformation $\interp{-}$: Form $\Rightarrow$ BoolAlg
$\circ$ Calc defined by the units and multiplications of the monads and a
distributive law transformation $\delta$: Calc $\circ$ BoolAlg $\Rightarrow$
BoolAlg $\circ$ Calc. This interpretation is consistent both with the
Curry-Howard isomorphism and with realizability. We give an implementation of
the &quot;possibly&quot; modal operator parametrized by a two-hole term context and show
that, surprisingly, the arrow type constructor in the $\lambda$-calculus is a
specific case. We also exhibit nontrivial formulae encoding confinement and
liveness properties for a reflective higher-order variant of the
$\pi$-calculus.

 <dc:description>  In mammography, the efficacy of computer-aided detection methods depends, in
part, on the robust localisation of micro-calcifications ($\mu$C). Currently,
the most effective methods are based on three steps: 1) detection of individual
$\mu$C candidates, 2) clustering of individual $\mu$C candidates, and 3)
classification of $\mu$C clusters. Where the second step is motivated both to
reduce the number of false positive detections from the first step and on the
evidence that malignancy depends on a relatively large number of $\mu$C
detections within a certain area. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
$\mu$C detection, consisting of the detection \emph{and} classification of
individual $\mu$C candidates, using shape and appearance features, using a
cascade of boosting classifiers. The final step in our approach then clusters
the remaining individual $\mu$C candidates. The main advantage of this approach
lies in its ability to reject a significant number of false positive $\mu$C
candidates compared to previously proposed methods. Specifically, on the
INbreast dataset, we show that our approach has a true positive rate (TPR) for
individual $\mu$Cs of 40\% at one false positive per image (FPI) and a TPR of
80\% at 10 FPI. These results are significantly more accurate than the current
state of the art, which has a TPR of less than 1\% at one FPI and a TPR of 10\%
at 10 FPI. Our results are competitive with the state of the art at the
subsequent stage of detecting clusters of $\mu$Cs.

 <dc:description>  Spatial smoothing is a widely used preprocessing scheme to improve the
performance of high-resolution parameter estimation algorithms in case of
coherent signals or if only a small number of snapshots is available. In this
paper, we present a first-order performance analysis of the spatially smoothed
versions of R-D Standard ESPRIT and R-D Unitary ESPRIT for sources with
arbitrary signal constellations as well as R-D NC Standard ESPRIT and R-D NC
Unitary ESPRIT for strictly second-order (SO) non-circular (NC) sources. The
derived expressions are asymptotic in the effective signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), i.e., the approximations become exact for either high SNRs or a large
sample size. Moreover, no assumptions on the noise statistics are required
apart from a zero-mean and finite SO moments. We show that both R-D NC
ESPRIT-type algorithms with spatial smoothing perform asymptotically identical
in the high effective SNR regime. Generally, the performance of spatial
smoothing based algorithms depends on the number of subarrays, which is a
design parameter and needs to be chosen beforehand. In order to gain more
insights into the optimal choice of the number of subarrays, we simplify the
derived analytical R-D mean square error (MSE) expressions for the special case
of a single source. The obtained MSE expression explicitly depends on the
number of subarrays in each dimension, which allows us to analytically find the
optimal number of subarrays for spatial smoothing. Based on this result, we
additionally derive the maximum asymptotic gain from spatial smoothing and
explicitly compute the asymptotic efficiency for this special case. All the
analytical results are verified by simulations.

 <dc:description>  Differently from computer vision systems which require explicit supervision,
humans can learn facial expressions by observing people in their environment.
In this paper, we look at how similar capabilities could be developed in
machine vision. As a starting point, we consider the problem of relating facial
expressions to objectively measurable events occurring in videos. In
particular, we consider a gameshow in which contestants play to win significant
sums of money. We extract events affecting the game and corresponding facial
expressions objectively and automatically from the videos, obtaining large
quantities of labelled data for our study. We also develop, using benchmarks
such as FER and SFEW 2.0, state-of-the-art deep neural networks for facial
expression recognition, showing that pre-training on face verification data can
be highly beneficial for this task. Then, we extend these models to use facial
expressions to predict events in videos and learn nameable expressions from
them. The dataset and emotion recognition models are available at

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the aesthetic image classification problem, also
known as automatically classifying an image into low or high aesthetic quality,
which is quite a challenging problem. Considering both the local and global
information of images is quite important for image aesthetic quality
assessment. Currently, a powerful inception module is proposed which shows very
high performance in object classification. We have the observation that the
inception module has the ability of considering both the local and global
features in nature. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel DCNN structure
codenamed ILGNet for image aesthetics classification, which introduces the
Inception module and connects intermediate Local layers to the Global layer for
the output. In addition, the ILGNet is derived from part of the GoogLeNet.
Thus, we can easily use a pre-trained image classification GoogleLeNet model on
the ImageNet dataset and fine tune our connected local and global layer on the
large scale aesthetics assessment AVA dataset. The experimental results show
that the proposed ILGNet outperforms the state of the art results in image
aesthetics assessment in the AVA benchmark. The time cost of both training and
test of the ILGNet are significantly less than those of full GoogLeNet with
only a little reduction of the classification accuracy. Our ILGNet can achieve
similar classification accuracy as that of 2/3 GoogLeNet, whose computational
cost is nearly twice of ours. This makes the aesthetic assessment model more
easily to be integrated into mobile and embedded systems.

 <dc:title>Parallel STEPS: Large Scale Stochastic Spatial Reaction-Diffusion

 <dc:description>  Stochastic, spatial reaction-diffusion simulations have been widely used in
systems biology and computational neuroscience. However, the increasing scale
and complexity of simulated models and morphologies have exceeded the capacity
of any serial implementation. This led to development of parallel solutions
that benefit from the boost in performance of modern large-scale
supercomputers. In this paper, we describe an MPI-based, parallel
Operator-Splitting implementation for stochastic spatial reaction-diffusion
simulations with irregular tetrahedral meshes. The performance of our
implementation is first examined and analyzed with simulations of a simple
model. We then demonstrate its usage in real-world research by simulating the
reaction-diffusion components of a published calcium burst model in both
Purkinje neuron sub-branch and full dendrite morphologies. Simulation results
indicate that our implementation is capable of achieving super-linear speedup
for balanced loading simulations with reasonable molecule density and mesh
quality. In the best scenario a parallel simulation with 2000 processes
achieves more than 3600 times of speedup relative to its serial SSA counterpart
and more than 20 times of speedup relative to parallel simulation with 100
processes. While simulation performance is affected by unbalanced loading, a
substantial speedup can still be observed without any special treatment.

 <dc:description>  A generalisation of Scott's information systems~\cite{sco82} is presented
that captures exactly all L-domains. The global consistency predicate in
Scott's definition is relativised in such a way that there is a consistency
predicate for each atomic proposition (token) saying which finite sets of such
statements express information that is consistent with the given statement.
  It is shown that the states of such generalised information systems form an
L-domain, and that each L-domain can be generated in this way, up to
isomorphism. Moreover, the equivalence of the category of generalised
information systems with the category of L-domains is derived. In addition, it
will be seen that from every generalised information system capturing an
algebraic bounded-complete domain a corresponding Scott information system can
be obtained in an easy and natural way; similarly for Hoofman's continuous
information systems~\cite{ho93} and the continuous bounded-complete domains
captured by them.

 <dc:description>  The main task of HTTP Adaptive Streaming is to adapt video quality
dynamically under variable network conditions. This is a key feature for
multimedia delivery especially when quality of service cannot be granted
network-wide and, e.g., throughput may suffer short term fluctuations.
  Hence, robust bitrate adaptation schemes become crucial in order to improve
video quality. The objective, in this context, is to control the filling level
of the playback buffer and maximize the quality of the video, while avoiding
unnecessary video quality variations.
  In this paper we study bitrate adaptation algorithms based on
Backward-Shifted Coding (BSC), a scalable video coding scheme able to greatly
improve video quality. We design bitrate adaptation algorithms that balance
video rate smoothness and high network capacity utilization, leveraging both on
throughput-based and buffer-based adaptation mechanisms.
  Extensive simulations using synthetic and real-world video traffic traces
show that the proposed scheme performs remarkably well even under challenging
network conditions.

 <dc:description>  Near-data processing (NDP) refers to augmenting memory or storage with
processing power. Despite its potential for acceleration computing and reducing
power requirements, only limited progress has been made in popularizing NDP for
various reasons. Recently, two major changes have occurred that have ignited
renewed interest and caused a resurgence of NDP. The first is the success of
machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for
training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the
popularity of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore
processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. In this
paper, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that
allows us to simulate instorage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform
(named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD
that can execute various ML algorithms using data stored in the SSD. To conduct
a thorough performance analysis and an in-depth comparison with alternative
techniques, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient descent
(SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable models such
as logistic regression and neural networks. We implement and compare three SGD
variants (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML,
exploiting the multiple NAND channels to parallelize SGD. In addition, we
compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing,
revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations
identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future
research on ISP for accelerating ML.

 <dc:title>CONE: Zero-Calibration Accurate Confidence Estimation for Indoor
  Localization Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Elbakly, Rizanne</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Youssef, Moustafa</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Accurate estimation of the confidence of an indoor localization system is
crucial for a number of applications including crowd-sensing applications,
map-matching services, and probabilistic location fusion techniques; all of
which lead to an enhanced user experience. Current approaches for quantifying
the output accuracy of a localization system in real-time either do not provide
a distance metric, require an extensive training process, and/or are tailored
to a specific localization system. In this paper, we present the design,
implementation, and evaluation of CONE: a novel calibration-free accurate
confidence estimation system that can work in real-time with any location
determination system. CONE builds on a sound theoretical model that allows it
to trade the required user confidence with tight bound on the estimated
confidence radius. We also introduce a new metric for evaluating confidence
estimation systems that can capture new aspects of their performance.
Evaluation of CONE on Android phones in a typical testbed using the iBeacons
BLE technology with a side-by-side comparison with traditional confidence
estimation techniques shows that CONE can achieve a consistent median absolute
error difference accuracy of less than 2.7m while estimating the user position
more than 80% of the time within the confidence circle. This is significantly
better than the state-of-the-art confidence estimation systems that are
tailored to the specific localization system in use. Moreover, CONE does not
require any calibration and therefore provides a scalable and ubiquitous
confidence estimation system for pervasive applications.

 <dc:description>  Consider unsupervised clustering of objects drawn from a discrete set,
through the use of human intelligence available in crowdsourcing platforms.
This paper defines and studies the problem of universal clustering using
responses of crowd workers, without knowledge of worker reliability or task
difficulty. We model stochastic worker response distributions by incorporating
traits of memory for similar objects and traits of distance among differing
objects. We are particularly interested in two limiting worker
types---temporary workers who retain no memory of responses and long-term
workers with memory. We first define clustering algorithms for these limiting
cases and then integrate them into an algorithm for the unified worker model.
We prove asymptotic consistency of the algorithms and establish sufficient
conditions on the sample complexity of the algorithm. Converse arguments
establish necessary conditions on sample complexity, proving that the defined
algorithms are asymptotically order-optimal in cost.

allows for evaluation of flow patterns and for evaluating the view experienced
from the buildings. The computation of flow is based on a multimesh finite

mesh which can be moved around freely in a fixed background mesh. The
computation of view is based on a novel and objective measure of the view which
can be efficiently computed by rasterization.

 <dc:description>  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with approximately 22 nucleotides (nt)
that are derived from precursor molecules. These precursor molecules or
pre-miRNAs often fold into stem-loop hairpin structures. However, a large
number of sequences with pre-miRNA-like hairpins can be found in genomes. It is
a challenge to distinguish the real pre-miRNAs from other hairpin sequences
with similar stem-loops (referred to as pseudo pre-miRNAs). Several
computational methods have been developed to tackle this challenge. In this
paper we propose a new method, called MirID, for identifying and classifying
microRNA precursors. We collect 74 features from the sequences and secondary
structures of pre-miRNAs; some of these features are taken from our previous
studies on non-coding RNA prediction while others were suggested in the
literature. We develop a combinatorial feature mining algorithm to identify
suitable feature sets. These feature sets are then used to train support vector
machines to obtain classification models, based on which classifier ensemble is
constructed. Finally we use an AdaBoost algorithm to further enhance the
accuracy of the classifier ensemble. Experimental results on a variety of
species demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method, and its
superiority over existing tools.

 <dc:title>The Voting Farm: A Distributed Class for Software Voting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>De Florio, Vincenzo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This document describes a class of C functions implementing a distributed
software voting mechanism for EPX or similar message passing multi-threaded
environments. Such a tool may be used for example, to set up a restoring organ,
i.e., an NMR (i.e., N-module redundant) system with N voters. In order to
describe the tool we start defining its basic building block, the voter. A
voter is defined as a software module connected to one user module and to a
farm of fellow voters arranged into a clique. By means of the functions in the
class the user module is able: to create a static &quot;picture&quot; of the voting farm,
needed for the set up of the clique; to instantiate the local voter; to send
input or control messages to that voter. No interlocutor is needed other than
the local voter. The other user modules are supposed to create coherent
pictures and instances of voters on other nodes of the machine and to manage
consistently the task of their local intermediary. All technicalities
concerning the set up of the clique and the exchange of messages between the
voters are completely transparent to the user module. In the following the
basic functionalities of the VotingFarm class will be discussed, namely how to
set up a &quot;passive farm&quot;, or a non-alive topological representation of a
yet-to-be-activated voting farm; how to initiate the voting farm; how to
control the farm.

 <dc:title>Online Fault-Tolerant Dynamic Event Region Detection in Sensor Networks
  via Trust Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Jiejie</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Bin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a Bayesian modeling approach to address the problem of
online fault-tolerant dynamic event region detection in wireless sensor
networks. In our model every network node is associated with a virtual
community and a trust index, which quantitatively measures the trustworthiness
of this node in its community. If a sensor node's trust value is smaller than a
threshold, it suggests that this node encounters a fault and thus its sensor
reading can not be trusted at this moment. This concept of sensor node trust
discriminates our model with the other alternatives, e.g.,the Markov random
fields. The practical issues, including spatiotemporal correlations of neighbor
nodes' sensor readings, the presence of sensor faults and the requirement of
online processing are linked together by the concept trust and are all taken
into account in the modeling stage. Based on the proposed model, the trust
value of each node is updated online by a particle filter algorithm upon the
arrival of new observations. The decision on whether a node is located in the
event region is made based upon the current estimate of this node's trust
value. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide
striking better performance than existent methods in terms of error rate in
detecting the event region.

 <dc:description>  Planning has achieved significant progress in recent years. Among the various
approaches to scale up plan synthesis, the use of macro-actions has been widely
explored. As a first stage towards the development of a solution to learn
on-line macro-actions, we propose an algorithm to identify useful macro-actions
based on data mining techniques. The integration in the planning search of
these learned macro-actions shows significant improvements over four classical
planning benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most prominent architectures
and algorithm in Deep Learning. It shows a remarkable improvement in the
recognition and classification of objects. This method has also been proven to
be very effective in a variety of computer vision and machine learning
problems. As in other deep learning, however, training the CNN is interesting
yet challenging. Recently, some metaheuristic algorithms have been used to
optimize CNN using Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated
Annealing and Harmony Search. In this paper, another type of metaheuristic
algorithms with different strategy has been proposed, i.e. Microcanonical
Annealing to optimize Convolutional Neural Network. The performance of the
proposed method is tested using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Although
experiment results of MNIST dataset indicate the increase in computation time
(1.02x - 1.38x), nevertheless this proposed method can considerably enhance the
performance of the original CNN (up to 4.60\%). On the CIFAR10 dataset,
currently, state of the art is 96.53\% using fractional pooling, while this
proposed method achieves 99.14\%.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes energy-efficient coordinated beamforming strategies for
multi-cell multi-user multiple-input single-output system. We consider a
practical power consumption model, where part of the consumed power depends on
the base station or user specific data rates due to coding, decoding and
backhaul. This is different from the existing approaches where the base station
power consumption has been assumed to be a convex or linear function of the
transmit powers. Two optimization criteria are considered, namely network
energy efficiency maximization and weighted sum energy efficiency maximization.
We develop successive convex approximation based algorithms to tackle these
difficult nonconvex problems. We further propose decentralized implementations
for the considered problems, in which base stations perform parallel and
distributed computation based on local channel state information and limited
backhaul information exchange. The decentralized approaches admit closed-form
solutions and can be implemented without invoking a generic external convex
solver. We also show an example of the pilot contamination effect on the energy
efficiency using a heuristic pilot allocation strategy. The numerical results
are provided to demonstrate that the rate dependent power consumption has a
large impact on the system energy efficiency, and, thus, has to be taken into
account when devising energy-efficient transmission strategies. The significant
gains of the proposed algorithms over the conventional low-complexity
beamforming algorithms are also illustrated.

 <dc:description>  We develop Gibbs sampling based techniques for learning the optimal content
placement in a cellular network. A collection of base stations are scattered on
the space, each having a cell (possibly overlapping with other cells). Mobile
users request for downloads from a finite set of contents according to some
popularity distribution. Each base station can store only a strict subset of
the contents at a time; if a requested content is not available at any serving
base station, it has to be downloaded from the backhaul. Thus, there arises the
problem of optimal content placement which can minimize the download rate from
the backhaul, or equivalently maximize the cache hit rate. Using similar ideas
as Gibbs sampling, we propose simple sequential content update rules that
decide whether to store a content at a base station based on the knowledge of
contents in neighbouring base stations. The update rule is shown to be
asymptotically converging to the optimal content placement for all nodes. Next,
we extend the algorithm to address the situation where content popularities and
cell topology are initially unknown, but are estimated as new requests arrive
to the base stations. Finally, improvement in cache hit rate is demonstrated
numerically.

contraction conditions which imply certain stability properties. Such
conditions are applied to a finite or infinite interval. In this paper we
consider the case, when a small-gain condition is applied to several disjunct

intervals to derive global stability properties for an interconnection. This

 <dc:description>  We offer a lattice-theoretic account of dynamic slicing for {\pi}-calculus,
building on prior work in the sequential setting. For any run of a concurrent
program, we exhibit a Galois connection relating forward slices of the start
configuration to backward slices of the end configuration. We prove that, up to
lattice isomorphism, the same Galois connection arises for any causally
equivalent execution, allowing an efficient concurrent implementation of
slicing via a standard interleaving semantics. Our approach has been formalised
in the dependently-typed language Agda.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a systematic survey on existing literature and seminal
works relevant to the application of ontologies in different aspects of Cloud
computing. Our hypothesis is that ontologies along with their reasoning
capabilities can have significant impact on improving various aspects of the
Cloud computing phenomena. Ontologies can promote intelligent decision support
mechanisms for various Cloud based services. They can also provide effective
interoperability among the Cloud based systems and resources. This survey can
promote a comprehensive understanding on the roles and significance of
ontologies within the overall domain of Cloud Computing. Also, this project can
potentially form the basis of new research area and possibilities for both
ontology and Cloud computing communities.

paradigm \cite{1} is modified and used for these two cut problems on directed
graphs By this paradigm, we give for each problem an approximation algorithm
such that both algorithms have an approximate factor. The work previously done
on these problems need to solve k linear programming, whereas our algorithms
require only one linear programming for obtaining a good approximate factor.

 <dc:description>  With the rapid increase in computing, storage and networking resources, data
is not only collected and stored, but also analyzed. This creates a serious
privacy problem which often inhibits the use of this data. In this chapter, we
investigate and resolve the privacy issues in a fundamental optimization
problem -- linear programming (LP) which is formulated by data collected from
different parties. We first consider the case where the objective function and
constraints of the linear programming problem are not partitioned between two
parties where one party privately holds the objective function while the other
party privately holds the constraints. Second, we present a privacy preserving
technique for the case that objective function and constraints are arbitrarily
partitioned between two parties where each party privately holds a share of
objective function and constraints. Finally, we extend the technique for
securely solving two-party arbitrarily partitioned linear programming problems
to a multi-party scenario. In summary, we propose a set of efficient and secure
transformation based techniques that create significant value-added benefits of
being independent of the specific algorithms used for solving the linear
programming problem.

 <dc:description>  In big data era, the data continuously generated and its distribution may
keep changes overtime. These challenges in online stream of data are known as
concept drift. In this paper, we proposed the Adaptive Convolutional ELM method
(ACNNELM) as enhancement of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a hybrid
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model plus adaptive capability. This method is
aimed for concept drift handling. We enhanced the CNN as convolutional
hiererchical features representation learner combined with Elastic ELM
(E$^2$LM) as a parallel supervised classifier. We propose an Adaptive OS-ELM
(AOS-ELM) for concept drift adaptability in classifier level (named ACNNELM-1)
and matrices concatenation ensembles for concept drift adaptability in ensemble
level (named ACNNELM-2). Our proposed Adaptive CNNELM is flexible that works
well in classifier level and ensemble level while most current methods only
proposed to work on either one of the levels.
  We verified our method in extended MNIST data set and not MNIST data set. We
set the experiment to simulate virtual drift, real drift, and hybrid drift
event and we demonstrated how our CNNELM adaptability works. Our proposed
method works well and gives better accuracy, computation scalability, and
concept drifts adaptability compared to the regular ELM and CNN. Further
researches are still required to study the optimum parameters and to use more
varied image data set.

 <dc:title>Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chollet, Fran&#xe7;ois</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an interpretation of Inception modules in convolutional neural
networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the
depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by
a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can
be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers.
This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network
architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced
with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed
Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which
Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a
larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000
classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as
Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but
rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.

 <dc:description>  For many European countries, in 2015 the refugee situation developed from a
remote tragedy reported upon in the news to a situation they have to deal with
in their own neighborhood. Driven by this observation, we investigated the
development of the perception of the refugee situation during 2015 in Twitter.
Starting from a dataset of 1.7 Million tweets covering refugee-related topics
from May to December 2015, we investigated how the discussion on refugees
changed over time, in different countries as well as in relationship with the
evolution of the actual situation. In this paper we report and discuss our
findings from checking a set of hypotheses, such as that the closeness to the
actual situation would influence the intensity and polarity of discussions and
that news media takes a mediating role between the actual and perceived refugee
situation.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of delivering $m$ messages between specified
source-target pairs in a weighted undirected graph, by $k$ mobile agents
initially located at distinct nodes of the graph. Each agent consumes energy
proportional to the distance it travels in the graph and we are interested in
optimizing the total energy consumption for the team of agents. Unlike previous
related work, we consider heterogeneous agents with different rates of energy
consumption (weights~$w_i$). To solve the delivery problem, agents face three
major challenges: \emph{Collaboration} (how to work together on each message),
\emph{Planning} (which route to take) and \emph{Coordination} (how to assign
agents to messages).
  We first show that the delivery problem can be 2-approximated \emph{without}
collaborating and that this is best possible, i.e., we show that the
\emph{benefit of collaboration} is 2 in general. We also show that the benefit
of collaboration for a single message is~$1/\ln 2 \approx 1.44$. Planning turns
out to be \NP-hard to approximate even for a single agent, but can be
2-approximated in polynomial time if agents have unit capacities and do not
collaborate. We further show that coordination is \NP-hard even for agents with
unit capacity, but can be efficiently solved exactly if they have uniform
weights. Finally, we give a polynomial-time
$(4\max\tfrac{w_i}{w_j})$-approximation for message delivery with unit
capacities.

 <dc:description>  We present a coordination language for the modeling of distributed database
applications. The language, baptized Klaim-DB, borrows the concepts of
localities and nets of the coordination language Klaim but re-incarnates the
tuple spaces of Klaim as databases. It provides high-level abstractions and
primitives for the access and manipulation of structured data, with integrity
and atomicity considerations. We present the formal semantics of Klaim-DB and
develop a type system that avoids potential runtime errors such as certain
evaluation errors and mismatches of data format in tables, which are monitored
in the semantics. The use of the language is illustrated in a scenario where
the sales from different branches of a chain of department stores are
aggregated from their local databases. Raising the abstraction level and
encapsulating integrity checks in the language primitives have benefited the
modeling task considerably.

 <dc:description>  Increasing the scalability of machine learning to handle big volume of data
is a challenging task. The scale up approach has some limitations. In this
paper, we proposed a scale out approach for CNN-ELM based on MapReduce on
classifier level. Map process is the CNN-ELM training for certain partition of
data. It involves many CNN-ELM models that can be trained asynchronously.
Reduce process is the averaging of all CNN-ELM weights as final training
result. This approach can save a lot of training time than single CNN-ELM
models trained alone. This approach also increased the scalability of machine
learning by combining scale out and scale up approaches. We verified our method
in extended MNIST data set and not-MNIST data set experiment. However, it has
some drawbacks by additional iteration learning parameters that need to be
carefully taken and training data distribution that need to be carefully
selected. Further researches to use more complex image data set are required.

 <dc:description>  More often than not, there is a need to understand the structure of complex
computer code: what functions and in what order they are called, how
information travels around static, input, and output variables, what depends on
what. As a rule, executable code and data are scattered among multiple files
and even multiple modules. Information is transmitted among variables which
often change names. These tangled relations greatly complicate the development,
maintenance, and redevelopment of code, its analysis for complexity and its
robustness. As of now, there is no tool which is capable of presenting the
real-life, useful diagram of actual code. Conventional flowcharts fail.
Proposed is the method which overcomes these difficulties. The main idea is
that functionality of software can be described through flows of control, which
is essentially flows of time, and flows of data. These are inseparable. The
second idea is to follow very strict system boundaries and distinctions with
respect to modules, functions, blocks, and operators, as well as data holders,
showing them all as subsystems, in other words, by clearly expressing the
system structure when every piece of executable code and every variable may
have its own graphical representation. The third is defining timelines as the
entities clearly separated from the connected blocks of code. Timelines allow
presentation of nesting of the control flow as deep as necessary. As a proof of
concept, the same methods successfully describe production systems. Keywords:
flowchart, UML, software diagram, visual programming, extreme programming,
extreme modeling, control flow, data flow.

 <dc:description>  Step adjustment for humanoid robots has been shown to improve robustness in
gaits. However, step duration adaptation is often neglected in control
strategies. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines both step
location and timing adjustment for generating robust gaits. In this approach,
step location and step timing are decided, based on feedback from the current
state of the robot. The proposed approach is comprised of two stages. In the
first stage, the nominal step location and step duration for the next step or a
previewed number of steps are specified. In this stage which is done at the
start of each step, the main goal is to specify the best step length and step
duration for a desired walking speed. The second stage deals with finding the
best landing point and landing time of the swing foot at each control cycle. In
this stage, stability of the gaits is preserved by specifying a desired offset
between the swing foot landing point and the Divergent Component of Motion
(DCM) at the end of current step. After specifying the landing point of the
swing foot at a desired time, the swing foot trajectory is regenerated at each
control cycle to realize desired landing properties. Simulation on different
scenarios shows the robustness of the generated gaits from our proposed
approach compared to the case where no timing adjustment is employed.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the synthesis of piecewise affine feedback
controllers to address the problem of safe and robust controller design in
robotics based on high-level controls specifications. The methodology is based
on formulating the problem as a collection of reach control problems on a
polytopic state space. Reach control has so far only been developed in theory
and has not been tested experimentally on a real system before. Using a
quadrocopter as our experimental platform, we show that these theoretical tools
can achieve fast, albeit safe and robust maneuvers. In contrast to most
traditional control techniques, the reach control approach does not require a
predefined open-loop reference trajectory or spacial path. Experimental results
on a quadrocopter show the effectiveness and robustness of this control
approach. In a proof-of-concept demonstration, the reach controller is
implemented in one translational direction while the other degrees of freedom
are stabilized by separate controllers.

 <dc:description>  This report presents the results of the UNIFY Service Provider DevOps
activities. First, we present the final definition and assessment of the
concept. SP-DevOps is realized by a combination of various functional
components facilitating integrated service verification, efficient and
programmable observability, and automated troubleshooting processes. Our
assessment shows that SP-DevOps can help providers to reach a medium level of
DevOps maturity and allows significant reduction in OPEX. Second, we focus on
the evaluation of the proposed SP-DevOps components. The set of tools proposed
supports ops and devs across all stages, with a focus on the deployment,
operation and debugging phases, and allows to activate automated processes for
operating NFV environments. Finally, we present use-cases and our demonstrators
for selected process implementions, which allowed the functional validation of
SP-DevOps.

 <dc:description>  We propose a technique for producing &quot;visual explanations&quot; for decisions from
a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach -
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of
any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a
coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for
predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a
wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.
VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in
tasks with multimodal inputs (e.g. VQA) or reinforcement learning, without any
architectural changes or re-training. We combine GradCAM with fine-grained
visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization
and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual
question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the
context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights
into their failure modes (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have
reasonable explanations), (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform
previous methods on weakly-supervised localization, (d) are more faithful to
the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset
bias. For captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention
based models can localize inputs. Finally, we conduct human studies to measure
if GradCAM explanations help users establish trust in predictions from deep
networks and show that GradCAM helps untrained users successfully discern a

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, robust detection, tracking and geometry estimation methods are
developed and combined into a system for estimating time-difference estimates,
microphone localization and sound source movement. No assumptions on the 3D
locations of the microphones and sound sources are made. The system is capable
of tracking continuously moving sound sources in an reverberant environment.
The multi-path components are explicitly tracked and used in the geometry
estimation parts. The system is based on matching between pairs of channels
using GCC-PHAT. Instead of taking a single maximum at each time instant from
each such pair, we select the four strongest local maxima. This produce a set
of hypothesis to work with in the subsequent steps, where consistency
constraints between the channels and time-continuity constraints are exploited.
In the paper it demonstrated how such detections can be used to estimate
microphone positions, sound source movement and room geometry. The methods are
tested and verified using real data from several reverberant environments. The
evaluation demonstrated accuracy in the order of few millimeters.

 <dc:description>  We propose a criterion for discrimination against a specified sensitive
attribute in supervised learning, where the goal is to predict some target
based on available features. Assuming data about the predictor, target, and
membership in the protected group are available, we show how to optimally
adjust any learned predictor so as to remove discrimination according to our
definition. Our framework also improves incentives by shifting the cost of poor
classification from disadvantaged groups to the decision maker, who can respond
by improving the classification accuracy.
  In line with other studies, our notion is oblivious: it depends only on the
joint statistics of the predictor, the target and the protected attribute, but
not on interpretation of individualfeatures. We study the inherent limits of
defining and identifying biases based on such oblivious measures, outlining
what can and cannot be inferred from different oblivious tests.
  We illustrate our notion using a case study of FICO credit scores.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a robust and parsimonious approach using Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to recognize and interpret interior space.
DCNN has achieved incredible success in object and scene recognition. In this
study we design and train a DCNN to classify a pre-zoning indoor space, and
from a single phone photo to recognize the learned space features, with no need
of additional assistive technology. We collect more than 600,000 images inside
MIT campus buildings to train our DCNN model, and achieved 97.9% accuracy in
validation dataset and 81.7% accuracy in test dataset based on spatial-scale
fixed model. Furthermore, the recognition accuracy and spatial resolution can
be potentially improved through multiscale classification model. We identify
the discriminative image regions through Class Activating Mapping (CAM)
technique, to observe the model's behavior in how to recognize space and
interpret it in an abstract way. By evaluating the results with
misclassification matrix, we investigate the visual spatial feature of interior
space by looking into its visual similarity and visual distinctiveness, giving
insights into interior design and human indoor perception and wayfinding
research. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a
robust and parsimonious approach for indoor navigation using DCNN. Second, we
demonstrate that DCNN also has a potential capability in space feature learning
and recognition, even under severe appearance changes. Third, we introduce a
DCNN based approach to look into the visual similarity and visual
distinctiveness of interior space.

 <dc:description>  We report a method to convert discrete representations of molecules to and
from a multidimensional continuous representation. This model allows us to
generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through
open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on
hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three
coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder and a predictor. The encoder converts
the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector,
and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular
representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent
continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations
allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing
simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors,
perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules.
Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based
optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional
compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and
also in the set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.

 <dc:title>Lopsidependency in the Moser-Tardos framework: Beyond the Lopsided
  Lovasz Local Lemma</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Harris, David G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Lopsided Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma (LLLL) is a powerful probabilistic
principle which has been used in a variety of combinatorial constructions.
While originally a general statement about probability spaces, it has recently
been transformed into a variety of polynomial-time algorithms. The resampling
algorithm of Moser &amp; Tardos (2010) is the most well-known example of this. A
variety of criteria have been shown for the LLLL; the strongest possible
criterion was shown by Shearer, and other criteria which are easier to use
computationally have been shown by Bissacot et al (2011), Pegden (2014),
Kolipaka &amp; Szegedy (2011), and Kolipaka, Szegedy, Xu (2012).
  We show a new criterion for the Moser-Tardos algorithm to converge. This
criterion is stronger than the LLLL criterion; this is possible because it does
not apply in the same generality as the original LLLL; yet, it is strong enough
to cover many applications of the LLLL in combinatorics. We show a variety of
new bounds and algorithms. A noteworthy application is for $k$-SAT, with
bounded occurrences of variables. As shown in Gebauer, Sz\'{a}bo, and Tardos
(2011), a $k$-SAT instance in which every variable appears $L \leq
\frac{2^{k+1}}{e (k+1)}$ times, is satisfiable. Although this bound is
asymptotically tight (in $k$), we improve it to $L \leq \frac{2^{k+1} (1 -
1/k)^k}{k-1} - \frac{2}{k}$ which can be significantly stronger when $k$ is
small.
  We introduce a new parallel algorithm for the LLLL. While Moser &amp; Tardos
described a simple parallel algorithm for the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma, and
described a simple sequential algorithm for a form of the Lopsided Lemma, they
were not able to combine the two. Our new algorithm applies in nearly all
settings in which the sequential algorithm works --- this includes settings
covered by our new stronger LLLL criterion.

 <dc:description>  Neural sequence models are widely used to model time-series data in many
fields. Equally ubiquitous is the usage of beam search (BS) as an approximate
inference algorithm to decode output sequences from these models. BS explores
the search space in a greedy left-right fashion retaining only the top-$B$
candidates -- resulting in sequences that differ only slightly from each other.
Producing lists of nearly identical sequences is not only computationally
wasteful but also typically fails to capture the inherent ambiguity of complex
AI tasks. To overcome this problem, we propose \emph{Diverse Beam Search}
(DBS), an alternative to BS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by
optimizing for a diversity-augmented objective. We observe that our method
finds better top-1 solutions by controlling for the exploration and
exploitation of the search space -- implying that DBS is a \emph{better search
algorithm}. Moreover, these gains are achieved with minimal computational or
memory overhead as compared to beam search. To demonstrate the broad
applicability of our method, we present results on image captioning, machine
translation and visual question generation using both standard quantitative
metrics and qualitative human studies. Our method consistently outperforms BS
and previously proposed techniques for diverse decoding from neural sequence
models.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a model reduction technique for leader-follower
networked multi-agent systems defined on weighted, undirected graphs with
arbitrary linear multivariable agent dynamics. In the network graph of this
network, nodes represent the agents and edges represent communication links
between the agents. Only the leaders in the network receive an external input,
the followers only exchange information with their neighbors. The reduced
network is obtained by partitioning the set of nodes into disjoint sets, called
clusters, and associating with each cluster a single, new, node in a reduced
network graph. The resulting reduced network has a weighted, symmetric,
directed network graph, and inherits some of the structure of the original
network. We establish a priori upper bounds on the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ model reduction error for the special case that the graph
partition is almost equitable. These upper bounds depend on the Laplacian
eigenvalues of the original and reduced network, an auxiliary system associated
with the agent dynamics, and the number of nodes that belong to the same
clusters as the leaders in the network. Finally, we consider the problem of
obtaining a priori upper bounds if we cluster using arbitrary, possibly non
almost equitable, partitions.

 <dc:title>InfraNotes: Inconspicuous Handwritten Trajectory Tracking for Lecture
  Note Recording with Infrared Sensors</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chang, Steve</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Lecture notes are important for students to review and understand the key
points in the class. Unfortunately, the students often miss or lose part of the
lecture notes. In this paper, we design and implement an infrared sensor based
system, InfraNotes, to automatically record the notes on the board by sensing
and analyzing hand gestures of the lecturer. Compared with existing techniques,
our system does not require special accessories with lecturers such as
sensor-facilitated pens, writing surfaces or the video-taping infrastructure.
Instead, it only has an infrared-sensor module on the eraser holder of
black/white board to capture handwritten trajectories. With a lightweight
framework for handwritten trajectory processing, clear lecture notes can be
generated automatically. We evaluate the quality of lecture notes by three
standard character recognition techniques. The results indicate that InfraNotes
is a promising solution to create clear and complete lectures to promote the
education.

 <dc:description>  The advancement in digital technologies have made it possible to produce
perfect copies of digital content. In this environment, malicious users
reproduce the digital content and share it without compensation to the content
owner. Content owners are concerned about the potential loss of revenue and
reputation from piracy, especially when the content is available over the
Internet. Digital watermarking has emerged as a deterrent measure towards such
malicious activities. Several methods have been proposed for copyright
protection and fingerprinting of digital images. However, these methods are not
applicable to text documents as these documents lack rich texture information
which is abundantly available in digital images. In this paper, a framework
(mPDF) is proposed which facilitates the usage of digital image watermarking
algorithms on text documents. The proposed method divides a text document into
texture and non-texture blocks using an energy-based approach. After
classification, a watermark is embedded inside the texture blocks in a content
adaptive manner. The proposed method is integrated with five known image
watermarking methods and its performance is studied in terms of quality and
robustness. Experiments are conducted on documents in 11 different languages.
Experimental results clearly show that the proposed method facilitates the
usage of image watermarking algorithms on text documents and is robust against
attacks such as print &amp; scan, print screen, and skew. Also, the proposed method
overcomes the drawbacks of existing text watermarking methods such as manual
inspection and language dependency.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated the
capability to synthesize compelling real-world images, such as room interiors,
album covers, manga, faces, birds, and flowers. While existing models can
synthesize images based on global constraints such as a class label or caption,
they do not provide control over pose or object location. We propose a new
model, the Generative Adversarial What-Where Network (GAWWN), that synthesizes
images given instructions describing what content to draw in which location. We
show high-quality 128 x 128 image synthesis on the Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset,
conditioned on both informal text descriptions and also object location. Our
system exposes control over both the bounding box around the bird and its
constituent parts. By modeling the conditional distributions over part
locations, our system also enables conditioning on arbitrary subsets of parts
(e.g. only the beak and tail), yielding an efficient interface for picking part
locations. We also show preliminary results on the more challenging domain of
text- and location-controllable synthesis of images of human actions on the
MPII Human Pose dataset.

 <dc:description>  Approximate Nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is fundamental and essential
operation in applications from many domains, such as databases, machine
learning, multimedia, and computer vision. Although many algorithms have been
continuously proposed in the literature in the above domains each year, there
is no comprehensive evaluation and analysis of their performances.
  In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of many
state-of-the-art methods for approximate nearest neighbor search. Our study (1)
is cross-disciplinary (i.e., including 16 algorithms in different domains, and
from practitioners) and (2) has evaluated a diverse range of settings,
including 20 datasets, several evaluation metrics, and different query
workloads. The experimental results are carefully reported and analyzed to
understand the performance results. Furthermore, we propose a new method that
achieves both high query efficiency and high recall empirically on majority of
the datasets under a wide range of settings.

 <dc:title>Supervisory Control of Fuzzy Discrete Event Systems for Simulation
  Equivalence</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Deng, Weilin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Qiu, Daowen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The supervisory control theory of fuzzy discrete event systems (FDESs) for
fuzzy language equivalence has been developed. However, in a way, language
equivalence has limited expressiveness. So if the given specification can not
be expressed by language equivalence, then the control for language equivalence
does not work. In this paper, we further establish the supervisory control
theory of FDESs for fuzzy simulation equivalence whose expressiveness is
stronger than that of fuzzy language equivalence. First, we formalize the
notions of fuzzy simulation and fuzzy simulation equivalence between two FDESs.
Then we present a method for deciding whether there is a fuzzy simulation or
not. In addition, we also show several basic properties of fuzzy simulation
relations. Afterwards, we put forward the notion of fuzzy simulation-based
controllability, and particularly show that it serves as a necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of the fuzzy supervisors of FDESs.
Moreover, we study the &quot;range&quot; control problem of FDESs. Some examples are
given to illustrate the main results obtained.

 <dc:title>Small Variance Asymptotics for Non-Parametric Online Robot Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tanwani, Ajay Kumar</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Calinon, Sylvain</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Small variance asymptotics is emerging as a useful technique for inference in
large scale Bayesian non-parametric mixture models. This paper analyses the
online learning of robot manipulation tasks with Bayesian non-parametric
mixture models under small variance asymptotics. The analysis yields a scalable
online sequence clustering (SOSC) algorithm that is non-parametric in the
number of clusters and the subspace dimension of each cluster. SOSC groups the
new datapoint in its low dimensional subspace by online inference in a
non-parametric mixture of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA)
based on Dirichlet process, and captures the state transition and state
duration information online in a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) based on
hierarchical Dirichlet process. A task-parameterized formulation of our
approach autonomously adapts the model to changing environmental situations
during manipulation. We apply the algorithm in a teleoperation setting to
recognize the intention of the operator and remotely adjust the movement of the
robot using the learned model. The generative model is used to synthesize both
time-independent and time-dependent behaviours by relying on the principles of
shared and autonomous control. Experiments with the Baxter robot yield
parsimonious clusters that adapt online with new demonstrations and assist the
operator in performing remote manipulation tasks.

 <dc:title>Bi-Fuzzy Discrete Event Systems and Their Supervisory Control Theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Deng, Weilin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Qiu, Daowen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is well known that type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FSs) have limited capabilities to
handle some data uncertainties directly, and type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FSs) can
cover the shortcoming of T1 FSs to a certain extent. Fuzzy discrete event
systems (FDESs) were proposed based on T1 FSs theory. Hence, FDES may not be a
satisfactory model to characterize some high-uncertainty systems. In this
paper, we propose a new model, called as bi-fuzzy discrete event systems
(BFDESs), by combining classical DESs theory and T2 FSs theory. Then, we
consider the supervisory control problem of BFDESs. The bi-fuzzy
controllability theorem and nonblocking bi-fuzzy controllability theorem are
demonstrated. Also, an algorithm for checking the bi-fuzzy controllability
condition is presented. In addition, two controllable approximations to an
uncontrollable language are investigated in detail. An illustrative example is
provided to show the applicability and the advantages of BFDESs model.

 <dc:title>A Music-generating System Inspired by the Science of Complex Adaptive

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>

 <dc:subject>Quantitative Biology - Neurons and Cognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents NetWorks (NW), an interactive music generation system
that uses a hierarchically clustered scale free network to generate music that
ranges from orderly to chaotic. NW was inspired by the Honing Theory of
creativity, according to which human-like creativity hinges on (1) the ability
to self-organize and maintain dynamics at the 'edge of chaos' using something
akin to 'psychological entropy', and (2) the capacity to shift between analytic
and associative processing modes. At the 'edge of chaos', NW generates patterns
that exhibit emergent complexity through coherent development at low, mid, and
high levels of musical organization, and often suggests goal seeking behaviour.
The architecture consists of four 16-node modules: one each for pitch,
velocity, duration, and entry delay. The Core allows users to define how nodes
are connected, and rules that determine when and how nodes respond to their
inputs. The Mapping Layer allows users to map node output values to MIDI data
that is routed to software instruments in a digital audio workstation. By
shifting between bottom-up and top-down NW shifts between analytic and
associative processing modes.

human cognitive science theories of creativity such as conceptual blending

 <dc:description>  Frequency estimation of multiple sinusoids is significant in both theory and
application. In some application scenarios, only sub-Nyquist samples are
available to estimate the frequencies. A conventional approach is to sample the
signals at several lower rates. In this paper, we address frequency estimation
of the signals in the time domain through undersampled data. We analyze the
impact of undersampling and demonstrate that three sub-Nyquist channels are
generally enough to estimate the frequencies provided the undersampling ratios
are pairwise coprime. We deduce the condition that leads to the failure of
resolving frequency ambiguity when two coprime undersampling channels are
utilized. When three-channel sub-Nyquist samples are used jointly, the
frequencies can be determined uniquely and the correct frequencies are
estimated. Numerical experiments verify the correctness of our analysis and
conclusion.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous crop monitoring at high spatial and temporal resolution is a
critical problem in precision agriculture. While Structure from Motion and
Multi-View Stereo algorithms can finely reconstruct the 3D structure of a field
with low-cost image sensors, these algorithms fail to capture the dynamic
nature of continuously growing crops. In this paper we propose a 4D
reconstruction approach to crop monitoring, which employs a spatio-temporal
model of dynamic scenes that is useful for precision agriculture applications.
Additionally, we provide a robust data association algorithm to address the
problem of large appearance changes due to scenes being viewed from different
angles at different points in time, which is critical to achieving 4D
reconstruction. Finally, we collected a high quality dataset with ground truth
statistics to evaluate the performance of our method. We demonstrate that our
4D reconstruction approach provides models that are qualitatively correct with
respect to visual appearance and quantitatively accurate when measured against
the ground truth geometric properties of the monitored crops.

 <dc:description>  Due to its simplicity and versatility, k-means remains popular since it was
proposed three decades ago. The performance of k-means has been enhanced from
different perspectives over the years. Unfortunately, a good trade-off between
quality and efficiency is hardly reached. In this paper, a novel k-means
variant is presented. Different from most of k-means variants, the clustering
procedure is driven by an explicit objective function, which is feasible for
the whole l2-space. The classic egg-chicken loop in k-means has been simplified
to a pure stochastic optimization procedure. The procedure of k-means becomes
simpler and converges to a considerably better local optima. The effectiveness
of this new variant has been studied extensively in different contexts, such as
document clustering, nearest neighbor search and image clustering. Superior
performance is observed across different scenarios.

 <dc:description>  The Daala project is a royalty-free video codec that attempts to compete with
the best patent-encumbered codecs. Part of our strategy is to replace core
tools of traditional video codecs with alternative approaches, many of them
designed to take perceptual aspects into account, rather than optimizing for
simple metrics like PSNR. This paper documents some of our experiences with
these tools, which ones worked and which did not. We evaluate which tools are
easy to integrate into a more traditional codec design, and show results in the
context of the codec being developed by the Alliance for Open Media.

 <dc:description>  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular tool for analyzing discrete
count data such as text and images. Applications require LDA to handle both
large datasets and a large number of topics. Though distributed CPU systems
have been used, GPU-based systems have emerged as a promising alternative
because of the high computational power and memory bandwidth of GPUs. However,
existing GPU-based LDA systems cannot support a large number of topics because
they use algorithms on dense data structures whose time and space complexity is
linear to the number of topics. In this paper, we propose SaberLDA, a GPU-based
LDA system that implements a sparsity-aware algorithm to achieve sublinear time
complexity and scales well to learn a large number of topics. To address the
challenges introduced by sparsity, we propose a novel data layout, a new
warp-based sampling kernel, and an efficient sparse count matrix updating
algorithm that improves locality, makes efficient utilization of GPU warps, and
reduces memory consumption. Experiments show that SaberLDA can learn from
billions-token-scale data with up to 10,000 topics, which is almost two orders
of magnitude larger than that of the previous GPU-based systems. With a single
GPU card, SaberLDA is able to learn 10,000 topics from a dataset of billions of
tokens in a few hours, which is only achievable with clusters with tens of
machines before.

 <dc:description>  In uplink block-fading multiple access channel (BF-MAC), the advantage of
multiuser diversity (MUD) can be taken to achieve higher system throughput. In
this letter, with rate constraints for all users and only channel state
information available at the receiver assumed, we demonstrate that
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) outperforms the counterpart of orthogonal
multiple access (OMA) via exploiting the MUD from the superposition of multiple
users. The MUD gain achieved by NOMA compared with OMA is quantitatively
analyzed for finite users, and the closed-form upper bound of MUD gain from the
superposition of infinite users is also derived. Numerical results show that
the potential MUD gain from superposition of infinite users can be well
approached with limited superposed users, which indicates that multiple access
schemes with limited superposed users can provide a good tradeoff between
system performance and decoding complexity.

 <dc:description>  We have unified quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems
called qACP which is a quantum generalization of process algebra ACP. But, an
axiomatization for quantum and classical processes with an assumption of closed
quantum systems is still missing. For closed quantum systems, unitary operator,
quantum measurement and quantum entanglement are three basic components for
quantum computing. This leads to probability unavoidable. Along the solution of
qACP to unify quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems, we unify
quantum and classical computing with an assumption of closed systems under the
framework of ACP-like probabilistic process algebra. This unification make it
can be used widely in verification for quantum and classical computing mixed
systems, such as most quantum communication protocols.

 <dc:description>  Recently neural networks and multiple instance learning are both attractive
topics in Artificial Intelligence related research fields. Deep neural networks
have achieved great success in supervised learning problems, and multiple
instance learning as a typical weakly-supervised learning method is effective
for many applications in computer vision, biometrics, nature language
processing, etc. In this paper, we revisit the problem of solving multiple
instance learning problems using neural networks. Neural networks are appealing
for solving multiple instance learning problem. The multiple instance neural
networks perform multiple instance learning in an end-to-end way, which take a
bag with various number of instances as input and directly output bag label.
All of the parameters in a multiple instance network are able to be optimized
via back-propagation. We propose a new multiple instance neural network to
learn bag representations, which is different from the existing multiple
instance neural networks that focus on estimating instance label. In addition,
recent tricks developed in deep learning have been studied in multiple instance
networks, we find deep supervision is effective for boosting bag classification
accuracy. In the experiments, the proposed multiple instance networks achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance on several MIL benchmarks.
Moreover, it is extremely fast for both testing and training, e.g., it takes
only 0.0003 second to predict a bag and a few seconds to train on a MIL
datasets on a moderate CPU.

 <dc:description>  Modern multi-stage retrieval systems are comprised of a candidate generation
stage followed by one or more reranking stages. In such an architecture, the
quality of the final ranked list may not be sensitive to the quality of initial
candidate pool, especially in terms of early precision. This provides several
opportunities to increase retrieval efficiency without significantly
sacrificing effectiveness. In this paper, we explore a new approach to
dynamically predicting two different parameters in the candidate generation
stage which can directly affect the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the
entire system. Previous work exploring this tradeoff has focused on global
parameter settings that apply to all queries, even though optimal settings vary
across queries. In contrast, we propose a technique which makes a parameter
prediction that maximizes efficiency within a effectiveness envelope on a per
query basis, using only static pre-retrieval features. The query-specific
tradeoff point between effectiveness and efficiency is decided using a
classifier cascade that weighs possible efficiency gains against effectiveness
losses over a range of possible parameter cutoffs to make the prediction. The
interesting twist in our new approach is to train classifiers without requiring
explicit relevance judgments. We show that our framework is generalizable by
applying it to two different retrieval parameters - selecting k in common top-k
query retrieval algorithms, and setting a quality threshold, $\rho$, for
score-at-a-time approximate query evaluation algorithms. Experimental results
show that substantial efficiency gains are achievable depending on the dynamic
parameter choice. In addition, our framework provides a versatile tool that can
be used to estimate the effectiveness-efficiency tradeoffs that are possible
before selecting and tuning algorithms to make machine learned predictions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems have been widely used for a wide
range of applications such as Art collections, Crime prevention and
Intellectual property. In this paper, a novel CBIR system, which utilizes
visual contents (color, texture and shape) of an image to retrieve images, is
proposed. The proposed system builds three feature vectors and stores them into
MySQL database. The first feature vector uses descriptive statistics to
describe the distribution of data in each channel of RGB channels of the image.
The second feature vector describes the texture using eigenvalues of the 39
sub-bands that are generated after applying four levels 2D DWT in each channel
(red, green and blue channels) of the image. These wavelets sub-bands perfectly
describes the horizontal, vertical and diagonal edges that exist in the
multi-resolution analysis of the image. The third feature vector describes the
basic shapes that exist in the skeletonization version of the black and white
representation of the image. Experimental results on a private MYSQL database
that consists of 10000 images, using color, texture, shape and stored relevance
feedbacks, showed 96.4% average correct retrieval rate in an efficient recovery
time.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is a promising technology for the
fifth-generation (5G) wireless system. However, the large number of antennas
used and the wide signal bandwidth in mmWave systems render the conventional
multi-antenna techniques increasingly costly in terms of signal processing
complexity, hardware implementation, and power consumption. In this article, we
investigate cost-effective mmWave communications by first providing an overview
of the main existing techniques that offer different trade-offs between
performance and cost, and then focusing our discussion on a promising new
technique based on the advanced lens antenna array. It is revealed that by
exploiting the angle-dependent energy focusing property of lens arrays,
together with the angular sparsity of the mmWave channels, mmWave lens-antenna
system is able to achieve the capacity-optimal performance with very few
radio-frequency (RF) chains and using the low-complexity single-carrier
transmission, even for wide-band frequency-selective channels. Numerical
results show that the lens-based system significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art designs for mmWave systems in both spectrum efficiency and
energy efficiency.

 <dc:description>  One of the key limitation of massive MIMO systems is pilot contamination,
which is defined as the interference during uplink channel estimation due to
re-use of the same pilots in surrounding cells. In this paper, we propose a
location-based approach to the pilot contamination problem for uplink MIMO
systems. Our approach makes use of the approximate locations of mobile devices
to provide good estimates of the channel statistics between the mobile devices
and their corresponding base stations (BSs). We aim at minimizing the pilot
contamination even when the number of BS antennas is not very large, and when
multiple users from different cells, or even the same cell, are assigned the
same pilot sequence. First, we characterize a desired angular region of the
target user at the target BS in which interference is very low or zero, based
on the number of BS antennas and the location of the target user. Second, based
on this observation, we propose various pilot coordination methods for
multi-user multi-cell scenarios to eliminate pilot contamination.

 <dc:description>  The latest High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard significantly
improves coding efficiency over its previous video coding standards. The
expense of such improvement is enormous computational complexity, from both
encoding and decoding sides. Since computational capability and power capacity
are diverse across portable devices, it is necessary to reduce decoding
complexity to a target with tolerable quality loss, so called complexity
control. This paper proposes a Saliency-Guided Complexity Control (SGCC)
approach for HEVC decoding, which reduces the decoding complexity to the target
with minimal perceptual quality loss. First, we establish the SGCC formulation
to minimize perceptual quality loss at the constraint on reduced decoding
complexity, which is achieved via disabling Deblocking Filter (DF) and
simplifying Motion Compensation (MC) of some non-salient Coding Tree Units
(CTUs). One important component in this formulation is the modelled
relationship between decoding complexity reduction and DF disabling/MC
simplification, which determines the control accuracy of our approach. Another
component is the modelled relationship between quality loss and DF disabling/MC
simplification, responsible for optimizing perceptual quality. By solving the
SGCC formulation for a given target complexity, we can obtain the DF and MC
settings of each CTU, and then decoding complexity can be reduced to the
target. Finally, the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
SGCC approach, from the aspects of control performance, complexity-distortion
performance, fluctuation of quality loss and subjective quality.

 <dc:title>A Hybrid Model for Estimating Software Project Effort from Use Case
  Points</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Azzeh, Mohammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nassif, Ali Bou</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Early software effort estimation is a hallmark of successful software project
management. Building a reliable effort estimation model usually requires
historical data. Unfortunately, since the information available at early stages
of software development is scarce, it is recommended to use software size
metrics as key cost factor of effort estimation. Use Case Points (UCP) is a
prominent size measure designed mainly for object-oriented projects.
Nevertheless, there are no established models that can translate UCP into its
corresponding effort, therefore, most models use productivity as a second cost
driver. The productivity in those models is usually guessed by experts and does
not depend on historical data, which makes it subject to uncertainty. Thus,
these models were not well examined using a large number of historical data. In
this paper, we designed a hybrid model that consists of classification and
prediction stages using a support vector machine and radial basis neural
networks. The proposed model was constructed over a large number of
observations collected from industrial and student projects. The proposed model
was compared against previous UCP prediction models. The validation and
empirical results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly surpasses
these models on all datasets. The main conclusion is that the environmental
factors of UCP can be used to classify and estimate productivity.

 <dc:title>The Advantage of Truncated Permutations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Let $m &lt; n$ be non-negative integers. An oracle chooses a permutation $\pi$
of $\{0, 1\}^{n}$ uniformly at random. When queried with an $n$-bit string $w$,
it truncates the last $m$ bits of $\pi (w)$, and returns the remaining first
$n-m$ bits. Such truncated random permutations were suggested by Hall et al.,
in 1998, as a construction of a Pseudo Random Function. They conjectured that
the distinguishing advantage of this PRF, given a budget of $q$ queries, ${\bf
Adv}_{n, m} (q)$, is small if $q = o (2^{(m+n)/2})$. They established a general
upper bound on ${\bf Adv}_{n, m} (q)$, which confirms the conjecture only for
$m &lt; n/7$. The conjecture was essentialy confirmed by Bellare and Impagliazzo
in 1999. Nevertheless, the problem of estimating ${\bf Adv}_{n, m} (q)$
remained open.
  Combining the trivial bound $1$, the birthday bound, and a result that Stam
had published much earlier in 1978, in a different context, leads to the
following upper bound: $${\bf
Adv}_{n,m}(q)=O\left(\min\left\{\frac{q^2}{2^n},\,\frac{q}{2^{\frac{n+m}{2}}},\,1\right\}\right)$$
This paper settles the open problem by showing that this bound is tight.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we coin the term Policy Enforcement as a Service (PEPS), which
enables the provision of innovative inter-layer and inter-domain Access
Control. We leverage the architecture of Software-Defined-Network (SDN) to
introduce a common network-level enforcement point, which is made available to
a range of access control systems. With our PEPS model, it is possible to have
a `defense in depth' protection model and drop unsuccessful access requests
before engaging the data provider (e.g. a database system). Moreover, the
current implementation of access control within the `trusted' perimeter of an
organization is no longer a restriction so that the potential for novel,
distributed and cooperative security services can be realized. We conduct an
analysis of the security requirements and technical challenges for implementing
Policy Enforcement as a Service. To illustrate the benefits of our proposal in
practice, we include a report on our prototype PEPS-enabled location-based
access control.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed
optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are
unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to
train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated
Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost
importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the
principal goal.
  A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users'
mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In
federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing
computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose
that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as
the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction
of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points
available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally,
since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable
to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall
distribution.
  We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and
propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse
convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the
context of \federated optimization.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the security of a recently-proposed chaos-based image
encryption scheme, and points out the following problems: 1) there exist a
number of invalid keys and weak keys, and some keys are partially equivalent
for encryption/decryption; 2) given one chosen plain-image, a subkey $K_{10}$
can be guessed with a smaller computational complexity than that of the simple
brute-force attack; 3) given at most 128 chosen plain-images, a
chosen-plaintext attack can possibly break the following part of the secret
key: $\{K_i\bmod 128\}_{i=4}^{10}$, which works very well when $K_{10}$ is not
too large; 4) when $K_{10}$ is relatively small, a known-plaintext attack can
be carried out with only one known plain-image to recover some visual
information of any other plain-images encrypted by the same key.

 <dc:description>  A linking theory explains how verbs' semantic arguments are mapped to their
syntactic arguments---the inverse of the Semantic Role Labeling task from the
shallow semantic parsing literature. In this paper, we develop the
Computational Linking Theory framework as a method for implementing and testing
linking theories proposed in the theoretical literature. We deploy this
framework to assess two cross-cutting types of linking theory: local v. global
models and categorical v. featural models. To further investigate the behavior
of these models, we develop a measurement model in the spirit of previous work
in semantic role induction: the Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model. We use this
model, which implements a generalization of Dowty's seminal Proto-Role Theory,
to induce semantic proto-roles, which we compare to those Dowty proposes.

 <dc:title>A categorization of arguments for counting methods for publication and
  citation indicators</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gauffriau, Marianne</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most publication and citation indicators are based on datasets with
multi-authored publications and thus a change in counting method will often
change the value of an indicator. Therefore it is important to know why a
specific counting method has been applied. I have identified arguments for
counting methods in a sample of 32 bibliometric studies published in 2016 and
compared the result with discussions of arguments for counting methods in three
older studies. Based on the underlying logics of the arguments I have arranged
the arguments in four groups. Group 1 focuses on arguments related to what an
indicator measures, Group 2 on the additivity of a counting method, Group 3 on
pragmatic reasons for the choice of counting method, and Group 4 on an
indicator's influence on the research community or how it is perceived by
researchers. This categorization can be used to describe and discuss how
bibliometric studies with publication and citation indicators argue for
counting methods.

 <dc:title>Performance Bounds for Remote Estimation under Energy Harvesting
  Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Remote estimation with an energy harvesting sensor with a limited data and
energy buffer is considered. The sensor node observes an unknown Gaussian field
and communicates its observations to a remote fusion center using the energy it
harvested. The fusion center employs minimum mean-square error (MMSE)
estimation to reconstruct the unknown field. The distortion minimization
problem under the online scheme, where the sensor has access to only the
statistical information for the future energy packets is considered. We provide
performance bounds on the achievable distortion under a slotted block
transmission scheme, where at each transmission time slot, the data and the
energy buffer are completely emptied. Our bounds provide insights to the
trade-offs between the buffer sizes, the statistical properties of the energy
harvesting process and the achievable distortion. In particular, these
trade-offs illustrate the insensitivity of the performance to the buffer sizes
for signals with low degree of freedom and suggest performance improvements
with increasing buffer size for signals with relatively higher degree of
freedom. Depending only on the mean, variance and finite support of the energy
arrival process, these results provide practical insights for the battery and
buffer sizes for deployment in future energy harvesting wireless sensing
systems.

 <dc:description>  Adverse reactions caused by drugs following their release into the market are
among the leading causes of death in many countries. The rapid growth of
electronically available health related information, and the ability to process
large volumes of them automatically, using natural language processing (NLP)
and machine learning algorithms, have opened new opportunities for
pharmacovigilance. Survey found that more than 70% of US Internet users consult
the Internet when they require medical information. In recent years, research
in this area has addressed for Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) pharmacovigilance
using social media, mainly Twitter and medical forums and websites. This paper
will show the information which can be collected from a variety of Internet
data sources and search engines, mainly Google Trends and Google Correlate.
While considering the case study of two popular Major depressive Disorder (MDD)
drugs, Duloxetine and Venlafaxine, we will provide a comparative analysis for
their reactions using publicly-available alternative data sources.

 <dc:description>  Objective: To present the first real-time a posteriori error-driven adaptive
finite element approach for real-time simulation and to demonstrate the method
on a needle insertion problem. Methods: We use corotational elasticity and a
frictional needle/tissue interaction model. The problem is solved using finite
elements within SOFA. The refinement strategy relies upon a hexahedron-based
finite element method, combined with a posteriori error estimation driven local
$h$-refinement, for simulating soft tissue deformation. Results: We control the
local and global error level in the mechanical fields (e.g. displacement or
stresses) during the simulation. We show the convergence of the algorithm on
academic examples, and demonstrate its practical usability on a percutaneous
procedure involving needle insertion in a liver. For the latter case, we
compare the force displacement curves obtained from the proposed adaptive
algorithm with that obtained from a uniform refinement approach. Conclusions:
Error control guarantees that a tolerable error level is not exceeded during
the simulations. Local mesh refinement accelerates simulations. Significance:
Our work provides a first step to discriminate between discretization error and
modeling error by providing a robust quantification of discretization error
during simulations.

 <dc:description>  The atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index is a degree-based molecular structure
descriptor that can be used for modelling thermodynamic properties of organic
chemical compounds. Motivated by its applicable potential, a series of
investigations have been carried out in the past several years. In this note we
first consider graphs with given edge-connectivity that attain the maximum ABC
index. In particular, we give an affirmative answer to the conjecture about the
structure of graphs with edge-connectivity equal to one that maximize the ABC
index, which was recently raised by Zhang, Yang, Wang and Zhang~\cite{zywz
mabciggp-2016}. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for another
conjecture posed by the same authors which concerns graphs that maximize the
ABC index among all graphs with chromatic number equal to some fixed $\chi \geq
3$. Specifically, we confirm this conjecture in the case where the order of the
graph is divisible by $\chi$.

 <dc:description>  Network models of healthcare systems can be used to examine how providers
collaborate, communicate, refer patients to each other. Most healthcare service
network models have been constructed from patient claims data, using billing
claims to link patients with providers. The data sets can be quite large,
making standard methods for network construction computationally challenging
and thus requiring the use of alternate construction algorithms. While these
alternate methods have seen increasing use in generating healthcare networks,
there is little to no literature comparing the differences in the structural
properties of the generated networks. To address this issue, we compared the
properties of healthcare networks constructed using different algorithms and
the 2013 Medicare Part B outpatient claims data. Three different algorithms
were compared: binning, sliding frame, and trace-route. Unipartite networks
linking either providers or healthcare organizations by shared patients were
built using each method. We found that each algorithm produced networks with
substantially different topological properties. Provider networks adhered to a
power law, and organization networks to a power law with exponential cutoff.
Censoring networks to exclude edges with less than 11 shared patients, a common
de-identification practice for healthcare network data, markedly reduced edge
numbers and greatly altered measures of vertex prominence such as the
betweenness centrality. We identified patterns in the distance patients travel
between network providers, and most strikingly between providers in the
Northeast United States and Florida. We conclude that the choice of network
construction algorithm is critical for healthcare network analysis, and discuss
the implications for selecting the algorithm best suited to the type of
analysis to be performed.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of adding redundancy to a collection of
physical objects so that the overall system is more robust to failures. In
contrast to its information counterpart, which can exploit parity to protect
multiple information symbols from a single erasure, physical redundancy can
only be realized through duplication and substitution of objects. We propose a
bipartite graph model for designing defect-tolerant systems in which defective
objects are replaced by judiciously connected redundant objects. The
fundamental limits of this model are characterized under various asymptotic
settings and both asymptotic and finite-size systems that approach these limits
are constructed. Among other results, we show that simple modular redundancy is
in general suboptimal. As we develop, this combinatorial problem of defect
tolerant system design has a natural interpretation as one of graph coloring,
and the analysis is significantly different from that traditionally used in
information redundancy for error-control codes.

 <dc:description>  The visual cues from multiple support regions of different sizes and
resolutions are complementary in classifying a candidate box in object
detection. Effective integration of local and contextual visual cues from these
regions has become a fundamental problem in object detection.
  In this paper, we propose a gated bi-directional CNN (GBD-Net) to pass
messages among features from different support regions during both feature
learning and feature extraction. Such message passing can be implemented
through convolution between neighboring support regions in two directions and
can be conducted in various layers. Therefore, local and contextual visual
patterns can validate the existence of each other by learning their nonlinear
relationships and their close interactions are modeled in a more complex way.
It is also shown that message passing is not always helpful but dependent on
individual samples. Gated functions are therefore needed to control message
transmission, whose on-or-offs are controlled by extra visual evidence from the
input sample. The effectiveness of GBD-Net is shown through experiments on
three object detection datasets, ImageNet, Pascal VOC2007 and Microsoft COCO.

detection challenge of 2016, with source code provided on

 <dc:title>A Gentle Tutorial of Recurrent Neural Network with Error Backpropagation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Gang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have attracted great
attention on sequential tasks, such as handwriting recognition, speech
recognition and image to text. However, compared to general feedforward neural
networks, RNNs have feedback loops, which makes it a little hard to understand
the backpropagation step. Thus, we focus on basics, especially the error
backpropagation to compute gradients with respect to model parameters. Further,
we go into detail on how error backpropagation algorithm is applied on long
short-term memory (LSTM) by unfolding the memory unit.

using ns-3. the implementation is achieved toward two MLB algorithms
dynamically adjusting handover (HO) parameters based on the reference signal
received power measurements. such adjustments are done with respect to loads of
both an overloaded cell and its cell neighbours having enough available
resources enabling to achieve load balancing. numerical investigations through
selected key performance indicators of the proposed MLB algorithms when
compared with another HO algorithm (already implemented in ns3) based on A3
event highlight the significant MLB gains provided in terms global network
throughput, packet loss rate and the number of successful HO without incurring

 <dc:description>  Arising from many applications at the intersection of decision making and
machine learning, Marginal Maximum A Posteriori (Marginal MAP) Problems unify
the two main classes of inference, namely maximization (optimization) and
marginal inference (counting), and are believed to have higher complexity than
both of them. We propose XOR_MMAP, a novel approach to solve the Marginal MAP
Problem, which represents the intractable counting subproblem with queries to
NP oracles, subject to additional parity constraints. XOR_MMAP provides a
constant factor approximation to the Marginal MAP Problem, by encoding it as a
single optimization in polynomial size of the original problem. We evaluate our
approach in several machine learning and decision making applications, and show
that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art Marginal MAP solvers.

 <dc:description>  Energy and power consumption are major limitations to continued scaling of
computing systems. Inexactness, where the quality of the solution can be traded
for energy savings, has been proposed as an approach to overcoming those
limitations. In the past, however, inexactness necessitated the need for highly
customized or specialized hardware. The current evolution of commercial
off-the-shelf(COTS) processors facilitates the use of lower-precision
arithmetic in ways that reduce energy consumption. We study these new
opportunities in this paper, using the example of an inexact Newton algorithm
for solving nonlinear equations. Moreover, we have begun developing a set of
techniques we call reinvestment that, paradoxically, use reduced precision to
improve the quality of the computed result: They do so by reinvesting the
energy saved by reduced precision.

 <dc:description>  Over the past two decades the field of computational science and engineering
(CSE) has penetrated both basic and applied research in academia, industry, and
laboratories to advance discovery, optimize systems, support decision-makers,
and educate the scientific and engineering workforce. Informed by centuries of
theory and experiment, CSE performs computational experiments to answer
questions that neither theory nor experiment alone is equipped to answer. CSE
provides scientists and engineers of all persuasions with algorithmic
inventions and software systems that transcend disciplines and scales. Carried
on a wave of digital technology, CSE brings the power of parallelism to bear on
troves of data. Mathematics-based advanced computing has become a prevalent
means of discovery and innovation in essentially all areas of science,
engineering, technology, and society; and the CSE community is at the core of
this transformation. However, a combination of disruptive
developments---including the architectural complexity of extreme-scale
computing, the data revolution that engulfs the planet, and the specialization
required to follow the applications to new frontiers---is redefining the scope
and reach of the CSE endeavor. This report describes the rapid expansion of CSE
and the challenges to sustaining its bold advances. The report also presents
strategies and directions for CSE research and education for the next decade.

 <dc:title>Learning Human-Robot Handovers Through $\pi$-STAM: Policy Improvement

 <dc:description>  Human-robot handovers are characterized by high uncertainty and poor
structure of the problem that make them difficult tasks. While machine learning
methods have shown promising results, their application to problems with large
state dimensionality, such as in the case of humanoid robots, is still limited.
Additionally, by using these methods and during the interaction with the human
operator, no guarantees can be obtained on the correct interpretation of
spatial constraints (e.g., from social rules). In this paper, we present Policy
Improvement with Spatio-Temporal Affordance Maps -- $\pi$-STAM, a novel
iterative algorithm to learn spatial affordances and generate robot behaviors.
Our goal consists in generating a policy that adapts to the unknown action
semantics by using affordances. In this way, while learning to perform a
human-robot handover task, we can (1) efficiently generate good policies with
few training episodes, and (2) easily encode action semantics and, if
available, enforce prior knowledge in it. We experimentally validate our
approach both in simulation and on a real NAO robot whose task consists in
taking an object from the hands of a human. The obtained results show that our
algorithm obtains a good policy while reducing the computational load and time
duration of the learning process.

 <dc:description>  Pouring a specific amount of liquid is a challenging task. In this paper we
develop methods for robots to use visual feedback to perform closed-loop
control for pouring liquids. We propose both a model-based and a model-free
method utilizing deep learning for estimating the volume of liquid in a
container. Our results show that the model-free method is better able to
estimate the volume. We combine this with a simple PID controller to pour
specific amounts of liquid, and show that the robot is able to achieve an
average 38ml deviation from the target amount. To our knowledge, this is the
first use of raw visual feedback to pour liquids in robotics.

 <dc:description>  Online handwritten Chinese text recognition (OHCTR) is a challenging problem
as it involves a large-scale character set, ambiguous segmentation, and
variable-length input sequences. In this paper, we exploit the outstanding
capability of path signature to translate online pen-tip trajectories into
informative signature feature maps using a sliding window-based method,
successfully capturing the analytic and geometric properties of pen strokes
with strong local invariance and robustness. A multi-spatial-context fully
convolutional recurrent network (MCFCRN) is proposed to exploit the multiple
spatial contexts from the signature feature maps and generate a prediction
sequence while completely avoiding the difficult segmentation problem.
Furthermore, an implicit language model is developed to make predictions based
on semantic context within a predicting feature sequence, providing a new
perspective for incorporating lexicon constraints and prior knowledge about a
certain language in the recognition procedure. Experiments on two standard
benchmarks, Dataset-CASIA and Dataset-ICDAR, yielded outstanding results, with
correct rates of 97.10% and 97.15%, respectively, which are significantly
better than the best result reported thus far in the literature.

 <dc:title>Reconstruction of signals from their autocorrelation and

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of reconstructing two signals from the
autocorrelation and cross-correlation measurements. This inverse problem is a
fundamental one in signal processing, and arises in many applications,
including phase retrieval and blind channel estimation. In a typical phase
retrieval setup, only the autocorrelation measurements are obtainable. We show
that, when the measurements are obtained using three simple &quot;masks&quot;, phase
retrieval reduces to the aforementioned reconstruction problem.
  The classic solution to this problem is based on finding common factors
between the $z$-transforms of the autocorrelation and cross-correlation
vectors. This solution has enjoyed limited practical success, mainly due to the
fact that it is not sufficiently stable in the noisy setting. In this work,
inspired by the success of convex programming in provably and stably solving
various quadratic constrained problems, we develop a semidefinite
programming-based algorithm and provide theoretical guarantees. In particular,
we show that almost all signals can be uniquely recovered by this algorithm (up
to a global phase). Comparative numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly outperforms the classic method in the noisy setting.

 <dc:title>Learning Deep Generative Spatial Models for Mobile Robots</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pronobis, Andrzej</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new probabilistic framework that allows mobile robots to
autonomously learn deep, generative models of their environments that span
multiple levels of abstraction. Unlike traditional approaches that combine
engineered models for low-level features, geometry, and semantics, our approach
leverages recent advances in Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and deep learning to
learn a single, universal model of the robot's spatial environment. Our model
is fully probabilistic and generative, and represents a joint distribution over
spatial information ranging from low-level geometry to semantic
interpretations. Once learned, it is capable of solving a wide range of tasks:
from semantic classification of places, uncertainty estimation, and novelty
detection, to generation of place appearances based on semantic information and
prediction of missing data in partial observations. Experiments on laser-range
data from a mobile robot show that the proposed universal model obtains
performance superior to state-of-the-art models fine-tuned to one specific
task, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or SVMs.

 <dc:description>  We present research towards bridging the language gap between migrant workers
in Qatar and medical staff. In particular, we present the first steps towards
the development of a real-world Hindi-English machine translation system for
doctor-patient communication. As this is a low-resource language pair,
especially for speech and for the medical domain, our initial focus has been on
gathering suitable training data from various sources. We applied a variety of
methods ranging from fully automatic extraction from the Web to manual
annotation of test data. Moreover, we developed a method for automatically
augmenting the training data with synthetically generated variants, which
yielded a very sizable improvement of more than 3 BLEU points absolute.

 <dc:description>  Antichain based semantics for general rough sets were introduced recently by
the present author. In her paper two different semantics, one for general rough
sets and another for general approximation spaces over quasi-equivalence
relations, were developed. These semantics are improved and studied further
from a lateral algebraic logic perspective in this research. The main results
concern the structure of the algebras and deductive systems in the context.

 <dc:description>  This research introduces a new strategy in cluster ensemble selection by
using Independency and Diversity metrics. In recent years, Diversity and
Quality, which are two metrics in evaluation procedure, have been used for
selecting basic clustering results in the cluster ensemble selection. Although
quality can improve the final results in cluster ensemble, it cannot control
the procedures of generating basic results, which causes a gap in prediction of
the generated basic results' accuracy. Instead of quality, this paper
introduces Independency as a supplementary method to be used in conjunction
with Diversity. Therefore, this paper uses a heuristic metric, which is based
on the procedure of converting code to graph in Software Testing, in order to
calculate the Independency of two basic clustering algorithms. Moreover, a new
modeling language, which we called as &quot;Clustering Algorithms Independency
Language&quot; (CAIL), is introduced in order to generate graphs which depict
Independency of algorithms. Also, Uniformity, which is a new similarity metric,
has been introduced for evaluating the diversity of basic results. As a
credential, our experimental results on varied different standard data sets
show that the proposed framework improves the accuracy of final results
dramatically in comparison with other cluster ensemble methods.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper provides a framework to hash images containing instances of
unknown object classes. In many object recognition problems, we might have
access to huge amount of data. It may so happen that even this huge data
doesn't cover the objects belonging to classes that we see in our day to day
life. Zero shot learning exploits auxiliary information (also called as
signatures) in order to predict the labels corresponding to unknown classes. In
this work, we attempt to generate the hash codes for images belonging to unseen
classes, information of which is available only through the textual corpus. We
formulate this as an unsupervised hashing formulation as the exact labels are
not available for the instances of unseen classes. We show that the proposed
solution is able to generate hash codes which can predict labels corresponding
to unseen classes with appreciably good precision.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes to exploit the so-called {\it reciprocity parameters}
(modelling non-reciprocal communication hardware) to use them as decision
metric for binary hypothesis testing based authentication framework at a
receiver node Bob. Specifically, Bob first learns the reciprocity parameters of
the legitimate sender Alice via initial training. Then, during the test phase,
Bob first obtains a measurement of reciprocity parameters of channel occupier
(Alice, or, the intruder Eve). Then, with ground truth and current measurement
both in hand, Bob carries out the hypothesis testing to automatically accept
(reject) the packets sent by Alice (Eve). For the proposed scheme, we provide
its success rate (the detection probability of Eve), and its performance
comparison with other schemes.

 <dc:description>  In this work we study the coupled dynamics of social balance and opinion
formation. We propose a model where agents form opinions under bounded
confidence, but only considering the opinions of their friends. The signs of
social ties -friendships and enmities- evolve seeking for social balance,
taking into account how similar agents' opinions are. We consider both the case
where opinions have one and two dimensions. We find that our dynamics produces
the segregation of agents into two cliques, with the opinions of agents in one
clique differing from those in the other. Depending on the level of bounded
confidence, the dynamics can produce either consensus of opinions within each
clique or the coexistence of several opinion clusters in a clique. For the
uni-dimensional case, the opinions in one clique are all below the opinions in
the other clique, hence defining a &quot;left clique&quot; and a &quot;right clique&quot;. In the
two-dimensional case, our numerical results suggest that the two cliques are
separated by a hyperplane in the opinion space. We also show that the
phenomenon of unidimensional opinions identified by DeMarzo, Vayanos and
Zwiebel (Q J Econ 2003) extends partially to our dynamics. Finally, in the
context of politics, we comment about the possible relation of our results to
the fragmentation of an ideology and the emergence of new political parties.

 <dc:creator>Saghaei, Hamed</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Knowing where the vehicles are, what the drivers doing and monitoring every
event in real time is the key parameters for a well-managed decision-making
process. In this paper, a novel approach for control and monitoring of a fleet
management system using three elements including GPS/GLONASS-based automatic
vehicle locators (called Rad100), GPRS/SMS GSM cellular network and web-based
software (called PayaRadyab) is proposed to show exact position of the desired
vehicle on different maps and take detailed reports of the mission, travelled
path, fuel consumption rate, speed limits, and other necessary information
according to the customers requests. The most significant features of the
proposed system are its global covering, high accuracy of positioning, easy
operation by the user at any location, and easy energy management. In this
study, I have designed and fabricated more than 50 Rad100 trackers and also
programmed a web-based PayaRadyab software in which their performance and
accuracy have been confirmed by the practical results in different conditions.

 <dc:title>Spectral partitioning in equitable graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Graph partitioning problems emerge in a wide variety of complex systems,
ranging from biology to finance, but can be rigorously analyzed and solved only
for a few graph ensembles. Here, an ensemble of equitable graphs, i.e. random
graphs with a block-regular structure, is studied, for which analytical results
can be obtained. In particular, the spectral density of this ensemble is
computed exactly for a modular and bipartite structure. Kesten-McKay's law for
random regular graphs is found analytically to apply also for modular and
bipartite structures when blocks are homogeneous. Exact solution to graph
partitioning for two equal-sized communities is proposed and verified
numerically, and a conjecture on the absence of an efficient recovery
detectability transition in equitable graphs is suggested. Final discussion
summarizes results and outlines their relevance for the solution of graph
partitioning problems in other graph ensembles, in particular for the study of
detectability thresholds and resolution limits in stochastic block models.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the remote estimation of a time-correlated signal using an energy
harvesting (EH) sensor. The sensor observes the unknown signal and communicates
its observations to a remote fusion center using an amplify-and-forward
strategy. We consider the design of optimal power allocation strategies in
order to minimize the mean-square error at the fusion center. Contrary to the
traditional approaches, the degree of correlation between the signal values
constitutes an important aspect of our formulation. We provide the optimal
power allocation strategies for a number of illustrative scenarios. We show
that the most majorized power allocation strategy, i.e. the power allocation as
balanced as possible, is optimal for the cases of circularly wide-sense
stationary (c.w.s.s.) signals with a static correlation coefficient, and
sampled low-pass c.w.s.s. signals for a static channel. We show that the
optimal strategy can be characterized as a water-filling type solution for
sampled low-pass c.w.s.s. signals for a fading channel. Motivated by the
high-complexity of the numerical solution of the optimization problem, we
propose low-complexity policies for the general scenario. Numerical evaluations
illustrate the close performance of these low-complexity policies to that of
the optimal policies, and demonstrate the effect of the EH constraints and the
degree of freedom of the signal.

 <dc:description>  The problem of detecting a change in the drift of a Brownian motion is
considered. The change point is assumed to have a modified exponential prior
distribution with unknown parameters. A worst-case analysis with respect to
these parameters is adopted leading to a min-max problem formulation.
Analytical and numerical justifications are provided towards establishing that
the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure with a specially designed starting point is
exactly optimal for the proposed mathematical setup.

understanding politeness in natural language requests. Our models are based on
simple convolutional neural networks directly on raw text, avoiding any manual
identification of complex sentiment or syntactic features, while performing
better than such feature-based models from previous work. More importantly, we
use the challenging task of politeness prediction as a testbed to next present
a much-needed understanding of what these successful networks are actually
learning. For this, we present several network visualizations based on
activation clusters, first derivative saliency, and embedding space
transformations, helping us automatically identify several subtle linguistics
markers of politeness theories. Further, this analysis reveals multiple novel,
high-scoring politeness strategies which, when added back as new features,
reduce the accuracy gap between the original featurized system and the neural
model, thus providing a clear quantitative interpretation of the success of
these neural networks.

 <dc:title>Computing Majority by Constant Depth Majority Circuits with Low Fan-in
  Gates</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kulikov, Alexander S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Podolskii, Vladimir V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the following computational problem: for which values of $k$, the
majority of $n$ bits $\text{MAJ}_n$ can be computed with a depth two formula
whose each gate computes a majority function of at most $k$ bits? The
corresponding computational model is denoted by $\text{MAJ}_k \circ
\text{MAJ}_k$. We observe that the minimum value of $k$ for which there exists
a $\text{MAJ}_k \circ \text{MAJ}_k$ circuit that has high correlation with the
majority of $n$ bits is equal to $\Theta(n^{1/2})$. We then show that for a
randomized $\text{MAJ}_k \circ \text{MAJ}_k$ circuit computing the majority of
$n$ input bits with high probability for every input, the minimum value of $k$
is equal to $n^{2/3+o(1)}$. We show a worst case lower bound: if a
$\text{MAJ}_k \circ \text{MAJ}_k$ circuit computes the majority of $n$ bits
correctly on all inputs, then $k\geq n^{13/19+o(1)}$. This lower bound exceeds
the optimal value for randomized circuits and thus is unreachable for pure
randomized techniques. For depth $3$ circuits we show that a circuit with $k=
O(n^{2/3})$ can compute $\text{MAJ}_n$ correctly on all inputs.

 <dc:description>  This thesis report studies methods to solve Visual Question-Answering (VQA)
tasks with a Deep Learning framework. As a preliminary step, we explore Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
tackle Question-Answering (text based). We then modify the previous model to
accept an image as an input in addition to the question. For this purpose, we
explore the VGG-16 and K-CNN convolutional neural networks to extract visual
features from the image. These are merged with the word embedding or with a
sentence embedding of the question to predict the answer. This work was
successfully submitted to the Visual Question Answering Challenge 2016, where
it achieved a 53,62% of accuracy in the test dataset. The developed software
has followed the best programming practices and Python code style, providing a
consistent baseline in Keras for different configurations.

 <dc:title>Topological Entropy Bounds for Switched Linear Systems with Lie

 <dc:description>  In this thesis, we provide an initial investigation into bounds for
topological entropy of switched linear systems. Entropy measures, roughly, the
information needed to describe the behavior of a system with finite precision
on finite time horizons, in the limit. After working out entropy computations
in detail for the scalar switched case, we review the linear time-invariant
nonscalar case, and extend to the nonscalar switched case. We assume some
commutation relations among the matrices of the switched system, namely
solvability, define an upper average time of activation quantity and use it to
provide an upper bound on the entropy of the switched system in terms of the
eigenvalues of each subsystem.

 <dc:description>  We show that for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), sub-exponential
size linear programming relaxations are as powerful as $n^{\Omega(1)}$-rounds
of the Sherali-Adams linear programming hierarchy. As a corollary, we obtain
sub-exponential size lower bounds for linear programming relaxations that beat
random guessing for many CSPs such as MAX-CUT and MAX-3SAT. This is a
nearly-exponential improvement over previous results, previously, it was only
known that linear programs of size $n^{o(\log n)}$ cannot beat random guessing
for any CSP (Chan-Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer 2013).
  Our bounds are obtained by exploiting and extending the recent progress in
communication complexity for &quot;lifting&quot; query lower bounds to communication
problems. The main ingredient in our results is a new structural result on
&quot;high-entropy rectangles&quot; that may of independent interest in communication
complexity.

 <dc:description>  We propose Deep Optimistic Linear Support Learning (DOL) to solve
high-dimensional multi-objective decision problems where the relative
importances of the objectives are not known a priori. Using features from the
high-dimensional inputs, DOL computes the convex coverage set containing all
potential optimal solutions of the convex combinations of the objectives. To
our knowledge, this is the first time that deep reinforcement learning has
succeeded in learning multi-objective policies. In addition, we provide a
testbed with two experiments to be used as a benchmark for deep multi-objective
reinforcement learning.

 <dc:description>  Egocentric, or first-person vision which became popular in recent years with
an emerge in wearable technology, is different than exocentric (third-person)
vision in some distinguishable ways, one of which being that the camera wearer
is generally not visible in the video frames. Recent work has been done on
action and object recognition in egocentric videos, as well as work on
biometric extraction from first-person videos. Height estimation can be a
useful feature for both soft-biometrics and object tracking. Here, we propose a
method of estimating the height of an egocentric camera without any calibration
or reference points. We used both traditional computer vision approaches and
deep learning in order to determine the visual cues that results in best height
estimation. Here, we introduce a framework inspired by two stream networks
comprising of two Convolutional Neural Networks, one based on spatial
information, and one based on information given by optical flow in a frame.
Given an egocentric video as an input to the framework, our model yields a
height estimate as an output. We also incorporate late fusion to learn a
combination of temporal and spatial cues. Comparing our model with other
methods we used as baselines, we achieve height estimates for videos with a
Mean Average Error of 14.04 cm over a range of 103 cm of data, and
classification accuracy for relative height (tall, medium or short) up to
93.75% where chance level is 33%.

 <dc:description>  A gambler moves between the vertices $1, \ldots, n$ of a graph using the
probability distribution $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}$. Multiple cops pursue the
gambler on the graph, only being able to move between adjacent vertices. We
investigate the expected capture time for the gambler against $k$ cops as a
function of $n$ and $k$ for three versions of the game: (1) known gambler: the
cops know the gambler's distribution (2) unknown gambler: the cops do not know
the gambler's distribution (3) known changing gambler: the gambler's
distribution can change every turn, but the cops know all of the gambler's
distributions from the beginning. We show for $n &gt; k$ that if the cops are
allowed to choose their initial positions before the game starts and before
they know the gambler's distribution(s), and if both the gambler and the cops
play optimally, then the expected capture time is $\Theta(n/k)$ for the known
gambler, the unknown gambler, and the known changing gambler.

 <dc:description>  To optimize the flow of traffic in IP networks, operators do traffic
engineering (TE), i.e., tune routing-protocol parameters in response to traffic
demands. TE in IP networks typically involves configuring static link weights
and splitting traffic between the resulting shortest-paths via the
Equal-Cost-MultiPath (ECMP) mechanism. Unfortunately, ECMP is a notoriously
cumbersome and indirect means for optimizing traffic flow, often leading to
poor network performance. Also, obtaining accurate knowledge of traffic demands
as the input to TE is elusive, and traffic conditions can be highly variable,
further complicating TE. We leverage recently proposed schemes for increasing
ECMP's expressiveness via carefully disseminated bogus information (&quot;lies&quot;) to
design COYOTE, a readily deployable TE scheme for robust and efficient network
utilization. COYOTE leverages new algorithmic ideas to configure (static)
traffic splitting ratios that are optimized with respect to all (even
adversarially chosen) traffic scenarios within the operator's &quot;uncertainty
bounds&quot;. Our experimental analyses show that COYOTE significantly outperforms
today's prevalent TE schemes in a manner that is robust to traffic uncertainty
and variation. We discuss experiments with a prototype implementation of
COYOTE.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary algorithms have been successfully applied to a variety of
optimisation problems in stationary environments. However, many real world
optimisation problems are set in dynamic environments where the success
criteria shifts regularly. Population diversity affects algorithmic
performance, particularly on multiobjective and dynamic problems. Diversity
mechanisms are methods of altering evolutionary algorithms in a way that
promotes the maintenance of population diversity. This project intends to
measure and compare the performance effect a variety of diversity mechanisms
have on an evolutionary algorithm when facing an assortment of dynamic
problems.

 <dc:title>Channel Estimation in Broadband Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems with

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We develop a broadband channel estimation algorithm for millimeter wave
(mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with few-bit
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Our methodology exploits the joint
sparsity of the mmWave MIMO channel in the angle and delay domains. We
formulate the estimation problem as a noisy quantized compressed-sensing
problem and solve it using efficient approximate message passing (AMP)
algorithms. In particular, we model the angle-delay coefficients using a
Bernoulli-Gaussian-mixture distribution with unknown parameters and use the
expectation-maximization (EM) forms of the generalized AMP (GAMP) and vector
AMP (VAMP) algorithms to simultaneously learn the distributional parameters and
compute approximately minimum mean-squared error (MSE) estimates of the channel
coefficients. We design a training sequence that allows fast, FFT-based
implementation of these algorithms while minimizing peak-to-average power ratio
at the transmitter, making our methods scale efficiently to large numbers of
antenna elements and delays. We present the results of a detailed simulation
study that compares our algorithms to several benchmarks. Our study
investigates the effect of SNR, training length, training type, ADC resolution,
and runtime on channel estimation MSE, mutual information, and achievable rate.
It shows that our methods allow one-bit ADCs to perform comparably to
infinite-bit ADCs at low SNR, and 4-bit ADCs to perform comparably to
infinite-bit ADCs at medium SNR.

 <dc:description>  Linguistic laws constitute one of the quantitative cornerstones of modern
cognitive sciences and have been routinely investigated in written corpora, or
in the equivalent transcription of oral corpora. This means that inferences of
statistical patterns of language in acoustics are biased by the arbitrary,
language-dependent segmentation of the signal, and virtually precludes the
possibility of making comparative studies between human voice and other animal
communication systems. Here we bridge this gap by proposing a method that
allows to measure such patterns in acoustic signals of arbitrary origin,
without needs to have access to the language corpus underneath. The method has
been applied to six different human languages, recovering successfully some
well-known laws of human communication at timescales even below the phoneme and
finding yet another link between complexity and criticality in a biological
system. These methods further pave the way for new comparative studies in
animal communication or the analysis of signals of unknown code.

 <dc:description>  Providing users of HPC systems with a wide variety of up to date software
packages is a challenging task. Large software stacks built from source are
difficult to manage, requiring powerful package management tools. The Portage
package manager from Gentoo is a highly flexible tool that offers a mature
solution to this otherwise daunting task. The Gentoo Prefix project develops
and maintains a way of installing Gentoo systems in non-standard locations,
bringing the virtues of Gentoo to other operating systems. Here we demonstrate
how a Gentoo Prefix installation can be used to cross compile software packages
for the Intel Xeon Phi known as Knights Corner, as well as to manage large
software stacks in HPC environments.

 <dc:description>  Combinatory Category Grammar (CCG) supertagging is a task to assign lexical
categories to each word in a sentence. Almost all previous methods use fixed
context window sizes as input features. However, it is obvious that different
tags usually rely on different context window sizes. These motivate us to build
a supertagger with a dynamic window approach, which can be treated as an
attention mechanism on the local contexts. Applying dropout on the dynamic
filters can be seen as drop on words directly, which is superior to the regular
dropout on word embeddings. We use this approach to demonstrate the
state-of-the-art CCG supertagging performance on the standard test set.

 <dc:description>  Imprecise-information processing will play an indispensable role in
intelligent systems, especially in the anthropomorphic intelligent systems (as
intelligent robots). A new theoretical and technological system of
imprecise-information processing has been founded in Principles of
Imprecise-Information Processing: A New Theoretical and Technological System[1]
which is different from fuzzy technology. The system has clear hierarchy and
rigorous structure, which results from the formation principle of imprecise
information and has solid mathematical and logical bases, and which has many
advantages beyond fuzzy technology. The system provides a technological
platform for relevant applications and lays a theoretical foundation for
further research.

 <dc:description>  Our team won the second prize of the Safe Aging with SPHERE Challenge
organized by SPHERE, in conjunction with ECML-PKDD and Driven Data. The goal of
the competition was to recognize activities performed by humans, using sensor
data. This paper presents our solution. It is based on a rich pre-processing
and state of the art machine learning methods. From the raw train data, we
generate a synthetic train set with the same statistical characteristics as the
test set. We then perform feature engineering. The machine learning modeling
part is based on stacking weak learners through a grid searched XGBoost
algorithm. Finally, we use post-processing to smooth our predictions over time.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel model of 3D elastic mesh is presented for image
segmentation. The model is inspired by stress and strain in physical elastic
objects, while the repulsive force and elastic force in the model are defined
slightly different from the physical force to suit the segmentation problem
well. The self-balancing mechanism in the model guarantees the stability of the
method in segmentation. The shape of the elastic mesh at balance state is used
for region segmentation, in which the sign distribution of the points'z
coordinate values is taken as the basis for segmentation. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is proved by analysis and experimental results for both
test images and real world images.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A novel approach of image matching for rotating transformation is presented
and studied. The approach is inspired by electromagnetic interaction force
between physical currents. The virtual current in images is proposed based on
the significant edge lines extracted as the fundamental structural feature of
images. The virtual electromagnetic force and the corresponding moment is
studied between two images after the extraction of the virtual currents in the
images. Then image matching for rotating transformation is implemented by
exploiting the interaction between the virtual currents in the two images to be
matched. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the novel idea,
which indicates the promising application of the proposed method in image
registration.

 <dc:description>  Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication can improve road safety and traffic
efficiency, particularly around critical areas such as intersections. We
analytically derive V2V success probability near an urban intersection, based
on empirically supported line-of-sight (LOS), weak-line-of-sight (WLOS), and
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel models. The analysis can serve as a
preliminary design tool for performance assessment over different system
parameters and target performance requirements.

 <dc:title>Inverse Diffusion Curves using Shape Optimization</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The inverse diffusion curve problem focuses on automatic creation of
diffusion curve images that resemble user provided color fields. This problem
is challenging since the 1D curves have a nonlinear and global impact on
resulting color fields via a partial differential equation (PDE). We introduce
a new approach complementary to previous methods by optimizing curve geometry.
In particular, we propose a novel iterative algorithm based on the theory of
shape derivatives. The resulting diffusion curves are clean and well-shaped,
and the final image closely approximates the input. Our method provides a
user-controlled parameter to regularize curve complexity, and generalizes to
handle input color fields represented in a variety of formats.

 <dc:title>Electoral Competition under Best-Worst Voting Rules</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cahan, Dodge</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We characterise multi-candidate pure-strategy equilibria in the
Hotelling-Downs spatial election model for the class of best-worst voting
rules, in which each voter is endowed with both a positive and a negative vote,
i.e., each voter can vote in favour of one candidate and against another one.
The weights attached to positive and negative votes in calculating a
candidate's net score may be different, so that a negative vote and a positive
vote need not cancel out exactly. These rules combine the first-place seeking
incentives of plurality with the incentives to avoid being ranked last of
anti-plurality. We show that these rules generally admit equilibria, which are
nonconvergent if and only if the importance of a positive vote exceeds that of
a negative vote. The set of equilibria in the latter case is very similar to
that of plurality, except that the platforms are less extreme due to the
moderating effect of negative votes. Moreover, any degree of dispersion between
plurality, at one extreme, and full convergence, at the other, can be attained
for the correct choice of the weights.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an algorithm for solving the problem of tracking smooth
curves by a fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle travelling with a constant
airspeed and under a constant wind disturbance. The algorithm is based on the
idea of following a guiding vector field which is constructed from the implicit
function that describes the desired (possibly time-varying) trajectory. The
output of the algorithm can be directly expressed in terms of the bank angle of
the UAV in order to achieve coordinated turns. Furthermore, the algorithm can
be tuned offline such that physical constraints of the UAV, e.g. the maximum
bank angle, will not be violated in a neighborhood of the desired trajectory.
We provide the corresponding theoretical convergence analysis and performance
results from actual flights.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To ensure the low end-to-end (E2E) delay for tactile internet, short frame
structures will be used in 5G systems. As such, transmission errors with finite
blocklength channel codes should be considered to guarantee the high
reliability requirement. In this paper, we study cross-layer transmission
optimization for tactile internet, where both queueing delay and transmission
delay are accounted for in the E2E delay, and different packet loss/error
probabilities are considered to characterize the reliability. We show that the
required transmit power becomes unbounded when the allowed maximal queueing
delay is shorter than the channel coherence time. To satisfy quality-of-service
requirement with finite transmit power, we introduce a proactive packet
dropping mechanism, and optimize a queue state information and channel state
information dependent transmission policy. Since the resource and policy for
transmission and the packet dropping policy are related to the packet error
probability, queueing delay violation probability, and packet dropping
probability, we optimize the three probabilities and obtain the policies
related to these probabilities. We start from single-user scenario and then
extend our framework to the multi-user scenario. Simulation results show that
the optimized three probabilities are in the same order of magnitude.
Therefore, we have to take into account all these factors when we design
systems for tactile internet applications.

 <dc:description>  Transparent authentication (TA) schemes are those in which a user is
authenticated by a verifier without requiring explicit user interaction. By
doing so, those schemes promise high usability and security simultaneously. The
majority of TA implementations rely on the received signal strength as an
indicator for the proximity of a user device (prover). However, such implicit
proximity verification is not secure against an adversary who can relay
messages over a larger distance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
thwarting relay attacks in TA schemes: the prover permits access to
authentication credentials only if it can confirm that it is near the verifier.
We present STASH, a system for relay-resilient transparent authentication in
which the prover does proximity verification by comparing its approach
trajectory towards the intended verifier with known authorized reference
trajectories. Trajectories are measured using low-cost sensors commonly
available on personal devices. We demonstrate the security of STASH against a
class of adversaries and its ease-of-use by analyzing empirical data, collected
using a STASH prototype. STASH is efficient and can be easily integrated to
complement existing TA schemes.

 <dc:description>  We describe an attentive encoder that combines tree-structured recursive
neural networks and sequential recurrent neural networks for modelling sentence
pairs. Since existing attentive models exert attention on the sequential
structure, we propose a way to incorporate attention into the tree topology.
Specially, given a pair of sentences, our attentive encoder uses the
representation of one sentence, which generated via an RNN, to guide the
structural encoding of the other sentence on the dependency parse tree. We
evaluate the proposed attentive encoder on three tasks: semantic similarity,
paraphrase identification and true-false question selection. Experimental
results show that our encoder outperforms all baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two tasks.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of robust compressed sensing whose objective is to
recover a high-dimensional sparse signal from compressed measurements corrupted
by outliers. A new sparse Bayesian learning method is developed for robust
compressed sensing. The basic idea of the proposed method is to identify and
remove the outliers from sparse signal recovery. To automatically identify the
outliers, we employ a set of binary indicator hyperparameters to indicate which
observations are outliers. These indicator hyperparameters are treated as
random variables and assigned a beta process prior such that their values are
confined to be binary. In addition, a Gaussian-inverse Gamma prior is imposed
on the sparse signal to promote sparsity. Based on this hierarchical prior
model, we develop a variational Bayesian method to estimate the indicator
hyperparameters as well as the sparse signal. Simulation results show that the
proposed method achieves a substantial performance improvement over existing
robust compressed sensing techniques.

 <dc:title>Energy Efficient Design for Tactile Internet</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Ensuring the ultra-low end-to-end latency and ultrahigh reliability required
by tactile internet is challenging. This is especially true when the stringent
Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement is expected to be satisfied not at the
cost of significantly reducing spectral efficiency and energy efficiency (EE).
In this paper, we study how to maximize the EE for tactile internet under the
stringent QoS constraint, where both queueing delay and transmission delay are
taken into account. We first validate that the upper bound of queueing delay
violation probability derived from the effective bandwidth can be used to
characterize the queueing delay violation probability in the short delay regime
for Poisson arrival process. However, the upper bound is not tight for short
delay, which leads to conservative designs and hence leads to wasting energy.
To avoid this, we optimize resource allocation that depends on the queue state
information and channel state information. Analytical results show that with a
large number of transmit antennas the EE achieved by the proposed policy
approaches to the EE limit achieved for infinite delay bound, which implies
that the policy does not lead to any EE loss. Simulation and numerical results
show that even for not-so-large number of antennas, the EE achieved by the
proposed policy is still close to the EE limit.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach to distinguish driving styles with
respect to their energy efficiency. A distinct property of our method is that
it relies exclusively on Global Positioning System (GPS) logs of drivers. This
setting is highly relevant in practice as these data can easily be acquired.
  Relying on positional data alone means that all derived features will be
correlated, so we strive to find a single quantity that allows us to perform
the driving style analysis. To this end we consider a robust variation of the
so called jerk of a movement. We show that our feature choice outperforms other
more commonly used jerk-based formulations and we discuss the handling of
noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete data as this is a notorious problem when
dealing with real-world GPS logs.
  Our solving strategy relies on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering
combined with an L-term heuristic to determine the relevant number of clusters.
It can easily be implemented and performs fast, even on very large, real-world
data sets. Experiments show that our approach is robust against noise and able
to discern different driving styles.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we study how to design uplink transmission with massive machine
type devices in tactile internet, where ultra-short delay and ultra-high
reliability are required. To characterize the transmission reliability
constraint, we employ a two-state transmission model based on the achievable
rate with finite blocklength channel codes. If the channel gain exceeds a
threshold, a short packet can be transmitted with a small error probability;
otherwise there is a packet loss. To exploit frequency diversity, we assign
multiple subchannels to each active device, from which the device selects a
subchannel with channel gain exceeding the threshold for transmission. To show
the total bandwidth required to ensure the reliability, we optimize the number
of subchannels and bandwidth of each subchannel and the threshold for each
device to minimize the total bandwidth of the system with a given number of
antennas at the base station. Numerical results show that with 1000 devices in
one cell, the required bandwidth of the optimized policy is acceptable even for
prevalent cellular systems. Furthermore, we show that by increasing antennas at
the BS, frequency diversity becomes unnecessary, and the required bandwidth is
reduced.

 <dc:title>Redundancies in Linear Systems with two Variables per Inequality</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fukuda, Komei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Szedlak, May</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of detecting and removing redundant constraints is fundamental in
optimization. We focus on the case of linear programs (LPs), given by $d$
variables with $n$ inequality constraints. A constraint is called
\emph{redundant}, if after its removal, the LP still has the same feasible
region. The currently fastest method to detect all redundancies is due to
Clarkson: it solves $n$ linear programs, but each of them has at most $s$
constraints, where $s$ is the number of nonredundant constraints.
  In this paper, we study the special case where every constraint has at most
two variables with nonzero coefficients. This family, denoted by $LI(2)$, has
some nice properties. Namely, as shown by Aspvall and Shiloach, given a
variable $x_i$ and a value $\lambda$, we can test in time $O(nd)$ whether there
is a feasible solution with $x_i = \lambda$. Hochbaum and Naor present an
$O(d^2 n \log n)$ algorithm for solving the feasibility problem in $LI(2)$.
Their technique makes use of the Fourier-Motzkin elimination method and the
earlier mentioned result by Aspvall and Shiloach.
  We present a strongly polynomial algorithm that solves redundancy detection
in time $O(n d^2 s \log s)$. It uses a modification of Clarkson's algorithm,
together with a revised version of Hochbaum and Naor's technique. Finally we
show that dimensionality testing can be done with the same running time as
solving feasibility.

 <dc:title>Diversity Extraction for Multicarrier Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
  Distribution</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gyongyosi, Laszlo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a diversity extraction for multicarrier continuous-variable (CV)
quantum key distribution (QKD). The diversity extraction utilizes the resources
that are injected into the transmission by the additional degrees of freedom of
the multicarrier modulation. The multicarrier scheme granulates the information
into Gaussian subcarrier CVs and divides the physical link into several
Gaussian sub-channels for the transmission. We prove that the exploitable extra
degree of freedom in a multicarrier CVQKD scenario significantly extends the
possibilities of single-carrier CVQKD. The diversity extraction allows for the
parties to reach decreased error probabilities by utilizing those extra
resources of a multicarrier transmission that are not available in a
single-carrier CVQKD setting. The additional resources of multicarrier CVQKD
allow the achievement of significant performance improvements that are
particularly crucial in an experimental scenario.

 <dc:title>Iterative Secret Key Rate Adapting with Error Minimization for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We define an iterative error-minimizing secret key adapting method for
multicarrier CVQKD. A multicarrier CVQKD protocol uses Gaussian subcarrier
quantum continuous variables (CVs) for the transmission. The proposed method
allows for the parties to reach a given target secret key rate with minimized
error rate through the Gaussian sub-channels by a sub-channel adaption
procedure. The adaption algorithm iteratively determines the optimal transmit
conditions to achieve the target secret key rate and the minimal error rate
over the sub-channels. The solution requires no complex calculations or
computational tools, allowing for easy implementation for experimental CVQKD
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In multi-hop secondary networks, bidding strategies for spectrum auction,
route selection and relaying incentives should be jointly considered to
establish multi-hop communication. In this paper, a framework for joint
resource bidding and tipping is developed where users iteratively revise their
strategies, which include bidding and incentivizing relays, to achieve their
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. A bidding language is designed to
generalize secondary users' heterogeneous demands for multiple resources and
willingness to pay. Then, group partitioning-based auction mechanisms are
presented to exploit the heterogeneity of SU demands in multi-hop secondary
networks. These mechanisms include primary operator (PO) strategies based on
static and dynamic partition schemes combined with new payment mechanisms to
obtain high revenue and fairly allocate the resources. The proposed auction
schemes stimulate the participation of SUs and provide high revenue for the PO
while maximizing the social welfare. Besides, they satisfy the properties of
truthfulness, individual rationality and computational tractability. Simulation
results have shown that for highly demanding users the static group scheme
achieves 150% more winners and 3 times higher revenue for the PO compared to a
scheme without grouping. For lowly demanding users, the PO may keep similar
revenue with the dynamic scheme by lowering 50% the price per channel as the
number of winners will increase proportionally.

techniques to rank research institutions based on publications. Rank importance
of research institutions are derived from predictions on the number of full
research papers that would potentially get accepted in upcoming top-tier
conferences, utilizing public information on the web. This paper describes our
solution to KDD Cup 2016. We used a two step approach in which we first
identify full research papers corresponding to each conference of interest and
then train two variants of exponential smoothing models to make predictions.
Our solution achieves an overall score of 0.7508, while the winning submission
scored 0.7656 in the overall results.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores how the in- and out-domain probabilistic linear
discriminant analysis (PLDA) speaker verification behave when enrolment and
verification lengths are reduced. Experiment studies have found that when
full-length utterance is used for evaluation, in-domain PLDA approach shows
more than 28% improvement in EER and DCF values over out-domain PLDA approach
and when short utterances are used for evaluation, the performance gain of
in-domain speaker verification reduces at an increasing rate. Novel modified
inter dataset variability (IDV) compensation is used to compensate the mismatch
between in- and out-domain data and IDV-compensated out-domain PLDA shows
respectively 26% and 14% improvement over out-domain PLDA speaker verification
when SWB and NIST data are respectively used for S normalization. When the
evaluation utterance length is reduced, the performance gain by IDV also
reduces as short utterance evaluation data i-vectors have more variations due
to phonetic variations when compared to the dataset mismatch between in- and
out-domain data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study a family of algorithms, introduced by Chan [SODA 1999]
and called LR-algorithms, for drawing ordered rooted binary trees. In
particular, we are interested in constructing LR-drawings (that are drawings
obtained via LR-algorithms) with small width. Chan showed three different
LR-algorithms that achieve, for an ordered rooted binary tree with $n$ nodes,
width $O(n^{0.695})$, width $O(n^{0.5})$, and width $O(n^{0.48})$.
  We prove that, for every $n$-node ordered rooted binary tree, an LR-drawing
with minimum width can be constructed in $O(n^{1.48})$ time. Further, we show
an infinite family of $n$-node ordered rooted binary trees requiring
$\Omega(n^{0.418})$ width in any LR-drawing; no lower bound better than
$\Omega(\log n)$ was previously known. Finally, we present the results of an
experimental evaluation that allowed us to determine the minimum width of all
the ordered rooted binary trees with up to $451$ nodes.
  Our interest in LR-drawings is mainly motivated by a result of Di Battista
and Frati [Algorithmica 2009], who proved that $n$-vertex outerplanar graphs
have outerplanar straight-line drawings in $O(n^{1.48})$ area by means of a
drawing algorithm which resembles an LR-algorithm.
  We deepen the connection between LR-drawings and outerplanar straight-line
drawings by proving that, if $n$-node ordered rooted binary trees have
LR-drawings with $f(n)$ width, for any function $f(n)$, then $n$-vertex
outerplanar graphs have outerplanar straight-line drawings in $O(f(n))$ area.
  Finally, we exploit a structural decomposition for ordered rooted binary
trees introduced by Chan in order to prove that every $n$-vertex outerplanar
graph has an outerplanar straight-line drawing in $O(n\cdot 2^{\sqrt{2 \log_2
n}} \sqrt{\log n})$ area.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning has been previously shown to speed up the
convergence rate of RL planning algorithms as well as mitigate feature-based
model misspecification (Mankowitz et. al. 2016a,b, Bacon 2015). To do so, it
utilizes hierarchical abstractions, also known as skills -- a type of
temporally extended action (Sutton et. al. 1999) to plan at a higher level,
abstracting away from the lower-level details. We incorporate risk sensitivity,
also referred to as Situational Awareness (SA), into hierarchical RL for the
first time by defining and learning risk aware skills in a Probabilistic Goal
Semi-Markov Decision Process (PG-SMDP). This is achieved using our novel
Situational Awareness by Risk-Conscious Skills (SARiCoS) algorithm which comes
with a theoretical convergence guarantee. We show in a RoboCup soccer domain
that the learned risk aware skills exhibit complex human behaviors such as
`time-wasting' in a soccer game. In addition, the learned risk aware skills are
able to mitigate reward-based model misspecification.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a technique for automatic gain tuning of a momentum based
balancing controller for humanoid robots. The controller ensures the
stabilization of the centroidal dynamics and the associated zero dynamics.
Then, the closed-loop, constrained joint space dynamics is linearized and the
controller's gains are chosen so as to obtain desired properties of the
linearized system. Symmetry and positive definiteness constraints of gain
matrices are enforced by proposing a tracker for symmetric positive definite
matrices. Simulation results are carried out on the humanoid robot iCub.

 <dc:description>  We propose Impatient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) which deal with dynamic time
budgets during application. They allow for individual budgets given a priori
for each test example and for anytime prediction, i.e., a possible interruption
at multiple stages during inference while still providing output estimates. Our
approach can therefore tackle the computational costs and energy demands of
DNNs in an adaptive manner, a property essential for real-time applications.
Our Impatient DNNs are based on a new general framework of learning dynamic
budget predictors using risk minimization, which can be applied to current DNN
architectures by adding early prediction and additional loss layers. A key
aspect of our method is that all of the intermediate predictors are learned
jointly. In experiments, we evaluate our approach for different budget
distributions, architectures, and datasets. Our results show a significant gain
in expected accuracy compared to common baselines.

 <dc:description>  The realisation of sensing modalities based on the principles of compressed
sensing is often hindered by discrepancies between the mathematical model of
its sensing operator, which is necessary during signal recovery, and its actual
physical implementation, which can amply differ from the assumed model. In this
paper we tackle the bilinear inverse problem of recovering a sparse input
signal and some unknown, unstructured multiplicative factors affecting the
sensors that capture each compressive measurement. Our methodology relies on
collecting a few snapshots under new draws of the sensing operator, and
applying a greedy algorithm based on projected gradient descent and the
principles of iterative hard thresholding. We explore empirically the sample
complexity requirements of this algorithm by testing its phase transition, and
show in a practically relevant instance of this problem for compressive imaging
that the exact solution can be obtained with only a few snapshots.

 <dc:description>  The availability heuristic is a strategy that people use to make quick
decisions but often lead to systematic errors. We propose three ways that
visualization could facilitate unbiased decision-making. First, visualizations
can alter the way our memory stores the events for later recall, so as to
improve users' long-term intuitions. Second, the known biases could lead to new
visualization guidelines. Third, we suggest the design of decision-making tools
that are inspired by heuristics, e.g. suggesting intuitive approximations,
rather than target to present exhaustive comparisons of all possible outcomes,
or automated solutions for choosing decisions.

 <dc:title>An Encoding for Order-Preserving Matching</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Encoding data structures store enough information to answer the queries they
are meant to support but not enough to recover their underlying datasets. In
this paper we give the first encoding data structure for the challenging
problem of order-preserving pattern matching. This problem was introduced only
a few years ago but has already attracted significant attention because of its
applications in data analysis. Two strings are said to be an order-preserving
match if the {\em relative order} of their characters is the same: e.g., $4, 1,
3, 2$ and $10, 3, 7, 5$ are an order-preserving match. We show how, given a
string $S [1..n]$ over an arbitrary alphabet and a constant $c \geq 1$, we can
build an $O (n \log \log n)$-bit encoding such that later, given a pattern $P
[1..m]$ with $m \leq \lg^c n$, we can return the number of order-preserving
occurrences of $P$ in $S$ in $O (m)$ time. Within the same time bound we can
also return the starting position of some order-preserving match for $P$ in $S$
(if such a match exists). We prove that our space bound is within a constant
factor of optimal; our query time is optimal if $\log \sigma = \Omega(\log n)$.
Our space bound contrasts with the $\Omega (n \log n)$ bits needed in the worst
case to store $S$ itself, an index for order-preserving pattern matching with
no restrictions on the pattern length, or an index for standard pattern
matching even with restrictions on the pattern length. Moreover, we can build
our encoding knowing only how each character compares to $O (\lg^c n)$
neighbouring characters.

 <dc:description>  The importance of timely response to natural disasters and evacuating
affected people to safe areas is paramount to save lives. Emergency services
are often handicapped by the amount of rescue resources at their disposal. We
present a system that leverages the power of a social network forming new
connections among people based on \textit{real-time location} and expands the
rescue resources pool by adding private sector cars. We also introduce a
car-sharing algorithm to identify safe routes in an emergency with the aim of
minimizing evacuation time, maximizing pick-up of people without cars, and
avoiding traffic congestion.

 <dc:description>  We perform a special number field sieve discrete logarithm computation in a
1024-bit prime field. To our knowledge, this is the first kilobit-sized
discrete logarithm computation ever reported for prime fields. This computation
took a little over two months of calendar time on an academic cluster using the
open-source CADO-NFS software. Our chosen prime $p$ looks random, and $p--1$
has a 160-bit prime factor, in line with recommended parameters for the Digital
Signature Algorithm. However, our p has been trapdoored in such a way that the
special number field sieve can be used to compute discrete logarithms in
$\mathbb{F}\_p^*$ , yet detecting that p has this trapdoor seems out of reach.
Twenty-five years ago, there was considerable controversy around the
possibility of back-doored parameters for DSA. Our computations show that
trapdoored primes are entirely feasible with current computing technology. We
also describe special number field sieve discrete log computations carried out
for multiple weak primes found in use in the wild. As can be expected from a
trapdoor mechanism which we say is hard to detect, our research did not reveal
any trapdoored prime in wide use. The only way for a user to defend against a
hypothetical trapdoor of this kind is to require verifiably random primes.

 <dc:description>  Local Process Model (LPM) discovery is focused on the mining of a set of
process models where each model describes the behavior represented in the event
log only partially, i.e. subsets of possible events are taken into account to
create so-called local process models. Often such smaller models provide
valuable insights into the behavior of the process, especially when no adequate
and comprehensible single overall process model exists that is able to describe
the traces of the process from start to end. The practical application of LPM
discovery is however hindered by computational issues in the case of logs with
many activities (problems may already occur when there are more than 17 unique
activities). In this paper, we explore three heuristics to discover subsets of
activities that lead to useful log projections with the goal of speeding up LPM
discovery considerably while still finding high-quality LPMs. We found that a
Markov clustering approach to create projection sets results in the largest
improvement of execution time, with discovered LPMs still being better than
with the use of randomly generated activity sets of the same size. Another
heuristic, based on log entropy, yields a more moderate speedup, but enables
the discovery of higher quality LPMs. The third heuristic, based on the
relative information gain, shows unstable performance: for some data sets the
speedup and LPM quality are higher than with the log entropy based method,
while for other data sets there is no speedup at all.

 <dc:description>  Anomalous random walks having long-range jumps are a critical branch of
dynamical processes on networks, which can model a number of search and
transport processes. However, traditional measurements based on mean first
passage time are not useful as they fail to characterize the cost associated
with each jump. Here we introduce a new concept of mean first traverse distance
(MFTD) to characterize anomalous random walks that represents the expected
traverse distance taken by walkers searching from source node to target node,
and we provide a procedure for calculating the MFTD between two nodes. We use
Levy walks on networks as an example, and demonstrate that the proposed
approach can unravel the interplay between diffusion dynamics of Levy walks and
the underlying network structure. Interestingly, applying our framework to the
famous PageRank search, we can explain why its damping factor empirically
chosen to be around 0.85. The framework for analyzing anomalous random walks on
complex networks offers a new useful paradigm to understand the dynamics of
anomalous diffusion processes, and provides a unified scheme to characterize
search and transport processes on networks.

 <dc:description>  This letter summarizes some known properties and also presents several new
properties of the Numerical Integration (NI) method for time-optimal trajectory
planning along a specified path. The contribution is that rigorous mathematical
proofs of these properties are presented, most of which cannot be found in
existing literatures. We first give some properties regarding switch points and
accelerating/decelerating curves of the NI method. Then, for the fact that when
kinematic constraints are considered, the original version of NI which only
considers torque constraints may result in failure of trajectory planning, we
give the concrete failure conditions with rigorous mathematical proof.
Accordingly, a failure detection algorithm is given in a run-and-test manner.
Some simulation results on a unicycle vehicle are provided to verify those
presented properties. Note that though those known properties are not
discovered first, their mathematical proofs are given first in this letter. The
detailed proofs make the theory of NI more complete and help interested readers
to gain a thorough understanding of the method.

 <dc:title>Hardening Cassandra Against Byzantine Failures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Cassandra is one of the most widely used distributed data stores these days.
Cassandra supports flexible consistency guarantees over a wide-column data
access model and provides almost linear scale-out performance. This enables
application developers to tailor the performance and availability of Cassandra
to their exact application's needs and required semantics. Yet, Cassandra is
designed to withstand benign failures, and cannot cope with most forms of
Byzantine attacks.
  In this work, we present an analysis of Cassandra's vulnerabilities and
propose protocols for hardening Cassandra against Byzantine failures. We
examine several alternative design choices and compare between them both
qualitatively and empirically by using the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark
(YCSB) performance benchmark. We include incremental performance analysis for
our algorithmic and cryptographic adjustments, supporting our design choices.

 <dc:description>  The randomized version of the Kaczmarz method for the solution of linear
systems is known to converge linearly in expectation. In this work we extend
this result and show that the recently proposed Randomized Sparse Kaczmarz
method for recovery of sparse solutions, as well as many variants, also
converges linearly in expectation. The result is achieved in the framework of
split feasibility problems and their solution by randomized Bregman projections
with respect to strongly convex functions. To obtain the expected convergence
rates we prove extensions of error bounds for projections. The convergence
result is shown to hold in more general settings involving smooth convex
functions, piecewise linear-quadratic functions and also the regularized
nuclear norm, which is used in the area of low rank matrix problems. Numerical
experiments indicate that the Randomized Sparse Kaczmarz method provides
advantages over both the non-randomized and the non-sparse Kaczmarz methods for
the solution of over- and under-determined linear systems.

 <dc:description>  It is difficult to train a personalized task-oriented dialogue system because
the data collected from each individual is often insufficient. Personalized
dialogue systems trained on a small dataset can overfit and make it difficult
to adapt to different user needs. One way to solve this problem is to consider
a collection of multiple users' data as a source domain and an individual
user's data as a target domain, and to perform a transfer learning from the
source to the target domain. By following this idea, we propose
&quot;PETAL&quot;(PErsonalized Task-oriented diALogue), a transfer-learning framework
based on POMDP to learn a personalized dialogue system. The system first learns
common dialogue knowledge from the source domain and then adapts this knowledge
to the target user. This framework can avoid the negative transfer problem by
considering differences between source and target users. The policy in the
personalized POMDP can learn to choose different actions appropriately for
different users. Experimental results on a real-world coffee-shopping data and
simulation data show that our personalized dialogue system can choose different
optimal actions for different users, and thus effectively improve the dialogue
quality under the personalized setting.

 <dc:description>  Increasing mobile data demands in current cellular networks and proliferation
of advanced handheld devices have given rise to a new generation of dynamic
network architectures (DNAs). In a DNA, users share their connectivities and
act as access points providing Internet connections for others without
additional network infrastructure cost. A large number of users and their
dynamic connections make DNA highly adaptive to variations in the network and
suitable for low cost ubiquitous Internet connectivity. In this article, we
propose a novel collaborative cognitive dynamic network architecture (CDNA)
which incorporates cognitive capabilities to exploit underutilized spectrum in
a more flexible and intelligent way. The design principles of CDNA are
perfectly aligned to the functionality requirements of future 5G wireless
networks such as energy and spectrum efficiency, scalability, dynamic
reconfigurability, support for multi-hop communications, infrastructure
sharing, and multi-operator cooperation. A case study with a new resource
allocation problem enabled by CDNA is conducted using matching theory with
pricing to illustrate the potential benefits of CDNA for users and operators,
tackle user associations for data and spectrum trading with low complexity, and
enable self-organizing capabilities. Finally, possible challenges and future
research directions are given.

 <dc:title>Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) in Remote Clinical Diagnosis and

 <dc:description>  Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) locates, retrieves and displays images
alike to one given as a query, using a set of features. It demands accessible
data in medical archives and from medical equipment, to infer meaning after
some processing. A problem similar in some sense to the target image can aid
clinicians. CBIR complements text-based retrieval and improves evidence-based
diagnosis, administration, teaching, and research in healthcare. It facilitates
visual/automatic diagnosis and decision-making in real-time remote
consultation/screening, store-and-forward tests, home care assistance and
overall patient surveillance. Metrics help comparing visual data and improve
diagnostic. Specially designed architectures can benefit from the application
scenario. CBIR use calls for file storage standardization, querying procedures,
efficient image transmission, realistic databases, global availability, access
simplicity, and Internet-based structures. This chapter recommends important
and complex aspects required to handle visual content in healthcare.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of network embedding, which aims at
learning low-dimensional vector representation of nodes in networks. Most
existing network embedding methods rely solely on the network structure, i.e.,
the linkage relationships between nodes, but ignore the rich content
information associated with it, which is common in real world networks and
beneficial to describing the characteristics of a node. In this paper, we
propose content-enhanced network embedding (CENE), which is capable of jointly
leveraging the network structure and the content information. Our approach
integrates text modeling and structure modeling in a general framework by
treating the content information as a special kind of node. Experiments on
several real world net- works with application to node classification show that
our models outperform all existing network embedding methods, demonstrating the
merits of content information and joint learning.

 <dc:title>Fundamental difference between superblockers and superspreaders in

 <dc:description>  Two very important problems regarding spreading phenomena in complex
topologies are the optimal selection of node sets either to minimize or
maximize the extent of outbreaks. Both problems are nontrivial when a small
fraction of the nodes in the network can be used to achieve the desired goal.
The minimization problem is equivalent to a structural optimization. The
&quot;superblockers&quot;, i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to
minimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components
as small as possible. &quot;Superspreaders&quot; are instead the nodes such that, if
chosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity
of superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on
the specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the
two optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers
act also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking
importance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture.
In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world
networks to test the similarity between sets of superblockers and of
superspreaders. We show that the two optimization problems are not equivalent:
superblockers do not act as optimal spreaders.

 <dc:title>Achievable Rate and Energy Efficiency of Hybrid and Digital Beamforming
  Receivers with Low Resolution ADC</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For 5G it will be important to leverage the available millimeter wave
spectrum. To achieve an approximately omni- directional coverage with a similar
effective antenna aperture compared to state of the art cellular systems, an
antenna array is required at both the mobile and basestation. Due to the large
bandwidth and inefficient amplifiers available in CMOS for mmWave, the analog
front-end of the receiver with a large number of antennas becomes especially
power hungry. Two main solutions exist to reduce the power consumption: Hybrid
BeamForming (HBF) and Digital BeamForming (DBF) with low resolution ADC. Hybrid
beamforming can also be combined with low resolution ADCs. This paper compares
the spectral and energy efficiency based on the chosen RF-frontend
configuration. A channel with multipath propagation is used. In contrast to
previous publication, we take the spatial correlation of the quantization noise
into account. We show that the low resolution ADC are robust to small Automatic
Gain Control (AGC) imperfections. We showed that in the low SNR regime the
performance of DBF even with 1-2 bit resolution outperforms HBF. If we consider
the relationship of spectral and energy efficiency then DBF with 3-5 bits
resolution achieves the best ratio of spectral efficiency per power consumption
of the RF receiver frontend over a very wide SNR region. The power consumption
model is based on components reported in literature.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown remarkable performance
in image classification tasks in recent years. Generally, deep neural network
architectures are stacks consisting of a large number of convolutional layers,
and they perform downsampling along the spatial dimension via pooling to reduce
memory usage. Concurrently, the feature map dimension (i.e., the number of
channels) is sharply increased at downsampling locations, which is essential to
ensure effective performance because it increases the diversity of high-level
attributes. This also applies to residual networks and is very closely related
to their performance. In this research, instead of sharply increasing the
feature map dimension at units that perform downsampling, we gradually increase
the feature map dimension at all units to involve as many locations as
possible. This design, which is discussed in depth together with our new
insights, has proven to be an effective means of improving generalization
ability. Furthermore, we propose a novel residual unit capable of further
improving the classification accuracy with our new network architecture.
Experiments on benchmark CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets have shown
that our network architecture has superior generalization ability compared to
the original residual networks. Code is available at

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of Gaussian mixture clustering in the
high-dimensional limit where the data consists of $m$ points in $n$ dimensions,
$n,m \rightarrow \infty$ and $\alpha = m/n$ stays finite. Using exact but
non-rigorous methods from statistical physics, we determine the critical value
of $\alpha$ and the distance between the clusters at which it becomes
information-theoretically possible to reconstruct the membership into clusters
better than chance. We also determine the accuracy achievable by the
Bayes-optimal estimation algorithm. In particular, we find that when the number
of clusters is sufficiently large, $r &gt; 4 + 2 \sqrt{\alpha}$, there is a gap
between the threshold for information-theoretically optimal performance and the
threshold at which known algorithms succeed.

 <dc:description>  Decoupling uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) is a new architectural paradigm
where DL and UL are not constrained to be associated to the same base station
(BS). Building upon this paradigm, the goal of the present paper is to provide
lower, albeit tight bounds for the ergodic UL capacity of a decoupled cellular
network. The analysis is performed for a scenario consisting of a macro BS and
a set of small cells (SCs) whose positions are selected randomly according to a
Poisson point process of a given spatial density. Based on this analysis simple
bounds in closed form expressions are defined. The devised bounds are employed
to compare the performance of the decoupled case versus a set of benchmark
cases, namely the coupled case, and the situations of having either a single
macro BS or only SCs. This comparison provides valuable insights regarding the
behavior and performance of such networks, providing simpler expressions for
the ergodic UL capacity as a function of the distances to the macro BS and the
density of SCs. These expressions constitute a simple guide to the minimum
degree of densification that guarantees the Quality of Service (QoS) objectives
of the network, thus, providing a valuable tool to the network operator of
significant practical and commercial value.

 <dc:description>  An interesting research problem in our age of Big Data is that of determining
provenance. Granular evaluation of provenance of physical goods--e.g. tracking
ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating authenticity of luxury
goods--has often not been possible with today's items that are produced and
transported in complex, inter-organizational, often internationally-spanning
supply chains. Recent adoption of Internet of Things and Blockchain
technologies give promise at better supply chain provenance. We are
particularly interested in the blockchain as many favoured use cases of
blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying
ontologies as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance,
traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a
case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this
case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its
representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce
traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.

 <dc:description>  Surveillance system (SS) development requires hi-tech support to prevail over
the shortcomings related to the massive quantity of visual information from
SSs. Anything but reduced human monitoring became impossible by means of its
physical and economic implications, and an advance towards an automated
surveillance becomes the only way out. When it comes to a computer vision
system, automatic video event comprehension is a challenging task due to motion
clutter, event understanding under complex scenes, multilevel semantic event
inference, contextualization of events and views obtained from multiple
cameras, unevenness of motion scales, shape changes, occlusions and object
interactions among lots of other impairments. In recent years, state-of-the-art
models for video event classification and recognition include modeling events
to discern context, detecting incidents with only one camera, low-level feature
extraction and description, high-level semantic event classification, and
recognition. Even so, it is still very burdensome to recuperate or label a
specific video part relying solely on its content. Principal component analysis
(PCA) has been widely known and used, but when combined with other techniques
such as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm its computation becomes
more efficient. This chapter introduces advances associated with the concept of
Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) analysis of video event and it also aims at looking
closely to ways and metrics to evaluate these less intensive EM implementations
of PCA and KPCA.

 <dc:description>  We continue the recent line of research studying information dissemination
problems in adversarial dynamic radio networks. We give two generic algorithms
which allow to transform generalized version of single-message broadcast
algorithms into multi-message broadcast algorithms. Based on these generic
algorithms, we obtain multi-message broadcast algorithms for dynamic radio
networks for a number of different dynamic network settings. For one of the
modeling assumptions, our algorithms are complemented by a lower bound which
shows that the upper bound is close to optimal.

 <dc:description>  We consider distributed multitask learning problems over a network of agents
where each agent is interested in estimating its own parameter vector, also
called task, and where the tasks at neighboring agents are related according to
a set of linear equality constraints. Each agent possesses its own convex cost
function of its parameter vector and a set of linear equality constraints
involving its own parameter vector and the parameter vectors of its neighboring
agents. We propose an adaptive stochastic algorithm based on the projection
gradient method and diffusion strategies in order to allow the network to
optimize the individual costs subject to all constraints. Although the
derivation is carried out for linear equality constraints, the technique can be
applied to other forms of convex constraints. We conduct a detailed
mean-square-error analysis of the proposed algorithm and derive closed-form
expressions to predict its learning behavior. We provide simulations to
illustrate the theoretical findings. Finally, the algorithm is employed for
solving two problems in a distributed manner: a minimum-cost flow problem over
a network and a space-time varying field reconstruction problem.

 <dc:description>  We propose a high-level concept word detector that can be integrated with any
video-to-language models. It takes a video as input and generates a list of
concept words as useful semantic priors for language generation models. The
proposed word detector has two important properties. First, it does not require
any external knowledge sources for training. Second, the proposed word detector
is trainable in an end-to-end manner jointly with any video-to-language models.
To maximize the values of detected words, we also develop a semantic attention
mechanism that selectively focuses on the detected concept words and fuse them
with the word encoding and decoding in the language model. In order to
demonstrate that the proposed approach indeed improves the performance of
multiple video-to-language tasks, we participate in four tasks of LSMDC 2016.
Our approach achieves the best accuracies in three of them, including
fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice test, and movie retrieval. We also attain
comparable performance for the other task, movie description.

 <dc:description>  Electromagnetic simulations of complex geologic settings are computationally
expensive. One reason for this is the fact that a fine mesh is required to
accurately discretize the electrical conductivity model of a given setting.
This conductivity model may vary over several orders of magnitude and these
variations can occur over a large range of length scales. Using a very fine
mesh for the discretization of this setting leads to the necessity to solve a
large system of equations that is often difficult to deal with. To keep the
simulations computationally tractable, coarse meshes are often employed for the
discretization of the model. Such coarse meshes typically fail to capture the
fine-scale variations in the conductivity model resulting in inaccuracies in
the predicted data. In this work, we introduce a framework for constructing a
coarse-mesh or upscaled conductivity model based on a prescribed fine-mesh
model. Rather than using analytical expressions, we opt to pose upscaling as a
parameter estimation problem. By solving an optimization problem, we obtain a
coarse-mesh conductivity model. The optimization criterion can be tailored to
the survey setting in order to produce coarse models that accurately reproduce
the predicted data generated on the fine mesh. This allows us to upscale
arbitrary conductivity structures, as well as to better understand the meaning
of the upscaled quantity. We use 1D and 3D examples to demonstrate that the
proposed framework is able to emulate the behavior of the heterogeneity in the
fine-mesh conductivity model, and to produce an accurate description of the
desired predicted data obtained by using a coarse mesh in the simulation
process.

 <dc:description>  The octagon abstract domain is a widely used numeric abstract domain
expressing relational information between variables whilst being both
computationally efficient and simple to implement. Each element of the domain
is a system of constraints where each constraint takes the restricted form $\pm
x_i \pm x_j \leq d$. A key family of operations for the octagon domain are
closure algorithms, which check satisfiability and provide a normal form for
octagonal constraint systems. We present new quadratic incremental algorithms
for closure, strong closure and integer closure and proofs of their
correctness. We highlight the benefits and measure the performance of these new
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This work studies the linear approximation of high-dimensional dynamical
systems using low-rank dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). Searching this
approximation in a data-driven approach can be formalised as attempting to
solve a low-rank constrained optimisation problem. This problem is non-convex
and state-of-the-art algorithms are all sub-optimal. This paper shows that
there exists a closed-form solution, which can be computed in polynomial-time,
and characterises the $\ell_2$-norm of the optimal approximation error. The
theoretical results serve to design low-complexity algorithms building reduced
models from the optimal solution, based on singular value decomposition or
low-rank DMD. The algorithms are evaluated by numerical simulations using
synthetic and physical data benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of solving convex optimization problems with many
convex constraints in a distributed setting. Our approach is based on an
extension of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that
recently gained a lot of attention in the Big Data context. Although it has
been invented decades ago, ADMM so far can be applied only to unconstrained
problems and problems with linear equality or inequality constraints. Our
extension can handle arbitrary inequality constraints directly. It combines the
ability of ADMM to solve convex optimization problems in a distributed setting
with the ability of the Augmented Lagrangian method to solve constrained
optimization problems, and as we show, it inherits the convergence guarantees
of ADMM and the Augmented Lagrangian method.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification (re-ID) has become increasingly popular in the
community due to its application and research significance. It aims at spotting
a person of interest in other cameras. In the early days, hand-crafted
algorithms and small-scale evaluation were predominantly reported. Recent years
have witnessed the emergence of large-scale datasets and deep learning systems
which make use of large data volumes. Considering different tasks, we classify
most current re-ID methods into two classes, i.e., image-based and video-based;
in both tasks, hand-crafted and deep learning systems will be reviewed.
Moreover, two new re-ID tasks which are much closer to real-world applications
are described and discussed, i.e., end-to-end re-ID and fast re-ID in very
large galleries. This paper: 1) introduces the history of person re-ID and its
relationship with image classification and instance retrieval; 2) surveys a
broad selection of the hand-crafted systems and the large-scale methods in both
image- and video-based re-ID; 3) describes critical future directions in
end-to-end re-ID and fast retrieval in large galleries; and 4) finally briefs
some important yet under-developed issues.

 <dc:description>  We propose a methodology for testing linear hypothesis in high-dimensional
linear models. The proposed test does not impose any restriction on the size of
the model, i.e. model sparsity or the loading vector representing the
hypothesis. Providing asymptotically valid methods for testing general linear
functions of the regression parameters in high-dimensions is extremely
challenging -- especially without making restrictive or unverifiable
assumptions on the number of non-zero elements. We propose to test the moment
conditions related to the newly designed restructured regression, where the
inputs are transformed and augmented features. These new features incorporate
the structure of the null hypothesis directly. The test statistics are
constructed in such a way that lack of sparsity in the original model parameter
does not present a problem for the theoretical justification of our procedures.
We establish asymptotically exact control on Type I error without imposing any
sparsity assumptions on model parameter or the vector representing the linear
hypothesis. Our method is also shown to achieve certain optimality in detecting
deviations from the null hypothesis. We demonstrate the favorable finite-sample
performance of the proposed methods, via a number of numerical and a real data
example.

 <dc:description>  Moral foundations theory explains variations in moral behavior using innate
moral foundations: Care, Fairness, Ingroup, Authority, and Purity, along with
experimental supports. However, little is known about the roles of and
relationships between those foundations in everyday moral situations. To
address these, we quantify moral foundations from a large amount of online
conversations (tweets) about moral topics on the social media site Twitter. We
measure moral loadings using latent semantic analysis of tweets related to
topics on abortion, homosexuality, immigration, religion, and immorality in
general, showing how the five moral foundations function in spontaneous
conversations about moral violating situations. The results indicate that
although the five foundations are mutually related, Purity is the most
distinctive foundation and Care is the most dominant foundation in everyday
conversations on immorality. Our study shows a new possibility of natural
language processing and social big data for moral psychology.

 <dc:description>  In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process
of identifying a suitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to
gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and outputs. In the natural
sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the
prime goal as it allows to understand and generalize results. This paper
proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner
(EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to
unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward

regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the
true underlying source expression is identified.

 <dc:description>  In graph coloring problems, the goal is to assign a positive integer color to
each vertex of an input graph such that adjacent vertices do not receive the
same color assignment. For classic graph coloring, the goal is to minimize the
maximum color used, and for the sum coloring problem, the goal is to minimize
the sum of colors assigned to all input vertices. In the offline variant, the
entire graph is presented at once, and in online problems, one vertex is
presented for coloring at each time, and the only information is the identity
of its neighbors among previously known vertices. In batched graph coloring,
vertices are presented in k batches, for a fixed integer k &gt; 1, such that the
vertices of a batch are presented as a set, and must be colored before the
vertices of the next batch are presented. This last model is an intermediate
model, which bridges between the two extreme scenarios of the online and
offline models. We provide several results, including a general result for sum
coloring and results for the classic graph coloring problem on restricted graph
classes: We show tight bounds for any graph class containing trees as a
subclass (e.g., forests, bipartite graphs, planar graphs, and perfect graphs),
and a surprising result for interval graphs and k = 2, where the value of the
(strict and asymptotic) competitive ratio depends on whether the graph is
presented with its interval representation or not.

 <dc:description>  Demand response management has become one of the key enabling technologies
for smart grids. Motivated by the increasing demand response incentives offered
by service operators, more customers are subscribing to various demand response
programs. However, with growing customer participation, the problem of
determining the optimal loads to be curtailed in a microgrid during
contingencies within a feasible time frame becomes computationally hard. This
paper proposes an efficient approximation algorithm for event-based demand
response management in microgrids. In event-based management, it is important
to curtail loads as fast as possible to maintain the stability of a microgrid
during the islanded mode in a scalable manner. A simple greedy approach is
presented that can rapidly determine a close-to-optimal load curtailment scheme
to maximize the aggregate customer utility in milliseconds for a large number
of customers. This paper further derives a novel theoretical guarantee of the
gap between the proposed efficient algorithm and the optimal solution (that may
be computationally hard to obtain). The performance of algorithm is
corroborated extensively by simulations with up to thousands of customers. For
the sake of practicality, the proposed event-based demand response management
algorithm is applied to a feeder from the Canadian benchmark distribution
system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
efficiently optimizes microgrid operation during islanded mode while
maintaining appropriate voltage levels and network constrains.

 <dc:description>  The suffix array is the key to efficient solutions for myriads of string
processing problems in different applications domains, like data compression,
data mining, or Bioinformatics. With the rapid growth of available data, suffix
array construction algorithms had to be adapted to advanced computational
models such as external memory and distributed computing. In this article, we
present five suffix array construction algorithms utilizing the new algorithmic
big data batch processing framework Thrill, which allows us to process input
sizes in orders of magnitude that have not been considered before.

 <dc:description>  Speaker verification systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks which
presents a major problem in their real-life deployment. To date, most of the
proposed synthetic speech detectors (SSDs) have weighted the importance of
different segments of speech equally. However, different attack methods have
different strengths and weaknesses and the traces that they leave may be short
or long term acoustic artifacts. Moreover, those may occur for only particular
phonemes or sounds. Here, we propose three algorithms that weigh
likelihood-ratio scores of individual frames, phonemes, and sound-classes
depending on their importance for the SSD. Significant improvement over the
baseline system has been obtained for known attack methods that were used in
training the SSDs. However, improvement with unknown attack types was not
substantial. Thus, the type of distortions that were caused by the unknown
systems were different and could not be captured better with the proposed SSD
compared to the baseline SSD.

 <dc:description>  The most significant progress in recent years in online display advertising
is what is known as the Real-Time Bidding (RTB) mechanism to buy and sell ads.
RTB essentially facilitates buying an individual ad impression in real time
while it is still being generated from a user's visit. RTB not only scales up
the buying process by aggregating a large amount of available inventories
across publishers but, most importantly, enables direct targeting of individual
users. As such, RTB has fundamentally changed the landscape of digital
marketing. Scientifically, the demand for automation, integration and
optimisation in RTB also brings new research opportunities in information
retrieval, data mining, machine learning and other related fields. In this
monograph, an overview is given of the fundamental infrastructure, algorithms,
and technical solutions of this new frontier of computational advertising. The
covered topics include user response prediction, bid landscape forecasting,
bidding algorithms, revenue optimisation, statistical arbitrage, dynamic
pricing, and ad fraud detection.

 <dc:description>  Most existing machine translation systems operate at the level of words,
relying on explicit segmentation to extract tokens. We introduce a neural
machine translation (NMT) model that maps a source character sequence to a
target character sequence without any segmentation. We employ a character-level
convolutional network with max-pooling at the encoder to reduce the length of
source representation, allowing the model to be trained at a speed comparable
to subword-level models while capturing local regularities. Our
character-to-character model outperforms a recently proposed baseline with a
subword-level encoder on WMT'15 DE-EN and CS-EN, and gives comparable
performance on FI-EN and RU-EN. We then demonstrate that it is possible to
share a single character-level encoder across multiple languages by training a
model on a many-to-one translation task. In this multilingual setting, the
character-level encoder significantly outperforms the subword-level encoder on
all the language pairs. We observe that on CS-EN, FI-EN and RU-EN, the quality
of the multilingual character-level translation even surpasses the models
specifically trained on that language pair alone, both in terms of BLEU score
and human judgment.

 <dc:description>  We study a two-tiered wireless sensor network (WSN) consisting of $N$ access
points (APs) and $M$ base stations (BSs). The sensing data, which is
distributed on the sensing field according to a density function $f$, is first
transmitted to the APs and then forwarded to the BSs. Our goal is to find an
optimal deployment of APs and BSs to minimize the average weighted total, or
Lagrangian, of sensor and AP powers. For $M=1$, we show that the optimal
deployment of APs is simply a linear transformation of the optimal $N$-level
quantizer for density $f$, and the sole BS should be located at the geometric
centroid of the sensing field. Also, for a one-dimensional network and uniform
$f$, we determine the optimal deployment of APs and BSs for any $N$ and $M$.
Moreover, to numerically optimize node deployment for general scenarios, we
propose one- and two-tiered Lloyd algorithms and analyze their convergence
properties. Simulation results show that, when compared to random deployment,
our algorithms can save up to 79\% of the power on average.

 <dc:description>  Sequence-to-sequence models have shown success in end-to-end speech
recognition. However these models have only used shallow acoustic encoder
networks. In our work, we successively train very deep convolutional networks
to add more expressive power and better generalization for end-to-end ASR
models. We apply network-in-network principles, batch normalization, residual
connections and convolutional LSTMs to build very deep recurrent and
convolutional structures. Our models exploit the spectral structure in the
feature space and add computational depth without overfitting issues. We
experiment with the WSJ ASR task and achieve 10.5\% word error rate without any
dictionary or language using a 15 layer deep network.

 <dc:description>  Learning powerful feature representations for image retrieval has always been
a challenging task in the field of remote sensing. Traditional methods focus on
extracting low-level hand-crafted features which are not only time-consuming
but also tend to achieve unsatisfactory performance due to the content
complexity of remote sensing images. In this paper, we investigate how to
extract deep feature representations based on convolutional neural networks
(CNN) for high-resolution remote sensing image retrieval (HRRSIR). To this end,
two effective schemes are proposed to generate powerful feature representations
for HRRSIR. In the first scheme, the deep features are extracted from the
fully-connected and convolutional layers of the pre-trained CNN models,
respectively; in the second scheme, we propose a novel CNN architecture based
on conventional convolution layers and a three-layer perceptron. The novel CNN
model is then trained on a large remote sensing dataset to learn low
dimensional features. The two schemes are evaluated on several public and
challenging datasets, and the results indicate that the proposed schemes and in
particular the novel CNN are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

ABA+, preference information given over assumptions is incorporated directly
into the attack relation, thus resulting in attack reversal. ABA+
conservatively extends ABA and exhibits various desirable features regarding
relationship among argumentation semantics as well as preference handling. We
also introduce Weak Contraposition, a principle concerning reasoning with rules
and preferences that relaxes the standard principle of contraposition, while
guaranteeing additional desirable features for ABA+.

 <dc:title>Lower bounds for CSP refutation by SDP hierarchies</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mori, Ryuhei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Witmer, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For a $k$-ary predicate $P$, a random instance of CSP$(P)$ with $n$ variables
and $m$ constraints is unsatisfiable with high probability when $m \gg n$. The
natural algorithmic task in this regime is \emph{refutation}: finding a proof
that a given random instance is unsatisfiable. Recent work of Allen et al.
suggests that the difficulty of refuting CSP$(P)$ using an SDP is determined by
a parameter $\mathrm{cmplx}(P)$, the smallest $t$ for which there does not
exist a $t$-wise uniform distribution over satisfying assignments to $P$. In
particular they show that random instances of CSP$(P)$ with $m \gg
n^{\mathrm{cmplx(P)}/2}$ can be refuted efficiently using an SDP.
  In this work, we give evidence that $n^{\mathrm{cmplx}(P)/2}$ constraints are
also \emph{necessary} for refutation using SDPs. Specifically, we show that if
$P$ supports a $(t-1)$-wise uniform distribution over satisfying assignments,
then the Sherali-Adams$_+$ and Lov\'{a}sz-Schrijver$_+$ SDP hierarchies cannot
refute a random instance of CSP$(P)$ in polynomial time for any $m \leq
n^{t/2-\epsilon}$.

 <dc:description>  We present the Macaulay2 package NumericalImplicitization, which allows for
user-friendly computation of the basic invariants of the image of a polynomial
map, such as dimension, degree, and Hilbert function values. This package
relies on methods of numerical algebraic geometry, such as homotopy
continuation and monodromy.

 <dc:description>  We present the Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD) framework. LSD decomposes
sequences with variable lengthed output units as a function of both the input
sequence and the output sequence. We present a training algorithm which samples
valid extensions and an approximate decoding algorithm. We experiment with the
Wall Street Journal speech recognition task. Our LSD model achieves 12.9% WER
compared to a character baseline of 14.8% WER. When combined with a
convolutional network on the encoder, we achieve 9.6% WER.

 <dc:description>  Sketching techniques have become popular for scaling up machine learning
algorithms by reducing the sample size or dimensionality of massive data sets,
while still maintaining the statistical power of big data. In this paper, we
study sketching from an optimization point of view: we first show that the
iterative Hessian sketch is an optimization process with preconditioning, and
develop accelerated iterative Hessian sketch via the searching the conjugate
direction; we then establish primal-dual connections between the Hessian sketch
and dual random projection, and apply the preconditioned conjugate gradient
approach on the dual problem, which leads to the accelerated iterative dual
random projection methods. Finally to tackle the challenges from both large
sample size and high-dimensionality, we propose the primal-dual sketch, which
iteratively sketches the primal and dual formulations. We show that using a
logarithmic number of calls to solvers of small scale problem, primal-dual
sketch is able to recover the optimum of the original problem up to arbitrary
precision. The proposed algorithms are validated via extensive experiments on
synthetic and real data sets which complements our theoretical results.

 <dc:title>Optimal Download Cost of Private Information Retrieval for Arbitrary

 <dc:description>  A private information retrieval scheme is a mechanism that allows a user to
retrieve any one out of $K$ messages from $N$ non-communicating replicated
databases, each of which stores all $K$ messages, without revealing anything
about the identity of the desired message index to any individual database. If
the size of each message is $L$ bits and the total download required by a PIR
scheme from all $N$ databases is $D$ bits, then $D$ is called the download cost
and the ratio $L/D$ is called an achievable rate. For fixed $K,N\in\mathbb{N}$,
the capacity of PIR, denoted by $C$, is the supremum of achievable rates over
all PIR schemes and over all message sizes, and was recently shown to be
$C=(1+1/N+1/N^2+\cdots+1/N^{K-1})^{-1}$. In this work, for arbitrary $K, N$, we
explore the minimum download cost $D_L$ across all PIR schemes (not restricted
to linear schemes) for arbitrary message lengths $L$ under arbitrary choices of
alphabet (not restricted to finite fields) for the message and download
symbols. If the same $M$-ary alphabet is used for the message and download
symbols, then we show that the optimal download cost in $M$-ary symbols is
$D_L=\lceil\frac{L}{C}\rceil$. If the message symbols are in $M$-ary alphabet
and the downloaded symbols are in $M'$-ary alphabet, then we show that the
optimal download cost in $M'$-ary symbols, $D_L\in\left\{\left\lceil
\frac{L'}{C}\right\rceil,\left\lceil \frac{L'}{C}\right\rceil-1,\left\lceil
\frac{L'}{C}\right\rceil-2\right\}$, where $L'= \lceil L \log_{M'} M\rceil$.

 <dc:description>  Read-Copy Update (RCU) is a scalable, high-performance Linux-kernel
synchronization mechanism that runs low-overhead readers concurrently with
updaters. Production-quality RCU implementations for multi-core systems are
decidedly non-trivial. Giving the ubiquity of Linux, a rare &quot;million-year&quot; bug
can occur several times per day across the installed base. Stringent validation
of RCU's complex behaviors is thus critically important. Exhaustive testing is
infeasible due to the exponential number of possible executions, which suggests
use of formal verification.
  Previous verification efforts on RCU either focus on simple implementations
or use modeling languages, the latter requiring error-prone manual translation
that must be repeated frequently due to regular changes in the Linux kernel's
RCU implementation. In this paper, we first describe the implementation of Tree
RCU in the Linux kernel. We then discuss how to construct a model directly from
Tree RCU's source code in C, and use the CBMC model checker to verify its
safety and liveness properties. To our best knowledge, this is the first
verification of a significant part of RCU's source code, and is an important
step towards integration of formal verification into the Linux kernel's
regression test suite.

 <dc:title>Multi-User MIMO with flexible numerology for 5G</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Flexible numerologies are being considered as part of designs for 5G systems
to support vertical services with diverse requirements such as enhanced mobile
broadband, ultra-reliable low-latency communications, and massive machine type
communication. Different vertical services can be multiplexed in either
frequency domain, time domain, or both. In this paper, we investigate the use
of spatial multiplexing of services using MU-MIMO where the numerologies for
different users may be different. The users are grouped according to the chosen
numerology and a separate pre-coder and FFT size is used per numerology at the
transmitter. The pre-coded signals for the multiple numerologies are added in
the time domain before transmission. We analyze the performance gains of this
approach using capacity analysis and link level simulations using conjugate
beamforming and signal-to-leakage noise ratio maximization techniques. We show
that the MU interference between users with different numerologies can be
suppressed efficiently with reasonable number of antennas at the base-station.
This feature enables MU-MIMO techniques to be applied for 5G across different
numerologies.

 <dc:description>  The standard linear regression (SLR) problem is to recover a vector
$\mathbf{x}^0$ from noisy linear observations
$\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{Ax}^0+\mathbf{w}$. The approximate message passing (AMP)
algorithm recently proposed by Donoho, Maleki, and Montanari is a
computationally efficient iterative approach to SLR that has a remarkable
property: for large i.i.d.\ sub-Gaussian matrices $\mathbf{A}$, its
per-iteration behavior is rigorously characterized by a scalar state-evolution
whose fixed points, when unique, are Bayes optimal. AMP, however, is fragile in
that even small deviations from the i.i.d.\ sub-Gaussian model can cause the
algorithm to diverge. This paper considers a &quot;vector AMP&quot; (VAMP) algorithm and
shows that VAMP has a rigorous scalar state-evolution that holds under a much
broader class of large random matrices $\mathbf{A}$: those that are
right-rotationally invariant. After performing an initial singular value
decomposition (SVD) of $\mathbf{A}$, the per-iteration complexity of VAMP can
be made similar to that of AMP. In addition, the fixed points of VAMP's state
evolution are consistent with the replica prediction of the minimum
mean-squared error recently derived by Tulino, Caire, Verd\'u, and Shamai. The
effectiveness and state evolution predictions of VAMP are confirmed in
numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  A b-coloring of the vertices of a graph is a proper coloring where each color
class contains a vertex which is adjacent to each other color class. The
b-chromatic number of $G$ is the maximum integer $\chi_b(G)$ for which $G$ has
a b-coloring with $\chi_b(G)$ colors. A graph $G$ is b-continuous if $G$ has a
b-coloring with $k$ colors, for every integer $k$ in the interval
$[\chi(G),\chi_b(G)]$. It is known that not all graphs are b-continuous. Here,
we investigate whether the lexicographic product $G[H]$ of b-continuous graphs
$G$ and $H$ is also b-continuous. Using homomorphisms, we provide a new lower
bound for $\chi_b(G[H])$, namely $\chi_b(G[K_t])$, where $t=\chi_b(H)$, and
prove that if $G[K_\ell]$ is b-continuous for every positive integer $\ell$,
then $G[H]$ admits a b-coloring with $k$ colors, for every $k$ in the interval
$[\chi(G[H]),\chi_b(G[K_t])]$. We also prove that $G[K_\ell]$ is b-continuous,
for every positive integer $\ell$, whenever $G$ is a $P_4$-sparse graph, and we
give further results on the b-spectrum of $G[K_\ell]$, when $G$ is chordal.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the performance of the downlink of a cellular network
with automatic repeat-request (ARQ) and a half duplex decode-and-forward shared
relay. In this system, two multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) base stations
serve two single antenna users. A MIMO shared relay retransmits the lost
packets to the target users. First, we study the system with direct
retransmission from the base station and derive a closed form expression for
the outage probability of the system.We show that the direct retransmission can
overcome the fading, however, it cannot overcome the interference. After that,
we invoke the shared relay and design the relay beamforming matrices such that
the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is improved at the users
subject to power constraints on the relay. In the case when the transmission of
only one user fails, we derive a closed form solution for the relay
beamformers. On the other hand when both transmissions fail, we pose the
beamforming problem as a sequence of non-convex feasibility problems. We use
semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to convert each feasibility problem into a convex
optimization problem. We ensure a rank one solution, and hence, there is no
loss of optimality in SDR. Simulation results are presented showing the
superior performance of the proposed relay beamforming strategy compared to
direct ARQ system in terms of the outage probability.

 <dc:description>  Recent work in distance metric learning has focused on learning
transformations of data that best align with specified pairwise similarity and
dissimilarity constraints, often supplied by a human observer. The learned
transformations lead to improved retrieval, classification, and clustering
algorithms due to the better adapted distance or similarity measures. Here, we
address the problem of learning these transformations when the underlying
constraint generation process is nonstationary. This nonstationarity can be due
to changes in either the ground-truth clustering used to generate constraints
or changes in the feature subspaces in which the class structure is apparent.
We propose Online Convex Ensemble StrongLy Adaptive Dynamic Learning (OCELAD),
a general adaptive, online approach for learning and tracking optimal metrics
as they change over time that is highly robust to a variety of nonstationary
behaviors in the changing metric. We apply the OCELAD framework to an ensemble
of online learners. Specifically, we create a retro-initialized composite
objective mirror descent (COMID) ensemble (RICE) consisting of a set of
parallel COMID learners with different learning rates, demonstrate RICE-OCELAD
on both real and synthetic data sets and show significant performance
improvements relative to previously proposed batch and online distance metric
learning algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel neural approach for paraphrase generation.
Conventional para- phrase generation methods either leverage hand-written rules
and thesauri-based alignments, or use statistical machine learning principles.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore deep learning
models for paraphrase generation. Our primary contribution is a stacked
residual LSTM network, where we add residual connections between LSTM layers.
This allows for efficient training of deep LSTMs. We evaluate our model and
other state-of-the-art deep learning models on three different datasets: PPDB,
WikiAnswers and MSCOCO. Evaluation results demonstrate that our model
outperforms sequence to sequence, attention-based and bi- directional LSTM
models on BLEU, METEOR, TER and an embedding-based sentence similarity metric.

 <dc:description>  Data-driven research is increasingly ubiquitous and data itself is a defining
asset for researchers, particularly in the computational social sciences and
humanities. Entire careers and research communities are built around valuable,
proprietary or sensitive datasets. However, many existing computation resources
fail to support secure and cost-effective storage of data while also enabling
secure and flexible analysis of the data. To address these needs we present
CLOUD KOTTA, a cloud-based architecture for the secure management and analysis
of social science data. CLOUD KOTTA leverages reliable, secure, and scalable
cloud resources to deliver capabilities to users, and removes the need for
users to manage complicated infrastructure. CLOUD KOTTA implements automated,
cost-aware models for efficiently provisioning tiered storage and automatically
scaled compute resources. CLOUD KOTTA has been used in production for several
months and currently manages approximately 10TB of data and has been used to
process more than 5TB of data with over 75,000 CPU hours. It has been used for
a broad variety of text analysis workflows, matrix factorization, and various
machine learning algorithms, and more broadly, it supports fast, secure and
cost-effective research.

 <dc:description>  Term weighting metrics assign weights to terms in order to discriminate the
important terms from the less crucial ones. Due to this characteristic, these
metrics have attracted growing attention in text classification and recently in
sentiment analysis. Using the weights given by such metrics could lead to more
accurate document representation which may improve the performance of the
classification. While previous studies have focused on proposing or comparing
different weighting metrics at two-classes document level sentiment analysis,
this study propose to analyse the results given by each metric in order to find
out the characteristics of good and bad weighting metrics. Therefore we present
an empirical study of fifteen global supervised weighting metrics with four
local weighting metrics adopted from information retrieval, we also give an
analysis to understand the behavior of each metric by observing and analysing
how each metric distributes the terms and deduce some characteristics which may
distinguish the good and bad metrics. The evaluation has been done using
Support Vector Machine on three different datasets: Twitter, restaurant and
laptop reviews.

 <dc:description>  Distributed communities of researchers rely increasingly on valuable,
proprietary, or sensitive datasets. Given the growth of such data, especially
in fields new to data-driven, computationally intensive research like the
social sciences and humanities, coupled with what are often strict and complex
data-use agreements, many research communities now require methods that allow
secure, scalable and cost-effective storage and analysis. Here we present CLOUD
KOTTA: a cloud-based data management and analytics framework. CLOUD KOTTA
delivers an end-to-end solution for coordinating secure access to large
datasets, and an execution model that provides both automated infrastructure
scaling and support for executing analytics near to the data. CLOUD KOTTA
implements a fine-grained security model ensuring that only authorized users
may access, analyze, and download protected data. It also implements automated
methods for acquiring and configuring low-cost storage and compute resources as
they are needed. We present the architecture and implementation of CLOUD KOTTA
and demonstrate the advantages it provides in terms of increased performance
and flexibility. We show that CLOUD KOTTA's elastic provisioning model can
reduce costs by up to 16x when compared with statically provisioned models.

 <dc:description>  Social norms are shared rules that govern and facilitate social interaction.
Violating such social norms via teasing and insults may serve to upend power
imbalances or, on the contrary reinforce solidarity and rapport in
conversation, rapport which is highly situated and context-dependent. In this
work, we investigate the task of automatically identifying the phenomena of
social norm violation in discourse. Towards this goal, we leverage the power of
recurrent neural networks and multimodal information present in the
interaction, and propose a predictive model to recognize social norm violation.
Using long-term temporal and contextual information, our model achieves an F1
score of 0.705. Implications of our work regarding developing a social-aware
agent are discussed.

 <dc:title>Correlation-Based Method for Sentiment Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The classic supervised classification algorithms are efficient, but
time-consuming, complicated and not interpretable, which makes it difficult to
analyze their results that limits the possibility to improve them based on real
observations. In this paper, we propose a new and a simple classifier to
predict a sentiment label of a short text. This model keeps the capacity of
human interpret-ability and can be extended to integrate NLP techniques in a
more interpretable way. Our model is based on a correlation metric which
measures the degree of association between a sentiment label and a word. Ten
correlation metrics are proposed and evaluated intrinsically. And then a
classifier based on each metric is proposed, evaluated and compared to the
classic classification algorithms which have proved their performance in many
studies. Our model outperforms these algorithms with several correlation
metrics.

 <dc:description>  We consider computing a longest palindrome in the streaming model, where the
symbols arrive one-by-one and we do not have random access to the input. While
computing the answer exactly using sublinear space is not possible in such a
setting, one can still hope for a good approximation guarantee. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we provide lower bounds on the space
requirements for randomized approximation algorithms processing inputs of
length $n$. We rule out Las Vegas algorithms, as they cannot achieve sublinear
space complexity. For Monte Carlo algorithms, we prove a lower bounds of
$\Omega( M \log\min\{|\Sigma|,M\})$ bits of memory; here $M=n/E$ for
approximating the answer with additive error $E$, and $M= \frac{\log n}{\log
(1+\varepsilon)}$ for approximating the answer with multiplicative error $(1 +
\varepsilon)$. Second, we design three real-time algorithms for this problem.
Our Monte Carlo approximation algorithms for both additive and multiplicative
versions of the problem use $O(M)$ words of memory. Thus the obtained lower
bounds are asymptotically tight up to a logarithmic factor. The third algorithm
is deterministic and finds a longest palindrome exactly if it is short. This
algorithm can be run in parallel with a Monte Carlo algorithm to obtain better
results in practice. Overall, both the time and space complexity of finding a
longest palindrome in a stream are essentially settled.

 <dc:description>  Extracting shape information from object bound- aries is a well studied
problem in vision, and has found tremen- dous use in applications like object
recognition. Conversely, studying the space of shapes represented by curves
satisfying certain constraints is also intriguing. In this paper, we model and
analyze the space of shapes represented by a 3D curve (space curve) formed by
connecting n pieces of quarter of a unit circle. Such a space curve is what we
call a Tangle, the name coming from a toy built on the same principle. We
provide two models for the shape space of n-link open and closed tangles, and
we show that tangles are a subset of trigonometric splines of a certain order.
We give algorithms for curve approximation using open/closed tangles, computing
geodesics on these shape spaces, and to find the deformation that takes one
given tangle to another given tangle, i.e., the Log map. The algorithms
provided yield tangles upto a small and acceptable tolerance, as shown by the
results given in the paper.

 <dc:title>Compression of Quantum Multi-Prover Interactive Proofs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a protocol that transforms any quantum multi-prover interactive
proof into a nonlocal game in which questions consist of logarithmic number of
bits and answers of constant number of bits. As a corollary, this proves that
the promise problem corresponding to the approximation of the nonlocal value to
inverse polynomial accuracy is complete for QMIP*, and therefore NEXP-hard.
This establishes that nonlocal games are provably harder than classical games
without any complexity theory assumptions. Our result also indicates that gap
amplification for nonlocal games may be impossible in general and provides a
negative evidence for the possibility of the gap amplification approach to the
multi-prover variant of the quantum PCP conjecture.

define the term 'PCG-based game', and explain how this concept follows on from
the idea of an AI-based game. We look at existing examples of games which

 <dc:description>  The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) has expanded significantly in recent
years. With the widespread of MOOC, the opportunity to study the fascinating
courses for free has attracted numerous people of diverse educational
backgrounds all over the world. In the big data era, a key research topic for
MOOC is how to mine the needed courses in the massive course databases in cloud
for each individual student accurately and rapidly as the number of courses is
increasing fleetly. In this respect, the key challenge is how to realize
personalized course recommendation as well as to reduce the computing and
storage costs for the tremendous course data. In this paper, we propose a big
data-supported, context-aware online learning-based course recommender system
that could handle the dynamic and infinitely massive datasets, which recommends
courses by using personalized context information and historical statistics.
The context-awareness takes the personal preferences into consideration, making
the recommendation suitable for people with different backgrounds. Besides, the
algorithm achieves the sublinear regret performance, which means it can
gradually recommend the mostly preferred and matched courses to students. In
addition, our storage module is expanded to the distributed-connected storage
nodes, where the devised algorithm can handle massive course storage problems
from heterogeneous sources of course datasets. Comparing to existing
algorithms, our proposed algorithms achieve the linear time complexity and
space complexity. Experiment results verify the superiority of our algorithms
when comparing with existing ones in the MOOC big data setting.

 <dc:title>Skeletal Program Enumeration for Rigorous Compiler Testing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A program can be viewed as a syntactic structure P (syntactic skeleton)
parameterized by a collection of the identifiers V (variable names). This paper
introduces the skeletal program enumeration (SPE) problem: Given a fixed
syntactic skeleton P and a set of variables V , enumerate a set of programs P
exhibiting all possible variable usage patterns within P. It proposes an
effective realization of SPE for systematic, rigorous compiler testing by
leveraging three important observations: (1) Programs with different variable
usage patterns exhibit diverse control- and data-dependence information, and
help exploit different compiler optimizations and stress-test compilers; (2)
most real compiler bugs were revealed by small tests (i.e., small-sized P) ---
this &quot;small-scope&quot; observation opens up SPE for practical compiler validation;
and (3) SPE is exhaustive w.r.t. a given syntactic skeleton and variable set,
and thus can offer a level of guarantee that is absent from all existing
compiler testing techniques.
  The key challenge of SPE is how to eliminate the enormous amount of
equivalent programs w.r.t. $\alpha$-conversion. Our main technical contribution
is a novel algorithm for computing the canonical (and smallest) set of all
non-$\alpha$-equivalent programs. We have realized our SPE technique and
evaluated it using syntactic skeletons derived from GCC's testsuite. Our
evaluation results on testing GCC and Clang are extremely promising. In less
than six months, our approach has led to 217 confirmed bug reports, 104 of
which have already been fixed, and the majority are long latent bugs despite
the extensive prior efforts of automatically testing both compilers (e.g.,
Csmith and EMI). The results also show that our algorithm for enumerating
non-$\alpha$-equivalent programs provides six orders of magnitude reduction,
enabling processing the GCC test-suite in under a month.

 <dc:description>  We introduce FaceVR, a novel method for gaze-aware facial reenactment in the
Virtual Reality (VR) context. The key component of FaceVR is a robust algorithm
to perform real-time facial motion capture of an actor who is wearing a
head-mounted display (HMD), as well as a new data-driven approach for eye
tracking from monocular videos. In addition to these face reconstruction
components, FaceVR incorporates photo-realistic re-rendering in real time, thus
allowing artificial modifications of face and eye appearances. For instance, we
can alter facial expressions, change gaze directions, or remove the VR goggles
in realistic re-renderings. In a live setup with a source and a target actor,
we apply these newly-introduced algorithmic components. We assume that the
source actor is wearing a VR device, and we capture his facial expressions and
eye movement in real-time. For the target video, we mimic a similar tracking
process; however, we use the source input to drive the animations of the target
video, thus enabling gaze-aware facial reenactment. To render the modified
target video on a stereo display, we augment our capture and reconstruction

variety of applications, such as gaze-aware facial reenactment, reenactment in
virtual reality, removal of VR goggles, and re-targeting of somebody's gaze

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demon- strated its successful
applications in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language
processing. For object recog- nition, CNNs might be limited by its strict label
requirement and an implicit assumption that images are supposed to be target-
object-dominated for optimal solutions. However, the labeling procedure,
necessitating laying out the locations of target ob- jects, is very tedious,
making high-quality large-scale dataset prohibitively expensive. Data
augmentation schemes are widely used when deep networks suffer the insufficient
training data problem. All the images produced through data augmentation share
the same label, which may be problematic since not all data augmentation
methods are label-preserving. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised CNN
framework named Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks
(MILCNN) to solve this problem. We apply MILCNN framework to object recognition
and report state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR10,
CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2015 classification dataset.

 <dc:description>  Modern robotics applications that involve human-robot interaction require
robots to be able to communicate with humans seamlessly and effectively.
Natural language provides a flexible and efficient medium through which robots
can exchange information with their human partners. Significant advancements
have been made in developing robots capable of interpreting free-form
instructions, but less attention has been devoted to endowing robots with the
ability to generate natural language. We propose a navigational guide model
that enables robots to generate natural language instructions that allow humans
to navigate a priori unknown environments. We first decide which information to
share with the user according to their preferences, using a policy trained from
human demonstrations via inverse reinforcement learning. We then &quot;translate&quot;
this information into a natural language instruction using a neural
sequence-to-sequence model that learns to generate free-form instructions from
natural language corpora. We evaluate our method on a benchmark route
instruction dataset and achieve a BLEU score of 72.18% when compared to
human-generated reference instructions. We additionally conduct navigation
experiments with human participants that demonstrate that our method generates
instructions that people follow as accurately and easily as those produced by
humans.

 <dc:description>  Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been
shown to give state-of-the-art performance on many speech recognition tasks, as
they are able to provide the learned dynamically changing contextual window of
all sequence history. On the other hand, the convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have brought significant improvements to deep feed-forward neural
networks (FFNNs), as they are able to better reduce spectral variation in the
input signal. In this paper, a network architecture called as convolutional
recurrent neural network (CRNN) is proposed by combining the CNN and LSTM RNN.
In the proposed CRNNs, each speech frame, without adjacent context frames, is
organized as a number of local feature patches along the frequency axis, and
then a LSTM network is performed on each feature patch along the time axis. We
train and compare FFNNs, LSTM RNNs and the proposed LSTM CRNNs at various
number of configurations. Experimental results show that the LSTM CRNNs can
exceed state-of-the-art speech recognition performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we empirically explore the effects of various kinds of skip
connections in stacked bidirectional LSTMs for sequential tagging. We
investigate three kinds of skip connections connecting to LSTM cells: (a) skip
connections to the gates, (b) skip connections to the internal states and (c)
skip connections to the cell outputs. We present comprehensive experiments
showing that skip connections to cell outputs outperform the remaining two.
Furthermore, we observe that using gated identity functions as skip mappings
works pretty well. Based on this novel skip connections, we successfully train
deep stacked bidirectional LSTM models and obtain state-of-the-art results on
CCG supertagging and comparable results on POS tagging.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, asynchronous motors have wide range use in many industrial
applications. Field oriented control (FOC) and direct torque control (DTC) are
commonly used methods in high performance vector control for asynchronous
motors. Therefore, it is very important to identify clearly advantages and
disadvantages of both systems in the selection of appropriate control methods
for many industrial applications. This paper aims to present a new and
different perspective regarding the comparison of the switching behaviours on
the FOC and the DTC drivers. For this purpose, the experimental studies have
been carried out to compare the inverter switching frequencies and torque
responses of the asynchronous motor in the FOC and the DTC systems under
different working conditions. The dSPACE 1103 controller board was programmed
with Matlab/Simulink software. As expected, the experimental studies showed
that the FOC controlled motors has a lessened torque ripple. On the other hand,
the FOC controlled motor switching frequency has about 65-75% more than the DTC
controlled under both loaded and unloaded working conditions.

 <dc:title>NEDindex: A new metric for community structure in networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rahman, Md. Khaledur</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are several metrics (Modularity, Mutual Information, Conductance, etc.)
to evaluate the strength of graph clustering in large graphs. These metrics
have great significance to measure the effectiveness and they are often used to
find the strongly connected clusters with respect to the whole graph. In this
paper, we propose a new metric to evaluate the strength of graph clustering and
also study its applications. We show that our proposed metric has great
consistency which is similar to other metrics and easy to calculate. Our
proposed metric also shows consistency where other metrics fail in some special
cases. We demonstrate that our metric has reasonable strength while extracting
strongly connected communities in both simulated (in silico) data and real data
networks. We also show some comparative results of our proposed metric with
other popular metric(s) for Online Social Networks (OSN) and Gene Regulatory
Networks (GRN).

 <dc:description>  This study concerns the security challenges that the people face in the usage
and implementation of cloud computing. Despite its growth in the past few
decades, this platform has experienced different challenges. They all arise
from the concern of data safety that the nature of sharing in the cloud
presents. This paper looks to identify the benefits of using a cloud computing
platform and the issue of information security. The paper also reviews the
concept of information hiding and its relevance to the cloud. This technique
has two ways about it that impact how people use cloud computing in their
organizations and even for personal implementations. First it presents the
potential to circulate harmful information and files that can adversely affect
the data those users upload on those platforms. It is also the basis of the
strategies such as steganalysis and cryptographic storage architecture that are
essential for data security.

 <dc:title>Generating Candidate Busy Beaver Machines (Or How to Build the Zany Zoo)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Harland, James</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The busy beaver problem is a well-known example of a non-computable function.
In order to determine a particular value of this function, it is necessary to
generate and classify a large number of Turing machines. Previous work on this
problem has described the processes used for the generation and classification
of these machines, but unfortunately has generally not provided details of the
machines considered. While there is no reason to doubt the veracity of the
results known so far, it is difficult to accept such results as scientifically
proven without being able to inspect the appropriate evidence. In addition, a
list of machines and their classifications can be used for other results, such
as variations on the busy beaver problem and related problems such as the
placid platypus problem. In this paper we investigate how to generate classes
of machines to be considered for the busy beaver problem. We discuss the
relationship between quadruple and quintuple variants of Turing machines, and
show that the latter are more general than the former. We give some formal
results to justify our strategy for minimising the number of machines
generated, and define a process reflecting this strategy for generating
machines. We describe our implementation, and the results of generating various
classes of machines with up to 5 states or up to 5 symbols, all of which
(together with our code) are available on the author's website.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the effects of limited speech data in the context of
speaker verification using deep neural network (DNN) approach. Being able to
reduce the length of required speech data is important to the development of
speaker verification system in real world applications. The experimental
studies have found that DNN-senone-based Gaussian probabilistic linear
discriminant analysis (GPLDA) system respectively achieves above 50% and 18%
improvements in EER values over GMM-UBM GPLDA system on NIST 2010
coreext-coreext and truncated 15sec-15sec evaluation conditions. Further when
GPLDA model is trained on short-length utterances (30sec) rather than
full-length utterances (2min), DNN-senone GPLDA system achieves above 7%
improvement in EER values on truncated 15sec-15sec condition. This is because
short length development i-vectors have speaker, session and phonetic variation
and GPLDA is able to robustly model those variations. For several real world
applications, longer utterances (2min) can be used for enrollment and shorter
utterances (15sec) are required for verification, and in those conditions,
DNN-senone GPLDA system achieves above 26% improvement in EER values over
GMM-UBM GPLDA systems.

 <dc:description>  The effort to extend cellular technologies to unlicensed spectrum has been
gaining high momentum. Listen-before-talk (LBT) is enforced in the regions such
as European Union and Japan to harmonize coexistence of cellular and incumbent
systems in unlicensed spectrum. In this paper, we study throughput optimal LBT
transmission strategy for load based equipment (LBE). We find that the optimal
rule is a pure threshold policy: The LBE should stop listening and transmit
once the channel quality exceeds an optimized threshold. We also reveal the
optimal set of LBT parameters that are compliant with regulatory requirements.
Our results shed light on how the regulatory LBT requirements can affect the
transmission strategies of radio equipment in unlicensed spectrum.

 <dc:description>  As the world becomes increasingly dependent on technology, researchers in
both industry and academia endeavor to understand how technology is used, the
impact it has on everyday life, the artifact life-cycle and overall
integrations of digital information. In doing so, researchers are increasingly
gathering 'real-world' or 'in-the-wild' residual data, obtained from a variety
of sources, without the explicit consent of the original owners. This data
gathering raises significant concerns regarding privacy, ethics and
legislation, as well as practical considerations concerning investigator
training, data storage, overall security and data disposal. This research
surveys recent studies of residual data gathered in-the-wild and analyzes the
challenges that were confronted. Amalgamating these insights, the research
presents a compendium of practices for addressing the issues that can arise
in-the-wild when conducting residual data research. The practices identified in
this research can be used to critique current projects and assess the
feasibility of proposed future research.

 <dc:description>  Performing a stability analysis during the design of any electronic circuit
is critical to guarantee its correct operation. A closed-loop stability
analysis can be performed by analysing the impedance presented by the circuit
at a well-chosen node without internal access to the simulator. If any of the
poles of this impedance lie in the complex right half-plane, the circuit is
unstable. The classic way to detect unstable poles is to fit a rational model
on the impedance.
  In this paper, a projection-based method is proposed which splits the
impedance into a stable and an unstable part by projecting on an orthogonal
basis of stable and unstable functions. When the unstable part lies
significantly above the interpolation error of the method, the circuit is
considered unstable. Working with a projection provides one, at small cost,
with a first appraisal of the unstable part of the system.
  Both small-signal and large-signal stability analysis can be performed with
this projection-based method. In the small-signal case, a low-order rational
approximation can be fitted on the unstable part to find the location of the
unstable poles.

 <dc:title>A Flat and Scalable Data Center Network Topology Based on De Bruijn

 <dc:description>  Due to the requirement of hosting tens of thousands of hosts in today's data
centers, data center networks strive for scalability and high throughput on the
one hand. On the other hand, the cost for networking hardware should be
minimized. Consequently, the number and complexity (e.g. TCAM size) of switches
has to be minimized. These requirements led to network topologies like Clos and
Leaf-Spine networks only requiring a shallow hierarchy of switches---two levels
for Leaf-Spine networks. The drawback of these topologies is that switches at
higher levels like Spine switches need a high port density and, thus, are
expensive and limit the scalability of the network.
  In this paper, we propose a data center network topology based on De Bruijn
graphs completely avoiding a switch hierarchy and implementing a flat network
topology of top-of-rack switches instead. This topology guarantees logarithmic
(short) path length. We show that the required routing logic can be implemented
by standard prefix matching operations in hardware (TCAM) allowing for using
commodity switches without any modification. Moreover, forwarding requires only
a very small number of forwarding table entries, saving costly and
energy-intensive TCAM.

 <dc:description>  Recently, attempts have been made to remove Gaussian mixture models (GMM)
from the training process of deep neural network-based hidden Markov models
(HMM/DNN). For the GMM-free training of a HMM/DNN hybrid we have to solve two
problems, namely the initial alignment of the frame-level state labels and the
creation of context-dependent states. Although flat-start training via
iteratively realigning and retraining the DNN using a frame-level error
function is viable, it is quite cumbersome. Here, we propose to use a
sequence-discriminative training criterion for flat start. While
sequence-discriminative training is routinely applied only in the final phase
of model training, we show that with proper caution it is also suitable for
getting an alignment of context-independent DNN models. For the construction of
tied states we apply a recently proposed KL-divergence-based state clustering
method, hence our whole training process is GMM-free. In the experimental
evaluation we found that the sequence-discriminative flat start training method
is not only significantly faster than the straightforward approach of iterative
retraining and realignment, but the word error rates attained are slightly
better as well.

 <dc:description>  For frequency division duplex channels, a simple pilot loop-back procedure
has been proposed that allows the estimation of the UL &amp; DL channels at an
antenna array without relying on any digital signal processing at the terminal
side. For this scheme, we derive the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for the
UL &amp; DL channel subspaces, formulate the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao bounds and
show the asymptotic efficiency of both (SVD-based) estimators by means of Monte
Carlo simulations. In addition, we illustrate how to compute the underlying
(rank-1) SVD with quadratic time complexity by employing the power iteration
method. To enable power control for the data transmission, knowledge of the
channel gains is needed. Assuming that the UL &amp; DL channels have on average the
same gain, we formulate the ML estimator for the channel norm, and illustrate
its robustness against strong noise by means of simulations.

 <dc:description>  We consider the model reduction problem for linear time-invariant dynamical
systems having nonzero (but otherwise indeterminate) initial conditions.
Building upon the observation that the full system response is decomposable as
a superposition of the response map for an unforced system having nontrivial
initial conditions and the response map for a forced system having null initial
conditions, we develop a new approach that involves reducing these component
responses independently and then combining the reduced responses into an
aggregate reduced system response. This approach allows greater flexibility and
offers better approximation properties than other comparable methods.

 <dc:description>  It is generally difficult to make any statements about the expected
prediction error in an univariate setting without further knowledge about how
the data were generated. Recent work showed that knowledge about the real
underlying causal structure of a data generation process has implications for
various machine learning settings. Assuming an additive noise and an
independence between data generating mechanism and its input, we draw a novel
connection between the intrinsic causal relationship of two variables and the
expected prediction error. We formulate the theorem that the expected error of
the true data generating function as prediction model is generally smaller when
the effect is predicted from its cause and, on the contrary, greater when the
cause is predicted from its effect. The theorem implies an asymmetry in the
error depending on the prediction direction. This is further corroborated with
empirical evaluations in artificial and real-world data sets.

 <dc:title>On the Optimality of Tape Merge of Two Lists with Similar Size</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The problem of merging sorted lists in the least number of pairwise
comparisons has been solved completely only for a few special cases. Graham and
Karp \cite{taocp} independently discovered that the tape merge algorithm is
optimal in the worst case when the two lists have the same size. In the seminal
papers, Stockmeyer and Yao\cite{yao}, Murphy and Paull\cite{3k3}, and
Christen\cite{christen1978optimality} independently showed when the lists to be
merged are of size $m$ and $n$ satisfying $m\leq
n\leq\lfloor\frac{3}{2}m\rfloor+1$, the tape merge algorithm is optimal in the
worst case. This paper extends this result by showing that the tape merge
algorithm is optimal in the worst case whenever the size of one list is no
larger than 1.52 times the size of the other. The main tool we used to prove
lower bounds is Knuth's adversary methods \cite{taocp}. In addition, we show
that the lower bound cannot be improved to 1.8 via Knuth's adversary methods.
We also develop a new inequality about Knuth's adversary methods, which might
be interesting in its own right. Moreover, we design a simple procedure to
achieve constant improvement of the upper bounds for $2m-2\leq n\leq 3m $.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous driving is a multi-agent setting where the host vehicle must apply
sophisticated negotiation skills with other road users when overtaking, giving
way, merging, taking left and right turns and while pushing ahead in
unstructured urban roadways. Since there are many possible scenarios, manually
tackling all possible cases will likely yield a too simplistic policy.
Moreover, one must balance between unexpected behavior of other
drivers/pedestrians and at the same time not to be too defensive so that normal
traffic flow is maintained.
  In this paper we apply deep reinforcement learning to the problem of forming
long term driving strategies. We note that there are two major challenges that
make autonomous driving different from other robotic tasks. First, is the
necessity for ensuring functional safety - something that machine learning has
difficulty with given that performance is optimized at the level of an
expectation over many instances. Second, the Markov Decision Process model
often used in robotics is problematic in our case because of unpredictable
behavior of other agents in this multi-agent scenario. We make three
contributions in our work. First, we show how policy gradient iterations can be
used without Markovian assumptions. Second, we decompose the problem into a
composition of a Policy for Desires (which is to be learned) and trajectory
planning with hard constraints (which is not learned). The goal of Desires is
to enable comfort of driving, while hard constraints guarantees the safety of
driving. Third, we introduce a hierarchical temporal abstraction we call an
&quot;Option Graph&quot; with a gating mechanism that significantly reduces the effective
horizon and thereby reducing the variance of the gradient estimation even
further.

 <dc:description>  We show that CSP is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the
treewidth of a backdoor into any tractable CSP problem over a finite constraint
language. This result combines the two prominent approaches for achieving
tractability for CSP: (i) by structural restrictions on the interaction between
the variables and the constraints and (ii) by language restrictions on the
relations that can be used inside the constraints. Apart from defining the
notion of backdoor-treewidth and showing how backdoors of small treewidth can
be used to efficiently solve CSP, our main technical contribution is a
fixed-parameter algorithm that finds a backdoor of small treewidth.

 <dc:description>  Dixon's famous theorem states that the group generated by two random
permutations of a finite set is generically either the whole symmetric group or
the alternating group. In the context of random generation of finite groups
this means that it is hopeless to wish for a uniform distribution -- or even a
non-trivial one -- by drawing random permutations and looking at the generated
group. Mealy automata are a powerful tool to generate groups, including all
finite groups and many interesting infinite ones, whence the idea of generating
random finite groups by drawing random Mealy automata. In this paper we show
that, for a special class of Mealy automata that generate only finite groups,
the distribution is far from being uniform since the obtained groups are
generically a semi-direct product between a direct product of alternating
groups and a group generated by a tuple of transpositions.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes and validates an in situ calibration method to calibrate
six axis force torque (F/T) sensors once they are mounted on the system. This
procedure takes advantage of the knowledge of the model of the robot to
generate the expected wrenches of the sensors during some arbitrary motions. It
then uses this information to train and validate new calibration matrices,
taking into account the calibration matrix obtained with a classical Workbench
calibration. The proposed calibration algorithm is validated on the F/T sensors
mounted on the iCub humanoid robot legs.

 <dc:description>  Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is an important task in many machine
learning applications such as the prediction phase of a low-rank matrix
factorization model for a recommender system. There have been some works on how
to perform MIPS in sub-linear time recently. However, most of them do not have
the flexibility to control the trade-off between search efficient and search
quality. In this paper, we study the MIPS problem with a computational budget.
By carefully studying the problem structure of MIPS, we develop a novel
Greedy-MIPS algorithm, which can handle budgeted MIPS by design. While simple
and intuitive, Greedy-MIPS yields surprisingly superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. As a specific example, on a candidate set
containing half a million vectors of dimension 200, Greedy-MIPS runs 200x
faster than the naive approach while yielding search results with the top-5
precision greater than 75\%.

 <dc:title>Keystroke dynamics as signal for shallow syntactic parsing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Plank, Barbara</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Keystroke dynamics have been extensively used in psycholinguistic and writing
research to gain insights into cognitive processing. But do keystroke logs
contain actual signal that can be used to learn better natural language
processing models?
  We postulate that keystroke dynamics contain information about syntactic
structure that can inform shallow syntactic parsing. To test this hypothesis,
we explore labels derived from keystroke logs as auxiliary task in a multi-task
bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM). Our results show promising
results on two shallow syntactic parsing tasks, chunking and CCG supertagging.
Our model is simple, has the advantage that data can come from distinct
sources, and produces models that are significantly better than models trained
on the text annotations alone.

 <dc:description>  We present a distributed full-text index for big data applications in a
distributed environment. Our index can answer different types of pattern
matching queries (existential, counting and enumeration). We perform
experiments on inputs up to 100 GiB using up to 512 processors, and compare our
index with the distributed suffix array by Arroyuelo et al. [Parall. Comput.
40(9): 471--495, 2014]. The result is that our index answers counting queries
up to 5.5 times faster than the distributed suffix array, while using about the
same space. We also provide a succinct variant of our index that uses only one
third of the memory compared with our non-succinct variant, at the expense of
only 20% slower query times.

 <dc:description>  Model driven development is an effective method due to its benefits such as
code transformation, increasing productivity and reducing human based error
possibilities. Meanwhile, agile software development increases the software
flexibility and customer satisfaction by using iterative method. Can these two
development approaches be combined to develop web applications efficiently?
What are the challenges and what are the benefits of this approach? In this
paper, we answer these two crucial problems; combining model driven development
and agile software development results in not only fast development and
easiness of the user interface design but also efficient job tracking. We also
defined an agile model based approach for web applications whose implementation
study has been carried out to support the answers we gave these two crucial
problems.

 <dc:description>  We say a string has a cadence if a certain character is repeated at regular

cadence anchored if the first interval must be the same length as the others.
We give a sub-quadratic algorithm for determining whether a string has any
cadence consisting of at least three occurrences of a character, and a nearly
linear algorithm for finding all anchored cadences.

 <dc:title>Proposal for Automatic License and Number Plate Recognition System for
  Vehicle Identification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Saghaei, Hamed</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an automatic and mechanized license and number
plate recognition (LNPR) system which can extract the license plate number of
the vehicles passing through a given location using image processing
algorithms. No additional devices such as GPS or radio frequency identification
(RFID) need to be installed for implementing the proposed system. Using special
cameras, the system takes pictures from each passing vehicle and forwards the
image to the computer for being processed by the LPR software. Plate
recognition software uses different algorithms such as localization,
orientation, normalization, segmentation and finally optical character
recognition (OCR). The resulting data is applied to compare with the records on
a database. Experimental results reveal that the presented system successfully
detects and recognizes the vehicle number plate on real images. This system can
also be used for security and traffic control.

 <dc:title>From phonemes to images: levels of representation in a recurrent neural

 <dc:description>  We present a model of visually-grounded language learning based on stacked
gated recurrent neural networks which learns to predict visual features given
an image description in the form of a sequence of phonemes. The learning task
resembles that faced by human language learners who need to discover both
structure and meaning from noisy and ambiguous data across modalities. We show
that our model indeed learns to predict features of the visual context given
phonetically transcribed image descriptions, and show that it represents
linguistic information in a hierarchy of levels: lower layers in the stack are
comparatively more sensitive to form, whereas higher layers are more sensitive
to meaning.

 <dc:description>  Graphics processing units have been extensively used to accelerate classical
molecular dynamics simulations. However, there is much less progress on the
acceleration of force evaluations for many-body potentials compared to pairwise
ones. In the conventional force evaluation algorithm for many-body potentials,
the force, virial stress, and heat current for a given atom are accumulated
within different loops, which could result in write conflict between different
threads in a CUDA kernel. In this work, we provide a new force evaluation
algorithm, which is based on an explicit pairwise force expression for
many-body potentials derived recently [Phys. Rev. B 92 (2015) 094301]. In our
algorithm, the force, virial stress, and heat current for a given atom can be
accumulated within a single thread and is free of write conflicts. We discuss
the formulations and algorithms and evaluate their performance. A new
open-source code, GPUMD, is developed based on the proposed formulations. For
the Tersoff many-body potential, the double precision performance of GPUMD
using a Tesla K40 card is equivalent to that of the LAMMPS (Large-scale
Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) molecular dynamics code running
with about 100 CPU cores (Intel Xeon CPU X5670 @ 2.93 GHz).

 <dc:description>  We study a Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem in which a robot needs to
estimate its state using an onboard camera and an inertial sensor, without any
prior knowledge of the external environment. We consider the case in which the
robot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to tight computational
constraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under limited
resources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the performance
of visual-inertial navigation? Our approach has four key ingredients. First, it
is task-driven, in that the selection of the visual cues is guided by a metric
quantifying the VIN performance. Second, it exploits the notion of
anticipation, since it uses a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot
dynamics, predicting the utility of a set of visual cues over a future time
horizon. Third, it is efficient and easy to implement, since it leads to a
greedy algorithm for the selection of the most relevant visual cues. Fourth, it
provides formal performance guarantees: we leverage submodularity to prove that
the greedy selection cannot be far from the optimal (combinatorial) selection.
Simulations and real experiments on agile drones show that our approach leads
to dramatic improvements in the VIN performance. In the easy scenarios, our
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of localization errors. In
the most challenging scenarios, it enables accurate visual-inertial navigation
while the state of the art fails to track robot's motion during aggressive
maneuvers.

 <dc:description>  As the groupoid model of Hofmann and Streicher proves, identity proofs in
intensional Martin-L\&quot;of type theory cannot generally be shown to be unique.
Inspired by a theorem by Hedberg, we give some simple characterizations of
types that do have unique identity proofs. A key ingredient in these
constructions are weakly constant endofunctions on identity types. We study
such endofunctions on arbitrary types and show that they always factor through
a propositional type, the truncated or squashed domain. Such a factorization is
impossible for weakly constant functions in general (a result by Shulman), but
we present several non-trivial cases in which it can be done. Based on these
results, we define a new notion of anonymous existence in type theory and
compare different forms of existence carefully. In addition, we show possibly
surprising consequences of the judgmental computation rule of the truncation,
in particular in the context of homotopy type theory. All the results have been
formalized and verified in the dependently typed programming language Agda.

 <dc:title>Near Optimal Adaptive Shortest Path Routing with Stochastic Links States
  under Adversarial Attack</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the shortest path routing (SPR) of a network with stochastically
time varying link metrics under potential adversarial attacks. Due to potential
denial of service attacks, the distributions of link states could be stochastic
(benign) or adversarial at different temporal and spatial locations. Without
any \emph{a priori}, designing an adaptive SPR protocol to cope with all
possible situations in practice optimally is a very challenging issue. In this
paper, we present the first solution by formulating it as a multi-armed bandit
(MAB) problem. By introducing a novel control parameter into the exploration
phase for each link, a martingale inequality is applied in the our
combinatorial adversarial MAB framework. As such, our proposed algorithms could
automatically detect features of the environment within a unified framework and
find the optimal SPR strategies with almost optimal learning performance in all
possible cases over time. Moreover, we study important issues related to the
practical implementation, such as decoupling route selection with multi-path
route probing, cooperative learning among multiple sources, the &quot;cold-start&quot;
issue and delayed feedback of our algorithm. Nonetheless, the proposed SPR
algorithms can be implemented with low complexity and they are proved to scale
very well with the network size. Comparing to existing approaches in a typical
network scenario under jamming attacks, our algorithm has a 65.3\% improvement
of network delay given a learning period and a 81.5\% improvement of learning
duration under a specified network delay.

 <dc:description>  In recent years linguistic typology, which classifies the world's languages
according to their functional and structural properties, has been widely used
to support multilingual NLP. While the growing importance of typological
information in supporting multilingual tasks has been recognised, no systematic
survey of existing typological resources and their use in NLP has been
published. This paper provides such a survey as well as discussion which we
hope will both inform and inspire future work in the area.

application of finite impulse response (FIR) filters. Their embedded digital
signal processing (DSP) blocks for multiply-accumulate operations enable
efficient fixed-point computations, in cases where the filter structure is
accurately mapped to the dedicated hardware architecture. This brief presents a
generic systolic structure for high-order FIR filters, efficiently exploiting
the hardware resources of an FPGA in terms of routability and timing. Although
this seems to be an easily implementable task, the synthesizing tools require
an adaptation of the straightforward digital filter implementation for an
optimal mapping. Using the example of a symmetric FIR filter with 90 taps, we
demonstrate the performance of the proposed structure with FPGAs from Xilinx
and Altera. The implementation utilizes less than 1% of slice logic and runs at
clock frequencies up to 526 MHz. Moreover, an enhancement of the structure
ultimately provides an extended dynamic range for the quantized coefficients
without the costs of additional slice logic.

 <dc:description>  The problem of efficient modulation classification (MC) in multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems is considered. Per-layer likelihood-based MC is
proposed by employing subspace decomposition to partially decouple the
transmitted streams. When detecting the modulation type of the stream of
interest, a dense constellation is assumed on all remaining streams. The
proposed classifier outperforms existing MC schemes at a lower complexity cost,
and can be efficiently implemented in the context of joint MC and subspace data
detection.

 <dc:description>  The Wasserstein metric or earth mover's distance (EMD) is a useful tool in
statistics, machine learning and computer science with many applications to
biological or medical imaging, among others. Especially in the light of
increasingly complex data, the computation of these distances via optimal
transport is often the limiting factor. Inspired by this challenge, a variety
of new approaches to optimal transport has been proposed in recent years and
along with these new methods comes the need for a meaningful comparison.
  In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for discrete optimal transport,
called DOTmark, which is designed to serve as a neutral collection of problems,
where discrete optimal transport methods can be tested, compared to one
another, and brought to their limits on large-scale instances. It consists of a
variety of grayscale images, in various resolutions and classes, such as
several types of randomly generated images, classical test images and real data
from microscopy.
  Along with the DOTmark we present a survey and a performance test for a cross
section of established methods ranging from more traditional algorithms, such
as the transportation simplex, to recently developed approaches, such as the
shielding neighborhood method, and including also a comparison with commercial
solvers.

 <dc:title>Optimal Attack Strategies Subject to Detection Constraints Against

 <dc:description>  This paper studies an attacker against a cyber-physical system (CPS) whose
goal is to move the state of a CPS to a target state while ensuring that his or
her probability of being detected does not exceed a given bound. The attacker's
probability of being detected is related to the nonnegative bias induced by his
or her attack on the CPS' detection statistic. We formulate a linear quadratic
cost function that captures the attacker's control goal and establish
constraints on the induced bias that reflect the attacker's detection-avoidance
objectives. When the attacker is constrained to be detected at the false-alarm
rate of the detector, we show that the optimal attack strategy reduces to a
linear feedback of the attacker's state estimate. In the case that the
attacker's bias is upper bounded by a positive constant, we provide two
algorithms -- an optimal algorithm and a sub-optimal, less computationally
intensive algorithm -- to find suitable attack sequences. Finally, we
illustrate our attack strategies in numerical examples based on a
remotely-controlled helicopter under attack.

 <dc:title>Differential Inequalities in Multi-Agent Coordination and Opinion

 <dc:description>  Distributed algorithms of multi-agent coordination have attracted substantial
attention from the research community; the simplest and most thoroughly studied
of them are consensus protocols in the form of differential or difference
equations over general time-varying weighted graphs. These graphs are usually
characterized algebraically by their associated Laplacian matrices. Network
algorithms with similar algebraic graph theoretic structures, called being of
Laplacian-type in this paper, also arise in other related multi-agent control
problems, such as aggregation and containment control, target surrounding,
distributed optimization and modeling of opinion evolution in social groups. In
spite of their similarities, each of such algorithms has often been studied
using separate mathematical techniques. In this paper, a novel approach is
offered, allowing a unified and elegant way to examine many Laplacian-type
algorithms for multi-agent coordination. This approach is based on the analysis
of some differential or difference inequalities that have to be satisfied by
the some &quot;outputs&quot; of the agents (e.g. the distances to the desired set in
aggregation problems). Although such inequalities may have many unbounded
solutions, under natural graphic connectivity conditions all their bounded
solutions converge (and even reach consensus), entailing the convergence of the
corresponding distributed algorithms. In the theory of differential equations
the absence of bounded non-convergent solutions is referred to as the
equation's dichotomy. In this paper, we establish the dichotomy criteria of
Laplacian-type differential and difference inequalities and show that these
criteria enable one to extend a number of recent results, concerned with
Laplacian-type algorithms for multi-agent coordination and modeling opinion
formation in social groups.

 <dc:title>Deterministic parallel algorithms for fooling polylogarithmic juntas and
  the Lovasz Local Lemma</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Harris, David G.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many randomized algorithms can be derandomized efficiently using either the
method of conditional expectations or probability spaces with low (almost-)
independence. A series of papers, beginning with Luby (1988) and continuing
with Berger &amp; Rompel (1991) and Chari et al. (1994), showed that these
techniques can be combined to give deterministic parallel algorithms for
combinatorial optimization problems involving sums of $w$-juntas. We improve
these algorithms through derandomized variable partitioning and a new code
construction for fooling Fourier characters over $GF(2)$. This reduces the
processor complexity to essentially independent of $w$ while the running time
is reduced from exponential in $w$ to linear in $w$.
  As a key subroutine, we give a new algorithm to generate a probability space
which can fool a given set of neighborhoods, each of size at most $w$. Schulman
(1992) gave an NC algorithm to do so for $w \leq O(\log n)$. Our new algorithm
is NC1, with essentially optimal time and processor complexity, when $w =
O(\log n)$; it remains NC up to $w = \text{polylog}(n)$. This answers an open
problem of Schulman.
  One major application of these algorithms is an NC algorithm for the
Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma. Previous NC algorithms, including the seminal algorithm
of Moser &amp; Tardos (2010) and the work of Chandrasekaran et. al (2013), required
that (essentially) the bad-events could span only $O(\log n)$ variables; we
relax this to $\text{polylog}(n)$ variables. We use this to give algorithms for
defective vertex coloring and domatic graph partition in graphs of maximum
degree $\text{polylog}(n)$.

 <dc:title>Crossing the Road Without Traffic Lights: An Android-based Safety Device</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the absence of pedestrian crossing lights, finding a safe moment to cross
the road is often hazardous and challenging, especially for people with visual
impairments. We present a reliable low-cost solution, an Android device
attached to a traffic sign or lighting pole near the crossing, indicating
whether it is safe to cross the road. The indication can be by sound, display,
vibration, and various communication modalities provided by the Android device.
The integral system camera is aimed at approaching traffic. Optical flow is
computed from the incoming video stream, and projected onto an influx map,
automatically acquired during a brief training period. The crossing safety is
determined based on a 1-dimensional temporal signal derived from the
projection. We implemented the complete system on a Samsung Galaxy K-Zoom
Android smartphone, and obtained real-time operation. The system achieves
promising experimental results, providing pedestrians with sufficiently early
warning of approaching vehicles. The system can serve as a stand-alone safety
device, that can be installed where pedestrian crossing lights are ruled out.
Requiring no dedicated infrastructure, it can be powered by a solar panel and
remotely maintained via the cellular network.

 <dc:title>Finding Euler Tours in the StrSort Model</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Srivastav, Anand</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a first algorithm for finding Euler tours in undirected graphs in
the StrSort model. This model is a relaxation of the semi streaming model. The
graph is given as a stream of its edges and can only be read sequentially, but
while doing a pass over the stream we are allowed to write out another stream
which will be the input for the next pass. In addition, items in the stream are
sorted between passes. This model was introduced by Aggarwal et al. in 2004.
Here we apply this model to the problem of finding an Euler tour in a graph (or
to decide that the graph does not admit an Euler tour). The algorithm works in
two steps. In the first step, a single pass is conducted while a linear (in the
number of vertices $n$) amount of RAM is required. In the second step,
$\mathcal O(\log(n))$ passes are conducted while only $\mathcal O(\log(n))$ RAM
is required.
  We use an alteration of the algorithm of Atallah and Vishkin from 1984 for
finding Euler tours in parallel. It finds a partition of edge-disjoint circuits
and arranges them in a tree expressing their connectivity. Then the circuits
are merged according to this tree. In order to minimize the needed amount of
RAM, we evade the need to store the entire tree and use techniques suggested by
Aggarwal et al. to exchange information concerning the merging of circuits.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a Maximum Entropy model able to capture the statistics of
melodies in music. The model can be used to generate new melodies that emulate
the style of the musical corpus which was used to train it. Instead of using
the $n-$body interactions of $(n-1)-$order Markov models, traditionally used in
automatic music generation, we use a $k-$nearest neighbour model with pairwise
interactions only. In that way, we keep the number of parameters low and avoid
over-fitting problems typical of Markov models. We show that long-range musical
phrases don't need to be explicitly enforced using high-order Markov
interactions, but can instead emerge from multiple, competing, pairwise
interactions. We validate our Maximum Entropy model by contrasting how much the
generated sequences capture the style of the original corpus without
plagiarizing it. To this end we use a data-compression approach to discriminate
the levels of borrowing and innovation featured by the artificial sequences.
The results show that our modelling scheme outperforms both fixed-order and
variable-order Markov models. This shows that, despite being based only on
pairwise interactions, this Maximum Entropy scheme opens the possibility to
generate musically sensible alterations of the original phrases, providing a
way to generate innovation.

 <dc:description>  We show that a family of quantum authentication protocols introduced in
[Barnum et al., FOCS 2002] can be used to construct a secure quantum channel
and additionally recycle all of the secret key if the message is successfully
authenticated, and recycle part of the key if tampering is detected. We give a
full security proof that constructs the secure channel given only insecure
noisy channels and a shared secret key. We also prove that the number of
recycled key bits is optimal for this family of protocols, i.e., there exists
an adversarial strategy to obtain all non-recycled bits. Previous works
recycled less key and only gave partial security proofs, since they did not
consider all possible distinguishers (environments) that may be used to
distinguish the real setting from the ideal secure quantum channel and secret
key resource.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: 38+17 pages, 13 figures. v2: constructed ideal secure channel and
  secret key resource have been slightly redefined; also added a proof in the

 <dc:description>  In this article, we present a denoising algorithm to improve the
interpretation and quality of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. Given
the high level of self-similarity of STM images, we propose a denoising
algorithm by reformulating the true estimation problem as a sparse regression,
often termed sparse coding. We introduce modifications to the algorithm to cope
with the existence of artifacts, mainly dropouts, which appear in a structured
way as consecutive line segments on the scanning direction. The resulting
algorithm treats the artifacts as missing data, and the estimated values
outperform those algorithms that substitute the outliers by a local filtering.
We provide code implementations for both Matlab and Gwyddion.

 <dc:description>  This work introduces a novel, modular, layered web based platform for
managing machine learning experiments on grid-based High Performance Computing
infrastructures. The coupling of the communication services offered by the
grid, with an administration layer and conventional web server programming, via
a data synchronization utility, leads to the straightforward development of a
web-based user interface that allows the monitoring and managing of diverse
online distributed computing applications. It also introduces an experiment
generation and monitoring tool particularly suitable for investigating machine
learning in game playing. The platform is demonstrated with experiments for two
different games.

 <dc:description>  The discussion-board site 4chan has been part of the Internet's dark
underbelly since its inception, and recent political events have put it
increasingly in the spotlight. In particular, /pol/, the &quot;Politically
Incorrect&quot; board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election
season, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric
of hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the
scientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it
generates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start
addressing this gap by analyzing /pol/ along several axes, using a dataset of
over 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a
general characterization, showing that /pol/ users are well distributed around
the world and that 4chan's unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also
analyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are
predominant on /pol/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first
measurement study of /pol/, but also insight into online harassment and hate
speech trends in social media.

 <dc:description>  We present deep variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA), a deep
multi-view learning model that extends the latent variable model interpretation
of linear CCA to nonlinear observation models parameterized by deep neural
networks. We derive variational lower bounds of the data likelihood by
parameterizing the posterior probability of the latent variables from the view
that is available at test time. We also propose a variant of VCCA called
VCCA-private that can, in addition to the &quot;common variables&quot; underlying both
views, extract the &quot;private variables&quot; within each view, and disentangles the
shared and private information for multi-view data without hard supervision.
Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our methods are
competitive across domains.

 <dc:title>On break-away forces in actuated motion systems with nonlinear friction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ruderman, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The phenomenon of so-called break-away forces, as maximal actuation forces at
which a sticking system begins to slide and thus passes over to a steady
(macro) motion, is well known from engineering practice but still less
understood in its cause-effect relationship. This note analyzes the break-away
behavior of systems with nonlinear friction, which is analytically
well-described by combining the Coulomb friction law with rate-independent
presliding transitions and, when necessary, Stribeck effect of the
velocity-weakening steady-state curve. The break-away conditions are harmonized
with analytic form of the system description and shown to be in accord with a
relationship between the varying break-away force and actuation force rate --
well known from the experiments reported in several independently published
works.

 <dc:description>  We propose a deep neural network fusion architecture for fast and robust
pedestrian detection. The proposed network fusion architecture allows for
parallel processing of multiple networks for speed. A single shot deep
convolutional network is trained as a object detector to generate all possible
pedestrian candidates of different sizes and occlusions. This network outputs a
large variety of pedestrian candidates to cover the majority of ground-truth
pedestrians while also introducing a large number of false positives. Next,
multiple deep neural networks are used in parallel for further refinement of
these pedestrian candidates. We introduce a soft-rejection based network fusion
method to fuse the soft metrics from all networks together to generate the
final confidence scores. Our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-arts, especially when detecting small-size and occluded
pedestrians. Furthermore, we propose a method for integrating pixel-wise
semantic segmentation network into the network fusion architecture as a
reinforcement to the pedestrian detector. The approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on most protocols on Caltech Pedestrian dataset, with
significant boosts on several protocols. It is also faster than all other
methods.

 <dc:description>  Current analysis of tumor proliferation, the most salient prognostic
biomarker for invasive breast cancer, is limited to subjective mitosis counting
by pathologists in localized regions of tissue images. This study presents the
first data-driven integrative approach to characterize the severity of tumor
growth and spread on a categorical and molecular level, utilizing multiple
biologically salient deep learning classifiers to develop a comprehensive
prognostic model. Our approach achieves pathologist-level performance on
three-class categorical tumor severity prediction. It additionally pioneers
prediction of molecular expression data from a tissue image, obtaining a
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.60 with ex vivo mean calculated
RNA expression. Furthermore, our framework is applied to identify over two
hundred unprecedented biomarkers critical to the accurate assessment of tumor
proliferation, validating our proposed integrative pipeline as the first to
holistically and objectively analyze histopathological images.

 <dc:title>Computation of forward stochastic reach sets: Application to stochastic,

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a method to efficiently compute the forward stochastic reach (FSR)
set and its probability measure for nonlinear systems with an affine
disturbance input, that is stochastic and bounded. This method is applicable to
systems with an a priori known controller, or to uncontrolled systems, and
often arises in problems in obstacle avoidance in mobile robotics. When used as
a constraint in finite horizon controller synthesis, the FSR set, and its
probability measure facilitates probabilistic collision avoidance, in contrast
to methods which presume the obstacles act in a worst-case fashion and generate
hard constraints that cannot be violated. We tailor our approach to accommodate
rigid body constraints, and show convexity is assured so long as the rigid body
shape of each obstacle is also convex. We extend methods for multi-obstacle
avoidance through mixed integer linear programming (with linear robot and
obstacle dynamics) to accommodate chance constraints that represent the FSR set
probability measure. We demonstrate our method on a rigid-body obstacle
avoidance scenario, in which a receding horizon controller is designed to avoid
several stochastically moving obstacles while reaching the desired goal. Our
approach can provide solutions when approaches that presume a worst-case action
from the obstacle fail.

 <dc:description>  In participatory budgeting, communities collectively decide on the allocation
of public tax dollars for local public projects. In this work, we consider the
question of fairly aggregating the preferences of community members to
determine an allocation of funds to projects. This problem is different from
standard fair resource allocation because of public goods: The allocated goods
benefit all users simultaneously. Fairness is crucial in participatory decision
making, since generating equitable outcomes is an important goal of these
processes. We argue that the classic game theoretic notion of core captures
fairness in the setting. To compute the core, we first develop a novel
characterization of a public goods market equilibrium called the Lindahl
equilibrium, which is always a core solution. We then provide the first (to our
knowledge) polynomial time algorithm for computing such an equilibrium for a
broad set of utility functions; our algorithm also generalizes (in a
non-trivial way) the well-known concept of proportional fairness. We use our
theoretical insights to perform experiments on real participatory budgeting
voting data. We empirically show that the core can be efficiently computed for
utility functions that naturally model our practical setting, and examine the
relation of the core with the familiar welfare objective. Finally, we address
concerns of incentives and mechanism design by developing a randomized
approximately dominant-strategy truthful mechanism building on the exponential
mechanism from differential privacy.

 <dc:description>  We consider two fundamental multi-user channel models: the multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel with one helper (WTH) and the MIMO
multiple access wiretap channel (MAC-WT). In each case, the eavesdropper has
$K$ antennas while the remaining terminals have $N$ antennas each. We consider
a fast fading channel where the channel state information (CSI) of the
legitimate receiver is available at the transmitters but no channel state
information at the transmitters (CSIT) is available for the eavesdropper's
channel. We determine the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) for
each channel model for the regime $K\leq N$, and show that in this regime, the
MAC-WT channel reduces to the WTH in the absence of eavesdropper CSIT. For the
regime $N\leq K\leq 2N$, we obtain the optimal linear s.d.o.f., and show that
the MAC-WT channel and the WTH have the same optimal s.d.o.f. when restricted
to linear encoding strategies. In the absence of any such restrictions, we
provide an upper bound for the sum s.d.o.f. of the MAC-WT chanel in the regime
$N\leq K\leq 2N$. Our results show that unlike in the single-input
single-output (SISO) case, there is loss of s.d.o.f. for even the WTH due to
lack of eavesdropper CSIT when $K\geq N$.

(GAP), in particular for Travel Salesman Problem in an Euclidian 2D space the
well known condition Jordan's simple curve and opposite condition for the

 <dc:description>  Attribution of responsibility and blame are important topics in political
science especially as individuals tend to think of political issues in terms of
questions of responsibility, and as blame carries far more weight in voting
behavior than that of credit. However, surprisingly, there is a paucity of
studies on the attribution of responsibility and blame in the field of disaster
research.
  The Flint water crisis is a story of government failure at all levels. By
studying microblog posts about it, we understand how citizens assign
responsibility and blame regarding such a man-made disaster online. We form
hypotheses based on social scientific theories in disaster research and then
operationalize them on unobtrusive, observational social media data. In
particular, we investigate the following phenomena: the source for blame; the
partisan predisposition; the concerned geographies; and the contagion of
complaining.
  This paper adds to the sociology of disasters research by exploiting a new,
rarely used data source (the social web), and by employing new computational
methods (such as sentiment analysis and retrospective cohort study design) on
this new form of data. In this regard, this work should be seen as the first
step toward drawing more challenging inferences on the sociology of disasters
from &quot;big social data&quot;.

 <dc:description>  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for
constructing generative models with several appealing properties: they do not
require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure;
they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to
harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classifiers.
Here, we develop our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view
of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse
set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a
mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of
algorithms for learning in implicit generative models--models that only specify
a stochastic procedure with which to generate data--and relate these ideas to
modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate
Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and
highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative
models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs,
and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to
the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for
density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to
distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence
minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature,
and we synthesise these views to form an understanding in terms of the
relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for
future exploration and cross-pollination.

 <dc:description>  A coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical computational model is proposed for fibre
reinforced polymers, formulated within the framework of Computational
Homogenisation (CH). At each macrostructure Gauss point, constitutive matrices
for thermal, moisture transport and mechanical responses are calculated from CH
of the underlying representative volume element (RVE). A degradation model,
developed from experimental data relating evolution of mechanical properties
over time for a given exposure temperature and moisture concentration is also
developed and incorporated in the proposed computational model. A unified
approach is used to impose the RVE boundary conditions, which allows convenient
switching between linear Dirichlet, uniform Neumann and periodic boundary
conditions. A plain weave textile composite RVE consisting of yarns embedded in
a matrix is considered in this case. Matrix and yarns are considered as
isotropic and transversely isotropic materials respectively. Furthermore, the
computational framework utilises hierarchic basis functions and designed to
take advantage of distributed memory high-performance computing.

 <dc:description>  In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, acquisition of the
channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT) is crucial. In this
paper, a practical CSIT estimation scheme is proposed for frequency division
duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Specifically, each received pilot symbol
is first quantized to one bit per dimension at the receiver side and then the
quantized bits are fed back to the transmitter. A joint one-bit compressed
sensing algorithm is implemented at the transmitter to recover the channel
matrices. The algorithm leverages the hidden joint sparsity structure in the
user channel matrices to minimize the training and feedback overhead, which is
considered to be a major challenge for FDD systems. Moreover, the one-bit
compressed sensing algorithm accurately recovers the channel directions for
beamforming. The one-bit feedback mechanism can be implemented in practical
systems using the uplink control channel. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme nearly achieves the maximum output signal-to-noise-ratio for
beamforming based on the estimated CSIT.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicular communication systems will provide an
abundance of bandwidth for the exchange of raw sensor data and support
driver-assisted and safety-related functionalities. Lack of secure
communication links, however, may lead to abuses and attacks that jeopardize
the efficiency of transportation systems and the physical safety of drivers. In
this paper, we propose two physical layer (PHY) security techniques for
vehicular mmWave communication systems. The first technique uses multiple
antennas with a single RF chain to transmit information symbols to a target
receiver and noise-like signals in non-receiver directions. The second
technique uses multiple antennas with a few RF chains to transmit information
symbols to a target receiver and opportunistically inject artificial noise in
controlled directions, thereby reducing interference in vehicular environments.
Theoretical and numerical results show that the proposed techniques provide
higher secrecy rate when compared to traditional PHY security techniques that
require digital or more complex antenna architectures.

 <dc:description>  Developing control policies in simulation is often more practical and safer
than directly running experiments in the real world. This applies to policies
obtained from planning and optimization, and even more so to policies obtained
from reinforcement learning, which is often very data demanding. However, a
policy that succeeds in simulation often doesn't work when deployed on a real
robot. Nevertheless, often the overall gist of what the policy does in
simulation remains valid in the real world. In this paper we investigate such
settings, where the sequence of states traversed in simulation remains
reasonable for the real world, even if the details of the controls are not, as
could be the case when the key differences lie in detailed friction, contact,
mass and geometry properties. During execution, at each time step our approach
computes what the simulation-based control policy would do, but then, rather
than executing these controls on the real robot, our approach computes what the
simulation expects the resulting next state(s) will be, and then relies on a
learned deep inverse dynamics model to decide which real-world action is most
suitable to achieve those next states. Deep models are only as good as their
training data, and we also propose an approach for data collection to
(incrementally) learn the deep inverse dynamics model. Our experiments shows
our approach compares favorably with various baselines that have been developed
for dealing with simulation to real world model discrepancy, including output
error control and Gaussian dynamics adaptation.

 <dc:title>Improved Parallel Construction of Wavelet Trees and Rank/Select

 <dc:creator>Shun, Julian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Existing parallel algorithms for wavelet tree construction have a work
complexity of $O(n\log\sigma)$. This paper presents parallel algorithms for the
problem with improved work complexity. Our first algorithm is based on parallel
integer sorting and has either $O(n\log\log n\lceil\log\sigma/\sqrt{\log
n\log\log n}\rceil)$ work and polylogarithmic depth, or
$O(n\lceil\log\sigma/\sqrt{\log n}\rceil)$ work and sub-linear depth. We also
describe another algorithm that has $O(n\lceil\log\sigma/\sqrt{\log n} \rceil)$
work and $O(\sigma+\log n)$ depth. We then show how to use similar ideas to
construct variants of wavelet trees (arbitrary-shaped binary trees and multiary
trees) as well as wavelet matrices in parallel with lower work complexity than
prior algorithms. Finally, we show that the rank and select structures on
binary sequences and multiary sequences, which are stored on wavelet tree
nodes, can be constructed in parallel with improved work bounds, matching those
of the best existing sequential algorithms for constructing rank and select
structures.

 <dc:description>  A systematic fractal brownian motion approach is proposed for generating
coherent noise, aiming at procedurally generating realistic terrain and
textures. Two models are tested and compared to Perlin noise method for
two-dimensional height map generation. A fractal analysis is performed in order
to compare fractal behaviour of generated data to real terrain coastlines from
the point of view of fractal dimension. Performance analysis show that one of
the described schemes requires half as many primitive operations than Perlin
noise while producing data of equivalent quality.

 <dc:description>  Radio frequency (RF) energy transfer and harvesting has been intensively
studied recently as a promising approach to significantly extend the lifetime
of energy-constrained wireless networks. This technique has a great potential
to provide relatively stable and continuous RF energy to devices wirelessly; it
thus opened a new research paradigm, termed wireless-powered communication
(WPC), which has raised many new research opportunities with wide applications.
Among these, the design and analysis of cooperative schemes towards efficient
WPC have attracted tremendous research interests nowadays. This article
provides an overview of various cooperative strategies for WPC, with particular
emphasis on relaying protocols for wireless-powered cooperative communications,
cooperative spectrum sharing schemes for cognitive wireless-powered networks,
and cooperative jamming strategies towards wireless-powered secure
communications. We also identify several interesting research directions in
this area before concluding this article.

 <dc:description>  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has been profusely used by most of
internet applications. Since 1970s, several TCP variants have been developed in
order to cope with the fast increasing of network capacities especially in high
Bandwidth Delay Product (high-BDP) networks. In these TCP variants, several
approaches have been used, some of these approaches have the ability to
estimate available bandwidths and some react based on network loss and/or delay
changes. This variety of the used approaches arises many consequent problems
with different levels of dependability and accuracy. Indeed, a particular TCP
variant which is proper for wireless networks, may not fit for high-BDP wired
networks and vice versa. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comparison
between the high-speed TCP variants that have a high level of importance
especially after the fast growth of networks bandwidths. In this paper,
high-speed TCP variants, that are implemented in Linux and available for
research, have been evaluated using NS2 network simulator. This performance
evaluation presents the advantages and disadvantages of these TCP variants in
terms of throughput, loss-ratio and fairness over high-BDP networks. The
results reveal that, CUBIC and YeAH overcome the other highspeed TCP variants
in different cases of buffer size. However, they still require more improvement
to extend their ability to fully utilize the high-speed bandwidths, especially
when the applied buffer is near-zero or less than the BDP of the link.

 <dc:title>Capacity bounds for distributed storage</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Luby, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The information capacity of a distributed storage system is the amount of
source data that can be reliably stored for long durations. Storage nodes fail
over time and are replaced, and thus data is erased at an erasure rate. To
maintain recoverability of source data, a repairer generates redundant data
from data read from nodes, and writes redundant data to nodes, where the repair
rate is the rate at which the repairer reads and writes data. We prove the
information capacity approaches $\left(1-\frac{1}{2 \cdot \sigma} \right) \cdot
N \cdot s$ as $N$ and $\sigma$ grow, where $N$ is the number of nodes, $s$ is
the amount of data each node can store, and $\sigma$ is the repair rate to
erasure rate ratio.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel scoring concept for visual place recognition based on
nearest neighbor descriptor voting and demonstrate how the algorithm naturally
emerges from the problem formulation. Based on the observation that the number
of votes for matching places can be evaluated using a binomial distribution
model, loop closures can be detected with high precision. By casting the
problem into a probabilistic framework, we not only remove the need for
commonly employed heuristic parameters but also provide a powerful score to
classify matching and non-matching places. We present methods for both a 2D-2D
pose-graph vertex matching and a 2D-3D landmark matching based on the above
scoring. The approach maintains accuracy while being efficient enough for
online application through the use of compact (low dimensional) descriptors and
fast nearest neighbor retrieval techniques. The proposed methods are evaluated
on several challenging datasets in varied environments, showing
state-of-the-art results with high precision and high recall.

 <dc:title>Review of Inferring Latent Attributes from Twitter</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ludu, Surabhi Singh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper reviews literature from 2011 to 2013 on how Latent attributes like
gender, political leaning etc. can be inferred from a person's twitter and
neighborhood data. Prediction of demographic data can bring value to
businesses, can prove instrumental in legal investigation. Moreover, political
leanings can be inferred from the wide variety of user data available on-line.
The motive of this review is to understand how large data sets can be made from
available twitter data. The tweeting and re tweeting behavior of a user can be
user to infer attributes like, gender, age etc. We explore in this text how
this field can be expanded in future and possible avenues for future research.

 <dc:description>  With the advancement of robotics, machine learning, and machine perception,
increasingly more robots will enter human environments to assist with daily
tasks. However, dynamically-changing human environments requires reactive
motion plans. Reactivity can be accomplished through replanning, e.g.
model-predictive control, or through a reactive feedback policy that modifies
on-going behavior in response to sensory events. In this paper, we investigate
how to use machine learning to add reactivity to a previously learned nominal
skilled behavior. We approach this by learning a reactive modification term for
movement plans represented by nonlinear differential equations. In particular,
we use dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to represent a skill and a neural
network to learn a reactive policy from human demonstrations. We use the well
explored domain of obstacle avoidance for robot manipulation as a test bed. Our
approach demonstrates how a neural network can be combined with physical
insights to ensure robust behavior across different obstacle settings and
movement durations. Evaluations on an anthropomorphic robotic system
demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.

 <dc:description>  In complex combinatorial markets with complementary valuations, truthful
auctions can yield low revenue. Core-selecting auctions attempt to boost
revenue by setting prices so that no group of agents, including the auctioneer,
can jointly improve their utilities by switching to a different allocation and
payments. Among outcomes in the core, bidder-optimal core points have been the
most widely studied due to their incentive properties, such as being
implementable at equilibrium. Prior work in economics has studied heuristics
and algorithms for computing approximate bidder-optimal core points given
oracle access to the welfare optimization problem, but these solutions either
lack performance guarantees or are based on prohibitively expensive convex
programs. Our main result is a combinatorial algorithm that finds an
approximate bidder-optimal core point in a quasi-linear number of calls to the
welfare maximization oracle.

 <dc:description>  We describe a general method of detecting valid chains or links of pieces on
a two-dimensional grid. Specifically, using the example of the chess variant
known as Switch-Side Chain-Chess (SSCC). Presently, no foolproof method of
detecting such chains in any given chess position is known and existing graph
theory, to our knowledge, is unable to fully address this problem either. We
therefore propose a solution implemented and tested using the C++ programming
language. We have been unable to find an incorrect result and therefore offer
it as the most viable solution thus far to the chain-detection problem in this
chess variant. The algorithm is also scalable, in principle, to areas beyond
two-dimensional grids such as 3D analysis and molecular chemistry.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a simple two-player test which certifies that the players apply
tensor products of Pauli $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Z$ observables on the tensor
product of $n$ EPR pairs. The test has constant robustness: any strategy
achieving success probability within an additive $\varepsilon$ of the optimal
must be $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$-close, in the appropriate distance
measure, to the honest $n$-qubit strategy. The test involves $2n$-bit questions
and $2$-bit answers. The key technical ingredient is a quantum version of the
classical linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld.
  As applications of our result we give (i) the first robust self-test for $n$
EPR pairs; (ii) a quantum multiprover interactive proof system for the local
Hamiltonian problem with a constant number of provers and classical questions
and answers, and a constant completeness-soundness gap independent of system
size; (iii) a robust protocol for delegated quantum computation.

 <dc:title>Minimax Filter: Learning to Preserve Privacy from Inference Attacks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hamm, Jihun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Preserving privacy of continuous and/or high-dimensional data such as images,
videos and audios, can be challenging with syntactic anonymization methods
which are designed for discrete attributes. Differential privacy, which
provides a more formal definition of privacy, has shown more success in
sanitizing continuous data. However, both syntactic and differential privacy
are susceptible to inference attacks, i.e., an adversary can accurately infer
sensitive attributes from sanitized data. The paper proposes a novel
filter-based mechanism which preserves privacy of continuous and
high-dimensional attributes against inference attacks. Finding the optimal
utility-privacy tradeoff is formulated as a min-diff-max optimization problem.
The paper provides an ERM-like analysis of the generalization error and also a
practical algorithm to perform the optimization. In addition, the paper
proposes an extension that combines minimax filter and differentially-private
noisy mechanism. Advantages of the method over purely noisy mechanisms is
explained and demonstrated with examples. Experiments with several real-world
tasks including facial expression classification, speech emotion
classification, and activity classification from motion, show that the minimax
filter can simultaneously achieve similar or better target task accuracy and
lower inference accuracy, often significantly lower than previous methods.

 <dc:title>Monitoring the Top-m Aggregation in a Sliding Window of Spatial Queries</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose and study the problem of top-m rank aggregation of
spatial objects in streaming queries, where, given a set of objects O, a stream
of spatial queries (kNN or range), the goal is to report m objects with the
highest aggregate rank. The rank of an object w.r.t. an individual query is
computed based on its distance from the query location, and the aggregate rank
is computed from all of the individual rank orderings. Solutions to this
fundamental problem can be used to monitor the popularity of spatial objects,
which in turn can provide new analytical tools for spatial data. Our work draws
inspiration from three different domains: rank aggregation, continuous queries
and spatial databases. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work
that considers all three problem domains in a single context. Our problem is
different from the classical rank aggregation problem in the way that the rank
of spatial objects are dependent on streaming queries whose locations are not
known a priori, and is different from the problem of continuous spatial queries
because new query locations can arrive in any region, but do not move. In order
to solve this problem, we show how to upper and lower bound the rank of an
object for any unseen query. Then we propose an approximation solution to
continuously monitor the top-m objects efficiently, for which we design an
Inverted Rank File (IRF) index to guarantee the error bound of the solution. In
particular, we propose the notion of safe ranking to determine whether the
current result is still valid or not when new queries arrive, and propose the
notion of validation objects to limit the number of objects to update in the
top-m results. We also propose an exact solution for applications where an
approximate solution is not sufficient. Last, we conduct extensive experiments
to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions.

 <dc:description>  In this work we consider the ground space connectivity problem for commuting
local Hamiltonians. The ground space connectivity problem asks whether it is
possible to go from one (efficiently preparable) state to another by applying a
polynomial length sequence of 2-qubit unitaries while remaining at all times in
a state with low energy for a given Hamiltonian $H$. It was shown in [Gharibian
and Sikora, ICALP'15] that this problem is QCMA-complete for general local
Hamiltonians, where QCMA is defined as QMA with a classical witness and BQP
verifier. Here we show that the commuting version of the problem is also
QCMA-complete. This provides one of the first examples where commuting local
Hamiltonians exhibit complexity theoretic hardness equivalent to general local
Hamiltonians.

 <dc:title>New families of Strictly optimal Frequency hopping sequence sets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bao, Jingjun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Frequency hopping sequences (FHSs) with favorable partial Hamming correlation
properties have important applications in many synchronization and
multiple-access systems. In this paper, we investigate constructions of FHS
sets with optimal partial Hamming correlation. We present several direct
constructions for balanced nested cyclic difference packings (BNCDPs) and
balanced nested cyclic relative difference packings (BNCRDPs) such that both of
them have a special property by using trace functions and discrete logarithm.
We also show three recursive constructions for FHS sets with partial Hamming
correlation, which are based on cyclic difference matrices and discrete
logarithm. Combing these BNCDPs, BNCRDPs and three recursive constructions, we
obtain infinitely many new strictly optimal FHS sets with respect to the
Peng-Fan bounds.

 <dc:description>  This work continues the study of the relationship between sample compression
schemes and statistical learning, which has been mostly investigated within the
framework of binary classification. The central theme of this work is
establishing equivalences between learnability and compressibility, and
utilizing these equivalences in the study of statistical learning theory.
  We begin with the setting of multiclass categorization (zero/one loss). We
prove that in this case learnability is equivalent to compression of
logarithmic sample size, and that uniform convergence implies compression of
constant size.
  We then consider Vapnik's general learning setting: we show that in order to
extend the compressibility-learnability equivalence to this case, it is
necessary to consider an approximate variant of compression.
  Finally, we provide some applications of the compressibility-learnability
equivalences:
  (i) Agnostic-case learnability and realizable-case learnability are
equivalent in multiclass categorization problems (in terms of sample
complexity).
  (ii) This equivalence between agnostic-case learnability and realizable-case
learnability does not hold for general learning problems: There exists a
learning problem whose loss function takes just three values, under which
agnostic-case and realizable-case learnability are not equivalent.
  (iii) Uniform convergence implies compression of constant size in multiclass
categorization problems. Part of the argument includes an analysis of the
uniform convergence rate in terms of the graph dimension, in which we improve
upon previous bounds.
  (iv) A dichotomy for sample compression in multiclass categorization
problems: If a non-trivial compression exists then a compression of logarithmic
size exists.
  (v) A compactness theorem for multiclass categorization problems.

 <dc:title>Subspace clustering based on low rank representation and weighted

 <dc:description>  Subspace clustering refers to the problem of segmenting a set of data points
approximately drawn from a union of multiple linear subspaces. Aiming at the
subspace clustering problem, various subspace clustering algorithms have been
proposed and low rank representation based subspace clustering is a very
promising and efficient subspace clustering algorithm. Low rank representation
method seeks the lowest rank representation among all the candidates that can
represent the data points as linear combinations of the bases in a given
dictionary. Nuclear norm minimization is adopted to minimize the rank of the
representation matrix. However, nuclear norm is not a very good approximation
of the rank of a matrix and the representation matrix thus obtained can be of
high rank which will affect the final clustering accuracy. Weighted nuclear
norm (WNN) is a better approximation of the rank of a matrix and WNN is adopted
in this paper to describe the rank of the representation matrix. The convex
program is solved via conventional alternation direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) and linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (LADMM) and
they are respectively refer to as WNNM-LRR and WNNM-LRR(L). Experimental
results show that, compared with low rank representation method and several
other state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods, WNNM-LRR and WNNM-LRR(L)
can get higher clustering accuracy.

 <dc:description>  In the context of contemporary monophonic music, expression can be seen as
the difference between a musical performance and its symbolic representation,
i.e. a musical score. In this paper, we show how Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)
models can be used to generate musical expression in order to mimic a human
performance. As a training corpus, we had a professional pianist play about 150
melodies of jazz, pop, and latin jazz. The results show a good predictive
power, validating the choice of our model. Additionally, we set up a listening
test whose results reveal that on average, people significantly prefer the
melodies generated by the MaxEnt model than the ones without any expression, or
with fully random expression. Furthermore, in some cases, MaxEnt melodies are
almost as popular as the human performed ones.

 <dc:description>  In order to analyze the moving and deforming of the objects in image
sequence, a novel way is presented to analyze the local changes of object edges
between two related images (such as two adjacent frames in a video sequence),
which is inspired by the physical electromagnetic interaction. The changes of
edge between adjacent frames in sequences are analyzed by simulation of virtual
current interaction, which can reflect the change of the object's position or
shape. The virtual current along the main edge line is proposed based on the
significant edge extraction. Then the virtual interaction between the current
elements in the two related images is studied by imitating the interaction
between physical current-carrying wires. The experimental results prove that
the distribution of magnetic forces on the current elements in one image
applied by the other can reflect the local change of edge lines from one image
to the other, which is important in further analysis.

 <dc:description>  A novel model for image segmentation is proposed, which is inspired by the
carrier immigration mechanism in physical P-N junction. The carrier diffusing
and drifting are simulated in the proposed model, which imitates the physical
self-balancing mechanism in P-N junction. The effect of virtual carrier
immigration in digital images is analyzed and studied by experiments on test
images and real world images. The sign distribution of net carrier at the
model's balance state is exploited for region segmentation. The experimental
results for both test images and real-world images demonstrate self-adaptive
and meaningful gathering of pixels to suitable regions, which prove the
effectiveness of the proposed method for image region segmentation.

 <dc:description>  A novel way of matching two images with shifting transformation is studied.
The approach is based on the presentation of the virtual edge current in
images, and also the study of virtual electromagnetic interaction between two
related images inspired by electromagnetism. The edge current in images is
proposed as a discrete simulation of the physical current, which is based on
the significant edge line extracted by Canny-like edge detection. Then the
virtual interaction of the edge currents between related images is studied by
imitating the electro-magnetic interaction between current-carrying wires.
Based on the virtual interaction force between two related images, a novel
method is presented and applied in image matching for shifting transformation.
The preliminary experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

 <dc:description>  Leveraging large data sets, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve
state-of-the-art recognition accuracy. Due to the substantial compute and
memory operations, however, they require significant execution time. The
massive parallel computing capability of GPUs make them as one of the ideal
platforms to accelerate CNNs and a number of GPU-based CNN libraries have been
developed. While existing works mainly focus on the computational efficiency of
CNNs, the memory efficiency of CNNs have been largely overlooked. Yet CNNs have
intricate data structures and their memory behavior can have significant impact
on the performance. In this work, we study the memory efficiency of various CNN
layers and reveal the performance implication from both data layouts and memory
access patterns. Experiments show the universal effect of our proposed
optimizations on both single layers and various networks, with up to 27.9x for
a single layer and up to 5.6x on the whole networks.

 <dc:description>  Training deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a time consuming task
that may take weeks to complete. In this article we propose a novel,
theoretically founded method for reducing CNN training time without incurring
any loss in accuracy. The basic idea is to begin training with a pre-train
network using lower-resolution kernels and input images, and then refine the
results at the full resolution by exploiting the spatial scaling property of
convolutions. We apply our method to the ImageNet winner OverFeat and to the
more recent ResNet architecture and show a reduction in training time of nearly
20% while test set accuracy is preserved in both cases.

 <dc:description>  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides a unique ability to image the eye
retina in 3D at micrometer resolution and gives ophthalmologist the ability to
visualize retinal diseases such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).
While visual inspection of OCT volumes remains the main method for AMD
identification, doing so is time consuming as each cross-section within the
volume must be inspected individually by the clinician. In much the same way,
acquiring ground truth information for each cross-section is expensive and time
consuming. This fact heavily limits the ability to acquire large amounts of
ground truth, which subsequently impacts the performance of learning-based
methods geared at automatic pathology identification. To avoid this burden, we
propose a novel strategy for automatic analysis of OCT volumes where only
volume labels are needed. That is, we train a classifier in a semi-supervised
manner to conduct this task. Our approach uses a novel Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) architecture, that only needs volume-level labels to be trained
to automatically asses whether an OCT volume is healthy or contains AMD. Our
architecture involves first learning a cross-section pathology classifier using
pseudo-labels that could be corrupted and then leverage these towards a more
accurate volume-level classification. We then show that our approach provides
excellent performances on a publicly available dataset and outperforms a number
of existing automatic techniques.

 <dc:description>  Millions of images on the web enable us to explore images from social events
such as a family party, thus it is of interest to understand and model the
affect exhibited by a group of people in images. But analysis of the affect
expressed by multiple people is challenging due to varied indoor and outdoor
settings, and interactions taking place between various numbers of people. A
few existing works on Group-level Emotion Recognition (GER) have investigated
on face-level information. Due to the challenging environments, face may not
provide enough information to GER. Relatively few studies have investigated
multi-modal GER. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-modal approach based on a
new feature description for understanding emotional state of a group of people
in an image. In this paper, we firstly exploit three kinds of rich information
containing face, upperbody and scene in a group-level image. Furthermore, in
order to integrate multiple person's information in a group-level image, we
propose an information aggregation method to generate three features for face,
upperbody and scene, respectively. We fuse face, upperbody and scene
information for robustness of GER against the challenging environments.
Intensive experiments are performed on two challenging group-level emotion
databases to investigate the role of face, upperbody and scene as well as
multi-modal framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves very promising performance for GER.

 <dc:description>  With advancing technologies, robotic manipulators and visual environment
sensors are becoming cheaper and more widespread. However, robot control can be
still a limiting factor for better adaptation of these technologies. Robotic
manipulators are performing very well in structured workspaces, but do not
adapt well to unexpected changes, like people entering the workspace. We
present a method combining 3D Camera based workspace mapping, and a predictive
and reflexive robot manipulator trajectory estimation to allow more efficient
and safer operation in dynamic workspaces. In experiments on a real UR5 robot
our method has proven to provide shorter and smoother trajectories compared to
a reactive trajectory planner in the same conditions. Furthermore, the robot
has successfully avoided any contact by initialising the reflexive movement
even when an obstacle got unexpectedly close to the robot. The main goal of our
work is to make the operation more flexible in unstructured dynamic workspaces
and not just avoid obstacles, but also adapt when performing collaborative
tasks with humans in the near future.

have suggested strengthening current server authentication methods by
incorporating website location as an additional authentication factor. In this
work, we explore how location information affects users' decision-making for
security and privacy. We conducted a series of qualitative interviews to learn
how location can be integrated into users' decision-making for security, and we
designed a security indicator to alert the user to changes in website
locations. We evaluated our tool in a 44-participant user study and found that
users were less likely to perform security-sensitive tasks when alerted to
location changes. Our results suggest that website location can be used as an
effective indicator for users' security assessment.

 <dc:title>An Inter-Node Interference Suppression Approach in Full-Duplex Wireless

 <dc:description>  Considering that a full-duplex network is comprised of a full-duplex (FD)
base station (BS) and two half-duplex (HD) users, one user transmits on the
uplink channel and the other receives through the downlink channel on the same
frequency. The uplink user will generate inter-user interference (IUI) on the
downlink user through the interference channel. In this paper, we propose a
novel IUI suppression approach when the BS knows the full channel station
information. The main idea of the approach is to retransmit the weighted uplink
signal as soon as it has been received at the BS. For the narrowband case, we
first derive the closed-form expression of the optimum weighted coefficient
when the SI is perfectly cancelled at the BS and then analyze the performance
of the proposed IUI suppression approach in practical considerations.
Furthermore, the proposed IUI suppression approach can be extended to the
broadband case using a time-domain weighted filter. Simulation results shows
the advantage over existing IUI suppression schemes.

 <dc:description>  Recognising detailed clothing characteristics (fine-grained attributes) in
unconstrained images of people in-the-wild is a challenging task for computer
vision, especially when there is only limited training data from the wild
whilst most data available for model learning are captured in well-controlled
environments using fashion models (well lit, no background clutter, frontal
view, high-resolution). In this work, we develop a deep learning framework
capable of model transfer learning from well-controlled shop clothing images
collected from web retailers to in-the-wild images from the street.
Specifically, we formulate a novel Multi-Task Curriculum Transfer (MTCT) deep
learning method to explore multiple sources of different types of web
annotations with multi-labelled fine-grained attributes. Our multi-task loss
function is designed to extract more discriminative representations in training
by jointly learning all attributes, and our curriculum strategy exploits the
staged easy-to-complex transfer learning motivated by cognitive studies. We
demonstrate the advantages of the MTCT model over the state-of-the-art methods
on the X-Domain benchmark, a large scale clothing attribute dataset. Moreover,
we show that the MTCT model has a notable advantage over contemporary models
when the training data size is small.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online social networks being extended to geographical space has resulted in
large amount of user check-in data. Understanding check-ins can help to build
appealing applications, such as location recommendation. In this paper, we
propose DeepCity, a feature learning framework based on deep learning, to
profile users and locations, with respect to user demographic and location
category prediction. Both of the predictions are essential for social network
companies to increase user engagement. The key contribution of DeepCity is the
proposal of task-specific random walk which uses the location and user
properties to guide the feature learning to be specific to each prediction
task. Experiments conducted on 42M check-ins in three cities collected from
Instagram have shown that DeepCity achieves a superior performance and
outperforms other baseline models significantly.

 <dc:description>  An accurate and reliable image based fruit detection system is critical for
supporting higher level agriculture tasks such as yield mapping and robotic
harvesting. This paper presents the use of a state-of-the-art object detection
framework, Faster R-CNN, in the context of fruit detection in orchards,
including mangoes, almonds and apples. Ablation studies are presented to better
understand the practical deployment of the detection network, including how
much training data is required to capture variability in the dataset. Data
augmentation techniques are shown to yield significant performance gains,
resulting in a greater than two-fold reduction in the number of training images
required. In contrast, transferring knowledge between orchards contributed to
negligible performance gain over initialising the Deep Convolutional Neural
Network directly from ImageNet features. Finally, to operate over orchard data
containing between 100-1000 fruit per image, a tiling approach is introduced
for the Faster R-CNN framework. The study has resulted in the best yet
detection performance for these orchards relative to previous works, with an
F1-score of &gt;0.9 achieved for apples and mangoes.

 <dc:title>Light Field Compression with Disparity Guided Sparse Coding based on
  Structural Key Views</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recent imaging technologies are rapidly evolving for sampling richer and more
immersive representations of the 3D world. And one of the emerging technologies
are light field (LF) cameras based on micro-lens arrays. To record the
directional information of the light rays, a much larger storage space and
transmission bandwidth are required by a LF image as compared with a
conventional 2D image of similar spatial dimension, and the compression of LF
data becomes a vital part of its application.
  In this paper, we propose a LF codec that fully exploits the intrinsic
geometry between the LF sub-views by first approximating the LF with disparity
guided sparse coding over a perspective shifted light field dictionary. The
sparse coding is only based on several optimized Structural Key Views (SKV);
however the entire LF can be recovered from the coding coefficients. By keeping
the approximation identical between encoder and decoder, only the residuals of
the non-key views, disparity map and the SKVs need to be compressed into the
bit stream. An optimized SKV selection method is proposed such that most LF
spatial information could be preserved. And to achieve optimum dictionary
efficiency, the LF is divided into several Coding Regions (CR), over which the
reconstruction works individually. Experiments and comparisons have been
carried out over benchmark LF dataset, which show that the proposed SC-SKV
codec produces convincing compression results in terms of both rate-distortion
performance and visual quality compared with High Efficiency Video Coding
(HEVC): with 47.87% BD-rate reduction and 1.59 dB BD-PSNR improvement achieved
on average, especially with up to 4 dB improvement for low bit rate scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In the context of estimating material properties of porous walls based on
in-site measurements and identification method, this paper presents the concept
of Optimal Experiment Design (OED). It aims at searching the best experimental
conditions in terms of quantity and position of sensors and boundary conditions
imposed to the material. These optimal conditions ensure to provide the maximum
accuracy of the identification method and thus the estimated parameters. The
search of the OED is done by using the Fisher information matrix and a priori
knowledge of the parameters. The methodology is applied for two case studies.
The first one deals with purely conductive heat transfer. The concept of
optimal experiment design is detailed and verified with 100 inverse problems
for different experiment designs. The second case study combines a strong
coupling between heat and moisture transfer through a porous building material.
The methodology presented is based on a scientific formalism for efficient
planning of experimental work that can be extended to the optimal design of
experiments related to other problems in thermal and fluid sciences.

of Koch networks. Each of the labels is consisted of two parts, the precise
position and the time adding to Koch networks. The shortest path routing
between any two vertices is determined only on the basis of their labels, and
the routing is calculated only by few computations. The rigorous solutions of
betweenness centrality for every node and edge are also derived by the help of
their labels. Furthermore, the community structure in Koch networks is studied
by the current and voltage characteristics of its resistor networks.

 <dc:description>  Academic leadership is essential for research innovation and impact. Until
now, there has been no dedicated measure of leadership by bibliometrics.
Popular bibliometric indices are mainly based on academic output, such as the
journal impact factor and the number of citations. Here we develop an academic
leadership index based on readily available bibliometric data that is sensitive
to not only academic output but also research efficiency. Our leadership index
was tested in two studies on peer-reviewed journal papers by
extramurally-funded principal investigators in the field of life sciences from
China and the USA, respectively. The leadership performance of these principal
investigators was quantified and compared relative to university rank and other
factors. As a validation measure, we show that the highest average leadership
index was achieved by principal investigators at top national universities in
both countries. More interestingly, our results also indicate that on an
individual basis, strong leadership and high efficiency are not necessarily
associated with those at top-tier universities nor with the most funding. This
leadership index may become the basis of a comprehensive merit system,
facilitating academic evaluation and resource management.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores new evaluation perspectives for image captioning and
introduces a noun translation task that achieves comparative image caption
generation performance by translating from a set of nouns to captions. This
implies that in image captioning, all word categories other than nouns can be
evoked by a powerful language model without sacrificing performance on n-gram
precision. The paper also investigates lower and upper bounds of how much
individual word categories in the captions contribute to the final BLEU score.
A large possible improvement exists for nouns, verbs, and prepositions.

 <dc:description>  The goal of semi-supervised learning is to improve supervised classifiers by
using additional unlabeled training examples. In this work we study a simple
self-learning approach to semi-supervised learning applied to the least squares
classifier. We show that a soft-label and a hard-label variant of self-learning
can be derived by applying block coordinate descent to two related but slightly
different objective functions. The resulting soft-label approach is related to
an idea about dealing with missing data that dates back to the 1930s. We show
that the soft-label variant typically outperforms the hard-label variant on
benchmark datasets and partially explain this behaviour by studying the
relative difficulty of finding good local minima for the corresponding
objective functions.

a firm solves the first stage, it can choose whether and when to disclose the
solution. We find that there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium, in which
each firm will disclose the solution of the first stage if it arrives early,
withhold the solution if it arrives neither too soon nor too late, and exit the
competition if it has not arrived after a sufficiently long time. From a social
welfare perspective, a competition is surprisingly not always optimal: in
certain scenarios, it is socially more desirable to assign the R&amp;D project to a
single firm.

 <dc:description>  Given a network represented by a graph $G=(V,E)$, we consider a dynamical
process of influence diffusion in $G$ that evolves as follows: Initially only
the nodes of a given $S\subseteq V$ are influenced; subsequently, at each
round, the set of influenced nodes is augmented by all the nodes in the network
that have a sufficiently large number of already influenced neighbors. The
question is to determine a small subset of nodes $S$ (\emph{a target set}) that
can influence the whole network. This is a widely studied problem that
abstracts many phenomena in the social, economic, biological, and physical
sciences. It is known that the above optimization problem is hard to
approximate within a factor of $2^{\log^{1-\epsilon}|V|}$, for any $\epsilon
&gt;0$. In this paper, we present a fast and surprisingly simple algorithm that
exhibits the following features: 1) when applied to trees, cycles, or complete
graphs, it always produces an optimal solution (i.e, a minimum size target
set); 2) when applied to arbitrary networks, it always produces a solution of
cardinality which improves on the previously known upper bound; 3) when applied
to real-life networks, it always produces solutions that substantially
outperform the ones obtained by previously published algorithms (for which no
proof of optimality or performance guarantee is known in any class of graphs).

 <dc:description>  Caching of popular content on wireless nodes is recently proposed as a means
to reduce congestion in the backbone of cellular networks and to improve
Quality of Service. From a network point of view, the goal is to offload as
many users as possible from the backbone network to the wireless caches while
at the same time offering good service to cache-unrelated users. Aggressive
offloading can lead to an unbalanced user association. Some wireless nodes can
be overloaded by cache-related traffic while the resources of others remain
underused. Given a fixed content placement, this work proposes an efficient
distributed algorithm to control and balance the association of cache-related
traffic among cellular cache memories. The algorithm allows the network to
achieve the globally optimal solution and can be executed on base stations
using a limited amount of information exchange between them. It is based on a
novel algorithm we call Bucket-filling. The solution limits the cache-users per
node by balancing the total load among the nodes in a fair way. The improvement
compared to common user assignment policies is highlighted for single- as well
as for multi-tier random networks.

 <dc:title>Scheduling of Event-Triggered Networked Control Systems using Timed Game

 <dc:creator>Adzkiya, Dieky</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mazo Jr, Manuel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We discuss the scheduling of a set of networked control systems implemented
over a shared communication network. Each control loop is described by a
linear-time-invariant (LTI) system with an event-triggered implementation. We
assume the network can be used by at most one control loop at any time instant
and after each controller update, a pre-defined channel occupancy time elapses
before the network is available. In our framework we offer the scheduler two
options to avoid conflicts: using the event-triggering mechanism, where the
scheduler can choose the triggering coefficient; or forcing controller updates
at an earlier pre-defined time. Our objective is avoiding communication
conflict while guaranteeing stability of all control loops. We formulate the
original scheduling problem as a control synthesis problem over a network of
timed game automata (NTGA) with a safety objective. The NTGA is obtained by
taking the parallel composition of the timed game automata (TGA) associated
with the network and with all control loops. The construction of TGA associated
with control loops leverages recent results on the abstraction of timing models
of event-triggered LTI systems. In our problem, the safety objective is to
avoid that update requests from a control loop happen while the network is in
use by another task. We showcase the results in some examples.

 <dc:title>Burst Transmission Symbol Synchronization in the Presence of Cycle Slip
  Arising from Different Clock Frequencies</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In digital communication systems different clock frequencies of transmitter
and receiver usually is translated into cycle slips. Receivers might experience
different sampling frequencies from transmitter due to manufacturing
imperfection, Doppler Effect introduced by channel or wrong estimation of
symbol rate. Timing synchronization in presence of cycle slip for a burst
sequence of received information, leads to severe degradation in system
performance that represents as shortening or prolonging of bit stream. Therefor
the necessity of prior detection and elimination of cycle slip is unavoidable.
Accordingly, the main idea introduced in this paper is to employ the Gardner
Detector (GAD) not only to recover a fixed timing offset, its output is also
processed in a way such that timing drifts can be estimated and corrected.
Deriving a two steps algorithm, eliminates the cycle slips arising from wrong
estimation of symbol rate firstly, and then iteratively synchronize symbol
timing of a burst received signal by applying GAD to a feed forward structure
with the additional benefits that convergence and stability problems are
avoided, as they are typical for feedback schemes normally used by GAD. The
proposed algorithm is able to compensate considerable symbol rate offsets at
the receiver side. Considerable results in terms of BER confirm the algorithm
proficiency.

 <dc:description>  We propose an algorithm for exploring the entire regularization path of
asymmetric-cost linear support vector machines. Empirical evidence suggests the
predictive power of support vector machines depends on the regularization
parameters of the training algorithms. The algorithms exploring the entire
regularization paths have been proposed for single-cost support vector machines
thereby providing the complete knowledge on the behavior of the trained model
over the hyperparameter space. Considering the problem in two-dimensional
hyperparameter space though enables our algorithm to maintain greater
flexibility in dealing with special cases and sheds light on problems
encountered by algorithms building the paths in one-dimensional spaces. We
demonstrate two-dimensional regularization paths for linear support vector
machines that we train on synthetic and real data.

 <dc:description>  When utilities are additive, we uncovered in our previous paper (Bogomolnaia
et al. &quot;Dividing Goods or Bads under Additive Utilities&quot;) many similarities but
also surprising differences in the behavior of the familiar Competitive rule
(with equal incomes), when we divide (private) goods or bads. The rule picks in
both cases the critical points of the product of utilities (or disutilities) on
the efficiency frontier, but there is only one such point if we share goods,
while there can be exponentially many in the case of bads.
  We extend this analysis to the fair division of mixed items: each item can be
viewed by some participants as a good and by others as a bad, with
corresponding positive or negative marginal utilities. We find that the
division of mixed items boils down, normatively as well as computationally, to
a variant of an all goods problem, or of an all bads problem: in particular the
task of dividing the non disposable items must be either good news for
everyone, or bad news for everyone.
  If at least one feasible utility profile is positive, the Competitive rule
picks the unique maximum of the product of (positive) utilities. If no feasible
utility profile is positive, this rule picks all critical points of the product
of disutilities on the efficient frontier.

 <dc:description>  The first objective towards the effective use of microblogging services such
as Twitter for situational awareness during the emerging disasters is discovery
of the disaster-related postings. Given the wide range of possible disasters,
using a pre-selected set of disaster-related keywords for the discovery is
suboptimal. An alternative that we focus on in this work is to train a
classifier using a small set of labeled postings that are becoming available as
a disaster is emerging. Our hypothesis is that utilizing large quantities of
historical microblogs could improve the quality of classification, as compared
to training a classifier only on the labeled data. We propose to use unlabeled
microblogs to cluster words into a limited number of clusters and use the word
clusters as features for classification. To evaluate the proposed
semi-supervised approach, we used Twitter data from 6 different disasters. Our
results indicate that when the number of labeled tweets is 100 or less, the
proposed approach is superior to the standard classification based on the bag
or words feature representation. Our results also reveal that the choice of the
unlabeled corpus, the choice of word clustering algorithm, and the choice of
hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  A fall is an abnormal activity that occurs rarely, so it is hard to collect
real data for falls. It is, therefore, difficult to use supervised learning
methods to automatically detect falls. Another challenge in using machine
learning methods to automatically detect falls is the choice of engineered
features. In this paper, we propose to use an ensemble of autoencoders to
extract features from different channels of wearable sensor data trained only
on normal activities. We show that the traditional approach of choosing a
threshold as the maximum of the reconstruction error on the training normal
data is not the right way to identify unseen falls. We propose two methods for
automatic tightening of reconstruction error from only the normal activities
for better identification of unseen falls. We present our results on two
activity recognition datasets and show the efficacy of our proposed method
against traditional autoencoder models and two standard one-class
classification methods.

 <dc:description>  Certain applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) require the
reconstruction of functions from Fourier spectral data. When the underlying
functions are piecewise-smooth, standard Fourier approximation methods suffer
from the Gibbs phenomenon - with associated oscillatory artifacts in the
vicinity of edges and an overall reduced order of convergence in the
approximation. This paper proposes an edge-augmented Fourier reconstruction
procedure which uses only the first few Fourier coefficients of an underlying
piecewise-smooth function to accurately estimate jump information and then
incorporate it into a Fourier partial sum approximation. We provide both
theoretical and empirical results showing the improved accuracy of the proposed
method, as well as comparisons demonstrating superior performance over existing
state-of-the-art sparse optimization-based methods. Extensions of the proposed
techniques to functions of several variables are also addressed preliminarily.
All code used to generate the results in this report are made publicly

 <dc:description>  Traditionally, reconfiguration problems ask the question whether a given
solution of an optimization problem can be transformed to a target solution in
a sequence of small steps that preserve feasibility of the intermediate
solutions. In this paper, rather than asking this question from an algorithmic
perspective, we analyze the combinatorial structure behind it. We consider the
problem of reconfiguring one independent set into another, using two different
processes: (1) exchanging exactly $k$ vertices in each step, or (2) removing or
adding one vertex in each step while ensuring the intermediate sets contain at
most $k$ fewer vertices than the initial solution. We are interested in
determining the minimum value of $k$ for which this reconfiguration is
possible, and bound these threshold values in terms of several structural graph
parameters. For hereditary graph classes we identify structures that cause the
reconfiguration threshold to be large.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce the task of targeted aspect-based sentiment
analysis. The goal is to extract fine-grained information with respect to
entities mentioned in user comments. This work extends both aspect-based
sentiment analysis that assumes a single entity per document and targeted
sentiment analysis that assumes a single sentiment towards a target entity. In
particular, we identify the sentiment towards each aspect of one or more
entities. As a testbed for this task, we introduce the SentiHood dataset,
extracted from a question answering (QA) platform where urban neighbourhoods

aspects of one or more neighbourhoods. This is the first time that a generic
social media platform in this case a QA platform, is used for fine-grained
opinion mining. Text coming from QA platforms is far less constrained compared
to text from review specific platforms which current datasets are based on. We
develop several strong baselines, relying on logistic regression and

 <dc:description>  Objective of this work is to integrate high performance computing (HPC)
technologies and bioacoustics data-mining capabilities by offering a
MATLAB-based toolbox called Raven-X. Raven-X will provide a
hardware-independent solution, for processing large acoustic datasets - the
toolkit will be available to the community at no cost. This goal will be
achieved by leveraging prior work done which successfully deployed MATLAB based
HPC tools within Cornell University's Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP).
These tools enabled commonly available multi-core computers to process data at
accelerated rates to detect and classify whale sounds in large multi-channel
sound archives. Through this collaboration, we will expand on this effort which
was featured through Mathworks research and industry forums incorporate new
cutting-edge detectors and classifiers, and disseminate Raven-X to the broader
bioacoustics community.

 <dc:description>  This work characterizes the benefits of averaging techniques widely used in
conjunction with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, this work
sharply analyzes: (1) mini-batching, a method of averaging many samples of the
gradient to both reduce the variance of a stochastic gradient estimate and for
parallelizing SGD and (2) tail-averaging, a method involving averaging the
final few iterates of SGD in order to decrease the variance in SGD's final
iterate. This work presents the first tight non-asymptotic generalization error
bounds for these schemes for the stochastic approximation problem of least
squares regression.
  Furthermore, this work establishes a precise problem-dependent extent to
which mini-batching can be used to yield provable near-linear parallelization
speedups over SGD with batch size one. These results are utilized in providing
a highly parallelizable SGD algorithm that obtains the optimal statistical
error rate with nearly the same number of serial updates as batch gradient
descent, which improves significantly over existing SGD-style methods.
  Finally, this work sheds light on some fundamental differences in SGD's
behavior when dealing with agnostic noise in the (non-realizable) least squares
regression problem. In particular, the work shows that the stepsizes that
ensure optimal statistical error rates for the agnostic case must be a function
of the noise properties.
  The central analysis tools used by this paper are obtained through
generalizing the operator view of averaged SGD, introduced by Defossez and Bach
(2015) followed by developing a novel analysis in bounding these operators to
characterize the generalization error. These techniques may be of broader
interest in analyzing various computational aspects of stochastic
approximation.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a convolutional neural network for inferring a compact
disentangled graphical description of objects from 2D images that can be used
for volumetric reconstruction. The network comprises an encoder and a
twin-tailed decoder. The encoder generates a disentangled graphics code. The
first decoder generates a volume, and the second decoder reconstructs the input
image using a novel training regime that allows the graphics code to learn a
separate representation of the 3D object and a description of its lighting and
pose conditions. We demonstrate this method by generating volumes and
disentangled graphical descriptions from images and videos of faces and chairs.

 <dc:description>  Many compelling video post-processing effects, in particular aesthetic focus
editing and refocusing effects, are feasible if per-frame depth information is
available. Existing computational methods to capture RGB and depth either
purposefully modify the optics (coded aperture, light-field imaging), or employ
active RGB-D cameras. Since these methods are less practical for users with
normal cameras, we present an algorithm to capture all-in-focus RGB-D video of
dynamic scenes with an unmodified commodity video camera. Our algorithm turns
the often unwanted defocus blur into a valuable signal. The input to our method
is a video in which the focus plane is continuously moving back and forth
during capture, and thus defocus blur is provoked and strongly visible. This
can be achieved by manually turning the focus ring of the lens during
recording. The core algorithmic ingredient is a new video-based
depth-from-defocus algorithm that computes space-time-coherent depth maps,
deblurred all-in-focus video, and the focus distance for each frame. We
extensively evaluate our approach, and show that it enables compelling video
post-processing effects, such as different types of refocusing.

 <dc:title>Computing the Expected Value and Variance of Geometric Measures</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Staals, Frank</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let P be a set of points in R^d, and let M be a function that maps any subset
of P to a positive real number. We examine the problem of computing the exact
mean and variance of M when a subset of points in P is selected according to a
well-defined random distribution. We consider two distributions; in the first
distribution (which we call the Bernoulli distribution), each point p in P is
included in the random subset independently, with probability pi(p). In the
second distribution (the fixed-size distribution), a subset of exactly s points
is selected uniformly at random among all possible subsets of s points in P.
  This problem is a crucial part of modern ecological analyses; each point in P
represents a species in d-dimensional trait space, and the goal is to compute
the statistics of a geometric measure on this trait space, when subsets of
species are selected under random processes.
  We present efficient exact algorithms for computing the mean and variance of
several geometric measures when point sets are selected under one of the
described random distributions. More specifically, we provide algorithms for
the following measures: the bounding box volume, the convex hull volume, the
mean pairwise distance (MPD), the squared Euclidean distance from the centroid,
and the diameter of the minimum enclosing disk. We also describe an efficient
(1-e)-approximation algorithm for computing the mean and variance of the mean
pairwise distance. We implemented three of our algorithms and we show that our
implementations can provide major speedups compared to the existing imprecise
approaches.

 <dc:description>  Decentralized coded caching is studied for a content server with $N$ files,
each of size $F$ bits, serving $K$ active users, each equipped with a cache of
distinct capacity. It is assumed that the users' caches are filled in advance
during the off-peak traffic period without the knowledge of the number of
active users, their identities, or the particular demands. User demands are
revealed during the peak traffic period, and are served simultaneously through
an error-free shared link. A new decentralized coded caching scheme is proposed
for this scenario, and it is shown to improve upon the state-of-the-art in
terms of the required delivery rate over the shared link, when there are more
users in the system than the number of files. Numerical results indicate that
the improvement becomes more significant as the cache capacities of the users
become more skewed.

that it includes a variety of aspects that we found to be vital in industrial
applications. It is not designed to be an approximation of any real system, but
to pose the same hardness and complexity.

 <dc:description>  We present the first constructions of single-prover proof systems that
achieve perfect zero knowledge (PZK) for languages beyond NP, under no
intractability assumptions:
  1. The complexity class #P has PZK proofs in the model of Interactive PCPs
(IPCPs) [KR08], where the verifier first receives from the prover a PCP and
then engages with the prover in an Interactive Proof (IP).
  2. The complexity class NEXP has PZK proofs in the model of Interactive
Oracle Proofs (IOPs) [BCS16,RRR16], where the verifier, in every round of
interaction, receives a PCP from the prover.
  Our constructions rely on succinct simulators that enable us to &quot;simulate
beyond NP&quot;, achieving exponential savings in efficiency over [BCGV16]. These
simulators crucially rely on solving a problem that lies at the intersection of
coding theory, linear algebra, and computational complexity, which we call the
succinct constraint detection problem, and consists of detecting dual
constraints with polynomial support size for codes of exponential block length.
Our two results rely on solutions to this problem for fundamental classes of
linear codes:
  * An algorithm to detect constraints for Reed--Muller codes of exponential
length.
  * An algorithm to detect constraints for PCPs of Proximity of Reed--Solomon
codes [BS08] of exponential degree.
  The first algorithm exploits the Raz--Shpilka [RS05] deterministic polynomial
identity testing algorithm, and shows, to our knowledge, a first connection of
algebraic complexity theory with zero knowledge. Along the way, we give a
perfect zero knowledge analogue of the celebrated sumcheck protocol [LFKN92],
by leveraging both succinct constraint detection and low-degree testing. The
second algorithm exploits the recursive structure of the PCPs of Proximity to
show that small-support constraints are &quot;locally&quot; spanned by a small number of
small-support constraints.

 <dc:description>  Modern processing networks often consist of heterogeneous servers with widely
varying capabilities, and process job flows with complex structure and
requirements. A major challenge in designing efficient scheduling policies in
these networks is the lack of reliable estimates of system parameters, and an
attractive approach for addressing this challenge is to design robust policies,
i.e., policies that do not use system parameters such as arrival and/or service
rates for making scheduling decisions. In this paper, we propose a general
framework for the design of robust policies. The main technical novelty is the
use of a stochastic gradient projection method that reacts to queue-length
changes in order to find a balanced allocation of service resources to incoming
tasks. We illustrate our approach on two broad classes of processing systems,
namely the flexible fork-join networks and the flexible queueing networks, and
prove the rate stability of our proposed policies for these networks under
non-restrictive assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Question generation from a knowledge base (KB) is the task of generating
questions related to the domain of the input KB. We propose a system for
generating fluent and natural questions from a KB, which significantly reduces
the human effort by leveraging massive web resources. In more detail, a seed
question set is first generated by applying a small number of hand-crafted
templates on the input KB, then more questions are retrieved by iteratively
forming already obtained questions as search queries into a standard search
engine, before finally questions are selected by estimating their fluency and
domain relevance. Evaluated by human graders on 500 random-selected triples
from Freebase, questions generated by our system are judged to be more fluent
than those of \newcite{serban-EtAl:2016:P16-1} by human graders.

 <dc:description>  We present a continuous model for structural brain connectivity based on the
Poisson point process. The model treats each streamline curve in a tractography
as an observed event in connectome space, here a product space of cortical
white matter boundaries. We approximate the model parameter via kernel density
estimation. To deal with the heavy computational burden, we develop a fast
parameter estimation method by pre-computing associated Legendre products of
the data, leveraging properties of the spherical heat kernel. We show how our
approach can be used to assess the quality of cortical parcellations with
respect to connectivty. We further present empirical results that suggest the
discrete connectomes derived from our model have substantially higher
test-retest reliability compared to standard methods.

 <dc:title>Finding Small Hitting Sets in Infinite Range Spaces of Bounded
  VC-dimension</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Elbassioni, Khaled</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of finding a small hitting set in an {\it infinite}
range space $\cF=(Q,\cR)$ of bounded VC-dimension. We show that, under
reasonably general assumptions, the infinite dimensional convex relaxation can
be solved (approximately) efficiently by multiplicative weight updates. As a
consequence, we get an algorithm that finds, for any $\delta&gt;0$, a set of size
$O(s_{\cF}(z^*_\cF))$ that hits $(1-\delta)$-fraction of $\cR$ (with respect to
a given measure) in time proportional to $\log(\frac{1}{\delta})$, where
$s_{\cF}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ is the size of the smallest $\epsilon$-net the
range space admits, and $z^*_{\cF}$ is the value of the {\it fractional}
optimal solution. This {\it exponentially} improves upon previous results which
achieve the same approximation guarantees with running time proportional to
$\poly(\frac{1}{\delta})$. Our assumptions hold, for instance, in the case when
the range space represents the {\it visibility} regions of a polygon in
$\RR^2$, giving thus a deterministic polynomial time $O(\log
z^*_{\cF})$-approximation algorithm for guarding $(1-\delta)$-fraction of the
area of any given simple polygon, with running time proportional to
$\polylog(\frac{1}{\delta})$.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a recursive diffeomorphism based regression method for
one-dimensional generalized mode decomposition problem that aims at extracting
generalized modes $\alpha_k(t)s_k(2\pi N_k\phi_k(t))$ from their superposition
$\sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_k(t)s_k(2\pi N_k\phi_k(t))$. First, a one-dimensional
synchrosqueezed transform is applied to estimate instantaneous information,
e.g., $\alpha_k(t)$ and $N_k\phi_k(t)$. Second, a novel approach based on
diffeomorphisms and nonparametric regression is proposed to estimate wave shape
functions $s_k(t)$. These two methods lead to a framework for the generalized
mode decomposition problem under a weak well-separation condition. Numerical
examples of synthetic and real data are provided to demonstrate the fruitful
applications of these methods.

 <dc:description>  Vehicular WiFi is different from conventional WiFi access. Firstly, as the
connections arise opportunistically, they are short lived and intermittent.
Secondly, at vehicular speeds channel conditions change rapidly. Under these
conditions, the MAC bit rate adaptation plays a critical role to ensure that
devices can maximize throughput performance. The goal of this work is to gain a
deeper understanding of current MAC bit rate adaptation algorithms and their
interaction with higher layer protocols under vehicular settings. Towards this
end, we evaluate the performance of four MAC bit rate adaptation algorithms;
SampleRate, AMRR, Minstrel, and RRAA, and their interactions with transport
layer protocols such as TCP in real world vehicular settings. Our experimental
study reveals that in general these algorithm perform poorly in vehicular
settings, and can have an extremely adverse impact on TCP performance.

 <dc:description>  In the traditional setup of public goods game all players are involved in
every available groups and the mutual benefit is shared among competing
cooperator and defector strategies. But in real life situations the group
formation of players could be more sophisticated because not all players are
attractive enough for others to participate in a joint venture. What if only
those players can initiate a group formation and establish a game who are
successful enough to the neighbors? To elaborate this idea we employ a modified
protocol and demonstrate that a carefully chosen threshold to establish joint
venture could efficiently improve the cooperation level even if the synergy
factor would suggest a full defector state otherwise. The microscopic mechanism
which is responsible for this effect is based on the asymmetric consequences of
competing strategies: while the success of a cooperator provides a long-time
well-being for the neighborhood, the temporary advantage of defection cannot be
maintained if the protocol is based on the success of leaders.

 <dc:description>  The temperature developed in bondwires of integrated circuits (ICs) is a
possible source of malfunction, and has to be taken into account during the
design phase of an IC. Due to manufacturing tolerances, a bondwire's
geometrical characteristics are uncertain parameters, and as such their impact
has to be examined with the use of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods.
Sampling methods, like the Monte Carlo (MC), converge slowly, while efficient
alternatives scale badly with respect to the number of considered
uncertainties. Possible remedies to this, so-called, curse of dimensionality
are sought in the application of stochastic collocation (SC) on sparse grids
(SGs) and of the recently emerged low-rank tensor decomposition methods, with
emphasis on the tensor train (TT) decomposition.

 <dc:description>  For the Lucas sequence $\{U_{k}(P,Q)\}$ we discuss the identities such as the
well-known Fibonacci identities. For example, the generalizations of
$F_{2k}=F_{k+1}^2-F_{k-1}^2$ and $F_{2k+1}=F_{k+1}^2+F_{k}^2$ are $P
U_{2k}=U_{k+1}^2- Q^2 U_{k-1}^2$ and $U_{2k+1}=U_{k+1}^2-Q U_{k}^2$,
respectively. We propose a new simple method for obtaining identities involving
any recurrences and we use it to obtain new identities involving the Fibonacci
numbers such as
$F_{k+3}^5-F_{k-3}^5+60F_{k}^5=8(F_{k+2}^5+F_{k-2}^5)+40(F_{k+1}^5-F_{k-1}^5)$.

 <dc:description>  Various spectrum sensing approaches have been shown to suffer from a
so-called SNR-wall, an SNR value below which a detector cannot perform robustly
no matter how many observations are used. Up to now, the eigenvalue-based
maximum-minimum-eigenvalue (MME) detector has been a notable exception. For
instance, the model uncertainty of imperfect knowledge of the receiver noise
power, which is known to be responsible for the energy detector's fundamental
limits, does not adversely affect the MME detector's performance. While
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is a standard assumption in wireless
communications, it is not a reasonable one for the MME detector. In fact, in
this work we prove that uncertainty in the amount of noise coloring does lead
to an SNR-wall for the MME detector. We derive a lower bound on this SNR-wall
and evaluate it for example scenarios. The findings are supported by numerical
simulations.

 <dc:title>Super-fast MST Algorithms in the Congested Clique using $o(m)$ Messages</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pemmaraju, Sriram V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sardeshmukh, Vivek B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a sequence of recent results (PODC 2015 and PODC 2016), the running time
of the fastest algorithm for the \emph{minimum spanning tree (MST)} problem in
the \emph{Congested Clique} model was first improved to $O(\log \log \log n)$
from $O(\log \log n)$ (Hegeman et al., PODC 2015) and then to $O(\log^* n)$
(Ghaffari and Parter, PODC 2016). All of these algorithms use $\Theta(n^2)$
messages independent of the number of edges in the input graph.
  This paper positively answers a question raised in Hegeman et al., and
presents the first &quot;super-fast&quot; MST algorithm with $o(m)$ message complexity
for input graphs with $m$ edges. Specifically, we present an algorithm running
in $O(\log^* n)$ rounds, with message complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m \cdot n})$
and then build on this algorithm to derive a family of algorithms, containing
for any $\varepsilon$, $0 &lt; \varepsilon \le 1$, an algorithm running in
$O(\log^* n/\varepsilon)$ rounds, using $\tilde{O}(n^{1 +
\varepsilon}/\varepsilon)$ messages. Setting $\varepsilon = \log\log n/\log n$
leads to the first sub-logarithmic round Congested Clique MST algorithm that
uses only $\tilde{O}(n)$ messages.
  Our primary tools in achieving these results are (i) a component-wise bound
on the number of candidates for MST edges, extending the sampling lemma of
Karger, Klein, and Tarjan (Karger, Klein, and Tarjan, JACM 1995) and (ii)
$\Theta(\log n)$-wise-independent linear graph sketches (Cormode and Firmani,
Dist.~Par.~Databases, 2014) for generating MST candidate edges.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been recently shown to
attain state-of-the-art performance for action recognition on
standard-resolution videos. However, less attention has been paid to
recognition performance at extremely low resolutions (eLR) (e.g., 16 x 12
pixels). Reliable action recognition using eLR cameras would address privacy
concerns in various application environments such as private homes, hospitals,
nursing/rehabilitation facilities, etc. In this paper, we propose a
semi-coupled filter-sharing network that leverages high resolution (HR) videos
during training in order to assist an eLR ConvNet. We also study methods for
fusing spatial and temporal ConvNets customized for eLR videos in order to take
advantage of appearance and motion information. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods at extremely low resolutions on IXMAS (93.7%) and HMDB
(29.2%) datasets.

 <dc:description>  Similarity learning has received a large amount of interest and is an
important tool for many scientific and industrial applications. In this
framework, we wish to infer the distance (similarity) between points with
respect to an arbitrary distance function $d$. Here, we formulate the problem
as a regression from a feature space $\mathcal{X}$ to an arbitrary vector space
$\mathcal{Y}$, where the Euclidean distance is proportional to $d$. We then
give Rademacher complexity bounds on the generalization error. We find that
with high probability, the complexity is bounded by the maximum of the radius
of $\mathcal{X}$ and the radius of $\mathcal{Y}$.

 <dc:description>  We conjecture that bounded generalised polynomial functions cannot be
generated by finite automata, except for the trivial case when they are
periodic away from a finite set. Using methods from ergodic theory, we are able
to partially resolve this conjecture, proving that any hypothetical
counterexample is periodic away from a very sparse and structured set. In
particular, we show that for a polynomial $p(n)$ with at least one irrational
coefficient (except for the constant one) and integer $m$, the sequence
$\lfloor p(n) \rfloor \bmod{m}$ is never automatic. We also obtain a
conditional result, where we prove the conjecture under the assumption that the
characteristic sequence of the set of powers of an integer $k\geq 2$ is not
given by a generalised polynomial.

 <dc:description>  Friendship is a fundamental characteristic of human beings and usually
assumed to be reciprocal in nature. Despite this common expectation, in
reality, not all friendships by default are reciprocal nor created equal. Here,
we show that reciprocated friendships are more intimate and they are
substantially different from those that are not. We examine the role of
reciprocal ties in inducing more effective peer pressure in a cooperative
arrangements setting and find that the directionality of friendship ties can
significantly limit the ability to persuade others to act. Specifically, we
observe a higher behavioral change and more effective peer-influence when
subjects shared reciprocal ties with their peers compared to sharing unilateral
ones. Moreover, through spreading process simulation, we find that although
unilateral ties diffuse behaviors across communities, reciprocal ties play more

 <dc:description>  Straintronic magneto-tunneling junction (s-MTJ) switches, whose resistances
are controlled with voltage-generated strain in the magnetostrictive free layer
of the MTJ, are extremely energy-efficient switches that would dissipate a few
aJ of energy during switching. Unfortunately, they are also relatively
error-prone and have low resistance on/off ratio. This suggests that as
computing elements, they are best suited for non-Boolean architectures. Here,
we propose and analyze a ternary content addressable memory implemented with
s-MTJs and some transistors. It overcomes challenges encountered by traditional
all-transistor implementations, resulting in exceptionally high cell density.

 <dc:description>  Moving target defense (MTD) techniques that enable a system to randomize its
configuration to thwart prospective attacks are an effective security solution
for tomorrow's wireless networks. However, there is a lack of analytical
techniques that enable one to quantify the benefits and tradeoffs of MTDs. In
this paper, a novel approach for implementing MTD techniques that can be used
to randomize cryptographic techniques and keys in wireless networks is
proposed. In particular, the problem is formulated as a stochastic game in
which a base station (BS), acting as a defender seeks to strategically change
its cryptographic techniques and keys in an effort to deter an attacker that is
trying to eavesdrop on the data. The game is shown to exhibit a
single-controller property in which only one player, the defender, controls the
state of the game. For this game, the existence and properties of the Nash
equilibrium are studied, in the presence of a defense cost for using MTD. Then,
a practical algorithm for deriving the equilibrium MTD strategies is derived.
Simulation results show that the proposed game-theoretic MTD framework can
significantly improve the overall utility of the defender, while enabling
effective randomization over cryptographic techniques.

 <dc:description>  Several research groups have shown how to correlate fMRI responses to the
meanings of presented stimuli. This paper presents new methods for doing so
when only a natural language annotation is available as the description of the
stimulus. We study fMRI data gathered from subjects watching an episode of BBCs
Sherlock [1], and learn bidirectional mappings between fMRI responses and
natural language representations. We show how to leverage data from multiple
subjects watching the same movie to improve the accuracy of the mappings,
allowing us to succeed at a scene classification task with 72% accuracy (random
guessing would give 4%) and at a scene ranking task with average rank in the
top 4% (random guessing would give 50%). The key ingredients are (a) the use of
the Shared Response Model (SRM) and its variant SRM-ICA [2, 3] to aggregate
fMRI data from multiple subjects, both of which are shown to be superior to
standard PCA in producing low-dimensional representations for the tasks in this
paper; (b) a sentence embedding technique adapted from the natural language
processing (NLP) literature [4] that produces semantic vector representation of
the annotations; (c) using previous timestep information in the featurization
of the predictor data.

 <dc:description>  As the number and variety of smart devices increase, users may use myriad
devices in their daily lives and the online activities become highly
fragmented. Building an accurate user identity becomes a difficult and
important problem for advertising companies. The task for the CIKM Cup 2016
Track 1 was to find the same user cross multiple devices. This paper discusses
our solution to the challenge. It is mainly comprised of three parts:
comprehensive feature engineering, negative sampling, and model selection. For
each part we describe our special steps and demonstrate how the performance is
boosted. We took the second prize of the competition with an F1-score of
0.41669.

 <dc:description>  We present some generalizations of quantum information inequalities involving
tracial positive linear maps between $C^*$-algebras. Among several results, we
establish a noncommutative Heisenberg uncertainty relation. More precisely, we
show that if $\Phi: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ is a tracial positive linear
map between $C^*$-algebras , $\rho \in \mathcal{A}$ is a $\Phi$-density element
and $A,B$ are self-adjoint operators of $\mathcal{A}$ such that $ {\rm
sp}(\mbox{-i}\rho^\frac{1}{2}[A,B]\rho^\frac{1}{2}) \subseteq [m,M] $ for some
scalers $0&lt;m&lt;M$, then under some conditions \begin{eqnarray}\label{inemain1}
V_{\rho,\Phi}(A)\sharp V_{\rho,\Phi}(B)\geq
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{K_{m,M}(\rho[A,B])}} \left|\Phi(\rho [A,B])\right|,
\end{eqnarray} where $K_{m,M}(\rho[A,B])$ is the Kantorovich constant of the
operator $\mbox{-i}\rho^\frac{1}{2}[A,B]\rho^\frac{1}{2}$ and
$V_{\rho,\Phi}(X)$ is the generalized variance of $X$.\\ In addition, we use
some arguments differing from the scalar theory to present some inequalities
related to the generalized correlation and the generalized
Wigner--Yanase--Dyson skew information.

 <dc:title>The Curvature-Augmented Closest Point Method with Vesicle
  Inextensibility Application</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vogl, Christopher J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Closest Point method, initially developed by Ruuth and Merriman, allows
for the numerical solution of surface partial differential equations without
the need for a parameterization of the surface itself. Surface quantities are
embedded into the surrounding domain by assigning each value at a given spatial
location to the corresponding value at the closest point on the surface. This
embedding allows for surface derivatives to be replaced by their Cartesian
counterparts (e.g. $\nabla_s = \nabla$). This equivalence is only valid on the
surface, and thus, interpolation is used to enforce what is known as the side
condition away from the surface. To improve upon the method, this work derives
an operator embedding that incorporates curvature information, making it valid
in a neighborhood of the surface. With this, direct enforcement of the side
condition is no longer needed. Comparisons in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$
show that the resulting Curvature-Augmented Closest Point method has better
accuracy and requires less memory, through increased matrix sparsity, than the
Closest Point method, while maintaining similar matrix condition numbers. To
demonstrate the utility of the method in a physical application, simulations of
inextensible, bi-lipid vesicles evolving toward equilibrium shapes are also
included.

 <dc:description>  Speech Translation has always been about giving source text or audio input
and waiting for system to give translated output in desired form. In this
paper, we present the Acoustic Dialect Decoder (ADD) - a voice to voice
ear-piece translation device. We introduce and survey the recent advances made
in the field of Speech Engineering, to employ in the ADD, particularly focusing
on the three major processing steps of Recognition, Translation and Synthesis.
We tackle the problem of machine understanding of natural language by designing
a recognition unit for source audio to text, a translation unit for source
language text to target language text, and a synthesis unit for target language
text to target language speech. Speech from the surroundings will be recorded
by the recognition unit present on the ear-piece and translation will start as
soon as one sentence is successfully read. This way, we hope to give translated
output as and when input is being read. The recognition unit will use Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs) Based Tool-Kit (HTK), hybrid RNN systems with gated memory
cells, and the synthesis unit, HMM based speech synthesis system HTS. This
system will initially be built as an English to Tamil translation device.

 <dc:title>Optimizing Epistemic Model Checking using Conditional Independence</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>van der Meyden, Ron</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Conditional independence reasoning has been shown to be helpful in the
context of Bayesian nets to optimize probabilistic inference, and related
techniques have been applied to speed up a number of logical reasoning tasks in
boolean logic by eliminating irrelevant parts of the formulas. This paper shows
that conditional independence reasoning can also be applied to optimize
epistemic model checking, in which one verifies that a model for a number of
agents operating with imperfect information satisfies a formula expressed in a
modal multi-agent logic of knowledge. An optimization technique is developed
that precedes the use of a model checking algorithm with an analysis that
applies conditional independence reasoning to reduce the size of the model. The
optimization has been implemented in the epistemic model checker MCK. The paper
reports experimental results demonstrating that it can yield multiple orders of
magnitude performance improvements.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a probabilistic framework that represents stylized banking
networks with the aim of predicting the size of contagion events. Most previous
work on random financial networks assumes independent connections between
banks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge
probabilities (e.g., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). We
analyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the
cascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge
probabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition
that characterizes whether or not an infinitesimal shock to the network can
grow to a finite size cascade, in analogy to the basic reproduction number
$R_0$ in epidemic modelling. The cascade condition provides an easily computed
measure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology.
Using the percolation theory for random networks we also derive an analytic
formula for the frequency of global cascades. Although the analytical methods
are derived for infinite networks, we demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations
the applicability of the results to finite-sized networks. We show that
edge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can
have a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade
condition. However, the effect of assortativity on systemic risk is subtle, and
we propose a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call the
graph-assortativity coefficient, that can be used to assess systemic risk.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a neural-network based model for coordination boundary prediction.
The network is designed to incorporate two signals: the similarity between
conjuncts and the observation that replacing the whole coordination phrase with
a conjunct tends to produce a coherent sentences. The modeling makes use of
several LSTM networks. The model is trained solely on conjunction annotations
in a Treebank, without using external resources. We show improvements on
predicting coordination boundaries on the PTB compared to two state-of-the-art
parsers; as well as improvement over previous coordination boundary prediction
systems on the Genia corpus.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks are among the state-of-the-art techniques for language
modeling. Existing neural language models typically map discrete words to
distributed, dense vector representations. After information processing of the
preceding context words by hidden layers, an output layer estimates the
probability of the next word. Such approaches are time- and memory-intensive
because of the large numbers of parameters for word embeddings and the output
layer. In this paper, we propose to compress neural language models by sparse
word representations. In the experiments, the number of parameters in our model
increases very slowly with the growth of the vocabulary size, which is almost
imperceptible. Moreover, our approach not only reduces the parameter space to a
large extent, but also improves the performance in terms of the perplexity
measure.

 <dc:description>  In human-computer conversation systems, the context of a user-issued
utterance is particularly important because it provides useful background
information of the conversation. However, it is unwise to track all previous
utterances in the current session as not all of them are equally important. In
this paper, we address the problem of session segmentation. We propose an
embedding-enhanced TextTiling approach, inspired by the observation that
conversation utterances are highly noisy, and that word embeddings provide a
robust way of capturing semantics. Experimental results show that our approach
achieves better performance than the TextTiling, MMD approaches.

 <dc:description>  A college student's life can be primarily categorized into domains such as
education, health, social and other activities which may include daily chores
and travelling time. Time management is crucial for every student. A self
realisation of one's daily time expenditure in various domains is therefore
essential to maximize one's effective output. This paper presents how a mobile
application using Fuzzy Logic and Global Positioning System (GPS) analyzes a
student's lifestyle and provides recommendations and suggestions based on the
results.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the question of consistency of multi-view models in UML and OCL. We
first critically survey the large amount of literature that already exists. We
find that only limited subsets of the UML/OCL have been covered so far and that
consistency checks mostly only cover structural aspects, whereas only few
methods also address behaviour. We also give a classification of different
techniques for multi-view UML/OCL consistency: consistency rules, the system
model approach, dynamic meta-modelling, universal logic, and heterogeneous
transformation. Finally, we elaborate cornerstones of a comprehensive
distributed semantics approach to consistency using OMG's Distributed Ontology,
Model and Specification Language (DOL).

 <dc:description>  A graph is well-covered if all its maximal independent sets are of the same
size (M. D. Plummer, 1970). A well-covered graph is 1-well-covered if the
deletion of every vertex leaves a graph which is well-covered as well (J. W.
Staples, 1975). A graph G belongs to class W_{n} if every n pairwise disjoint
independent sets in G are included in $n$ pairwise disjoint maximum independent
sets (J. W. Staples, 1975). Clearly, W_{1} is the family of all well-covered
graphs. It turns out that G belongs to W_{2} if and only if it is a
1-well-covered graph without isolated vertices. We show that deleting a
shedding vertex does not change the maximum size of a maximal independent set
including a given independent set A in a graph G. Specifically, for
well-covered graphs, it means that the vertex v is shedding if and only if G-v
is well-covered. In addition, we provide new characterizations of
1-well-covered graphs, which we further use in building 1-well-covered graphs
by corona, join, and concatenation operations.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a dictionary update method for Nonnegative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) with high dimensional data in a spectral conversion (SC)
task. Voice conversion has been widely studied due to its potential
applications such as personalized speech synthesis and speech enhancement.
Exemplar-based NMF (ENMF) emerges as an effective and probably the simplest
choice among all techniques for SC, as long as a source-target parallel speech
corpus is given. ENMF-based SC systems usually need a large amount of bases
(exemplars) to ensure the quality of the converted speech. However, a small and
effective dictionary is desirable but hard to obtain via dictionary update, in
particular when high-dimensional features such as STRAIGHT spectra are used.
Therefore, we propose a dictionary update framework for NMF by means of an
encoder-decoder reformulation. Regarding NMF as an encoder-decoder network
makes it possible to exploit the whole parallel corpus more effectively and
efficiently when applied to SC. Our experiments demonstrate significant gains
of the proposed system with small dictionaries over conventional ENMF-based
systems with dictionaries of same or much larger size.

 <dc:title>Fourier-Motzkin Elimination Software for Information Theoretic

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We provide open-source software implemented in MATLAB, that performs
Fourier-Motzkin elimination (FME) and removes constraints that are redundant
due to Shannon-type inequalities (STIs). The FME is often used in information
theoretic contexts to simplify rate regions, e.g., by eliminating auxiliary
rates. Occasionally, however, the procedure becomes cumbersome, which makes an
error-free hand-written derivation an elusive task. Some computer software have
circumvented this difficulty by exploiting an automated FME process. However,
the outputs of such software often include constraints that are inactive due to
information theoretic properties. By incorporating the notion of STIs (a class
of information inequalities provable via a computer program), our algorithm
removes such redundant constraints based on non-negativity properties,
chain-rules and probability mass function factorization. This newsletter first
illustrates the program's abilities, and then reviews the contribution of STIs
to the identification of redundant constraints.

 <dc:title>Semi-Supervised Active Learning for Support Vector Machines: A Novel

 <dc:description>  In our today's information society more and more data emerges, e.g.~in social
networks, technical applications, or business applications. Companies try to
commercialize these data using data mining or machine learning methods. For
this purpose, the data are categorized or classified, but often at high
(monetary or temporal) costs. An effective approach to reduce these costs is to
apply any kind of active learning (AL) methods, as AL controls the training
process of a classifier by specific querying individual data points (samples),
which are then labeled (e.g., provided with class memberships) by a domain
expert. However, an analysis of current AL research shows that AL still has
some shortcomings. In particular, the structure information given by the
spatial pattern of the (un)labeled data in the input space of a classification
model (e.g.,~cluster information), is used in an insufficient way. In addition,
many existing AL techniques pay too little attention to their practical
applicability. To meet these challenges, this article presents several
techniques that together build a new approach for combining AL and
semi-supervised learning (SSL) for support vector machines (SVM) in
classification tasks. Structure information is captured by means of
probabilistic models that are iteratively improved at runtime when label
information becomes available. The probabilistic models are considered in a
selection strategy based on distance, density, diversity, and distribution (4DS
strategy) information for AL and in a kernel function (Responsibility Weighted
Mahalanobis kernel) for SVM. The approach fuses generative and discriminative
modeling techniques. With 20 benchmark data sets and with the MNIST data set it
is shown that our new solution yields significantly better results than
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We present a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph of odd-girth
$2k+1$ to bound the class of $K_4$-minor-free graphs of odd-girth (at least)
$2k+1$, that is, to admit a homomorphism from any such $K_4$-minor-free graph.
This yields a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize such bounds. Using this
condition, we first prove that every $K_4$-minor free graph of odd-girth $2k+1$
admits a homomorphism to the projective hypercube of dimension $2k$. This
supports a conjecture of the third author which generalizes the four-color
theorem and relates to several outstanding conjectures such as Seymour's
conjecture on edge-colorings of planar graphs. Strengthening this result, we
show that the Kneser graph $K(2k+1,k)$ satisfies the conditions, thus implying
that every $K_4$-minor free graph of odd-girth $2k+1$ has fractional chromatic
number exactly $2+\frac{1}{k}$. Knowing that a smallest bound of odd-girth
$2k+1$ must have at least ${k+2 \choose 2}$ vertices, we build nearly optimal
bounds of order $4k^2$. Furthermore, we conjecture that the suprema of the
fractional and circular chromatic numbers for $K_4$-minor-free graphs of
odd-girth $2k+1$ are achieved by a same bound of odd-girth $2k+1$. If true,
this improves, in the homomorphism order, earlier tight results on the circular
chromatic number of $K_4$-minor-free graphs. We support our conjecture by
proving it for the first few cases. Finally, as an application of our work, and
after noting that Seymour provided a formula for calculating the edge-chromatic
number of $K_4$-minor-free multigraphs, we show that stronger results can be
obtained in the case of $K_4$-minor-free regular multigraphs.

 <dc:description>  Social media platforms are now a key source of information for a large
segment of the public. As such, these platforms have a great potential as a
means to provide real-time information to emergency management agencies.
Moreover, during an emergency, these agencies are very interested in social
media as a means to find public-driven response efforts, as well as to track
how their handling of that emergency is being perceived. However, there is
currently a lack advanced tools designed for monitoring social media during
emergencies. The Emergency Analysis Identification and Management System
(EAIMS) is a prototype service that aims to fill this technology gap by
providing richer analytic and exploration tools than current solutions. In
particular, EAIMS provides real-time detection of emergency events, related
information finding, information access and credibility analysis tools for use
over social media during emergencies.

 <dc:description>  Content-Centric Networking (CCN) research addresses the mismatch between the
modern usage of the Internet and its outdated architecture. Importantly, CCN
routers may locally cache frequently requested content in order to speed up
delivery to end users. Thus, the issue of caching strategies arises, i.e.,
which content shall be stored and when it should be replaced. In this work, we
employ novel techniques towards intelligent administration of CCN routers that
autonomously switch between existing strategies in response to changing content
request patterns. In particular, we present a router architecture for CCN
networks that is controlled by rule-based stream reasoning, following the
recent formal framework LARS which extends Answer Set Programming for streams.
The obtained possibility for flexible router configuration at runtime allows
for faster experimentation and may thus help to advance the further development
of CCN. Moreover, the empirical evaluation of our feasibility study shows that
the resulting caching agent may give significant performance gains.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the problem of maintaining the strongly connected
components of a graph in the presence of failures. In particular, we show that
given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$, and an integer value
$k\geq 1$, there is an algorithm that computes in $O(2^{k}n\log^2 n)$ time for
any set $F$ of size at most $k$ the strongly connected components of the graph
$G\setminus F$. The running time of our algorithm is almost optimal since the
time for outputting the SCCs of $G\setminus F$ is at least $\Omega(n)$. The
algorithm uses a data structure that is computed in a preprocessing phase in
polynomial time and is of size $O(2^{k} n^2)$.
  Our result is obtained using a new observation on the relation between
strongly connected components (SCCs) and reachability. More specifically, one
of the main building blocks in our result is a restricted variant of the
problem in which we only compute strongly connected components that intersect a
certain path. Restricting our attention to a path allows us to implicitly
compute reachability between the path vertices and the rest of the graph in
time that depends logarithmically rather than linearly in the size of the path.
This new observation alone, however, is not enough, since we need to find an
efficient way to represent the strongly connected components using paths. For
this purpose we use a mixture of old and classical techniques such as the heavy
path decomposition of Sleator and Tarjan and the classical Depth-First-Search
algorithm. Although, these are by now standard techniques, we are not aware of
any usage of them in the context of dynamic maintenance of SCCs. Therefore, we
expect that our new insights and mixture of new and old techniques will be of
independent interest.

 <dc:title>Min cost flow on unit capacity networks and convex cost K-flow are as

 <dc:description>  We explore here surprising links between the time-cost-tradeoff problem and
the minimum cost flow problem that lead to faster, strongly polynomial,
algorithms for both problems. One of the main results is a new algorithm for
the unit capacity min cost flow that culminates decades of efforts to match the
complexity of the fastest strongly polynomial algorithm known for the
assignment problem.
  The time cost tradeoff (TCT) problem in project management is to expedite the
durations of activities, subject to precedence constraints, in order to achieve
a target project completion time at minimum expediting costs, or, to maximize
the net benefit from a reward associated with project completion time
reduction. We devise here the all-min-cuts procedure, which for a given maximum
flow, is capable of generating all minimum cuts of equal value very efficiently
in average $O(m+n \log n)$ time.
  The all-min-cuts procedure implies faster algorithms for TCT problems: For a
project network on $n$ nodes and $m$ arcs, with $n'$ arcs of finite uniform
expediting costs, the run time is $O((n+n')(m+n\log n))$; for projects with
reward of $O(K)$ per unit reduction in the project completion time the run time
is $O((n+K)(m+n\log n))$.
  Using the primal-dual relationship between TCT and the minimum cost flow
problem (MCF) we generate faster strongly polynomial algorithms for various
cases of minimum cost flow: For the unit capacity MCF the complexity of our
algorithm is $O(n(m+n\log n))$, which is faster than any other strongly
polynomial known to date; For a minimum convex (or linear) cost $K$-flow
problem our algorithm runs in $O((n+K)(m+n\log n))$. This complexity of the
algorithm for any min cost $O(n)$-flow matches the best known complexity for
the assignment problem, $O(n(m+n\log n))$, yet with a significantly different
approach.

 <dc:description>  We propose a flexible framework for spectral conversion (SC) that facilitates
training with unaligned corpora. Many SC frameworks require parallel corpora,
phonetic alignments, or explicit frame-wise correspondence for learning
conversion functions or for synthesizing a target spectrum with the aid of
alignments. However, these requirements gravely limit the scope of practical
applications of SC due to scarcity or even unavailability of parallel corpora.
We propose an SC framework based on variational auto-encoder which enables us
to exploit non-parallel corpora. The framework comprises an encoder that learns
speaker-independent phonetic representations and a decoder that learns to
reconstruct the designated speaker. It removes the requirement of parallel
corpora or phonetic alignments to train a spectral conversion system. We report
objective and subjective evaluations to validate our proposed method and
compare it to SC methods that have access to aligned corpora.

 <dc:description>  We present an upper bound for the number of differentiations in differential
elimination for systems of polynomial ODEs, the first such bound as far as we
are aware. Elimination of unknowns from systems of equations, starting with
Gaussian elimination, is a problem of general interest. In this paper, we study
elimination of unknowns from systems of polynomial ODEs, that is, how to derive
consequences of a system that do not depend on a selected set of unknowns. This
is called differential elimination. One way to do this is to find a uniform
(independent of the coefficients of the system) upper bound $N$ so that, after
differentiating the system $N$ times, the remaining computation becomes
polynomial elimination.

 <dc:description>  Recently there has been much interest in performing search queries over
encrypted data to enable functionality while protecting sensitive data. One
particularly efficient mechanism for executing such queries is order-preserving
encryption/encoding (OPE) which results in ciphertexts that preserve the
relative order of the underlying plaintexts thus allowing range and comparison
queries to be performed directly on ciphertexts. In this paper, we propose an
alternative approach to range queries over encrypted data that is optimized to
support insert-heavy workloads as are common in &quot;big data&quot; applications while
still maintaining search functionality and achieving stronger security.
Specifically, we propose a new primitive called partial order preserving
encoding (POPE) that achieves ideal OPE security with frequency hiding and also
leaves a sizable fraction of the data pairwise incomparable. Using only O(1)
persistent and $O(n^\epsilon)$ non-persistent client storage for
$0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1$, our POPE scheme provides extremely fast batch insertion
consisting of a single round, and efficient search with O(1) amortized cost for
up to $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ search queries. This improved security and
performance makes our scheme better suited for today's insert-heavy databases.

 <dc:description>  Spectrum sensing is a crucial component of opportunistic spectrum access
schemes, which aim at improving spectrum utilization by allowing for the reuse
of idle licensed spectrum. Sensing a spectral band before using it makes sure
the legitimate users are not disturbed. Since information about these users'
signals is not necessarily available, the sensor should be able to conduct
so-called blind spectrum sensing. Historically, this has not been a feature of
cyclostationarity-based algorithms. Indeed, in many application scenarios the
information required for traditional cyclostationarity detection might not be
available, hindering its practical applicability. In this work we propose two
new cyclostationary spectrum sensing algorithms that make use of the inherent
sparsity of the cyclic autocorrelation to make blind operation possible. Along
with utilizing sparse recovery methods for estimating the cyclic
autocorrelation, we take further advantage of its structure by introducing
joint sparsity as well as general structure dictionaries into the recovery
process. Furthermore, we extend a statistical test for cyclostationarity to
accommodate sparse cyclic spectra. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
new methods achieve a near constant false alarm rate behavior in contrast to
earlier approaches from the literature.

 <dc:description>  A methodology for the development of a fuzzy expert system (FES) with
application to earthquake prediction is presented. The idea is to reproduce the
performance of a human expert in earthquake prediction. To do this, at the
first step, rules provided by the human expert are used to generate a fuzzy
rule base. These rules are then fed into an inference engine to produce a fuzzy
inference system (FIS) and to infer the results. In this paper, we have used a
Sugeno type fuzzy inference system to build the FES. At the next step, the
adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to refine the FES
parameters and improve its performance. The proposed framework is then employed
to attain the performance of a human expert used to predict earthquakes in the
Zagros area based on the idea of coupled earthquakes. While the prediction
results are promising in parts of the testing set, the general performance
indicates that prediction methodology based on coupled earthquakes needs more
investigation and more complicated reasoning procedure to yield satisfactory
predictions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate how a residual network can learn to predict the dynamics of
interacting shapes purely as an image-to-image regression task.
  With a simple 2d physics simulator, we generate short sequences composed of
rectangles put in motion by applying a pulling force at a point picked at
random. The network is trained with a quadratic loss to predict the image of
the resulting configuration, given the image of the starting configuration and
an image indicating the point of grasping.
  Experiments show that the network learns to predict accurately the resulting
image, which implies in particular that (1) it segments rectangles as distinct
components, (2) it infers which one contains the grasping point, (3) it models
properly the dynamic of a single rectangle, including the torque, (4) it
detects and handles collisions to some extent, and (5) it re-synthesizes
properly the entire scene with displaced rectangles.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an online transfer learning framework for improving
temperature predictions in residential buildings. In transfer learning,
prediction models trained under a set of available data from a target domain
(e.g., house with limited data) can be improved through the use of data
generated from similar source domains (e.g., houses with rich data). Given also
the need for prediction models that can be trained online (e.g., as part of a
model-predictive-control implementation), this paper introduces the generalized
online transfer learning algorithm (GOTL). It employs a weighted combination of
the available predictors (i.e., the target and source predictors) and
guarantees convergence to the best weighted predictor. Furthermore, the use of
Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) allows for using more than a single source
domains, since it may facilitate the fit of a single model on more than one
source domains (houses). This allows GOTL to transfer knowledge from more than
one source domains. We further validate our results through experiments in
climate control for residential buildings and show that GOTL may lead to
non-negligible energy savings for given comfort levels.

likely to be selected for by natural selection, one must argue that, in some
sense, it is a better approach than the simple strategies that we propose.

 <dc:description>  We study the complexity of approximate counting Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (#CSPs) in a bounded degree setting. Specifically, given a Boolean
constraint language $\Gamma$ and a degree bound $\Delta$, we study the
complexity of #CSP$_\Delta(\Gamma)$, which is the problem of counting
satisfying assignments to CSP instances with constraints from $\Gamma$ and
whose variables can appear at most $\Delta$ times. Our main result shows that:
(i) if every function in $\Gamma$ is affine, then #CSP$_\Delta(\Gamma)$ is in
FP for all $\Delta$, (ii) otherwise, if every function in $\Gamma$ is in a
class called IM$_2$, then for all sufficiently large $\Delta$,
#CSP$_\Delta(\Gamma)$ is equivalent under approximation-preserving (AP)
reductions to the counting problem #BIS (the problem of counting independent
sets in bipartite graphs) (iii) otherwise, for all sufficiently large $\Delta$,
it is NP-hard to approximate the number of satisfying assignments of an
instance of #CSP$_\Delta(\Gamma)$, even within an exponential factor. Our
result extends previous results, which apply only in the so-called
&quot;conservative&quot; case.

 <dc:description>  We provide a new estimator of integral operators with smooth kernels,
obtained from a set of scattered and noisy impulse responses. The proposed
approach relies on the formalism of smoothing in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces and on the choice of an appropriate regularization term that takes the
smoothness of the operator into account. It is numerically tractable in very
large dimensions. We study the estimator's robustness to noise and analyze its
approximation properties with respect to the size and the geometry of the
dataset. In addition, we show minimax optimality of the proposed estimator.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Stroke Sequence-dependent Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (SSDCNN), using the stroke sequence information
and eight-directional features for Online Handwritten Chinese Character
Recognition (OLHCCR). On one hand, SSDCNN can learn the representation of
Online Handwritten Chinese Character (OLHCC) by incorporating the natural
sequence information of the strokes. On the other hand, SSDCNN can incorporate
eight-directional features in a natural way. In order to train SSDCNN, we
divide the process of training into two stages: 1) The training data is used to
pre-train the whole architecture until the performance tends to converge. 2)
Fully-connected neural network which is used to combine the stroke
sequence-dependent representation with eight-directional features and softmax
layer are further trained. Experiments were conducted on the OLHCCR competition
tasks of ICDAR 2013. Results show that, SSDCNN can reduce the recognition error
by 50\% (5.13\% vs 2.56\%) compared to the model which only use
eight-directional features. The proposed SSDCNN achieves 97.44\% accuracy which
reduces the recognition error by about 1.9\% compared with the best submitted
system on ICDAR2013 competition. These results indicate that SSDCNN can exploit
the stroke sequence information to learn high-quality representation of OLHCC.
It also shows that the learnt representation and the classical
eight-directional features complement each other within the SSDCNN
architecture.

 <dc:description>  Given a video and its incomplete textural description with missing words, the
Video-Fill-in-the-Blank (ViFitB) task is to automatically find the missing
word. The contextual information of the sentences are important to infer the
missing words; the visual cues are even more crucial to get a more accurate
inference. In this paper, we presents a new method which intuitively takes
advantage of the structure of the sentences and employs merging LSTMs (to merge
two LSTMs) to tackle the problem with embedded textural and visual cues. In the
experiments, we have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed
method on the challenging &quot;Movie Fill-in-the-Blank&quot; dataset.

 <dc:description>  Releasing connection data from social networking services can pose a
significant threat to user privacy. In our work, we consider structural social
network de-anonymization attacks, which are used when a malicious party uses
connections in a public or other identified network to re-identify users in an
anonymized social network release that he obtained previously.
  In this paper we design and evaluate a novel social de-anonymization attack.
In particular, we argue that the similarity function used to re-identify nodes
is a key component of such attacks, and we design a novel measure tailored for
social networks. We incorporate this measure in an attack called Bumblebee. We
evaluate Bumblebee in depth, and show that it significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art, for example it has higher re-identification rates with high
precision, robustness against noise, and also has better error control.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a practical and highly secure method for the authentication of
chips based on a new concept for implementing strong Physical Unclonable
Function (PUF) on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Its qualitatively
novel feature is a remote reconfiguration in which the delay stages of the PUF
are arranged to a random pattern within a subset of the FPGA's gates. Before
the reconfiguration is performed during authentication the PUF simply does not
exist. Hence even if an attacker has the chip under control previously she can
gain no useful information about the PUF. This feature, together with a strict
renunciation of any error correction and challenge selection criteria that
depend on individual properties of the PUF that goes into the field make our
strong PUF construction immune to all machine learning attacks presented in the
literature. More sophisticated attacks on our strong-PUF construction will be
difficult, because they require the attacker to learn or directly measure the
properties of the complete FPGA. A fully functional reference implementation
for a secure &quot;chip biometrics&quot; is presented. We remotely configure ten 64-stage
arbiter PUFs out of 1428 lookup tables within a time of 25 seconds and then
receive one &quot;fingerprint&quot; from each PUF within 1 msec.

 <dc:title>Truthful Mechanisms for Matching and Clustering in an Ordinal World</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study truthful mechanisms for matching and related problems in a partial
information setting, where the agents' true utilities are hidden, and the
algorithm only has access to ordinal preference information. Our model is
motivated by the fact that in many settings, agents cannot express the
numerical values of their utility for different outcomes, but are still able to
rank the outcomes in their order of preference. Specifically, we study problems
where the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph of agent
utilities, but the algorithm can only elicit the agents' private information in
the form of a preference ordering for each agent induced by the underlying
weights. Against this backdrop, we design truthful algorithms to approximate
the true optimum solution with respect to the hidden weights. Our techniques
yield universally truthful algorithms for a number of graph problems: a
1.76-approximation algorithm for Max-Weight Matching, 2-approximation algorithm
for Max k-matching, a 6-approximation algorithm for Densest k-subgraph, and a
2-approximation algorithm for Max Traveling Salesman as long as the hidden
weights constitute a metric. We also provide improved approximation algorithms
for such problems when the agents are not able to lie about their preferences.
Our results are the first non-trivial truthful approximation algorithms for
these problems, and indicate that in many situations, we can design robust
algorithms even when the agents may lie and only provide ordinal information
instead of precise utilities.

 <dc:title>Pricing to Maximize Revenue and Welfare Simultaneously in Large Markets</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study large markets with a single seller which can produce many types of
goods, and many multi-minded buyers. The seller chooses posted prices for its
many items, and the buyers purchase bundles to maximize their utility. For this
setting, we consider the following questions: What fraction of the optimum
social welfare does a revenue maximizing solution achieve? Are there pricing
mechanisms which achieve both good revenue and good welfare simultaneously? To
address these questions, we give efficient pricing schemes which are guaranteed
to result in both good revenue and welfare, as long as the buyer valuations for
the goods they desire have a nice (although reasonable) structure, e.g., that
the aggregate buyer demand has a monotone hazard rate or is not too convex. We
also show that our pricing schemes have implications for any pricing which
achieves high revenue: specifically that even if the seller cares only about
revenue, they can still ensure that their prices result in good social welfare
without sacrificing profit. Our results holds for general multi-minded buyers
in large markets; we also provide improved guarantees for the important special
case of unit-demand buyers.

improve the accuracy of link prediction. In our approach, we base PTransR model
on TransR, which is the best one-hop model at present. Then we regularize
TransR with information of relation paths. In our experiment, we evaluate
PTransR on the task of entity prediction. Experimental results show that
PTransR outperforms previous models.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of many low cost and light sensors
dispersed in an area to monitor the physical environment. Event detection in
WSN area, especially detection of multi-events at the same time, is an
important problem. This article is a new attempt for detection of two
simultaneous events based on distributed data processing structure and Bayesian
criteria. For accurate detection of two simultaneous events, we proposed new
decision rules based on likelihood ratio test and also derived probability of
detection error based on Bayesian criteria. In addition to multi-event
detection, the proposed method is expanded to a fault-tolerant procedure if
there are faults in decision making of sensors. Performance of the proposed
approach is demonstrated for detection of events in different circumstances.
Results show the effectiveness of the algorithm for fault-tolerant multi-event
detection.

 <dc:description>  The study of neurocognitive tasks requiring accurate localisation of activity
often rely on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a widely adopted technique
that makes use of a pipeline of data processing modules, each involving a
variety of parameters. These parameters are frequently set according to the
local goal of each specific module, not accounting for the rest of the
pipeline. Given recent success of neural network research in many different
domains, we propose to convert the whole data pipeline into a deep neural
network, where the parameters involved are jointly optimised by the network to
best serve a common global goal. As a proof of concept, we develop a module
able to adaptively apply the most suitable spatial smoothing to every brain
volume for each specific neuroimaging task, and we validate its results in a
standard brain decoding experiment.

 <dc:description>  This chapter is dedicated to the so-called cuspidal robots, i.e. those robots
that can move from one inverse geometric solution to another without meeting a
singular confuguration. This feature was discovered quite recently and has then
been fascinating a lot of researchers. After a brief history of cuspidal
robots, the chapter provides the main features of cuspidal robots: explanation
of the non-singular change of posture, uniqueness domains, regions of feasible
paths, identification and classification of cuspidal robots. The chapter
focuses on 3-R orthogonal serial robots. The case of 6-dof robots and parallel
robots is discussed in the end of this chapter.

 <dc:description>  Recommender system has attracted much attention during the past decade, and
many attack detection algorithms have been developed for better recommendation.
Most previous approaches focus on the shilling attacks, where the attack
organizer fakes a large number of user profiles by the same strategy to promote
or demote an item. In this paper, we study a different attack style:
unorganized malicious attacks, where attackers respectively use a small number
of user profiles to attack their own target items without any organizer. This
attack style occurs in many real applications, yet relevant study remains open.
In this paper, we formulate the unorganized malicious attacks detection as a
variant of matrix completion problem, and prove that attackers can be detected
theoretically. We propose the Unorganized Malicious Attacks detection (UMA)
algorithm, which can be viewed as a proximal alternating splitting augmented
Lagrangian method. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Mobile agent networks, such as multi-UAV systems, are constrained by limited
resources. In particular, limited energy affects system performance directly,
such as system lifetime. It has been demonstrated in the wireless sensor
network literature that the communication energy consumption dominates the
computational and the sensing energy consumption. Hence, the lifetime of the
multi-UAV systems can be extended significantly by optimizing the amount of
communication data, at the expense of increasing computational cost. In this
work, we aim at attaining an optimal trade-off between the communication and
the computational energy. Specifically, we propose a mixed-integer optimization
formulation for a multi-hop hierarchical clustering-based self-organizing UAV
network incorporating data aggregation, to obtain an energy-efficient
information routing scheme. The proposed framework is tested on two
applications, namely target tracking and area mapping. Based on simulation
results, our method can significantly save energy compared to a baseline
strategy, where there is no data aggregation and clustering scheme.

 <dc:description>  Esophageal adenocarcinoma arises from Barrett's esophagus, which is the most
serious complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Strategies for
screening involve periodic surveillance and tissue biopsies. A major challenge
in such regular examinations is to record and track the disease evolution and
re-localization of biopsied sites to provide targeted treatments. In this
paper, we extend our original inter-operative relocalization framework to
provide a constrained image based search for obtaining the best view-point
match to the live view. Within this context we investigate the effect of: the
choice of feature descriptors and color-space; filtering of uninformative
frames and endoscopic modality, for view-point localization. Our experiments
indicate an improvement in the best view-point retrieval rate to [92%,87%] from
[73%,76%] (in our previous approach) for NBI and WL.

 <dc:description>  Recent studies on cloud-radio access networks assume either signal-level or
scheduling-level coordination. This paper considers a hybrid coordinated scheme
as a means to benefit from both policies. Consider the downlink of a
multi-cloud radio access network, where each cloud is connected to several
base-stations (BSs) via high capacity links, and, therefore, allows for joint
signal processing within the cloud transmission. Across the multiple clouds,
however, only scheduling-level coordination is permitted, as low levels of
backhaul communication are feasible. The frame structure of every BS is
composed of various time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZs), which are
maintained at a fixed power level. The paper addresses the problem of
maximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and scheduling
them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is scheduled to
a single cloud at most, but possibly to many BSs within the cloud, and can be
served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The paper solves the
problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the conflict graph. The
considered scheduling problem is, then, shown to be equivalent to a
maximum-weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, which can be
solved using efficient techniques. The paper then proposes solving the problem
using both optimal and heuristic algorithms that can be implemented in a
distributed fashion across the network. The proposed distributed algorithms
rely on the well-chosen structure of the constructed conflict graph utilized to
solve the maximum-weight independent set problem. Simulation results suggest
that the proposed optimal and heuristic hybrid scheduling strategies provide
appreciable gain as compared to the scheduling-level coordinated networks, with
a negligible degradation to signal-level coordination.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a deep learning architecture for the semantic decoder
component of a Statistical Spoken Dialogue System. In a slot-filling dialogue,
the semantic decoder predicts the dialogue act and a set of slot-value pairs
from a set of n-best hypotheses returned by the Automatic Speech Recognition.
Most current models for spoken language understanding assume (i) word-aligned
semantic annotations as in sequence taggers and (ii) delexicalisation, or a
mapping of input words to domain-specific concepts using heuristics that try to
capture morphological variation but that do not scale to other domains nor to
language variation (e.g., morphology, synonyms, paraphrasing ). In this work
the semantic decoder is trained using unaligned semantic annotations and it
uses distributed semantic representation learning to overcome the limitations
of explicit delexicalisation. The proposed architecture uses a convolutional
neural network for the sentence representation and a long-short term memory
network for the context representation. Results are presented for the publicly
available DSTC2 corpus and an In-car corpus which is similar to DSTC2 but has a
significantly higher word error rate (WER).

 <dc:description>  Dense, robust and real-time computation of depth information from
stereo-camera systems is a computationally demanding requirement for robotics,
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. Semi-Global
Matching (SGM) is a widely used algorithm that propagates consistency
constraints along several paths across the image. This work presents a
real-time system producing reliable disparity estimation results on the new
embedded energy-efficient GPU devices. Our design runs on a Tegra X1 at 42
frames per second (fps) for an image size of 640x480, 128 disparity levels, and
using 4 path directions for the SGM method.

 <dc:description>  Digital whole-slide images of pathological tissue samples have recently
become feasible for use within routine diagnostic practice. These gigapixel
sized images enable pathologists to perform reviews using computer workstations
instead of microscopes. Existing workstations visualize scanned images by
providing a zoomable image space that reproduces the capabilities of the
microscope. This paper presents a novel visualization approach that enables
filtering of the scale-space according to color preference. The visualization
method reveals diagnostically important patterns that are otherwise not
visible. The paper demonstrates how this approach has been implemented into a
fully functional prototype that lets the user navigate the visualization
parameter space in real time. The prototype was evaluated for two common
clinical tasks with eight pathologists in a within-subjects study. The data
reveal that task efficiency increased by 15% using the prototype, with
maintained accuracy. By analyzing behavioral strategies, it was possible to
conclude that efficiency gain was caused by a reduction of the panning needed
to perform systematic search of the images. The prototype system was well
received by the pathologists who did not detect any risks that would hinder use
in clinical routine.

 <dc:description>  Crowdsourced software development (CSD) offers a series of specified tasks to
a large crowd of trustworthy software workers. Topcoder is a leading platform
to manage the whole process of CSD. While increasingly accepted as a realistic
option for software development, preliminary analysis on Topcoder's software
crowd worker behaviors reveals an alarming task-quitting rate of 82.9%. In
addition, a substantial number of tasks do not receive any successful
submission.
  In this paper, we report about a methodology to improve the efficiency of
CSD. We apply massive data analytics and machine leaning to (i) perform
comparative analysis on alternative technique analysis to predict likelihood of
winners and quitters for each task, (ii) significantly reduce the amount of
non-succeeding development effort in registered but inappropriate tasks, (iii)
identify and rank the most qualified registered workers for each task, and (iv)
provide reliable prediction of tasks risky to get any successful submission.
  Our results and analysis show that Random Forest (RF) based predictive
technique performs best among the alternative techniques studied. Applying RF,
the tasks recommended to workers can reduce the amount of non-succeeding
development effort to a great extent. On average, over a period of 30 days, the
savings are 3.5 and 4.6 person-days per registered tasks for experienced resp.
unexperienced workers. For the task-related recommendations of workers, we can
accurately recommend at least 1 actual winner in the top ranked workers,
particularly 94.07% of the time among the top-2 recommended workers for each
task. Finally, we can predict, with more than 80% F-measure, the tasks likely
not getting any submission, thus triggering timely corrective actions from CSD
platforms or task requesters.

 <dc:description>  Traditional studies of memristive devices have mainly focused on their
applications in non-volatile information storage and information processing.
Here, we demonstrate that the third fundamental component of information
technologies { the transfer of information { can also be employed with
memristive devices. For this purpose, we introduce a metastable memristive
circuit. Combining metastable memristive circuits into a line, one obtains an
architecture capable of transferring a signal edge from one space location to
another. We emphasize that the suggested transmission lines employ only
resistive components. Moreover, their networks (for example, Y-connected lines)
have an information processing capability.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of extremely high dimensional datasets, dimensionality
reduction techniques are becoming mandatory. Among many techniques, feature
selection has been growing in interest as an important tool to identify
relevant features on huge datasets --both in number of instances and
features--. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that standard feature
selection methods can be parallelized in Big Data platforms like Apache Spark,
boosting both performance and accuracy. We thus propose a distributed
implementation of a generic feature selection framework which includes a wide
group of well-known Information Theoretic methods. Experimental results on a
wide set of real-world datasets show that our distributed framework is capable
of dealing with ultra-high dimensional datasets as well as those with a huge
number of samples in a short period of time, outperforming the sequential
version in all the cases studied.

of the moir\'e effect for cylindrical single-layer objects in the paraxial
approximation. With using the dual grids, the moir\'e effect in the plane
gratings is simulated, as well as the near-axis moir\'e effect in cylinders
including the chiral layouts. The results can be applied to the graphene
layers, to single-walled nanotubes, and to cylinders in general.

 <dc:title>Why Deep Neural Networks for Function Approximation?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently there has been much interest in understanding why deep neural
networks are preferred to shallow networks. We show that, for a large class of
piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network
to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number
of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function
approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval
and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of $\varepsilon$
uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks
whose depth does not depend on $\varepsilon$) require
$\Omega(\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ neurons while deep networks (i.e.,
networks whose depth grows with $1/\varepsilon$) require
$\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$ neurons. We then extend these
results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are
derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units
(ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation
functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of
two bits can be represented by a ReLU.

 <dc:description>  Casting neural networks in generative frameworks is a highly sought-after
endeavor these days. Existing methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks,
capture some of the generative capabilities, but not all. To truly leverage the
power of generative models, tractable marginalization is needed, a feature
outside the realm of current methods. We present a generative model based on
convolutional arithmetic circuits, a variant of convolutional networks that
computes high-dimensional functions through tensor decompositions. Our method
admits tractable marginalization, combining the expressive power of
convolutional networks with all the abilities that may be offered by a
generative framework. We focus on the application of classification under
missing data, where unknown portions of classified instances are absent at test
time. Our model, which theoretically achieves optimal classification, provides
state of the art performance when classifying images with missing pixels, as
well as promising results when treating speech with occluded samples.

 <dc:description>  Misinformation under the form of rumor, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories
spreads on social media at alarming rates. One hypothesis is that, since social
media are shaped by homophily, belief in misinformation may be more likely to
thrive on those social circles that are segregated from the rest of the
network. One possible antidote is fact checking which, in some cases, is known
to stop rumors from spreading further. However, fact checking may also backfire
and reinforce the belief in a hoax. Here we take into account the combination
of network segregation, finite memory and attention, and fact-checking efforts.
We consider a compartmental model of two interacting epidemic processes over a
network that is segregated between gullible and skeptic users. Extensive
simulation and mean-field analysis show that a more segregated network
facilitates the spread of a hoax only at low forgetting rates, but has no
effect when agents forget at faster rates. This finding may inform the
development of mitigation techniques and overall inform on the risks of
uncontrolled misinformation online.

 <dc:description>  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems achieve high sum
spectral efficiency by offering an order of magnitude increase in multiplexing
gains. In time division duplexing systems, however, the reuse of uplink
training pilots among cells results in additional channel estimation error,
which causes downlink inter-cell interference, even when large numbers of
antennas are employed. Handling this interference with conventional network
MIMO techniques is challenging due to the large channel dimensionality.
Further, the implementation of large antenna precoding/combining matrices is
associated with high hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper,
we propose multi-layer precoding to enable efficient and low complexity
operation in full-dimensional massive MIMO, where a large number of antennas is
used in two dimensions. In multi-layer precoding, the precoding matrix of each
base station is written as a product of a number of precoding matrices, each
one called a layer. Multi-layer precoding (i) leverages the directional
characteristics of large-scale MIMO channels to manage inter-cell interference
with low channel knowledge requirements, and (ii) allows for an efficient
implementation using low-complexity hybrid analog/digital architectures. We
present a specific multi-layer precoding design for full-dimensional massive
MIMO systems. The performance of this precoding design is analyzed and the
per-user achievable rate is characterized for general channel models. The
asymptotic optimality of the proposed multi-layer precoding design is then
proved for some special yet important channels. Numerical simulations verify
the analytical results and illustrate the potential gains of multi-layer
precoding compared to traditional pilot-contaminated massive MIMO solutions.

 <dc:description>  Wireless object tracking applications are gaining popularity and will soon
utilize emerging ultra-low-power device-to-device communication. However,
severe energy constraints require much more careful accounting of energy usage
than what prior art provides. In particular, the available energy, the
differing power consumption levels for listening, receiving, and transmitting,
as well as the limited control bandwidth must all be considered. Therefore, we
formulate the problem of maximizing the throughput among a set of heterogeneous
broadcasting nodes with differing power consumption levels, each subject to a
strict ultra-low-power budget. We obtain the oracle throughput (i.e., maximum
throughput achieved by an oracle) and use Lagrangian methods to design EconCast
- a simple asynchronous distributed protocol in which nodes transition between
sleep, listen, and transmit states, and dynamically change the transition
rates. EconCast can operate in groupput or anyput modes to respectively
maximize two alternative throughput measures. We show that EconCast approaches
the oracle throughput. The performance is also evaluated numerically and via
extensive simulations and it is shown that EconCast outperforms prior art by 6x
- 17x under realistic assumptions. Moreover, we evaluate EconCast's latency
performance and consider design tradeoffs when operating in groupput and anyput
modes. Finally, we implement EconCast using the TI eZ430-RF2500-SEH energy
harvesting nodes and experimentally show that in realistic environments it
obtains 57% - 77% of the achievable throughput.

 <dc:title>Phase Retrieval Meets Statistical Learning Theory: A Flexible Convex

 <dc:description>  We propose a flexible convex relaxation for the phase retrieval problem that
operates in the natural domain of the signal. Therefore, we avoid the
prohibitive computational cost associated with &quot;lifting&quot; and semidefinite
programming (SDP) in methods such as PhaseLift and compete with recently
developed non-convex techniques for phase retrieval. We relax the quadratic
equations for phaseless measurements to inequality constraints each of which
representing a symmetric &quot;slab&quot;. Through a simple convex program, our proposed
estimator finds an extreme point of the intersection of these slabs that is
best aligned with a given anchor vector. We characterize geometric conditions
that certify success of the proposed estimator. Furthermore, using classic
results in statistical learning theory, we show that for random measurements
the geometric certificates hold with high probability at an optimal sample
complexity. Phase transition of our estimator is evaluated through simulations.
Our numerical experiments also suggest that the proposed method can solve phase
retrieval problems with coded diffraction measurements as well.

 <dc:description>  Machine reading using differentiable reasoning models has recently shown
remarkable progress. In this context, End-to-End trainable Memory Networks,
MemN2N, have demonstrated promising performance on simple natural language
based reasoning tasks such as factual reasoning and basic deduction. However,
other tasks, namely multi-fact question-answering, positional reasoning or
dialog related tasks, remain challenging particularly due to the necessity of
more complex interactions between the memory and controller modules composing
this family of models. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end memory
access regulation mechanism inspired by the current progress on the connection
short-cutting principle in the field of computer vision. Concretely, we develop
a Gated End-to-End trainable Memory Network architecture, GMemN2N. From the
machine learning perspective, this new capability is learned in an end-to-end
fashion without the use of any additional supervision signal which is, as far
as our knowledge goes, the first of its kind. Our experiments show significant
improvements on the most challenging tasks in the 20 bAbI dataset, without the
use of any domain knowledge. Then, we show improvements on the dialog bAbI
tasks including the real human-bot conversion-based Dialog State Tracking
Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset. On these two datasets, our model sets the new state
of the art.

 <dc:description>  The high probability of hardware failures prevents many advanced robots
(e.g., legged robots) from being confidently deployed in real-world situations
(e.g., post-disaster rescue). Instead of attempting to diagnose the failures,
robots could adapt by trial-and-error in order to be able to complete their
tasks. In this situation, damage recovery can be seen as a Reinforcement
Learning (RL) problem. However, the best RL algorithms for robotics require the
robot and the environment to be reset to an initial state after each episode,
that is, the robot is not learning autonomously. In addition, most of the RL
methods for robotics do not scale well with complex robots (e.g., walking
robots) and either cannot be used at all or take too long to converge to a
solution (e.g., hours of learning). In this paper, we introduce a novel
learning algorithm called &quot;Reset-free Trial-and-Error&quot; (RTE) that (1) breaks
the complexity by pre-generating hundreds of possible behaviors with a dynamics
simulator of the intact robot, and (2) allows complex robots to quickly recover
from damage while completing their tasks and taking the environment into
account. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated wheeled robot, a simulated
six-legged robot, and a real six-legged walking robot that are damaged in
several ways (e.g., a missing leg, a shortened leg, faulty motor, etc.) and
whose objective is to reach a sequence of targets in an arena. Our experiments
show that the robots can recover most of their locomotion abilities in an
environment with obstacles, and without any human intervention.

 <dc:description>  In encryption, non-malleability is a highly desirable property: it ensures
that adversaries cannot manipulate the plaintext by acting on the ciphertext.
Ambainis, Bouda and Winter gave a definition of non-malleability for the
encryption of quantum data. In this work, we show that this definition is too
weak, as it allows adversaries to &quot;inject&quot; plaintexts of their choice into the
ciphertext. We give a new definition of quantum non-malleability which resolves
this problem. Our definition is expressed in terms of entropic quantities,
considers stronger adversaries, and does not assume secrecy. Rather, we prove
that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy; this is in stark contrast to the
classical setting, where the two properties are completely independent. For
unitary schemes, our notion of non-malleability is equivalent to encryption
with a two-design (and hence also to the definition of Ambainis et al.). Our
techniques also yield new results regarding the closely-related task of quantum
authentication. We show that &quot;total authentication&quot; (a notion recently proposed
by Garg, Yuen and Zhandry) can be satisfied with two-designs, a significant
improvement over the eight-design construction of Garg et al. We also show
that, under a mild adaptation of the rejection procedure, both total
authentication and our notion of non-malleability yield quantum authentication
as defined by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail.

 <dc:description>  We prove the partial strong converse property for the discrete memoryless
\emph{non-degraded} wiretap channel, for which we require the leakage to the
eavesdropper to vanish but allow an asymptotic error probability $\epsilon \in
[0,1)$ to the legitimate receiver. We show that when the transmission rate is
above the secrecy capacity, the probability of correct decoding at the
legitimate receiver decays to zero exponentially. Therefore, the maximum
transmission rate is the same for $\epsilon \in [0,1)$, and the partial strong
converse property holds. Our work is inspired by a recently developed technique
based on information spectrum method and Chernoff-Cramer bound for evaluating
the exponent of the probability of correct decoding.

 <dc:description>  Large real-world networks typically follow a power-law degree distribution.
To study such networks, numerous random graph models have been proposed.
However, real-world networks are not drawn at random. Therefore, Brach, Cygan,
{\L}acki, and Sankowski [SODA 2016] introduced two natural deterministic
conditions: (1) a power-law upper bound on the degree distribution (PLB-U) and
(2) power-law neighborhoods, that is, the degree distribution of neighbors of
each vertex is also upper bounded by a power law (PLB-N). They showed that many
real-world networks satisfy both deterministic properties and exploit them to
design faster algorithms for a number of classical graph problems.
  We complement the work of Brach et al. by showing that some well-studied
random graph models exhibit both the mentioned PLB properties and additionally
also a power-law lower bound on the degree distribution (PLB-L). All three
properties hold with high probability for Chung-Lu Random Graphs and Geometric
Inhomogeneous Random Graphs and almost surely for Hyperbolic Random Graphs. As
a consequence, all results of Brach et al. also hold with high probability or
almost surely for those random graph classes.
  In the second part of this work we study three classical NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems on PLB networks. It is known that on
general graphs with maximum degree {\Delta}, a greedy algorithm, which chooses
nodes in the order of their degree, only achieves an {\Omega}(ln
{\Delta})-approximation for Minimum Vertex Cover and Minimum Dominating Set,
and an {\Omega}({\Delta})-approximation for Maximum Independent Set. We prove
that the PLB-U property suffices for the greedy approach to achieve a
constant-factor approximation for all three problems. We also show that all
three combinatorial optimization problems are APX-complete, even if all
PLB-properties hold.

 <dc:title>Super-Resolution Delay-Doppler Estimation for OFDM Passive Radar</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zheng, Le</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of joint delay-Doppler estimation of
moving targets in a passive radar that makes use of orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals. A compressed
sensing algorithm is proposed to achieve supper-resolution and better accuracy,
using both the atomic norm and the $\ell_1$-norm. The atomic norm is used to
manifest the signal sparsity in the continuous domain. Unlike previous works
which assume the demodulation to be error free, we explicitly introduce the
demodulation error signal whose sparsity is imposed by the $\ell_1$-norm. On
this basis, the delays and Doppler frequencies are estimated by solving a
semidefinite program (SDP) which is convex. We also develop an iterative method
for solving this SDP via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
where each iteration involves closed-form computation. Simulation results are
presented to illustrate the high performance of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:title>Assessing Threat of Adversarial Examples on Deep Neural Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks are facing a potential security threat from adversarial
examples, inputs that look normal but cause an incorrect classification by the
deep neural network. For example, the proposed threat could result in
hand-written digits on a scanned check being incorrectly classified but looking
normal when humans see them. This research assesses the extent to which
adversarial examples pose a security threat, when one considers the normal
image acquisition process. This process is mimicked by simulating the
transformations that normally occur in acquiring the image in a real world
application, such as using a scanner to acquire digits for a check amount or
using a camera in an autonomous car. These small transformations negate the
effect of the carefully crafted perturbations of adversarial examples,
resulting in a correct classification by the deep neural network. Thus just
acquiring the image decreases the potential impact of the proposed security
threat. We also show that the already widely used process of averaging over
multiple crops neutralizes most adversarial examples. Normal preprocessing,
such as text binarization, almost completely neutralizes adversarial examples.
This is the first paper to show that for text driven classification,
adversarial examples are an academic curiosity, not a security threat.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing technology provides the means to share physical resources
among multiple users and data center tenants by exposing them as virtual
resources. There is a strong industrial drive to use similar technology and
concepts to provide timing sensitive services. One such is virtual networking
services, so called services chains, which consist of several interconnected
virtual network functions. This allows for the capacity to be scaled up and
down by adding or removing virtual resources. In this work, we develop a model
of a service chain and pose the dynamic allocation of resources as an
optimization problem. We design and present a set of strategies to allot
virtual network nodes in an optimal fashion subject to latency and buffer
constraints.

 <dc:description>  Conventional dual-frequency fringe projection algorithm often suffers from
phase unwrapping failure when the frequency ratio between the high frequency
and the low one is too large. Zhang et.al. proposed an enhanced two-frequency
phase-shifting method to use geometric constraints of digital fringe
projection(DFP) to reduce the noise impact due to the large frequency ratio.
However, this method needs to calibrate the DFP system and calculate the
minimum phase map at the nearest position from the camera perspective, these
procedures are are relatively complex and more time-cosuming. In this paper, we
proposed an improved method, which eliminates the system calibration and
determination in Zhang's method,meanwhile does not need to use the low
frequency fringe pattern. In the proposed method,we only need a set of high
frequency fringe patterns to measure the object after the high frequency is
directly estimated by the experiment. Thus the proposed method can simplify the
procedure and improve the speed. Finally, the experimental evaluation is
conducted to prove the validity of the proposed method.The results demonstrate
that the proposed method can overcome the main disadvantages encountered by
Zhang's method.

 <dc:description>  The utilization of statistical machine translation (SMT) has grown enormously
over the last decade, many using open-source software developed by the NLP
community. As commercial use has increased, there is need for software that is
optimized for commercial requirements, in particular, fast phrase-based
decoding and more efficient utilization of modern multicore servers.
  In this paper we re-examine the major components of phrase-based decoding and
decoder implementation with particular emphasis on speed and scalability on
multicore machines. The result is a drop-in replacement for the Moses decoder
which is up to fifteen times faster and scales monotonically with the number of
cores.

 <dc:description>  Many critical EDA problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the
very fast-scaling computational burden produced by large number of parameters
and/or unknown variables. This phenomenon may be caused by multiple spatial or
temporal factors (e.g. 3-D field solvers discretizations and multi-rate circuit
simulation), nonlinearity of devices and circuits, large number of design or
optimization parameters (e.g. full-chip routing/placement and circuit sizing),
or extensive process variations (e.g. variability/reliability analysis and
design for manufacturability). The computational challenges generated by such
high dimensional problems are generally hard to handle efficiently with
traditional EDA core algorithms that are based on matrix and vector
computation. This paper presents &quot;tensor computation&quot; as an alternative general
framework for the development of efficient EDA algorithms and tools. A tensor
is a high-dimensional generalization of a matrix and a vector, and is a natural
choice for both storing and solving efficiently high-dimensional EDA problems.
This paper gives a basic tutorial on tensors, demonstrates some recent examples
of EDA applications (e.g., nonlinear circuit modeling and high-dimensional
uncertainty quantification), and suggests further open EDA problems where the
use of tensor computation could be of advantage.

 <dc:title>Hierarchical Clustering Given Confidence Intervals of Metric Distances</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper considers metric spaces where distances between a pair of nodes
are represented by distance intervals. The goal is to study methods for the
determination of hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions
indexed by a resolution parameter, induced from the given distance intervals of
the metric spaces. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is based
on defining admissible methods to be those methods that abide to the axioms of
value - nodes in a metric space with two nodes are clustered together at the
convex combination of the distance bounds between them - and transformation -
when both distance bounds are reduced, the output may become more clustered but
not less. Two admissible methods are constructed and are shown to provide
universal upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Practical
implications are explored by clustering moving points via snapshots and by
clustering networks representing brain structural connectivity using the lower
and upper bounds of the network distance. The proposed clustering methods
succeed in identifying underlying clustering structures via the maximum and
minimum distances in all snapshots, as well as in differentiating brain
connectivity networks of patients from those of healthy controls.

basic 3D visualization. A range of usage cases are tested, including data
visualization and immersive data spaces, in-situ visualization of 3D models and
full scale architectural form visualization. Ultimately, the Hololens is found
to provide a remarkable tool for moving from traditional visualization of 3D

 <dc:description>  Applying end-to-end learning to solve complex, interactive, pixel-driven
control tasks on a robot is an unsolved problem. Deep Reinforcement Learning
algorithms are too slow to achieve performance on a real robot, but their
potential has been demonstrated in simulated environments. We propose using
progressive networks to bridge the reality gap and transfer learned policies
from simulation to the real world. The progressive net approach is a general
framework that enables reuse of everything from low-level visual features to
high-level policies for transfer to new tasks, enabling a compositional, yet
simple, approach to building complex skills. We present an early demonstration
of this approach with a number of experiments in the domain of robot
manipulation that focus on bridging the reality gap. Unlike other proposed
approaches, our real-world experiments demonstrate successful task learning
from raw visual input on a fully actuated robot manipulator. Moreover, rather
than relying on model-based trajectory optimisation, the task learning is
accomplished using only deep reinforcement learning and sparse rewards.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, electrothermal field phenomena in electronic components are
considered. This coupling is tackled by multiphysical field simulations using
the Finite Integration Technique (FIT). In particular, the design of bonding
wires with respect to thermal degradation is investigated. Instead of resolving
the wires by the computational grid, lumped element representations are
introduced as point-to-point connections in the spatially distributed model.
Fabrication tolerances lead to uncertainties of the wires' parameters and
influence the operation and reliability of the final product. Based on
geometric measurements, the resulting variability of the wire temperatures is
determined using the stochastic electrothermal field-circuit model.

 <dc:description>  Starting from a 3D electrothermal field problem discretized by the Finite
Integration Technique, the equivalence to a circuit description is shown by
exploiting the analogy to the Modified Nodal Analysis approach. Using this
analogy, an algorithm for the automatic generation of a monolithic SPICE
netlist is presented. Joule losses from the electrical circuit are included as
heat sources in the thermal circuit. The thermal simulation yields nodal
temperatures that influence the electrical conductivity. Apart from the used
field discretization, this approach applies no further simplifications. An
example 3D chip package is used to validate the algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new practical association rule mining algorithm
for anomaly detection in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). First, with a view
of anomaly cases being relatively rarely occurred in network packet database,
we define a rare association rule among infrequent itemsets rather than the
traditional association rule mining method. And then, we discuss an interest
measure to catch differences between interesting relations and uninteresting
ones, and what interest there is, and develop a hash based rare association
rule mining algorithm for finding rare, but useful anomaly patterns to user.
Finally, we define a quantitative association rule in relational database,
propose a practical algorithm to mine rare association rules from network
packet database, and show advantages of it giving a concrete example. Our
algorithm can be applied to fields need to mine hidden patterns which are rare,
but valuable, like IDS, and it is based on hashing method among infrequent
itemsets, so that it has obvious advantages of speed and memory space
limitation problems over the traditional association rule mining algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Active vision is inherently attention-driven: The agent selects views of
observation to best approach the vision task while improving its internal
representation of the scene being observed. Inspired by the recent success of
attention-based models in 2D vision tasks based on single RGB images, we
propose to address the multi-view depth-based active object recognition using
attention mechanism, through developing an end-to-end recurrent 3D attentional
network. The architecture comprises of a recurrent neural network (RNN),
storing and updating an internal representation, and two levels of spatial
transformer units, guiding two-level attentions. Our model, trained with a 3D
shape database, is able to iteratively attend to the best views targeting an
object of interest for recognizing it, and focus on the object in each view for
removing the background clutter. To realize 3D view selection, we derive a 3D
spatial transformer network which is differentiable for training with
back-propagation, achieving must faster convergence than the reinforcement
learning employed by most existing attention-based models. Experiments show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cluttered scenes.

 <dc:title>A Quantitative Model for Predicting Cross-application Interference in

 <dc:description>  Cross-application interference can affect drastically performance of HPC
applications when running in clouds. This problem is caused by concurrent
access performed by co-located applications to shared and non-sliceable
resources such as cache and memory. In order to address this issue, some works
adopted a qualitative approach that does not take into account the amount of
access to shared resources. In addition, a few works, even considering the
amount of access, evaluated just the SLLC access contention as the root of this
problem. However, our experiments revealed that interference is intrinsically
related to the amount of simultaneous access to shared resources, besides
showing that another shared resources, apart from SLLC, can also influence the
interference suffered by co-located applications. In this paper, we present a
quantitative model for predicting cross-application interference in virtual
environments. Our proposed model takes into account the amount of simultaneous
access to SLLC, DRAM and virtual network, and the similarity of application's
access burden to predict the level of interference suffered by applications
when co-located in a same physical machine. Experiments considering a real
petroleum reservoir simulator and applications from HPCC benchmark showed that
our model reached an average and maximum prediction errors around 4\% and 12\%,
besides achieving an error less than 10\% in approximately 96\% of all tested
cases.

 <dc:title>Computing Equilibria with Partial Commitment</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Conitzer, Vincent</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In security games, the solution concept commonly used is that of a
Stackelberg equilibrium where the defender gets to commit to a mixed strategy.
The motivation for this is that the attacker can repeatedly observe the
defender's actions and learn her distribution over actions, before acting
himself. If the actions were not observable, Nash (or perhaps correlated)
equilibrium would arguably be a more natural solution concept. But what if
some, but not all, aspects of the defender's actions are observable? In this
paper, we introduce solution concepts corresponding to this case, both with and
without correlation. We study their basic properties, whether these solutions
can be efficiently computed, and the impact of additional observability on the
utility obtained.

 <dc:title>Approximate Counting, the Lovasz Local Lemma and Inference in Graphical

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a new approach for approximately counting in
bounded degree systems with higher-order constraints. Our main result is an
algorithm to approximately count the number of solutions to a CNF formula
$\Phi$ when the width is logarithmic in the maximum degree. This closes an
exponential gap between the known upper and lower bounds.
  Moreover our algorithm extends straightforwardly to approximate sampling,
which shows that under Lov\'asz Local Lemma-like conditions it is not only
possible to find a satisfying assignment, it is also possible to generate one
approximately uniformly at random from the set of all satisfying assignments.
Our approach is a significant departure from earlier techniques in approximate
counting, and is based on a framework to bootstrap an oracle for computing
marginal probabilities on individual variables. Finally, we give an application
of our results to show that it is algorithmically possible to sample from the
posterior distribution in an interesting class of graphical models.

 <dc:title>Learning and Fusing Multimodal Features from and for Multi-task Facial

 <dc:creator>Zhu, Zhigang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a deep learning-based feature fusion approach for facial computing
including face recognition as well as gender, race and age detection. Instead
of training a single classifier on face images to classify them based on the
features of the person whose face appears in the image, we first train four
different classifiers for classifying face images based on race, age, gender
and identification (ID). Multi-task features are then extracted from the
trained models and cross-task-feature training is conducted which shows the
value of fusing multimodal features extracted from multi-tasks. We have found
that features trained for one task can be used for other related tasks. More
interestingly, the features trained for a task with more classes (e.g. ID) and
then used in another task with fewer classes (e.g. race) outperforms the
features trained for the other task itself. The final feature fusion is
performed by combining the four types of features extracted from the images by
the four classifiers. The feature fusion approach improves the classifications
accuracy by a 7.2%, 20.1%, 22.2%, 21.8% margin, respectively, for ID, age, race
and gender recognition, over the results of single classifiers trained only on
their individual features. The proposed method can be applied to applications
in which different types of data or features can be extracted.

 <dc:description>  Bilinear models provide rich representations compared with linear models.
They have been applied in various visual tasks, such as object recognition,
segmentation, and visual question-answering, to get state-of-the-art
performances taking advantage of the expanded representations. However,
bilinear representations tend to be high-dimensional, limiting the
applicability to computationally complex tasks. We propose low-rank bilinear
pooling using Hadamard product for an efficient attention mechanism of
multimodal learning. We show that our model outperforms compact bilinear
pooling in visual question-answering tasks with the state-of-the-art results on
the VQA dataset, having a better parsimonious property.

 <dc:description>  Strict Minimum Message Length (SMML) is a statistical inference method widely
cited (but only with informal arguments) as providing estimations that are
consistent for general estimation problems. It is, however, almost invariably
intractable to compute, for which reason only approximations of it (known as
MML algorithms) are ever used in practice. We investigate the Neyman-Scott
estimation problem, an oft-cited showcase for the consistency of MML, and show
that even with a natural choice of prior, neither SMML nor its popular
approximations are consistent for it, thereby providing a counterexample to the
general claim. This is the first known explicit construction of an SMML
solution for a natural, high-dimensional problem. We use the same novel
construction methods to refute other claims regarding MML also appearing in the
literature.

 <dc:description>  In an era of unprecedented deluge of (mostly unstructured) data, graphs are
proving more and more useful, across the sciences, as a flexible abstraction to
capture complex relationships between complex objects. One of the main
challenges arising in the study of such networks is the inference of
macroscopic, large-scale properties affecting a large number of objects, based
solely on the microscopic interactions between their elementary constituents.
Statistical physics, precisely created to recover the macroscopic laws of
thermodynamics from an idealized model of interacting particles, provides
significant insight to tackle such complex networks.
  In this dissertation, we use methods derived from the statistical physics of
disordered systems to design and study new algorithms for inference on graphs.
Our focus is on spectral methods, based on certain eigenvectors of carefully
chosen matrices, and sparse graphs, containing only a small amount of
information. We develop an original theory of spectral inference based on a
relaxation of various mean-field free energy optimizations. Our approach is
therefore fully probabilistic, and contrasts with more traditional motivations
based on the optimization of a cost function. We illustrate the efficiency of
our approach on various problems, including community detection, randomized
similarity-based clustering, and matrix completion.

wide-sense-stationary uncorrelated-scattering (WSSUS) channel and evaluate the
worst case of SNR. We construct the non-linear programing for maximizing the
lower bound of the average of SNR. This problem becomes the convex programming
if we did not take into account the norm constraint. We derive necessary
conditions for optimal spreading sequences for the problem.

 <dc:description>  Many methods have been used to recognize author personality traits from text,
typically combining linguistic feature engineering with shallow learning
models, e.g. linear regression or Support Vector Machines. This work uses
deep-learning-based models and atomic features of text, the characters, to
build hierarchical, vectorial word and sentence representations for trait
inference. This method, applied to a corpus of tweets, shows state-of-the-art
performance across five traits and three languages (English, Spanish and
Italian) compared with prior work in author profiling. The results, supported
by preliminary visualisation work, are encouraging for the ability to detect
complex human traits.

 <dc:description>  Steganography is the art of hiding data, in such a way that it is
undetectable under traffic-pattern analysis and the data hidden is only known
to the receiver and the sender. In this paper new method of text steganography
over the silence interval of audio in a video file, is presented. In the
proposed method first the audio signal is extracted from the video. After doing
audio enhancement, the data on the audio signal is steganographed using new
technique and then audio signal is rewritten in video file again.
http://www.learnrnd.com/All_latest_research_findings.php
  To enhance the security level we apply chaotic maps on arbitrary text.
Furthermore, the algorithm in this paper, gives a technique which states that
undetectable stegotext and cover-text has same probability distribution and no
statistical test can detect the presence of the hidden message.

  Moreover, hidden message does not affect the transmission rate of video file
at all.

 <dc:description>  We propose a simple discrete time semi-supervised graph embedding approach to
link prediction in dynamic networks. The learned embedding reflects information
from both the temporal and cross-sectional network structures, which is
performed by defining the loss function as a weighted sum of the supervised
loss from past dynamics and the unsupervised loss of predicting the
neighborhood context in the current network. Our model is also capable of
learning different embeddings for both formation and dissolution dynamics.
These key aspects contributes to the predictive performance of our model and we
provide experiments with three real--world dynamic networks showing that our
method is comparable to state of the art methods in link formation prediction
and outperforms state of the art baseline methods in link dissolution
prediction.

round trip time (RTT) is observed in lab trial as predicted in theory. The
achieved round trip time is around 5 times shorter compared with what is

 <dc:description>  We present a closed-form expression for the minimal delay that is achievable
in a setting that combines a buffer and an erasure code, used to mitigate the
packet delay variance. The erasure code is modeled according to the recent
information-theoretic results on finite block length codes. Evaluations reveal
that accurate knowledge of the network parameters is essential for optimal
operation. Moreover, it is shown that, when the network packet delay variance
is large, the buffer delay becomes negligible. Therefore, in this case the
delay budget should be spent mainly on the erasure code.

monitoring micro blogs like Tweets. The system detects emergency related
events, and classifies them into appropriate categories like &quot;fire&quot;,
&quot;accident&quot;, &quot;earthquake&quot;, etc. We demonstrate our ideas by classifying Twitter
posts in real time, visualizing the ongoing event on a map interface and
alerting users with options to contact relevant authorities, both online and
offline. We evaluate our classifiers for both the steps, i.e., emergency
detection and categorization, and obtain F-scores exceeding 70% and 90%,
respectively. We demonstrate Civique using a web interface and on an Android
application, in realtime, and show its use for both tweet detection and

 <dc:description>  The optimization of joint source and channel coding for a sequence of
numerous progressive packets is a challenging problem. Further, the problem
becomes more complicated if the space-time coding is also involved with the
optimization in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. This is because
the number of ways of jointly assigning channels codes and space-time codes to
progressive packets is much larger than that of solely assigning channel codes
to the packets. We are unaware of any feasible and complete solution for such
optimization of joint source, channel, and space-time coding of progressive
packets. This paper applies a parametric approach to address that complex joint
optimization problem in a MIMO system. We use the parametric methodology to
derive some useful theoretical results, and then exploit those results to
propose an optimization method where the joint assignment of channel codes and
space-time codes to the packets can be optimized in a packet-by-packet manner.
As a result, the computational complexity of the optimization is exponentially
reduced, compared to the conventional exhaustive search. The numerical results
show that the proposed method significantly improves the peak-signal-to-noise
ratio performance of the rate-based optimal solution in a MIMO system.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the logical foundations of hyperproperties. Hyperproperties
generalize trace properties, which are sets of traces, to sets of sets of
traces. The most prominent application of hyperproperties is information flow
security: information flow policies characterize the secrecy and integrity of a
system by comparing two or more execution traces, for example by comparing the
observations made by an external observer on execution traces that result from
different values of a secret variable. In this paper, we establish the first
connection between temporal logics for hyperproperties and first-order logic.
Kamp's seminal theorem (in the formulation due to Gabbay et al.) states that
linear-time temporal logic (LTL) is expressively equivalent to first-order
logic over the natural numbers with order. We introduce first-order logic over
sets of traces and prove that HyperLTL, the extension of LTL to
hyperproperties, is strictly subsumed by this logic. We furthermore exhibit a
fragment that is expressively equivalent to HyperLTL, thereby establishing
Kamp's theorem for hyperproperties.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose an algorithm for path following control of the
nonholonomic mobile robot based on the idea of the guiding vector field (GVF).
The desired path may be an arbitrary smooth curve in its implicit form, that
is, a level set of a predefined smooth function. Using this function and the
robot's kinematic model, we design a GVF, whose integral curves converge to the
trajectory. A nonlinear motion controller is then proposed which steers the
robot along such an integral curve, bringing it to the desired path. We
establish global convergence conditions for our algorithm and demonstrate its
applicability and performance by experiments with real wheeled robots.

 <dc:description>  Linked Data technologies become increasingly important in many domains. Key
factors for their breakthrough are security and trust. Classical means for
access control lack granularity when parts of the Linked Data graph must be
protected. The WebID, combining semantic web concepts with methods from
certificate based authentication and authorization, seems promising to fulfill
all requirements concerning security and trust in the semantic web.
  In the PerSemID project, we challenged the WebID technology with a fully
implemented proof-of-concept (PoC) addressing a workflow coming from the domain
of lifelong learning and student mobility. In our use case of study enrollment,
we used WebIDs for authentication and to grant access to parts of triple
stores, during cross domain triple store interactions to exchange data between
stakeholders.

 <dc:description>  Social influence plays an important role in human behavior and decisions. The
sources of influence can be generally divided into external, which are
independent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and
friends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by
peers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and
observational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the
extent of social contagion based on large-scale observational data with an
unknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap
between the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human
dynamics and the detailed approach of the social sciences, we present a
parsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in
political science -- elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical
expression of the county vote-share distribution in a two party system, which
is in excellent agreement with 92 years of observed U.S. presidential election
data. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an
abrupt transition in the patterns of social contagion -- from low to high
levels of social contagion. The results from our analysis reveal robust
differences among regions of the United States in terms of their social
influence index. In particular, we identify two regions of 'hot' and 'cold
spots of social influence, each comprising states that are geographically
close. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more
instrumental in shaping large scale collective political behavior, which is at
the core of democratic societies.

 <dc:description>  According to the distributional inclusion hypothesis, entailment between
words can be measured via the feature inclusions of their distributional
vectors. In recent work, we showed how this hypothesis can be extended from
words to phrases and sentences in the setting of compositional distributional
semantics. This paper focuses on inclusion properties of tensors; its main
contribution is a theoretical and experimental analysis of how feature
inclusion works in different concrete models of verb tensors. We present
results for relational, Frobenius, projective, and holistic methods and compare
them to the simple vector addition, multiplication, min, and max models. The
degrees of entailment thus obtained are evaluated via a variety of existing
word-based measures, such as Weed's and Clarke's, KL-divergence, APinc,
balAPinc, and two of our previously proposed metrics at the phrase/sentence
level. We perform experiments on three entailment datasets, investigating which
version of tensor-based composition achieves the highest performance when
combined with the sentence-level measures.

 <dc:title>Theoretical Analysis of Domain Adaptation with Optimal Transport</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Domain adaptation (DA) is an important and emerging field of machine learning
that tackles the problem occurring when the distributions of training (source
domain) and test (target domain) data are similar but different. Current
theoretical results show that the efficiency of DA algorithms depends on their
capacity of minimizing the divergence between source and target probability
distributions. In this paper, we provide a theoretical study on the advantages
that concepts borrowed from optimal transportation theory can bring to DA. In
particular, we show that the Wasserstein metric can be used as a divergence
measure between distributions to obtain generalization guarantees for three
different learning settings: (i) classic DA with unsupervised target data (ii)
DA combining source and target labeled data, (iii) multiple source DA. Based on
the obtained results, we provide some insights showing when this analysis can
be tighter than other existing frameworks.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have seen an evolution of SDN control plane architectures,
starting from simple monolithic controllers, over modular monolithic
controllers, to distributed controllers. We observe, however, that today's
distributed controllers still exhibit inflexibility with respect to the
distribution of control logic. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture of a
distributed SDN controller in this paper, providing maximum flexibility with
respect to distribution.
  Our architecture splits control logic into light-weight control modules,
called controllets, based on a micro-kernel approach, reducing common
controllet functionality to a bare minimum and factoring out all higher-level
functionality. Light-weight controllets also allow for pushing control logic
onto switches to minimize latency and communication overhead. Controllets are
interconnected through a message bus supporting the publish/subscribe
communication paradigm with specific extensions for content-based OpenFlow
message filtering. Publish/subscribe allows for complete decoupling of
controllets to further facilitate control plane distribution.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new algorithm for detecting if a person is under
the influence of alcohol. This algorithm is based on number of pauses the
speaker makes by judging that if the number of pauses compared to the previous
recordings of the same person, which has been recorded beforehand, is higher.
If so the algorithm mark the speaker as drunk.

 <dc:description>  As the use of crowdsourcing increases, it is important to think about
performance optimization. For this purpose, it is possible to think about each
worker as a HPU(Human Processing Unit), and to draw inspiration from
performance optimization on traditional computers or cloud nodes with CPUs.
However, as we characterize HPUs in detail for this purpose, we find that there
are important differences between CPUs and HPUs, leading to the need for
completely new optimization algorithms.
  In this paper, we study the specific optimization problem of obtaining
results fastest for a crowd sourced job with a fixed total budget. In
crowdsourcing, jobs are usually broken down into sets of small tasks, which are
assigned to workers one at a time. We consider three scenarios of increasing
complexity: Identical Round Homogeneous tasks, Multiplex Round Homogeneous
tasks, and Multiple Round Heterogeneous tasks. For each scenario, we analyze
the stochastic behavior of the HPU clock-rate as a function of the remuneration
offered. After that, we develop an optimum Budget Allocation strategy to
minimize the latency for job completion. We validate our results through
extensive simulations and experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

 <dc:description>  We study the well-known two-dimensional strip packing problem. Given is a set
of rectangular axis-parallel items and a strip of width $W$ with infinite
height. The objective is to find a packing of these items into the strip, which
minimizes the packing height. Lately, it has been shown that the lower bound of
$3/2$ of the absolute approximation ratio can be beaten when we allow a
pseudo-polynomial running-time of type $(n W)^{f(1/\varepsilon)}$. If $W$ is
polynomially bounded by the number of items, this is a polynomial running-time.
We present a pseudo-polynomial algorithm with approximation ratio $4/3
+\varepsilon$ and running time $(n
W)^{1/\varepsilon^{\mathcal{O}(2^{1/\varepsilon})}}$.

 <dc:description>  Clark has defined the notion of $n$-avoidance basis which contains the
avoidable formulas with at most $n$ variables that are closest to be
unavoidable in some sense. The family $C_i$ of circular formulas is such that
$C_1=AA$, $C_2=ABA.BAB$, $C_3=ABCA.BCAB.CABC$ and so on. For every $i\le n$,
the $n$-avoidance basis contains $C_i$. Clark showed that the avoidability
index of every circular formula and of every formula in the $3$-avoidance basis
(and thus of every avoidable formula containing at most 3 variables) is at most
4. We determine exactly the avoidability index of these formulas.

 <dc:title>Hiring Expert Consultants in E-Healthcare With Budget Constraint</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The expert advices or consultancies by the expert consultants (ECs) for any
critical situation in healthcare are the most important event that occurs on a
daily basis in the hospitals. As the success of any critical operation (or
surgery) is heavily dependent on ECs, so they can be thought of as one of the
crucial elements of the healthcare domain. In many critical situations, there
may be a need to hire some ECs from outside of the hospital to provide their
expertise to the needy patient(s) that are in-house to the hospital. Earlier
this interesting situation of hiring ECs (mainly doctors) from outside of the
hospital has been studied under both monetary environment (with infinite
budget) and non-monetary environment (with zero budget). In this paper, a two
pass algorithm is proposed for the fixed budget case, for the first time, in
healthcare domain. In the first pass it is ensured that a substantial number of
ECs must be aware of this hiring concept, so that they can participate in the
bidding process and in the second pass, ECs are allocated to a patient
satisfying its budget limit and it is interesting to note that the proposed
algorithm satisfies truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget
feasibility. Through exhaustive simulations, we evaluate the performance and
validate our proposed mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  Uniform and affordable Internet is emerging as one of the fundamental civil
rights in developing countries. However in India, the connectivity is far from
uniform across the regions, where the disparity is evident in the
infrastructure, the cost of access and telecommunication services to provide
Internet facilities among different economic classes. In spite of having a
large mobile user base, the mobile Internet are still remarkably slower in some
of the developing countries. Especially in India, it falls below 50% even in
comparison with the performance of its developing counterparts!
  This essay presents a study of connectivity and performance trends based on
an exploratory analysis of mobile Internet measurement data from India. In
order to assess the state of mobile networks and its readiness in adopting the
different mobile standards (2G, 3G, and 4G) for commercial use, we discuss the
spread, penetration, interoperability and the congestion trends. Based on our
analysis, we argue that the network operators have taken negligible measures to
scale the mobile Internet. Affordable Internet is definitely for everyone. But,
the affordability of the Internet in terms of cost does not necessarily imply
the rightful access to Internet services.
  Chota recharge is possibly leading us to chota (shrunken) Internet!

 <dc:description>  Though the concept of sample mean in dynamic time warping (DTW) spaces is
used in pattern recognition applications, its existence has neither been proved
nor called into question. This article shows that a sample mean exists under
general conditions that cover common variations of different DTW-spaces
mentioned in the literature. The existence proofs are based on a Reduction
Theorem that bounds the length of the candidate solutions we need to consider.
The proposed results place the concept of sample mean in DTW-spaces on a sound
mathematical foundation and serves as a first step towards a statistical theory
of DTW-spaces.

 <dc:title>Persistent Contextual Values as Inter-Process Layers</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>H.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mobile applications today often fail to be context aware when they also need
to be customizable and efficient at run-time. Context-oriented programming
allows programmers to develop applications that are more context aware. Its
central construct, the so-called layer, however, is not customizable. We
propose to use novel persistent contextual values for mobile development.
Persistent contextual values automatically adapt their value to the context.
Furthermore they provide access without overhead. Key-value configuration files
contain the specification of contextual values and the persisted contextual
values themselves. By modifying the configuration files, the contextual values
can easily be customized for every context. From the specification, we generate
code to simplify development. Our implementation, called Elektra, permits
development in several languages including C++ and Java. In a benchmark we
compare layer activations between threads and between applications. In a case
study involving a web-server on a mobile embedded device the performance
overhead is minimal, even with many context switches.

 <dc:description>  The curse of outlier measurements in estimation problems is a well known
issue in a variety of fields. Therefore, outlier removal procedures, which
enables the identification of spurious measurements within a set, have been
developed for many different scenarios and applications. In this paper, we
propose a statistically motivated outlier removal algorithm for time
differences of arrival (TDOAs), or equivalently range differences (RD),
acquired at sensor arrays. The method exploits the TDOA-space formalism and
works by only knowing relative sensor positions. As the proposed method is
completely independent from the application for which measurements are used, it
can be reliably used to identify outliers within a set of TDOA/RD measurements
in different fields (e.g. acoustic source localization, sensor synchronization,
radar, remote sensing, etc.). The proposed outlier removal algorithm is
validated by means of synthetic simulations and real experiments.

 <dc:description>  Minimum Physical Hop (MPH) has been proposed as a peer selection algorithm
for decreasing inter-AS (Autonomous System) traffic volume in P2P live
streaming. In MPH, a newly joining peer selects a peer whose physical hop count
(i.e., the number of ASes traversed on the content delivery path) from it is
the minimum as its providing peer. However, MPH shows high inter-AS traffic
volume when the number of joining peers is large. In this paper, we propose
IMPH that tries to further decrease the inter-AS traffic volume by distributing
peers with one logical hop count (i.e., the number of peers or origin streaming
servers (OSSes) traversed on the content delivery path from an OSS to the peer)
to many ASes and encouraging the following peers to find their providing peers
within the same AS. Numerical examples show that IMPH achieves at the maximum
of 64% lower inter-AS traffic volume than MPH.

 <dc:description>  Image super-resolution (SR) is an underdetermined inverse problem, where a
large number of plausible high-resolution images can explain the same
downsampled image. Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk
minimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. However,
the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally
appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori
(MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under
the image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR
is non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from
samples. Furthermore, MAP inference is often performed via optimisation-based
iterative algorithms which don't compare well with the efficiency of
neural-network-based alternatives. Here we introduce new methods for amortised
MAP inference whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a
convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network
architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR
solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always
consistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this
architecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the
cross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models.
We propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates
gradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline
method using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior. Our experiments show
that the GAN based approach performs best on real image data. Lastly, we
establish a connection between GANs and amortised variational inference as in
e.g. variational autoencoders.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic linear bandits are a natural and simple generalisation of
finite-armed bandits with numerous practical applications. Current approaches
focus on generalising existing techniques for finite-armed bandits, notably the
optimism principle and Thompson sampling. While prior work has mostly been in
the worst-case setting, we analyse the asymptotic instance-dependent regret and
show matching upper and lower bounds on what is achievable. Surprisingly, our
results show that no algorithm based on optimism or Thompson sampling will ever
achieve the optimal rate, and indeed, can be arbitrarily far from optimal, even
in very simple cases. This is a disturbing result because these techniques are
standard tools that are widely used for sequential optimisation. For example,
for generalised linear bandits and reinforcement learning.

 <dc:description>  Big data processing is a hot topic in today's computer science world. There
is a significant demand for analysing big data to satisfy many requirements of
many industries. Emergence of the Kappa architecture created a strong
requirement for a highly capable and efficient data processing engine.
Therefore data processing engines such as Apache Flink and Apache Spark emerged
in open source world to fulfil that efficient and high performing data
processing requirement. There are many available benchmarks to evaluate those
two data processing engines. But complex deployment patterns and dependencies
make those benchmarks very difficult to reproduce by our own. This project has
two main goals. They are making few of community accepted benchmarks easily
reproducible on cloud and validate the performance claimed by those studies.

 <dc:description>  As Wireless Sensor Networks are penetrating into the industrial domain, many
research opportunities are emerging. One such essential and challenging
application is that of node localization. A feed-forward neural network based
methodology is adopted in this paper. The Received Signal Strength Indicator
(RSSI) values of the anchor node beacons are used. The number of anchor nodes
and their configurations has an impact on the accuracy of the localization
system, which is also addressed in this paper. Five different training
algorithms are evaluated to find the training algorithm that gives the best
result. The multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model was trained using
Matlab. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real
time, the model obtained was then implemented on the Arduino microcontroller.
With four anchor nodes, an average 2D localization error of 0.2953 m has been
achieved with a 12-12-2 neural network structure. The proposed method can also
be implemented on any other embedded microcontroller system.

 <dc:description>  A new system model reflecting the clustered structure of distributed storage
is suggested to investigate bandwidth requirements for repairing failed storage
nodes. Large data centers with multiple racks/disks or local networks of
storage devices (e.g. sensor network) are good applications of the suggested
clustered model. In realistic scenarios involving clustered storage structures,
repairing storage nodes using intact nodes residing in other clusters is more
bandwidth-consuming than restoring nodes based on information from
intra-cluster nodes. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between
intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair bandwidth in modeling
distributed storage. Capacity of the suggested model is obtained as a function
of fundamental resources of distributed storage systems, namely, storage
capacity, intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair bandwidth.
Based on the capacity expression, feasible sets of required resources which
enable reliable storage are analyzed. It is shown that the cross-cluster
traffic can be minimized to zero (i.e., intra-cluster local repair becomes
possible) by allowing extra resources on storage capacity and intra-cluster
repair bandwidth, according to a law specified in a closed-form. Moreover,
trade-off between cross-cluster traffic and intra-cluster traffic is observed
for sufficiently large storage capacity.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that load balancing and low delivery communication cost are
two critical issues in mapping requests to servers in Content Delivery Networks
(CDNs). However, the trade-off between these two performance metrics has not
been yet quantitatively investigated in designing efficient request mapping
schemes. In this work, we formalize this trade-off through a stochastic
optimization problem. While the solutions to the problem in the extreme cases
of minimum communication cost and optimum load balancing can be derived in
closed form, finding the general solution is hard to derive. Thus we propose
three heuristic mapping schemes and compare the trade-off performance of them
through extensive simulations.
  Our simulation results show that at the expense of high query cost, we can
achieve a good trade-off curve. Moreover, by benefiting from the power of
multiple choices phenomenon, we can achieve almost the same performance with
much less query cost. Finally, we can handle requests with different delay
requirements at the cost of degrading network performance.

 <dc:description>  We study a class of optimization problems in which the objective function is
given by the sum of a differentiable but possibly nonconvex component and a
nondifferentiable convex regularization term. We introduce an auxiliary
variable to separate the objective function components and utilize the Moreau
envelope of the regularization term to derive the proximal augmented Lagrangian
$-$ a continuously differentiable function obtained by constraining the
augmented Lagrangian to the manifold that corresponds to the explicit
minimization over the variable in the nonsmooth term. This function is used to
develop customized algorithms based on the method of multipliers (MM) and a
primal-descent dual-ascent gradient method in order to compute optimal
primal-dual pairs. Our customized MM algorithm is applicable to a broader class
of problems than proximal gradient methods and it has stronger convergence
guarantees and a more refined step-size update rules than the alternating
direction method of multipliers. These features make it an attractive option
for solving structured optimal control problems. When the differentiable
component of the objective function is (strongly) convex and the regularization
term is convex, we prove (exponential) asymptotic convergence of the
primal-descent dual-ascent algorithm. Finally, we solve the edge addition in
directed consensus networks and optimal placement problems to demonstrate the
merits and the effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analyze 2CNF formulas from the perspectives of Read-Once
resolution (ROR) refutation schemes. We focus on two types of ROR refutations,
viz., variable-once refutation and clause-once refutation. In the former, each
variable may be used at most once in the derivation of a refutation, while in
the latter, each clause may be used at most once. We show that the problem of
checking whether a given 2CNF formula has an ROR refutation under both schemes
is NP-complete. This is surprising in light of the fact that there exist
polynomial refutation schemes (tree-resolution and DAG-resolution) for 2CNF
formulas. On the positive side, we show that 2CNF formulas have copy-complexity
2, which means that any unsatisfiable 2CNF formula has a refutation in which
any clause needs to be used at most twice.

 <dc:description>  A user wants to retrieve a file from a database without revealing the
identity of the file retrieved at the database, which is known as the problem
of private information retrieval (PIR). If it is further required that the user
obtains no information about the database other than the desired file, the
concept of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) is introduced to
guarantee privacy for both parties. In this paper, the problem of SPIR is
studied for a database stored among $N$ nodes in a distributed way, by using an
$(N,M)$-MDS storage code. The information-theoretic capacity of SPIR, defined
as the maximum number of symbols of the desired file retrieved per downloaded
symbol, for the coded database is derived. It is shown that the SPIR capacity
for coded database is $1-\frac{M}{N}$, when the amount of the shared common
randomness of distributed nodes (unavailable at the user) is at least
$\frac{M}{N-M}$ times the file size. Otherwise, the SPIR capacity for the coded
database equals zero.

 <dc:description>  Recent developments in elastic shape analysis (ESA) are motivated by the fact
that it provides comprehensive frameworks for simultaneous registration,
deformation, and comparison of shapes. These methods achieve computational
efficiency using certain square-root representations that transform invariant
elastic metrics into Euclidean metrics, allowing for applications of standard
algorithms and statistical tools. For analyzing shapes of embeddings of
$\mathbb{S}^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, Jermyn et al. introduced square-root normal
fields (SRNFs) that transformed an elastic metric, with desirable invariant
properties, into the $\mathbb{L}^2$ metric. These SRNFs are essentially surface
normals scaled by square-roots of infinitesimal area elements. A critical need
in shape analysis is to invert solutions (deformations, averages, modes of
variations, etc) computed in the SRNF space, back to the original surface space
for visualizations and inferences. Due to the lack of theory for understanding
SRNFs maps and their inverses, we take a numerical approach and derive an
efficient multiresolution algorithm, based on solving an optimization problem
in the surface space, that estimates surfaces corresponding to given SRNFs.
This solution is found effective, even for complex shapes, e.g. human bodies
and animals, that undergo significant deformations including bending and
stretching. Specifically, we use this inversion for computing elastic shape
deformations, transferring deformations, summarizing shapes, and for finding
modes of variability in a given collection, while simultaneously registering
the surfaces. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms using a statistical
analysis of human body shapes, classification of generic surfaces and analysis
of brain structures.

 <dc:title>On Duality Of Multiple Target Tracking and Segmentation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tian, Yicong</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditionally, object tracking and segmentation are treated as two separate
problems and solved independently. However, in this paper, we argue that
tracking and segmentation are actually closely related and solving one should
help the other. On one hand, the object track, which is a set of bounding boxes
with one bounding box in every frame, would provide strong high-level guidance
for the target/background segmentation task. On the other hand, the object
segmentation would separate object from other objects and background, which
will be useful for determining track locations in every frame. We propose a
novel framework which combines online multiple target tracking and segmentation
in a video. In our approach, the tracking and segmentation problems are coupled
by Lagrange dual decomposition, which leads to more accurate segmentation
results and also \emph{helps resolve typical difficulties in multiple target
tracking, such as occlusion handling, ID-switch and track drifting}. To track
targets, an individual appearance model is learned for each target via
structured learning and network flow is employed to generate tracks from
densely sampled candidates. For segmentation, multi-label Conditional Random
Field (CRF) is applied to a superpixel based spatio-temporal graph in a segment
of video to assign background or target labels to every superpixel. The
experiments on diverse sequences show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches for multiple target tracking as well as
segmentation.

 <dc:title>Computing the K-terminal Reliability of Circle Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lin, Min-Sheng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Chien-Min</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let G denote a graph and let K be a subset of vertices that are a set of
target vertices of G. The K-terminal reliability of G is defined as the
probability that all target vertices in K are connected, considering the
possible failures of non-target vertices of G. The problem of computing
K-terminal reliability is known to be #P-complete for polygon-circle graphs,
and can be solved in polynomial-time for t-polygon graphs, which are a subclass
of polygon-circle graphs. The class of circle graphs is a subclass of
polygon-circle graphs and a superclass of t-polygon graphs. Therefore, the
problem of computing K-terminal reliability for circle graphs is of particular
interest. This paper proves that the problem remains #P-complete even for
circle graphs. Additionally, this paper proposes a linear-time algorithm for
solving the problem for proper circular-arc graphs, which are a subclass of
circle graphs and a superclass of proper interval graphs.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a scheme that provides an analytical estimate for
the time-dependent degree distribution of some networks. This scheme maps the
problem into a random walk in degree space, and then we choose the paths that
are responsible for the dominant contributions. The method is illustrated on
the dynamical versions of the Erd\&quot;os-R\'enyi and Watts-Strogatz graphs, which
were introduced as static models in the original formulation. We have succeeded
in obtaining an analytical form for the dynamics Watts-Strogatz model, which is
asymptotically exact for some regimes.

 <dc:description>  We propose a scalable method for forward stochastic reachability analysis for
uncontrolled linear systems with affine disturbance. Our method uses Fourier
transforms to efficiently compute the forward stochastic reach probability
measure (density) and the forward stochastic reach set. This method is
applicable to systems with bounded or unbounded disturbance sets. We also
examine the convexity properties of the forward stochastic reach set and its
probability density. Motivated by the problem of a robot attempting to capture
a stochastically moving, non-adversarial target, we demonstrate our method on
two simple examples. Where traditional approaches provide approximations, our
method provides exact analytical expressions for the densities and probability
of capture.

 <dc:description>  Consonance is related to the perception of pleasantness arising from a
combination of sounds and has been approached quantitatively using mathematical
relations, physics, information theory, and psychoacoustics. Tonal consonance
is present in timbre, musical tuning, harmony, and melody, and it is used for
conveying sensations, perceptions, and emotions in music. It involves the
physical properties of sound waves and is used to study melody and harmony
through musical intervals and chords. From the perspective of complexity, the
macroscopic properties of a system with many parts frequently rely on the
statistical properties of its constituent elements. Here we show how the tonal
consonance parameters for complex tones can be used to study complexity in
music. We apply this formalism to melody, showing that melodic lines in musical
pieces can be described in terms of the physical properties of melodic
intervals and the existence of an entropy extremalization principle subject to
psychoacoustic macroscopic constraints with musical meaning. This result
connects the human perception of consonance with the complexity of human
creativity in music through the physical properties of the musical stimulus.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples formed by
applying small carefully chosen perturbations to inputs that cause unexpected
classification errors. In this paper, we perform experiments on various
adversarial example generation approaches with multiple deep convolutional
neural networks including Residual Networks, the best performing models on
ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2015. We compare the
adversarial example generation techniques with respect to the quality of the
produced images, and measure the robustness of the tested machine learning
models to adversarial examples. Finally, we conduct large-scale experiments on
cross-model adversarial portability. We find that adversarial examples are
mostly transferable across similar network topologies, and we demonstrate that
better machine learning models are less vulnerable to adversarial examples.

manuscript focuses on Big Data analytics in cloud environment using Hadoop. We
have classified the Big Data according to its characteristics like Volume,
Value, Variety and Velocity. We have made various nodes to process the data
based on their volume, velocity, value and variety. In this work we have
classify the input data and routed to various processing node. At the last
after processing from each node, we can combine the output of all nodes to get
the final result. We have used Hadoop to partition the data as well as process
it.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the generalization error of invariant classifiers. In
particular, we consider the common scenario where the classification task is
invariant to certain transformations of the input, and that the classifier is
constructed (or learned) to be invariant to these transformations. Our approach
relies on factoring the input space into a product of a base space and a set of
transformations. We show that whereas the generalization error of a
non-invariant classifier is proportional to the complexity of the input space,
the generalization error of an invariant classifier is proportional to the
complexity of the base space. We also derive a set of sufficient conditions on
the geometry of the base space and the set of transformations that ensure that
the complexity of the base space is much smaller than the complexity of the
input space. Our analysis applies to general classifiers such as convolutional
neural networks. We demonstrate the implications of the developed theory for
such classifiers with experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

 <dc:description>  Kernel alignment measures the degree of similarity between two kernels. In
this paper, inspired from kernel alignment, we propose a new Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) formulation, kernel alignment LDA (kaLDA). We first
define two kernels, data kernel and class indicator kernel. The problem is to
find a subspace to maximize the alignment between subspace-transformed data
kernel and class indicator kernel. Surprisingly, the kernel alignment induced
kaLDA objective function is very similar to classical LDA and can be expressed
using between-class and total scatter matrices. This can be extended to
multi-label data. We use a Stiefel-manifold gradient descent algorithm to solve
this problem. We perform experiments on 8 single-label and 6 multi-label data
sets. Results show that kaLDA has very good performance on many single-label
and multi-label problems.

 <dc:description>  Data Mining is the process of examining the information from different point
of view and compressing it for the relevant data. This data can also be
utilized to build the incomes. Data Mining is also known as Data or Knowledge
Discovery. The basic purpose of data mining is to search patterns which have
minimal user inputs and efforts. Data Mining plays a very crucial role in the
various fields. There are various data mining procedures which can be connected
in different fields of innovation. By using data mining techniques, it is
observed that less time is taken for the prediction of any disease with more
accuracy. In this paper we would review various data mining techniques which
are categorized under classification, regression and clustering and apply these
algorithms over an ECG dataset. The purpose of this work is to determine the
most suitable data mining technique and use it to improve the accuracy of
analyzing ECG data for better decision making.

 <dc:description>  Advances in optical neuroimaging techniques now allow neural activity to be
recorded with cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. Brain motion
in these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons
must be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity
traces. Recordings from small invertebrates like C. elegans are especially
challenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during
animal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to
reliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the
brain of a freely moving C. elegans undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D
volumetric fluorescent images of the animal's brain are straightened, aligned
and registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via
segmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new
time-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector
Encoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match
each segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from
throughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references
defines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each
neuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to
correct errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities.
The Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well
suited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations. When
applied to whole-brain calcium imaging recordings in freely moving C. elegans,
this analysis pipeline located 150 neurons for the duration of an 8 minute
recording and consistently found more neurons more quickly than manual or
semi-automated approaches.

 <dc:description>  Various alignment problems arising in cryo-electron microscopy, community
detection, time synchronization, computer vision, and other fields fall into a
common framework of synchronization problems over compact groups such as Z/L,
U(1), or SO(3). The goal of such problems is to estimate an unknown vector of
group elements given noisy relative observations. We present an efficient
iterative algorithm to solve a large class of these problems, allowing for any
compact group, with measurements on multiple 'frequency channels' (Fourier
modes, or more generally, irreducible representations of the group). Our
algorithm is a highly efficient iterative method following the blueprint of
approximate message passing (AMP), which has recently arisen as a central
technique for inference problems such as structured low-rank estimation and
compressed sensing. We augment the standard ideas of AMP with ideas from
representation theory so that the algorithm can work with distributions over
compact groups. Using standard but non-rigorous methods from statistical
physics we analyze the behavior of our algorithm on a Gaussian noise model,
identifying phases where the problem is easy, (computationally) hard, and
(statistically) impossible. In particular, such evidence predicts that our
algorithm is information-theoretically optimal in many cases, and that the
remaining cases show evidence of statistical-to-computational gaps.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the increasing demand and complexity of networks, factors such as
balancing the load, improving the performance, reducing delay and finding
optimal path between nodes in a computer network have become crucial. The
traditional routing approaches are not able to perform up to the mark as they
do not take into account factors such as reducing delay and adaptive nature.
Thus there is a need for more sophisticated techniques to meet the current
network problems. This paper focuses on Ant-net algorithm based on Ant colony
optimization which is an adaptive routing algorithm.In this approach, models of
collective intelligence are transformed into optimization techniques. The ants
travel across various paths in the network, thus depositing of pheromone,
collecting route information and congestion. In this paper the Ant-Net
algorithm along the important data structures required has been discussed and
it is implemented on a simple packet switch network. The simulations describe
the adaptive nature of the algorithm

 <dc:description>  We report on the development of the HoTT library, a formalization of homotopy
type theory in the Coq proof assistant. It formalizes most of basic homotopy
type theory, including univalence, higher inductive types, and significant
amounts of synthetic homotopy theory, as well as category theory and
modalities. The library has been used as a basis for several independent
developments. We discuss the decisions that led to the design of the library,
and we comment on the interaction of homotopy type theory with recently
introduced features of Coq, such as universe polymorphism and private inductive
types.

 <dc:description>  Enterprise level software is implemented using multi-layer architecture.
These layers are often implemented using de-coupled solutions with millions of
lines of code. Programmers often have to track and debug a function call from
user interface layer to the data access layer while troubleshooting an issue.
They have to inspect the code based on search results or use design documents
to construct the call graph. This process is time consuming and laborious. The
development environment tools are insufficient or confined to analyzing only
the code in the loaded solution. This paper proposes a method to construct a
call graph of the call across several layers of the code residing in different
code bases to help programmers better understand the design and architecture of
the software. The signatures of class, methods, and properties were evaluated
and then matched against the code files. A graph of matching functions was
created. The recursive search stopped when there were no matches or the data
layer code was detected. The method resulted in 78.26% accuracy when compared
with manual search.

 <dc:description>  Global Route-Planning Algorithms (GRPA) are required to compute paths between
several points located on Earth's surface. A geodesic algorithm is employed as
an auxiliary tool, increasing the precision of distance calculations. This work
presents a novel simulator for GRPA, which compares and evaluates three GRPAs
implemented to solve the shortest path problem for points located at different
cities: A*, LPA*, and D*Lite. The performance of each algorithm is investigated
with a set of experiments, which are executed to check the answers provided by
the algorithms and to compare their execution time. It is shown that GRPAs
implementations with consistent heuristics lead to optimal paths. The
noticeable differences among those algorithms are related to the time execution
after successive executions.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel distribution-free approach, the data-driven threshold
machine (DTM), for a fundamental problem at the core of many learning tasks:
choose a threshold for a given pre-specified level that bounds the tail
probability of the maximum of a (possibly dependent but stationary) random
sequence. We do not assume data distribution, but rather relying on the
asymptotic distribution of extremal values, and reduce the problem to estimate
three parameters of the extreme value distributions and the extremal index. We
specially take care of data dependence via estimating extremal index since in
many settings, such as scan statistics, change-point detection, and extreme
bandits, where dependence in the sequence of statistics can be significant. Key
features of our DTM also include robustness and the computational efficiency,
and it only requires one sample path to form a reliable estimate of the
threshold, in contrast to the Monte Carlo sampling approach which requires
drawing a large number of sample paths. We demonstrate the good performance of
DTM via numerical examples in various dependent settings.

 <dc:description>  Theoretical constructs of logical gates implemented with plant roots are
morphological computing asynchronous devices. Values of Boolean variables are
represented by plant roots. A presence of a plant root at a given site
symbolises the logical {\sc True}, an absence the logical {\sc False}. Logical
functions are calculated via interaction between roots. Two types of
two-inputs-two-outputs gates are proposed: a gate $\langle x, y \rangle
\rightarrow \langle xy, x+y \rangle$ where root apexes are guided by gravity
and a gate $\langle x, y \rangle \rightarrow \langle \overline{x}y, x \rangle$
where root apexes are guided by humidity. We propose a design of binary
half-adder based on the gates.

 <dc:description>  A three-dimensional multi-scale computational homogenisation framework is
developed for the prediction of nonlinear micro/meso-mechanical response of the
fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Two dominant damage mechanisms, i.e.
matrix elasto-plastic response and fibre-matrix decohesion are considered and
modelled using a non-associative pressure dependent paraboloidal yield
criterion and cohesive interface elements respectively. A linear-elastic
transversely isotropic material model is used to model yarns/fibres within the
representative volume element (RVE). A unified approach is used to impose the
RVE boundary conditions, which allows convenient switching between linear
displacement, uniform traction and periodic boundary conditions. The
computational model is implemented within the framework of the hierarchic
finite element, which permits the use of arbitrary orders of approximation.
Furthermore, the computational framework is designed to take advantage of
distributed memory high-performance computing. The accuracy and performance of
the computational framework are demonstrated with a variety of numerical
examples, including unidirectional FRP composite, a composite comprising a
multi-fibre and multi-layer RVE, with randomly generated fibres, and a single
layered plain weave textile composite. Results are validated against the
reference experimental/numerical results from the literature. The computational
framework is also used to study the effect of matrix and fibre-matrix
interfaces properties on the homogenised stress-strain responses.

 <dc:description>  Cloud-based Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is a promising architecture for
future cellular networks, in which Baseband Units (BBUs) are placed at a
centralized location, with capacity-constrained fronthaul connected to multiple
distributed Remote Radio Units (RRHs) that are far away from the BBUs. The
centralization of signal processing enables the flexibility for coordinated
multi-point transmission (CoMP) to meet high traffic demand of users. We
investigate how to jointly optimize CoMP-cell selection and base station
resource allocation so as to enhance the quality of service (QoS), subject to
the fronthaul capacity constraint in orthogonal frequency-division multiple
access (OFDMA) based C-RAN. The problem is proved to be NP-hard in this paper.
To deal with the computational complexity, we derive a partial optimality
condition as the foundation for designing a cell-selection algorithm. Besides,
we provide a solution method of the optimum of the time-frequency resource
allocation problem without loss of fairness on the QoS enhancement of all
users. The simulations show good performance of the proposed algorithms for
jointly optimizing the cell selection and resource allocation in a C-RAN, with
respect to QoS.

 <dc:description>  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a widely-used supervised dimensionality
reduction method in computer vision and pattern recognition. In null space
based LDA (NLDA), a well-known LDA extension, between-class distance is
maximized in the null space of the within-class scatter matrix. However, there
are some limitations in NLDA. Firstly, for many data sets, null space of
within-class scatter matrix does not exist, thus NLDA is not applicable to
those datasets. Secondly, NLDA uses arithmetic mean of between-class distances
and gives equal consideration to all between-class distances, which makes
larger between-class distances can dominate the result and thus limits the
performance of NLDA. In this paper, we propose a harmonic mean based Linear
Discriminant Analysis, Multi-Class Discriminant Analysis (MCDA), for image
classification, which minimizes the reciprocal of weighted harmonic mean of
pairwise between-class distance. More importantly, MCDA gives higher priority
to maximize small between-class distances. MCDA can be extended to multi-label
dimension reduction. Results on 7 single-label data sets and 4 multi-label data
sets show that MCDA has consistently better performance than 10 other
single-label approaches and 4 other multi-label approaches in terms of
classification accuracy, macro and micro average F1 score.

 <dc:description>  We consider a set-up in which there are multiple servers and multiple clients
in a large distributed computing system. Clients request servers to process
jobs. Servers can only process one job in unit time. There is no coordinating
agent to route client requests to servers, and clients choose servers
independently and simultaneously, and only have access to the outcomes of their
own past requests. If more than one clients choose the same server, then only
one randomly chosen client's requests will be fulfilled. If some servers do not
receive any request, they remain idle. In this paper, we show that a large
category of strategies are not effective in terms of server utilization. We
devise strategies for clients that improve server utilization of such systems
over those of strategies known in the current literature.

 <dc:title>Refinement Reflection (or, how to turn your favorite language into a

 <dc:description>  Refinement Reflection turns your favorite programming language into a proof
assistant by reflecting the code implementing a user-defined function into the
function's (output) refinement type. As a consequence, at uses of the function,
the function definition is unfolded into the refinement logic in a precise,
predictable and most importantly, programmer controllable way. In the logic, we
encode functions and lambdas using uninterpreted symbols preserving SMT-based
decidable verification. In the language, we provide a library of combinators
that lets programmers compose proofs from basic refinements and function
definitions. We have implemented our approach in the Liquid Haskell system,
thereby converting Haskell into an interactive proof assistant, that we used to
verify a variety of properties ranging from arithmetic properties of higher
order, recursive functions to the Monoid, Applicative, Functor and Monad type
class laws for a variety of instances.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the joint optimization problem of two-way relay
beamforming, the receiver power splitting (PS) ratio as well as the transmit
power at the sources to maximize the achievable sum-rate of a simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with a full-duplex (FD)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify and forward (AF) relay, assuming
perfect channel state information (CSI). In particular, our contribution is an
iterative algorithm based on the difference of convex programming (DC) and one
dimensional searching to achieve the joint solution. Simulation results are
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We consider multi-class classification where the predictor has a hierarchical
structure that allows for a very large number of labels both at train and test
time. The predictive power of such models can heavily depend on the structure
of the tree, and although past work showed how to learn the tree structure, it
expected that the feature vectors remained static. We provide a novel algorithm
to simultaneously perform representation learning for the input data and
learning of the hierarchi- cal predictor. Our approach optimizes an objec- tive
function which favors balanced and easily- separable multi-way node partitions.
We theoret- ically analyze this objective, showing that it gives rise to a
boosting style property and a bound on classification error. We next show how
to extend the algorithm to conditional density estimation. We empirically
validate both variants of the al- gorithm on text classification and language
mod- eling, respectively, and show that they compare favorably to common
baselines in terms of accu- racy and running time.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present and evaluate a parallel algorithm for solving a
minimum spanning tree (MST) problem for supercomputers with distributed memory.
The algorithm relies on the relaxation of the message processing order
requirement for one specific message type compared to the original GHS
(Gallager, Humblet, Spira) algorithm. Our algorithm adopts hashing and message
compression optimization techniques as well. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first parallel implementation of the GHS algorithm that linearly scales
to more than 32 nodes (256 cores) of Infiniband cluster.

 <dc:description>  Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. While curable with early
detection, only highly trained specialists are capable of accurately
recognizing the disease. As expertise is in limited supply, automated systems
capable of identifying disease could save lives, reduce unnecessary biopsies,
and reduce costs. Toward this goal, we propose a system that combines recent
developments in deep learning with established machine learning approaches,
creating ensembles of methods that are capable of segmenting skin lesions, as
well as analyzing the detected area and surrounding tissue for melanoma
detection. The system is evaluated using the largest publicly available
benchmark dataset of dermoscopic images, containing 900 training and 379
testing images. New state-of-the-art performance levels are demonstrated,
leading to an improvement in the area under receiver operating characteristic
curve of 7.5% (0.843 vs. 0.783), in average precision of 4% (0.649 vs. 0.624),
and in specificity measured at the clinically relevant 95% sensitivity
operating point 2.9 times higher than the previous state-of-the-art (36.8%
specificity compared to 12.5%). Compared to the average of 8 expert
dermatologists on a subset of 100 test images, the proposed system produces a
higher accuracy (76% vs. 70.5%), and specificity (62% vs. 59%) evaluated at an
equivalent sensitivity (82%).

 <dc:description>  Real life data often includes information from different channels. For
example, in computer vision, we can describe an image using different image
features, such as pixel intensity, color, HOG, GIST feature, SIFT features,
etc.. These different aspects of the same objects are often called multi-view
(or multi-modal) data. Low-rank regression model has been proved to be an
effective learning mechanism by exploring the low-rank structure of real life
data. But previous low-rank regression model only works on single view data. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view low-rank regression model by imposing
low-rank constraints on multi-view regression model. Most importantly, we
provide a closed-form solution to the multi-view low-rank regression model.
Extensive experiments on 4 multi-view datasets show that the multi-view
low-rank regression model outperforms single-view regression model and reveals
that multi-view low-rank structure is very helpful.

 <dc:title>New Hardness Results for the Permanent Using Linear Optics</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 2011, Aaronson gave a striking proof, based on quantum linear optics,
showing that the problem of computing the permanent of a matrix is #P-hard.
Aaronson's proof led naturally to hardness of approximation results for the
permanent, and it was arguably simpler than Valiant's seminal proof of the same
fact in 1979. Nevertheless, it did not prove that computing the permanent was
#P-hard for any class of matrices which was not previously known. In this
paper, we present a collection of new results about matrix permanents that are
derived primarily via these linear optical techniques.
  First, we show that the problem of computing the permanent of a real
orthogonal matrix is #P-hard. Much like Aaronson's original proof, this will
show that even a multiplicative approximation remains #P-hard to compute. The
hardness result even translates to permanents over finite fields, where the
problem of computing the permanent of an orthogonal matrix is ModpP-hard in the
finite field F_{p^4} for all primes p not equal to 2 or 3. Interestingly, this
characterization is tight: in fields of characteristic 2, the permanent
coincides with the determinant; in fields of characteristic 3, one can
efficiently compute the permanent of an orthogonal matrix by a nontrivial
result of Kogan.
  Finally, we use more elementary arguments to prove #P-hardness for the
permanent of a positive semidefinite matrix, which shows that certain
probabilities of boson sampling experiments with thermal states are hard to
compute exactly despite the fact that they can be efficiently sampled by a
classical computer.

 <dc:description>  Automatic extraction of road curbs from uneven, unorganized, noisy and
massive 3D point clouds is a challenging task. Existing methods often project
3D point clouds onto 2D planes to extract curbs. However, the projection causes
loss of 3D information which degrades the performance of the detection. This
paper presents a robust, accurate and efficient method to extract road curbs
from 3D mobile LiDAR point clouds. Our method consists of two steps: 1)
extracting the candidate points of curbs based on the proposed novel energy
function and 2) refining the candidate points using the proposed least cost
path model. We evaluated our method on a large-scale of residential area
(16.7GB, 300 million points) and an urban area (1.07GB, 20 million points)
mobile LiDAR point clouds. Results indicate that the proposed method is
superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness, accuracy and
efficiency. The proposed curb extraction method achieved a completeness of
78.62% and a correctness of 83.29%. These experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method is a promising solution to extract road curbs from mobile LiDAR
point clouds.

 <dc:description>  Social influence among users (e.g., collaboration on a project) creates
bursty behavior in the underlying high performance computing (HPC) workloads.
Using representative HPC and cluster workload logs, this paper identifies,
analyzes, and quantifies the level of social influence across HPC users. We
show the existence of a social graph that is characterized by a pattern of
dominant users and followers. This pattern also follows a power-law
distribution, which is consistent with those observed in mainstream social
networks. Given its potential impact on HPC workloads prediction and
scheduling, we propose a fast-converging, computationally-efficient online
learning algorithm for identifying social groups. Extensive evaluation shows
that our online algorithm can (1) quickly identify the social relationships by
using a small portion of incoming jobs and (2) can efficiently track group
evolution over time.

 <dc:title>ExpressPass: End-to-End Credit-based Congestion Control for Datacenters</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  As link speeds increase in datacenter networks, existing congestion control
algorithms become less effective in providing fast convergence. TCP-based
algorithms that probe for bandwidth take a long time to reach the fair-share
and lead to long flow completion times. An ideal congestion control algorithms
for datacenter must provide 1) zero data loss, 2) fast convergence, and 3) low
buffer occupancy. However, these requirements present conflicting goals. For
fast convergence,flows must ramp up quickly, but this risks packet losses and
large queues. Thus, even the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as TIMELY and
DCQCN, rely on link layer flow control (e.g.,Priority-based Flow Control) to
achieve zero loss. This paper presents a new approach, called ExpressPass, an
end-to-end credit-based congestion control algorithm for datacenters.
ExpressPass is inspired by credit-based flow control, but extends it to work
end-to-end. The switches control the amount of credit packets by rate limiting
and ensure data packets flow in the reverse direction without any loss.
ExpressPass leverages this to ramp up aggressively. ExpressPass converges up to
80 times faster than DCTCP at 10Gbps link, and the gap increases as link speeds
become faster. Our simulation with realistic workload shows that ExpressPass
significantly reduces the flow completion time especially for small and medium
size flows compared to DCTCP, HULL, and DX.

 <dc:description>  A novel non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based subband decomposition
in frequency spatial domain for acoustic source localization using a microphone
array is introduced. The proposed method decomposes source and noise subband
and emphasises source dominant frequency bins for more accurate source
representation. By employing NMF, delay basis vectors and their subband
information in frequency spatial domain for each frame is extracted. The
proposed algorithm is evaluated in both simulated noise and real noise with a

algorithm performs more accurately than other conventional algorithms under

 <dc:description>  Increase in image resolution require the ability of image sensors to pack an
increased number of circuit components in a given area. On the the other hand a
high speed processing of signals from the sensors require the ability of pixel
to carry out pixel parallel operations. In the paper, we propose a modified 3T
and 4T CMOS wide dynamic range pixels, which we refer as 2T-M and 3T-M
configurations, comprising of MOSFETS and memristors. The low leakage currents
and low area of memristors helps to achieve the objective of reducing the area,
while the possibility to create arrays of memristors and MOSFETs across
different layers within the chip, ensure the possibility to scale the circuit
architecture.

 <dc:title>Reasoning in the Bernays-Schoenfinkel-Ramsey Fragment of Separation
  Logic</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Separation Logic (SL) is a well-known assertion language used in Hoare-style
modular proof systems for programs with dynamically allocated data structures.
In this paper we investigate the fragment of first-order SL restricted to the
Bernays-Schoenfinkel-Ramsey quantifier prefix $\exists^*\forall^*$, where the
quantified variables range over the set of memory locations. When this set is
uninterpreted (has no associated theory) the fragment is PSPACE-complete, which
matches the complexity of the quantifier-free fragment. However, SL becomes
undecidable when the quantifier prefix belongs to $\exists^*\forall^*\exists^*$
instead, or when the memory locations are interpreted as integers with linear
arithmetic constraints, thus setting a sharp boundary for decidability within
SL. We have implemented a decision procedure for the decidable fragment of
$\exists^*\forall^*$SL as a specialized solver inside a DPLL($T$) architecture,
within the CVC4 SMT solver. The evaluation of our implementation was carried
out using two sets of verification conditions, produced by (i) unfolding
inductive predicates, and (ii) a weakest precondition-based verification
condition generator. Experimental data shows that automated quantifier
instantiation has little overhead, compared to manual model-based
instantiation.

 <dc:title>A $2\ell k$ Kernel for $\ell$-Component Order Connectivity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kumar, Mithilesh</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lokshtanov, Daniel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the $\ell$-Component Order Connectivity problem ($\ell \in \mathbb{N}$),
we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and a non-negative integer
$k$ and asks whether there exists a set of vertices $S\subseteq V(G)$ such that
$|S|\leq k$ and the size of the largest connected component in $G-S$ is at most
$\ell$. In this paper, we give a kernel for $\ell$-Component Order Connectivity
with at most $2\ell k$ vertices that takes $n^{\mathcal{O}(\ell)}$ time for
every constant $\ell$. On the way to obtaining our kernel, we prove a
generalization of the $q$-Expansion Lemma to weighted graphs. This
generalization may be of independent interest.

 <dc:title>A Near-Linear Pseudopolynomial Time Algorithm for Subset Sum</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>

 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a set $Z$ of $n$ positive integers and a target value $t$, the Subset
Sum problem asks whether any subset of $Z$ sums to $t$. A textbook
pseudopolynomial time algorithm by Bellman from 1957 solves Subset Sum in time
$O(nt)$. This has been improved to $O(n \max Z)$ by Pisinger [J. Algorithms'99]
and recently to $\tilde O(\sqrt{n} t)$ by Koiliaris and Xu [SODA'17].
  Here we present a simple randomized algorithm running in time $\tilde
O(n+t)$. This improves upon a classic algorithm and is likely to be
near-optimal, since it matches conditional lower bounds from Set Cover and
k-Clique.
  We then use our new algorithm and additional tricks to improve the best known
polynomial space solution from time $\tilde O(n^3 t)$ and space $\tilde O(n^2)$
to time $\tilde O(nt)$ and space $\tilde O(n \log t)$, assuming the Extended
Riemann Hypothesis. Unconditionally, we obtain time $\tilde O(n
t^{1+\varepsilon})$ and space $\tilde O(n t^\varepsilon)$ for any constant
$\varepsilon &gt; 0$.

 <dc:description>  In this short note we propose a new approach for the design and analysis of
randomized gossip algorithms which can be used to solve the average consensus
problem. We show how that Randomized Block Kaczmarz (RBK) method - a method for
solving linear systems - works as gossip algorithm when applied to a special
system encoding the underlying network. The famous pairwise gossip algorithm
arises as a special case. Subsequently, we reveal a hidden duality of
randomized gossip algorithms, with the dual iterative process maintaining a set
of numbers attached to the edges as opposed to nodes of the network. We prove
that RBK obtains a superlinear speedup in the size of the block, and
demonstrate this effect through experiments.

 <dc:description>  The article deals with the issue of modification of metric classification
algorithms. In particular, it studies the algorithm k-Nearest Neighbours for
its application to sequential data. A method of generalization of metric
classification algorithms is proposed. As a part of it, there has been
developed an algorithm for solving the problem of classification and labelling
of sequential data. The advantages of the developed algorithm of classification
in comparison with the existing one are also discussed in the article. There is
a comparison of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with the algorithm
of CRF in the task of chunking in the open data set CoNLL2000.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we outline a PhD research plan. This research contributes to
the field of one-class incremental learning and classification in case of
non-stationary environments. The goal of this PhD is to define a new
classification framework able to deal with very small learning dataset at the
beginning of the process and with abilities to adjust itself according to the
variability of the incoming data which create large scale datasets. As a
preliminary work, incremental Covariance-guided One-Class Support Vector
Machine is proposed to deal with sequentially obtained data. It is inspired
from COSVM which put more emphasis on the low variance directions while keeping
the basic formulation of incremental One-Class Support Vector Machine
untouched. The incremental procedure is introduced by controlling the possible
changes of support vectors after the addition of new data points, thanks to the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, that have to be maintained on all previously
acquired data. Comparative experimental results with contemporary incremental
and non-incremental one-class classifiers on numerous artificial and real data
sets show that our method results in significantly better classification
performance.

 <dc:description>  Today's societies are enveloped in an ever-growing telecommunication
infrastructure. This infrastructure offers important opportunities for sensing
and recording a multitude of human behaviors. Human mobility patterns are a
prominent example of such a behavior which has been studied based on cell phone
towers, Bluetooth beacons, and WiFi networks as proxies for location. However,
while mobility is an important aspect of human behavior, understanding complex
social systems requires studying not only the movement of individuals, but also
their interactions. Sensing social interactions on a large scale is a technical
challenge and many commonly used approaches---including RFID badges or
Bluetooth scanning---offer only limited scalability. Here we show that it is
possible, in a scalable and robust way, to accurately infer person-to-person
physical proximity from the lists of WiFi access points measured by smartphones
carried by the two individuals. Based on a longitudinal dataset of
approximately 800 participants with ground-truth interactions collected over a
year, we show that our model performs better than the current state-of-the-art.
Our results demonstrate the value of WiFi signals in social sensing as well as
potential threats to privacy that they imply.

 <dc:description>  A pervasive problem in Data Science is that the knowledge generated by
possibly expensive analytics processes is subject to decay over time, as the
data used to compute it drifts, the algorithms used in the processes are
improved, and the external knowledge embodied by reference datasets used in the
computation evolves. Deciding when such knowledge outcomes should be refreshed,
following a sequence of data change events, requires problem-specific functions
to quantify their value and its decay over time, as well as models for
estimating the cost of their re-computation. What makes this problem
challenging is the ambition to develop a decision support system for informing
data analytics re-computation decisions over time, that is both generic and
customisable. With the help of a case study from genomics, in this vision paper
we offer an initial formalisation of this problem, highlight research
challenges, and outline a possible approach based on the collection and
analysis of metadata from a history of past computations.

 <dc:description>  Clustering network is one of which complex network attracting plenty of
scholars to discuss and study the structures and cascading process. We
primarily analyzed the effect of clustering coefficient to other various of the
single clustering network under localized attack. These network models
including double clustering network and star-like NON with clustering and
random regular (RR) NON of ER networks with clustering are made up of at least
two networks among which exist interdependent relation among whose degree of
dependence is measured by coupling strength. We show both analytically and
numerically, how the coupling strength and clustering coefficient effect the
percolation threshold, size of giant component, critical coupling point where
the behavior of phase transition changes from second order to first order with
the increase of coupling strength between the networks. Last, we study the two
types of clustering network: one type is same with double clustering network in
which each subnetwork satisfies identical degree distribution and the other is
that their subnetwork satisfies different degree distribution. The former type
is treated both analytically and numerically while the latter is treated only
numerically. In each section, we compared two results obtained from localized
attack and random attack according to Shao et al:[22].

 <dc:description>  Modern control is implemented with digital microcontrollers, embedded within
a dynamical plant that represents physical components. We present a new
algorithm based on counter-example guided inductive synthesis that automates
the design of digital controllers that are correct by construction. The
synthesis result is sound with respect to the complete range of approximations,
including time discretization, quantization effects, and finite-precision
arithmetic and its rounding errors. We have implemented our new algorithm in a
tool called DSSynth, and are able to automatically generate stable controllers
for a set of intricate plant models taken from the literature within minutes.

 <dc:description>  The problem of source localization with ad hoc microphone networks in noisy
and reverberant enclosures, given a training set of prerecorded measurements,
is addressed in this paper. The training set is assumed to consist of a limited
number of labelled measurements, attached with corresponding positions, and a
larger amount of unlabelled measurements from unknown locations. However,
microphone calibration is not required. We use a Bayesian inference approach
for estimating a function that maps measurement-based feature vectors to the
corresponding positions. The central issue is how to combine the information
provided by the different microphones in a unified statistical framework. To
address this challenge, we model this function using a Gaussian process with a
covariance function that encapsulates both the connections between pairs of
microphones and the relations among the samples in the training set. The
parameters of the process are estimated by optimizing a maximum likelihood (ML)
criterion. In addition, a recursive adaptation mechanism is derived where the
new streaming measurements are used to update the model. Performance is
demonstrated for 2-D localization of both simulated data and real-life
recordings in a variety of reverberation and noise levels.

 <dc:description>  Stakeholder involvement is one of the major success factors in integrating
user experience (UX) practices into software development processes and
organizations. It is also a necessity for agile software development. However,
practitioners still have limited access to guidelines on successful involvement
of UX stakeholders in agile settings. Moreover, agile UX literature does not
well address the specific characteristics of UX and it does not clearly
differentiate between UX and usability work. This paper presents two guidelines
for supporting stakeholder involvement in both UX integration and the daily UX
work. In particular, we focus on the special characteristics of UX: being
dynamic, subjective, holistic, and context-dependent. The guidelines clarify
practical implications of these characteristics for practitioners. In addition,
they can help researchers in addressing these characteristics better in agile
UX research.

 <dc:description>  A new computationally efficient dependence measure, and an adaptive
statistical test of independence, are proposed. The dependence measure is the
difference between analytic embeddings of the joint distribution and the
product of the marginals, evaluated at a finite set of locations (features).
These features are chosen so as to maximize a lower bound on the test power,
resulting in a test that is data-efficient, and that runs in linear time (with
respect to the sample size n). The optimized features can be interpreted as
evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating regions in the joint domain
where the joint distribution and the product of the marginals differ most.
Consistency of the independence test is established, for an appropriate choice
of features. In real-world benchmarks, independence tests using the optimized
features perform comparably to the state-of-the-art quadratic-time HSIC test,
and outperform competing O(n) and O(n log n) tests.

 <dc:description>  Multivariate time series naturally exist in many fields, like energy,
bioinformatics, signal processing, and finance. Most of these applications need
to be able to compare these structured data. In this context, dynamic time
warping (DTW) is probably the most common comparison measure. However, not much
research effort has been put into improving it by learning. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for learning similarities based on DTW, in order to
improve time series classification. Making use of the uniform stability
framework, we provide the first theoretical guarantees in the form of a
generalization bound for linear classification. The experimental study shows
that the proposed approach is efficient, while yielding sparse classifiers.

 <dc:title>Tight Approximation Bounds for the Seminar Assignment Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The seminar assignment problem is a variant of the generalized assignment
problem in which items have unit size and the amount of space allowed in each
bin is restricted to an arbitrary set of values. The problem has been shown to
be NP-complete and to not admit a PTAS. However, the only constant factor
approximation algorithm known to date is randomized and it is not guaranteed to
always produce a feasible solution.
  In this paper we show that a natural greedy algorithm outputs a solution with
value within a factor of $(1 - e^{-1})$ of the optimal, and that unless
$NP\subseteq DTIME(n^{\log\log n})$, this is the best approximation guarantee
achievable by any polynomial time algorithm.

 <dc:title>Recovering the Missing Link: Predicting Class-Attribute Associations for

 <dc:description>  Collecting training images for all visual categories is not only expensive
but also impractical. Zero-shot learning (ZSL), especially using attributes,
offers a pragmatic solution to this problem. However, at test time most
attribute-based methods require a full description of attribute associations
for each unseen class. Providing these associations is time consuming and often
requires domain specific knowledge. In this work, we aim to carry out
attribute-based zero-shot classification in an unsupervised manner. We propose
an approach to learn relations that couples class embeddings with their
corresponding attributes. Given only the name of an unseen class, the learned
relationship model is used to automatically predict the class-attribute
associations. Furthermore, our model facilitates transferring attributes across
data sets without additional effort. Integrating knowledge from multiple
sources results in a significant additional improvement in performance. We
evaluate on two public data sets: Animals with Attributes and aPascal/aYahoo.
Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predicting
class-attribute associations and unsupervised ZSL by a large margin.

 <dc:description>  There is great interest in supporting imprecise queries (e.g., keyword search
or natural language queries) over databases today. To support such queries, the
database system is typically required to disambiguate parts of the
user-specified query against the database, using whatever resources are
intrinsically available to it (the database schema, data values distributions,
natural language models etc). Often, systems will also have a user-interaction
log available, which can serve as an extrinsic resource to supplement their
model based on their own intrinsic resources. This leads to a problem of how
best to combine the system's prior ranking with insight derived from the
user-interaction log. Statistical inference techniques such as maximum
likelihood or Bayesian updates from a subjective prior turn out not to apply in
a straightforward way due to possible noise from user search behavior and to
encoding biases endemic to the system's models. In this paper, we address such
learning problem in interactive data retrieval, with specific focus on type
classification for user-specified query terms. We develop a novel Bayesian
smoothing algorithm, Bsmooth, which is simple, fast, flexible and accurate. We
analytically establish some desirable properties and show, through experiments
against an independent benchmark, that the addition of such a learning layer
performs much better than standard methods.

 <dc:description>  Programmers routinely trade space for time to increase performance, often in
the form of caching or memoization. In managed languages like Java or
JavaScript, however, this space-time tradeoff is complex. Using more space
translates into higher garbage collection costs, especially at the limit of
available memory. Existing runtime systems provide limited support for
space-sensitive algorithms, forcing programmers into difficult and often
brittle choices about provisioning.
  This paper presents prioritized garbage collection, a cooperative programming
language and runtime solution to this problem. Prioritized GC provides an
interface similar to soft references, called priority references, which
identify objects that the collector can reclaim eagerly if necessary. The key
difference is an API for defining the policy that governs when priority
references are cleared and in what order. Application code specifies a priority
value for each reference and a target memory bound. The collector reclaims
references, lowest priority first, until the total memory footprint of the
cache fits within the bound. We use this API to implement a space-aware
least-recently-used (LRU) cache, called a Sache, that is a drop-in replacement
for existing caches, such as Google's Guava library. The garbage collector
automatically grows and shrinks the Sache in response to available memory and
workload with minimal provisioning information from the programmer. Using a
Sache, it is almost impossible for an application to experience a memory leak,
memory pressure, or an out-of-memory crash caused by software caching.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks are making spectacular progress from
design, standardisation, to commercialisation. At this time of fast-paced
adoption, it is of utmost importance to analyse how well these technologies
will scale as the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT)
inevitably grows. In this letter, we provide a stochastic geometry framework
for modelling the performance of a single gateway LoRa network, a leading LPWA
technology. Our analysis formulates unique peculiarities of LoRa, including its
chirp spread-spectrum modulation technique, regulatory limitations on radio
duty cycle, and use of ALOHA protocol on top, all of which are not as common in
today's commercial cellular networks. We show that the coverage probability
drops exponentially as the number of end-devices grows due to interfering
signals using the same spreading sequence. We conclude that this fundamental
limiting factor is perhaps more significant towards LoRa scalability than for
instance spectrum restrictions. Our derivations for co-spreading factor
interference found in LoRa networks enables rigorous scalability analysis of
such networks.

 <dc:description>  Most learning approaches treat dimensionality reduction (DR) and clustering
separately (i.e., sequentially), but recent research has shown that optimizing
the two tasks jointly can substantially improve the performance of both. The
premise behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained via
linear transformation of latent representations that are easy to cluster; but
in practice, the transformation from the latent space to the data can be more
complicated. In this work, we assume that this transformation is an unknown and
possibly nonlinear function. To recover the `clustering-friendly' latent
representations and to better cluster the data, we propose a joint DR and
K-means clustering approach in which DR is accomplished via learning a deep
neural network (DNN). The motivation is to keep the advantages of jointly
optimizing the two tasks, while exploiting the deep neural network's ability to
approximate any nonlinear function. This way, the proposed approach can work
well for a broad class of generative models. Towards this end, we carefully
design the DNN structure and the associated joint optimization criterion, and
propose an effective and scalable algorithm to handle the formulated
optimization problem. Experiments using different real datasets are employed to
showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Learning policies for bipedal locomotion can be difficult, as experiments are
expensive and simulation does not usually transfer well to hardware. To counter
this, we need al- gorithms that are sample efficient and inherently safe.
Bayesian Optimization is a powerful sample-efficient tool for optimizing
non-convex black-box functions. However, its performance can degrade in higher
dimensions. We develop a distance metric for bipedal locomotion that enhances
the sample-efficiency of Bayesian Optimization and use it to train a 16
dimensional neuromuscular model for planar walking. This distance metric
reflects some basic gait features of healthy walking and helps us quickly
eliminate a majority of unstable controllers. With our approach we can learn
policies for walking in less than 100 trials for a range of challenging
settings. In simulation, we show results on two different costs and on various
terrains including rough ground and ramps, sloping upwards and downwards. We
also perturb our models with unknown inertial disturbances analogous with
differences between simulation and hardware. These results are promising, as
they indicate that this method can potentially be used to learn control
policies on hardware.

 <dc:description>  We study the notion of extensibility in functional data types, as a new
approach to the problem of decorating abstract syntax trees with additional
sets of information. We observed the need for such extensibility while
redesigning the data types representing Haskell abstract syntax inside GHC.
  Specifically, we describe our approach to the tree-decoration problem using a
novel syntactic machinery in Haskell for expressing extensible data types. We
show that the syntactic machinery is complete in that it can express all the
syntactically possible forms of extensions to algebraic data type declarations.
Then, we describe an encoding of the syntactic machinery based on the existing
features in Glasgow Haskell Compiler(GHC).

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel stacked generalization (stacking) method as a dynamic
ensemble technique using a pool of heterogeneous classifiers for node label
classification on networks. The proposed method assigns component models a set
of functional coefficients, which can vary smoothly with certain topological
features of a node. Compared to the traditional stacking model, the proposed
method can dynamically adjust the weights of individual models as we move
across the graph and provide a more versatile and significantly more accurate
stacking model for label prediction on a network. We demonstrate the benefits
of the proposed model using both a simulation study and real data analysis.

 <dc:description>  When modeling geo-spatial data, it is critical to capture spatial
correlations for achieving high accuracy. Spatial Auto-Regression (SAR) is a
common tool used to model such data, where the spatial contiguity matrix (W)
encodes the spatial correlations. However, the efficacy of SAR is limited by
two factors. First, it depends on the choice of contiguity matrix, which is
typically not learnt from data, but instead, is assumed to be known apriori.
Second, it assumes that the observations can be explained by linear models. In
this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework to model
geo-spatial data (specifi- cally housing prices), to learn the spatial
correlations automatically. We show that neighborhood information embedded in
satellite imagery can be leveraged to achieve the desired spatial smoothing. An
additional upside of our framework is the relaxation of linear assumption on
the data. Specific challenges we tackle while implementing our framework
include, (i) how much of the neighborhood is relevant while estimating housing
prices? (ii) what is the right approach to capture multiple resolutions of
satellite imagery? and (iii) what other data-sources can help improve the
estimation of spatial correlations? We demonstrate a marked improvement of 57%
on top of the SAR baseline through the use of features from deep neural
networks for the cities of London, Birmingham and Liverpool.

 <dc:description>  In 1988, Johnson, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis wrote that &quot;Practically all
the empirical evidence would lead us to conclude that finding locally optimal
solutions is much easier than solving NP-hard problems&quot;. Since then the
empirical evidence has continued to amass, but formal proofs of this phenomenon
have remained elusive. A canonical (and indeed complete) example is the local
max-cut problem, for which no polynomial time method is known. In a
breakthrough paper, Etscheid and R\&quot;oglin proved that the smoothed complexity
of local max-cut is quasi-polynomial, i.e., if arbitrary bounded weights are
randomly perturbed, a local maximum can be found in $n^{O(\log n)}$ steps. In
this paper we prove smoothed polynomial complexity for local max-cut, thus
confirming that finding local optima for max-cut is much easier than solving
it.

 <dc:description>  &quot;Net neutrality&quot; often refers to the policy dictating that an Internet
service provider (ISP) cannot charge content providers (CPs) for delivering
their content to consumers. Many past quantitative models designed to determine
whether net neutrality is a good idea have been rather equivocal in their
conclusions. Here we propose a very simple two-sided market model, in which the
types of the consumers and the CPs are {\em power-law distributed} --- a kind
of distribution known to often arise precisely in connection with
Internet-related phenomena. We derive mostly analytical, closed-form results
for several regimes: (a) Net neutrality, (b) social optimum, (c) maximum
revenue by the ISP, or (d) maximum ISP revenue under quality differentiation.
One unexpected conclusion is that (a) and (b) will differ significantly, unless
average CP productivity is very high.

 <dc:title>Term-Class-Max-Support (TCMS): A Simple Text Document Categorization
  Approach Using Term-Class Relevance Measure</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guru, D S</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Suhil, Mahamad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a simple text categorization method using term-class relevance
measures is proposed. Initially, text documents are processed to extract
significant terms present in them. For every term extracted from a document, we
compute its importance in preserving the content of a class through a novel
term-weighting scheme known as Term_Class Relevance (TCR) measure proposed by
Guru and Suhil (2015) [1]. In this way, for every term, its relevance for all
the classes present in the corpus is computed and stored in the knowledgebase.
During testing, the terms present in the test document are extracted and the
term-class relevance of each term is obtained from the stored knowledgebase. To
achieve quick search of term weights, Btree indexing data structure has been
adapted. Finally, the class which receives maximum support in terms of
term-class relevance is decided to be the class of the given test document. The
proposed method works in logarithmic complexity in testing time and simple to
implement when compared to any other text categorization techniques available
in literature. The experiments conducted on various benchmarking datasets have
revealed that the performance of the proposed method is satisfactory and
encouraging.

 <dc:title>A System Level Approach to Controller Synthesis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Biological and advanced cyberphysical control systems often have limited,
sparse, uncertain, and distributed communication and computing in addition to
sensing and actuation. Fortunately, the corresponding plants and performance
requirements are also sparse and structured, and this must be exploited to make
constrained controller design feasible and tractable. We introduce a new
&quot;system level&quot; (SL) approach involving three complementary SL elements. System
Level Parameterizations (SLPs) generalize state space and Youla
parameterizations of all stabilizing controllers and the responses they
achieve, and combine with System Level Constraints (SLCs) to parameterize the
largest known class of constrained stabilizing controllers that admit a convex
characterization, generalizing quadratic invariance (QI). SLPs also lead to a
generalization of detectability and stabilizability, suggesting the existence
of a rich separation structure, that when combined with SLCs, is naturally
applicable to structurally constrained controllers and systems. We further
provide a catalog of useful SLCs, most importantly including sparsity, delay,
and locality constraints on both communication and computing internal to the
controller, and external system performance. The resulting System Level
Synthesis (SLS) problems that arise define the broadest known class of
constrained optimal control problems that can be solved using convex
programming. An example illustrates how this system level approach can
systematically explore tradeoffs in controller performance, robustness, and
synthesis/implementation complexity.

 <dc:description>  Face recognition performance has improved remarkably in the last decade. Much
of this success can be attributed to the development of deep learning
techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs have pushed
the state-of-the-art forward, their training process requires a large amount of
clean and correctly labelled training data. If a CNN is intended to tolerate
facial pose, then we face an important question: should this training data be
diverse in its pose distribution, or should face images be normalized to a
single pose in a pre-processing step? To address this question, we evaluate a
number of popular facial landmarking and pose correction algorithms to
understand their effect on facial recognition performance. Additionally, we
introduce a new, automatic, single-image frontalization scheme that exceeds the
performance of current algorithms. CNNs trained using sets of different
pre-processing methods are used to extract features from the Point and Shoot
Challenge (PaSC) and CMU Multi-PIE datasets. We assert that the subsequent
verification and recognition performance serves to quantify the effectiveness
of each pose correction scheme.

 <dc:description>  The ability to open a door is essential for robots to perform home-serving
and rescuing tasks. A substantial problem is to obtain the necessary parameters
such as the width of the door and the length of the handle. Many researchers
utilize computer vision techniques to extract the parameters automatically
which lead to fine but not very stable results because of the complexity of the
environment. We propose a method that utilizes an RGBD sensor and a GUI for
users to 'point' at the target region with a mouse to acquire 3D information.
Algorithms that can extract important parameters from the selected points are
designed. To avoid large internal force induced by the misalignment of the
robot orientation and the normal of the door plane, we design a module that can
compute the normal of the plane by pointing at three non-collinear points and
then drive the robot to the desired orientation. We carried out experiments on
real robot. The result shows that the designed GUI and algorithms can help find
the necessary parameters stably and get the robot prepared for further
operations.

 <dc:description>  The anatomical location of imaging features is of crucial importance for
accurate diagnosis in many medical tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
have had huge successes in computer vision, but they lack the natural ability
to incorporate the anatomical location in their decision making process,
hindering success in some medical image analysis tasks.
  In this paper, to integrate the anatomical location information into the
network, we propose several deep CNN architectures that consider multi-scale
patches or take explicit location features while training. We apply and compare
the proposed architectures for segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in
brain MR images on a large dataset. As a result, we observe that the CNNs that
incorporate location information substantially outperform a conventional
segmentation method with hand-crafted features as well as CNNs that do not
integrate location information. On a test set of 46 scans, the best
configuration of our networks obtained a Dice score of 0.791, compared to 0.797
for an independent human observer. Performance levels of the machine and the
independent human observer were not statistically significantly different
(p-value=0.17).

 <dc:description>  The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies offer the potential of orders of
magnitude increases in capacity for next-generation cellular systems. However,
links in mmWave networks are susceptible to blockage and may suffer from rapid
variations in quality. Connectivity to multiple cells - at mmWave and/or
traditional frequencies - is considered essential for robust communication. One
of the challenges in supporting multi-connectivity in mmWaves is the
requirement for the network to track the direction of each link in addition to
its power and timing. To address this challenge, we implement a novel uplink
measurement system that, with the joint help of a local coordinator operating
in the legacy band, guarantees continuous monitoring of the channel propagation
conditions and allows for the design of efficient control plane applications,
including handover, beam tracking and initial access. We show that an
uplink-based multi-connectivity approach enables less consuming, better
performing, faster and more stable cell selection and scheduling decisions with
respect to a traditional downlink-based standalone scheme. Moreover, we argue
that the presented framework guarantees (i) efficient tracking of the user in
the presence of the channel dynamics expected at mmWaves, and (ii) fast
reaction to situations in which the primary propagation path is blocked or not
available.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of selecting a minimum size subset of nodes in a
network, that allows to activate all the nodes of the network. We present a
fast and simple algorithm that, in real-life networks, produces solutions that
outperform the ones obtained by using the best algorithms in the literature. We
also investigate the theoretical performances of our algorithm and give proofs
of optimality for some classes of graphs. From an experimental perspective,
experiments also show that the performance of the algorithms correlates with
the modularity of the analyzed network. Moreover, the more the influence among
communities is hard to propagate, the less the performances of the algorithms
differ. On the other hand, when the network allows some propagation of
influence between different communities, the gap between the solutions returned
by the proposed algorithm and by the previous algorithms in the literature

 <dc:title>Translation Quality Estimation using Recurrent Neural Network</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes our submission to the shared task on word/phrase level
Quality Estimation (QE) in the First Conference on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT16). The objective of the shared task was to predict if the
given word/phrase is a correct/incorrect (OK/BAD) translation in the given
sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for word level Quality
Estimation using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture.
RNN-LMs have been found very effective in different Natural Language Processing
(NLP) applications. RNN-LM is mainly used for vector space language modeling
for different NLP problems. For this task, we modify the architecture of
RNN-LM. The modified system predicts a label (OK/BAD) in the slot rather than
predicting the word. The input to the system is a word sequence, similar to the
standard RNN-LM. The approach is language independent and requires only the
translated text for QE. To estimate the phrase level quality, we use the output
of the word level QE system.

 <dc:description>  Cold start problem in Collaborative Filtering can be solved by asking new
users to rate a small seed set of representative items or by asking
representative users to rate a new item. The question is how to build a seed
set that can give enough preference information for making good
recommendations. One of the most successful approaches, called Representative
Based Matrix Factorization, is based on Maxvol algorithm. Unfortunately, this
approach has one important limitation --- a seed set of a particular size
requires a rating matrix factorization of fixed rank that should coincide with
that size. This is not necessarily optimal in the general case. In the current
paper, we introduce a fast algorithm for an analytical generalization of this
approach that we call Rectangular Maxvol. It allows the rank of factorization
to be lower than the required size of the seed set. Moreover, the paper
includes the theoretical analysis of the method's error, the complexity
analysis of the existing methods and the comparison to the state-of-the-art
approaches.

 <dc:title>Joint Multiuser Downlink Beamforming and Admission Control for Green

 <dc:description>  With the dense deployment of the remote radio heads (RRHs), the huge network
power consumption has become a great challenge for green cloud radio access
networks (Cloud-RANs), and multiuser downlink beamforming has been proposed as
a promising solution. Moreover, the increasing number of mobile users (MUs)
causes that admission control is essential for Cloud-RAN with limited fronthaul
capacity and predefined power budget. In this paper, we consider the problem of
joint multiuser downlink beamforming and admission control (JBAC) to enhance
the admitted MUs in the network and reduce the network power consumption, while
taking into account the Quality of Service requirements of the MUs, the power
budget constraints and fronthaul limitation. It is shown that the JBAC problem
is a mixed integer nonlinear problem, and still non-convex even though the
continuous relaxation is adopted. Therefore, we first transform the JBAC
problem into a Mixed-Integer Semidefinite Program. Then, we propose a bound
improving Branch and Bound algorithm to yield the near-optimal solution. For
practical application, a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm is proposed to
derive the sub-optimal solution. Extensive simulations are conducted with
different system configurations to show the effectiveness of the proposed two
schemes.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach of color transfer between images by exploring
their high-level semantic information. First, we set up a database which
consists of the collection of downloaded images from the internet, which are
segmented automatically by using matting techniques. We then, extract image
foregrounds from both source and multiple target images. Then by using image
matting algorithms, the system extracts the semantic information such as faces,
lips, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, etc., from the extracted foregrounds of the source
image. And, then the color is transferred between corresponding parts with the
same semantic information. Next we get the color transferred result by
seamlessly compositing different parts together using alpha blending. In the
final step, we present an efficient method of color consistency to optimize the
color of a collection of images showing the common scene. The main advantage of
our method over existing techniques is that it does not need face matching, as
one could use more than one target images. It is not restricted to head shot
images as we can also change the color style in the wild. Moreover, our
algorithm does not require to choose the same color style, same pose and image
size between source and target images. Our algorithm is not restricted to
one-to-one image color transfer and can make use of more than one target images
to transfer the color in different parts in the source image. Comparing with
other approaches, our algorithm is much better in color blending in the input
data.

 <dc:description>  We propose a probabilistic filtering method which fuses joint measurements
with depth images to yield a precise, real-time estimate of the end-effector
pose in the camera frame. This avoids the need for frame transformations when
using it in combination with visual object tracking methods.
  Precision is achieved by modeling and correcting biases in the joint
measurements as well as inaccuracies in the robot model, such as poor extrinsic
camera calibration. We make our method computationally efficient through a
principled combination of Kalman filtering of the joint measurements and
asynchronous depth-image updates based on the Coordinate Particle Filter.
  We quantitatively evaluate our approach on a dataset recorded from a real
robotic platform, annotated with ground truth from a motion capture system. We
show that our approach is robust and accurate even under challenging conditions
such as fast motion, significant and long-term occlusions, and time-varying
biases. We release the dataset along with open-source code of our approach to
allow for quantitative comparison with alternative approaches.

 <dc:description>  With the advancement of huge data generation and data handling capability,
Machine Learning and Probabilistic modelling enables an immense opportunity to
employ predictive analytics platform in high security critical industries
namely data centers, electricity grids, utilities, airport etc. where downtime
minimization is one of the primary objectives. This paper proposes a novel,
complete architecture of an intelligent predictive analytics platform, Fault
Engine, for huge device network connected with electrical/information flow.
Three unique modules, here proposed, seamlessly integrate with available
technology stack of data handling and connect with middleware to produce online
intelligent prediction in critical failure scenarios. The Markov Failure module
predicts the severity of a failure along with survival probability of a device
at any given instances. The Root Cause Analysis model indicates probable
devices as potential root cause employing Bayesian probability assignment and
topological sort. Finally, a community detection algorithm produces correlated
clusters of device in terms of failure probability which will further narrow
down the search space of finding route cause. The whole Engine has been tested
with different size of network with simulated failure environments and shows
its potential to be scalable in real-time implementation.

 <dc:title>Gibbard-Satterthwaite Success Stories and Obvious Strategyproofness</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Impossibility Theorem holds that dictatorship is
the only Pareto optimal and strategyproof social choice function on the full
domain of preferences. Much of the work in mechanism design aims at getting
around this impossibility theorem. Three grand success stories stand out. On
the domains of single peaked preferences, of house matching, and of quasilinear
preferences, there are appealing Pareto optimal and strategyproof social choice
functions. We investigate whether these success stories are robust to
strengthening strategyproofness to obvious strategyproofness (OSP), recently
introduced by Li (2015).
  For single peaked preferences, we characterize the class of OSP-implementable
and unanimous social choice functions as dictatorships with safeguards against
extremism - mechanisms (which turn out to also be Pareto optimal) in which the
dictator can choose the outcome, but other agents may prevent the dictator from
choosing an outcome that is too extreme. Median voting is consequently not
OSP-implementable. Indeed, the only OSP-implementable quantile rules choose
either the minimal or the maximal ideal point. For house matching, we
characterize the class of OSP-implementable and Pareto optimal matching rules
as sequential barter with lurkers - a significant generalization over bossy
variants of bipolar serially dictatorial rules. While Li (2015) shows that
second-price auctions are OSP-implementable when only one good is sold, we show
that this positive result does not extend to the case of multiple goods. Even
when all agents' preferences over goods are quasilinear and additive, no
welfare-maximizing auction where losers pay nothing is OSP-implementable when
more than one good is sold. Our analysis makes use of a gradual revelation
principle, an analog of the (direct) revelation principle for OSP mechanisms
that we present and prove.

 <dc:description>  Real-time simultaneous tracking of hands manipulating and interacting with
external objects has many potential applications in augmented reality, tangible
computing, and wearable computing. However, due to difficult occlusions, fast
motions, and uniform hand appearance, jointly tracking hand and object pose is
more challenging than tracking either of the two separately. Many previous
approaches resort to complex multi-camera setups to remedy the occlusion
problem and often employ expensive segmentation and optimization steps which
makes real-time tracking impossible. In this paper, we propose a real-time
solution that uses a single commodity RGB-D camera. The core of our approach is
a 3D articulated Gaussian mixture alignment strategy tailored to hand-object
tracking that allows fast pose optimization. The alignment energy uses novel
regularizers to address occlusions and hand-object contacts. For added
robustness, we guide the optimization with discriminative part classification
of the hand and segmentation of the object. We conducted extensive experiments
on several existing datasets and introduce a new annotated hand-object dataset.
Quantitative and qualitative results show the key advantages of our method:
speed, accuracy, and robustness.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating the states of weakly coupled linear
systems from sampled measurements. We assume that the total capacity available
to the sensors to transmit their samples to a network manager in charge of the
estimation is bounded above, and that each sample requires the same amount of
communication. Our goal is then to find an optimal allocation of the capacity
to the sensors so that the average estimation error is minimized. We show that
when the total available channel capacity is large, this resource allocation
problem can be recast as a strictly convex optimization problem, and hence
there exists a unique optimal allocation of the capacity. We further
investigate how this optimal allocation varies as the available capacity
increases. In particular, we show that if the coupling among the subsystems is
weak, then the sampling rate allocated to each sensor is nondecreasing in the
total sampling rate, and is strictly increasing if and only if the total
sampling rate exceeds a certain threshold.

 <dc:description>  We analyze online and mini-batch k-means variants. Both scale up the widely
used Lloyd 's algorithm via stochastic approximation, and have become popular
for large-scale clustering and unsupervised feature learning. We show, for the
first time, that they have global convergence towards local optima at
$O(\frac{1}{t})$ rate under general conditions. In addition, we show if the
dataset is clusterable, with suitable initialization, mini-batch k-means
converges to an optimal k-means solution with $O(\frac{1}{t})$ convergence rate
with high probability. The k-means objective is non-convex and
non-differentiable: we exploit ideas from non-convex gradient-based
optimization by providing a novel characterization of the trajectory of k-means
algorithm on its solution space, and circumvent its non-differentiability via
geometric insights about k-means update.

algorithm that has a buffer (1-delta) k performs worse by a factor of Omega(log
n) than an offline algorithm with buffer k. In particular, this demonstrates
that the O(log n)-competitive online algorithm MovingPartition by Gamzu and

 <dc:title>Power Control for Packet Streaming with Head-of-Line Deadlines</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider a mathematical model for streaming media packets (as the
motivating key example) from a transmitter buffer to a receiver over a wireless
link while controlling the transmitter power (hence, the packet/job processing
rate). When each packet comes to the head-of-line (HOL) in the buffer, it is
given a deadline $D$ which is the maximum number of times the transmitter can
attempt retransmission in order to successfully transmit the packet. If this
number of transmission attempts is exhausted, the packet is ejected from the
buffer and the next packet comes to the HOL. Costs are incurred in each time
slot for holding packets in the buffer, expending transmitter power, and
ejecting packets which exceed their deadlines. We investigate how transmission
power should be chosen so as to minimize the total cost of transmitting the
items in the buffer. We formulate the optimal power control problem in a
dynamic programming framework and then hone in on the special case of fixed
interference. For this special case, we are able to provide a precise analytic
characterization of how the power control should vary with the backlog and how
the power control should react to approaching deadlines. In particular, we show
monotonicity results for how the transmitter should adapt power levels to the
backlog and approaching deadlines. We leverage these analytic results from the
special case to build a power control scheme for the general case. Monte Carlo
simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the resulting power control
scheme as compared to the optimal scheme. The resulting power control scheme is
sub-optimal but it provides a low-complexity approximation of the optimal power
control. Simulations show that our proposed schemes outperform benchmark
algorithms. We also discuss applications of the model to other practical
operational scenarios.

 <dc:description>  For more than the past twenty years, Csound has been one of the leaders in
the world of the computer music research, implementing innovative synthesis
methods and making them available beyond the academic environments from which
they often arise, and into the hands of musicians and sound designers
throughout the world. In its present state, Csound offers an efficient
environment for sound experimentation, allowing the user to work with almost
any known sound synthesis or signal processing method through its vast
collection of ready-made opcodes. But despite all this potential, the shared
resource of Csound instruments still lacks quality reproductions of well-known
synthesizers; even with its ability to generate commercial standard user
interfaces and with the possibility to compile Csound instruments in such as
fashion so that they can be used with no knowledge of Csound code. To fill this
gap, the authors have implemented two commercial-style synthesizers as VST
plug-ins using the Csound front-end &quot;Cabbage&quot;. This paper describes their
architecture and some of the Csound specific challenges involved in the
development of fully featured synthesizers.

 <dc:title>An interleaver design for polar codes over slow fading channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tavildar, Saurabha R</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of using polar codes over slow fading wireless
channels. For design, we focus on a parallel slow fading channel with 2 blocks,
and polar codes with rate &lt;= 1/2. Motivated by Arikan's systematic polar code
construction, we propose an interleaver design for a general polar code. The
interleaver comprises of using the bit reversal of the order of polarized bit
channels. This interleaver is called a diversity interleaver. In addition to
the diversity interleaver, a diversity polar code is proposed to further
increase the diversity gain.
  The proposed designs are evaluated via link simulations for AWGN and fading
channels. The simulation results show a performance close to the outage
probability (within 2 dB) and significant gains over using a random
interleaver.

 <dc:title>Probabilistic Dimensionality Reduction via Structure Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Li</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel probabilistic dimensionality reduction framework that can
naturally integrate the generative model and the locality information of data.
Based on this framework, we present a new model, which is able to learn a
smooth skeleton of embedding points in a low-dimensional space from
high-dimensional noisy data. The formulation of the new model can be
equivalently interpreted as two coupled learning problem, i.e., structure
learning and the learning of projection matrix. This interpretation motivates
the learning of the embedding points that can directly form an explicit graph
structure. We develop a new method to learn the embedding points that form a
spanning tree, which is further extended to obtain a discriminative and compact
feature representation for clustering problems. Unlike traditional clustering
methods, we assume that centers of clusters should be close to each other if
they are connected in a learned graph, and other cluster centers should be
distant. This can greatly facilitate data visualization and scientific
discovery in downstream analysis. Extensive experiments are performed that
demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to obtain discriminative
feature representations, and correctly recover the intrinsic structures of
various real-world datasets.

 <dc:description>  Geometric model fitting is a fundamental task in computer graphics and
computer vision. However, most geometric model fitting methods are unable to
fit an arbitrary geometric model (e.g. a surface with holes) to incomplete
data, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to
measure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models. This paper hence
proposes a novel rigid geometric similarity metric, which is able to measure
both the full similarity and the partial similarity between arbitrary geometric
models. The proposed metric enables us to perform partial procedural geometric
model fitting (PPGMF). The task of PPGMF is to search a procedural geometric
model space for the model rigidly similar to a query of non-complete point set.
Models in the procedural model space are generated according to a set of
parametric modeling rules. A typical query is a point cloud. PPGMF is very
useful as it can be used to fit arbitrary geometric models to non-complete
(incomplete, over-complete or hybrid-complete) point cloud data. For example,
most laser scanning data is non-complete due to occlusion. Our PPGMF method
uses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the proposed similarity
metric over the model space. To accelerate the optimization process, the method
also employs a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to reject
dissimilar models in advance. Our method has been demonstrated on a variety of
geometric models and non-complete data. Experimental results show that the
PPGMF method based on the proposed metric is able to fit non-complete data,
while the method based on other metrics is unable. It is also shown that our
method can be accelerated by several times via early rejection.

 <dc:title>On the equivariant Betti numbers of symmetric definable sets: vanishing,

 <dc:description>  Let $\mathrm{R}$ be a real closed field. We prove that for any fixed $d$, the
equivariant rational cohomology groups of closed symmetric semi-algebraic
subsets of $\mathrm{R}^k$ defined by polynomials of degrees bounded by $d$
vanishes in dimensions $d$ and larger. This vanishing result is tight. Using a
new geometric approach we also prove an upper bound of $d^{O(d)} s^d k^{\lfloor
d/2 \rfloor-1} $ on the equivariant Betti numbers of closed symmetric
semi-algebraic subsets of $\mathrm{R}^k$ defined by quantifier-free formulas
involving $s$ symmetric polynomials of degrees bounded by $d$, where $1 &lt; d \ll
s,k$. This bound is tight up to a factor depending only on $d$. These results
significantly improve upon those obtained previously which were proved using
different techniques. Our new methods are quite general, and also yield bounds
on the equivariant Betti numbers of certain special classes of symmetric
definable sets (definable sets symmetrized by pulling back under symmetric
polynomial maps of fixed degree) in arbitrary o-minimal structures over
$\mathrm{R}$. Finally, we utilize our new approach to obtain an algorithm with
polynomially bounded complexity for computing these equivariant Betti numbers.
In contrast, the problem of computing the ordinary Betti numbers of (not
necessarily symmetric) semi-algebraic sets is considered to be an intractable
problem, and all known algorithms for this problem have doubly exponential
complexity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we aim to maximize the energy efficiency of cellular wireless
networks. Specifically, we address the power allocation problem in multi-cell
multi-carrier systems. Considering realistic base station power consumption
models, we formulate a network-wide energy efficiency maximization problem.
Using tools from fractional programming, we cast this problem in the framework
of bi-criterion optimization where rate maximization and power minimization are
weighted accordingly. Interference pricing mechanism is applied to reduce the
intercell interference and to achieve a higher network performance. We
decompose the main problem into subproblems via dual decomposition. These
subproblems are independently solved per sector using limited information
exchange between base stations. We first derive our expressions and present
algorithms for the single-tier networks. Then, we extend our analysis to
two-tier networks where picocell base stations are deployed to improve the
network performance and reduce the link distances. Lastly, we extend our
framework and include the quality-of-service constraints.We obtain closed-form
expressions for the power level updates which are determined by the multi-level
water-filling algorithm, or, as it is sometimes called as, the modified
waterfilling algorithm. Based on our simulation results, we demonstrate that
the proposed algorithms can outperform the benchmark approaches in terms of
energy efficiency by a factor of 2.7.

 <dc:description>  Automatic attribute discovery methods have gained in popularity to extract
sets of visual attributes from images or videos for various tasks. Despite
their good performance in some classification tasks, it is difficult to
evaluate whether the attributes discovered by these methods are meaningful and
which methods are the most appropriate to discover attributes for visual
descriptions. In its simplest form, such an evaluation can be performed by
manually verifying whether there is any consistent identifiable visual concept
distinguishing between positive and negative exemplars labelled by an
attribute. This manual checking is tedious, expensive and labour intensive. In
addition, comparisons between different methods could also be problematic as it
is not clear how one could quantitatively decide which attribute is more
meaningful than the others. In this paper, we propose a novel attribute
meaningfulness metric to address this challenging problem. With this metric,
automatic quantitative evaluation can be performed on the attribute sets; thus,
reducing the enormous effort to perform manual evaluation. The proposed metric
is applied to some recent automatic attribute discovery and hashing methods on
four attribute-labelled datasets. To further validate the efficacy of the
proposed method, we conducted a user study. In addition, we also compared our
metric with a semi-supervised attribute discover method using the mixture of
probabilistic PCA. In our evaluation, we gleaned several insights that could be
beneficial in developing new automatic attribute discovery methods.

 <dc:description>  As data-driven methods are becoming pervasive in a wide variety of
disciplines, there is an urgent need to develop scalable and sustainable tools
to simplify the process of data science, to make it easier to keep track of the
analyses being performed and datasets being generated, and to enable
introspection of the workflows. In this paper, we describe our vision of a
unified provenance and metadata management system to support lifecycle
management of complex collaborative data science workflows. We argue that a
large amount of information about the analysis processes and data artifacts
can, and should be, captured in a semi-passive manner; and we show that
querying and analyzing this information can not only simplify bookkeeping and
debugging tasks for data analysts but can also enable a rich new set of
capabilities like identifying flaws in the data science process itself. It can
also significantly reduce the time spent in fixing post-deployment problems
through automated analysis and monitoring. We have implemented an initial
prototype of our system, called ProvDB, on top of git (a version control
system) and Neo4j (a graph database), and we describe its key features and
capabilities.

 <dc:title>Improvements in Sub-optimal Solving of the $(N^2-1)$-Puzzle via Joint
  Relocation of Pebbles and its Applications to Rule-based Cooperative
  Path-Finding</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Surynek, Pavel</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of solving $(n^2-1)$-puzzle and cooperative path-finding (CPF)
sub-optimally by rule based algorithms is addressed in this manuscript. The
task in the puzzle is to rearrange $n^2-1$ pebbles on the square grid of the
size of n x n using one vacant position to a desired goal configuration. An
improvement to the existent polynomial-time algorithm is proposed and
experimentally analyzed. The improved algorithm is trying to move pebbles in a
more efficient way than the original algorithm by grouping them into so-called
snakes and moving them jointly within the snake. An experimental evaluation
showed that the algorithm using snakes produces solutions that are 8% to 9%
shorter than solutions generated by the original algorithm.
  The snake-based relocation has been also integrated into rule-based
algorithms for solving the CPF problem sub-optimally, which is a closely
related task. The task in CPF is to relocate a group of abstract robots that
move over an undirected graph to given goal vertices. Robots can move to
unoccupied neighboring vertices and at most one robot can be placed in each
vertex. The $(n^2-1)$-puzzle is a special case of CPF where the underlying
graph is represented by a 4-connected grid and there is only one vacant vertex.
Two major rule-based algorithms for CPF were included in our study - BIBOX and
PUSH-and-SWAP (PUSH-and-ROTATE). Improvements gained by using snakes in the
BIBOX algorithm were stable around 30% in $(n^2-1)$-puzzle solving and up to
50% in CPFs over bi-connected graphs with various ear decompositions and
multiple vacant vertices. In the case of the PUSH-and-SWAP algorithm the
improvement achieved by snakes was around 5% to 8%. However, the improvement
was unstable and hardly predictable in the case of PUSH-and-SWAP.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyses the short utterance probabilistic linear discriminant
analysis (PLDA) speaker verification with utterance partitioning and short
utterance variance (SUV) modelling approaches. Experimental studies have found
that instead of using single long-utterance as enrolment data, if long enrolled
utterance is partitioned into multiple short utterances and average of short
utterance i-vectors is used as enrolled data, that improves the Gaussian PLDA
(GPLDA) speaker verification. This is because short utterance i-vectors have
speaker, session and utterance variations, and utterance-partitioning approach
compensates the utterance variation. Subsequently, SUV-PLDA is also studied
with utterance partitioning approach, and utterance partitioning-based
SUV-GPLDA system shows relative improvement of 9% and 16% in EER for NIST 2008
and NIST 2010 truncated 10sec-10sec evaluation condition as utterance
partitioning approach compensates the utterance variation and SUV modelling
approach compensates the mismatch between full-length development data and
short-length evaluation data.

 <dc:description>  A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a communication system that receives
neurological signals from the brain and translates them into control commands
for electrical (e.g., computer mouse) and electromechanical (e.g., Wheelchair)
devices. The development of such systems was intended originally to aid
individuals with a condition called locked-in syndrome. Individuals with this
condition have lost all their voluntary muscle control but remain cognitively
intact (i.e., mentally aware of their surroundings- can feel emotions,
recognize objects/people but are unable to move). This means that they are
trapped in their own bodies. The use of BCI may one day improve the
independence and quality of life of people with this disability.

 <dc:description>  Attack detection is usually approached as a classification problem. However,
standard classification tools often perform poorly because an adaptive attacker
can shape his attacks in response to the algorithm. This has led to the recent
interest in developing methods for adversarial classification, but to the best
of our knowledge, there have been very few prior studies that take into account
the attacker's tradeoff between adapting to the classifier being used against
him with his desire to maintain the efficacy of his attack. Including this
effect is key to derive solutions that perform well in practice.
  In this investigation we model the interaction as a game between a defender
who chooses a classifier to distinguish between attacks and normal behavior
based on a set of observed features and an attacker who chooses his attack
features (class 1 data). Normal behavior (class 0 data) is random and
exogenous. The attacker's objective balances the benefit from attacks and the
cost of being detected while the defender's objective balances the benefit of a
correct attack detection and the cost of false alarm. We provide an efficient
algorithm to compute all Nash equilibria and a compact characterization of the
possible forms of a Nash equilibrium that reveals intuitive messages on how to
perform classification in the presence of an attacker. We also explore
qualitatively and quantitatively the impact of the non-attacker and underlying
parameters on the equilibrium strategies.

 <dc:description>  Fuzzy logic is a powerful tool to model knowledge uncertainty, measurements
imprecision, and vagueness. However, there is another type of vagueness that
arises when data have multiple forms of expression that fuzzy logic does not
address quite well. This is the case for multiple instance learning problems
(MIL). In MIL, an object is represented by a collection of instances, called a
bag. A bag is labeled negative if all of its instances are negative, and
positive if at least one of its instances is positive. Positive bags encode
ambiguity since the instances themselves are not labeled. In this paper, we
introduce fuzzy inference systems and neural networks designed to handle bags
of instances as input and capable of learning from ambiguously labeled data.
First, we introduce the Multiple Instance Sugeno style fuzzy inference
(MI-Sugeno) that extends the standard Sugeno style inference to handle
reasoning with multiple instances. Second, we use MI-Sugeno to define and
develop Multiple Instance Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (MI-ANFIS). We
expand the architecture of the standard ANFIS to allow reasoning with bags and
derive a learning algorithm using backpropagation to identify the premise and
consequent parameters of the network. The proposed inference system is tested
and validated using synthetic and benchmark datasets suitable for MIL problems.
We also apply the proposed MI-ANFIS to fuse the output of multiple
discrimination algorithms for the purpose of landmine detection using Ground
Penetrating Radar.

 <dc:description>  A full-duplex two-way relay channel with multiple antennas is considered. For
this three-node network, the beamforming design needs to suppress
self-interference. While a traditional way is to apply zero-forcing for
self-interference mitigation, it may harm the desired signals. In this paper, a
design which reserves a fraction of self-interference is proposed by solving a
quality-of-service constrained beamforming design problem. Since the problem is
challenging due to the loop self-interference, a convergence-guaranteed
alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to jointly design the relay-user
beamformers. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms
zero-forcing method, and achieves a transmit power close to the ideal case.

 <dc:description>  Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, which enables direct communication
between nearby mobile devices, is an attractive add-on component to improve
spectrum efficiency and user experience by reusing licensed cellular spectrum
in 5G system. In this paper, we propose to enable D2D communication in
unlicensed spectrum (D2D-U) as an underlay of the uplink LTE network for
further booming the network capacity. A sensing-based protocol is designed to
support the unlicensed channel access for both LTE and D2D users. We further
investigate the subchannel allocation problem to maximize the sum rate of LTE
and D2D users while taking into account their interference to the existing
Wi-Fi systems. Specifically, we formulate the subchannel allocation as a
many-to-many matching problem with externalities, and develop an iterative
user-subchannel swap algorithm. Analytical and simulation results show that the
proposed D2D-U scheme can significantly improve the system sum-rate.

 <dc:description>  We study the recovery of sparse vectors from subsampled random convolutions
via $\ell_1$-minimization. We consider the setup in which both the subsampling
locations as well as the generating vector are chosen at random. For a
subgaussian generator with independent entries, we improve previously known
estimates: if the sparsity $s$ is small enough, i.e.~$s \lesssim
\sqrt{n/\log(n)}$, we show that $m \gtrsim s \log(en/s)$ measurements are
sufficient to recover $s$-sparse vectors in dimension $n$ with high
probability, matching the well-known condition for recovery from standard
Gaussian measurements. If $s$ is larger, then essentially $m \geq s \log^2(s)
\log(\log(s)) \log(n)$ measurements are sufficient, again improving over
previous estimates. Moreover, we also provide robustness estimates for
measurement errors that are bounded in $\ell_q$ for $q &gt; 2$ -- in particular,
allowing the case $q=\infty$ which is important for quantized compressive
sensing. All these results are shown via $\ell_q$-robust versions of the null
space property and for $q &gt; 2$ they represent the first non-trivial bounds for
structured random matrices. As a crucial ingredient, our approach requires to
lower bound expressions of the form $\inf_{v \in V_r} \| \Gamma_v \xi\|_q$,
where $\Gamma_v$ is a set of matrices indexed by unit norm $r$-sparse vectors
and $\xi$ is a subgaussian random vector. This involves the combination of
small ball estimates with chaining techniques.

 <dc:title>Coupled and decoupled impedance models compared in power electronics

 <dc:description>  This paper provides a comparative analysis of impedance models for power
electronic converters and systems for the purpose of stability investigations.
Such models can be divided into either decoupled models or matrix models. A
decoupled impedance model is highly appealing since the
Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) structure makes the analysis and result
interpretation very simple. On the other hand, matrix impedance models are more
accurate, and in some cases necessary. Previous works have applied various
approximations to obtain decoupled models, and both the dq- and sequence
domains have been used. This paper introduces the terms decoupled and
semi-decoupled impedance models in order to have a clear classification of the
available approximations.
  The accuracy of 4 decoupled impedance models are discussed based on the
concept of Mirror Frequency Coupling (MFC). By definition the decoupled models
based on sequence domain impedances will be exact for systems without MFC. In
the general case, they are expected to be more accurate than the decoupled
dq-impedance models. The paper defines a norm $\epsilon$ to measure the degree
of coupling in the impedance matrices. This norm equals the error in the
eigenvalue loci between the matrix and semi-decoupled models. This can also be
viewed as the error in the semi-decoupled Nyquist plot.
  An example case study consisting of a grid-connected VSC with current
controller and PLL is used to compare the different methods. It is found that
decoupled and semi-decoupled models in the dq-domain are only applicable in
grids with very low X/R-ratio. Furthermore, it is concluded that the decoupled
model in the sequence domain gives close to equal results as the semi-decoupled
model.

 <dc:description>  Recently, neural networks have achieved great success on sentiment
classification due to their ability to alleviate feature engineering. However,
one of the remaining challenges is to model long texts in document-level
sentiment classification under a recurrent architecture because of the
deficiency of the memory unit. To address this problem, we present a Cached
Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (CLSTM) to capture the overall semantic
information in long texts. CLSTM introduces a cache mechanism, which divides
memory into several groups with different forgetting rates and thus enables the
network to keep sentiment information better within a recurrent unit. The
proposed CLSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art models on three publicly
available document-level sentiment analysis datasets.

 <dc:description>  Automatic video captioning is challenging due to the complex interactions in
dynamic real scenes. A comprehensive system would ultimately localize and track
the objects, actions and interactions present in a video and generate a
description that relies on temporal localization in order to ground the visual
concepts. However, most existing automatic video captioning systems map from
raw video data to high level textual description, bypassing localization and
recognition, thus discarding potentially valuable information for content
localization and generalization. In this work we present an automatic video
captioning model that combines spatio-temporal attention and image
classification by means of deep neural network structures based on long
short-term memory. The resulting system is demonstrated to produce
state-of-the-art results in the standard YouTube captioning benchmark while
also offering the advantage of localizing the visual concepts (subjects, verbs,
objects), with no grounding supervision, over space and time.

 <dc:description>  Accurate prediction of wind ramp events is critical for ensuring the
reliability and stability of the power systems with high penetration of wind
energy. This paper proposes a classification based approach for estimating the
future class of wind ramp event based on certain thresholds. A parallelized
gradient boosted regression tree based technique has been proposed to
accurately classify the normal as well as rare extreme wind power ramp events.
The model has been validated using wind power data obtained from the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory database. Performance comparison with several
benchmark techniques indicates the superiority of the proposed technique in
terms of superior classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Conventional attention-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) conducts
dynamic alignment in generating the target sentence. By repeatedly reading the
representation of source sentence, which keeps fixed after generated by the
encoder (Bahdanau et al., 2015), the attention mechanism has greatly enhanced
state-of-the-art NMT. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism,
called INTERACTIVE ATTENTION, which models the interaction between the decoder
and the representation of source sentence during translation by both reading
and writing operations. INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can keep track of the interaction
history and therefore improve the translation performance. Experiments on NIST
Chinese-English translation task show that INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can achieve
significant improvements over both the previous attention-based NMT baseline
and some state-of-the-art variants of attention-based NMT (i.e., coverage
models (Tu et al., 2016)). And neural machine translator with our INTERACTIVE
ATTENTION can outperform the open source attention-based NMT system Groundhog
by 4.22 BLEU points and the open source phrase-based system Moses by 3.94 BLEU
points averagely on multiple test sets.

 <dc:description>  The weekly maintenance schedule specifies when maintenance activities should
be performed on the equipment, taking into account the availability of workers
and maintenance bays, and other operational constraints. The current approach
to generating this schedule is labour intensive and requires coordination
between the maintenance schedulers and operations staff to minimise its impact
on the operation of the mine. This paper presents methods for automatically
generating this schedule from the list of maintenance tasks to be performed,
the availability roster of the maintenance staff, and time windows in which
each piece of equipment is available for maintenance. Both Mixed-Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) and genetic algorithms are evaluated, with the genetic
algorithm shown to significantly outperform the MILP. Two fitness functions for
the genetic algorithm are also examined, with a linear fitness function
outperforming an inverse fitness function by up to 5% for the same calculation
time. The genetic algorithm approach is computationally fast, allowing the
schedule to be rapidly recalculated in response to unexpected delays and
breakdowns.

 <dc:description>  A novel algorithmic discussion of the methodological and numerical
differences of competing parametric model reduction techniques for nonlinear
problems are presented. First, the Galerkin reduced basis (RB) formulation is
presented which fails at providing significant gains with respect to the
computational efficiency for nonlinear problems. Renown methods for the
reduction of the computing time of nonlinear reduced order models are the
Hyper-Reduction and the (Discrete) Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM, DEIM).
An algorithmic description and a methodological comparison of both methods are
provided. The accuracy of the predictions of the hyper-reduced model and the
(D)EIM in comparison to the Galerkin RB is investigated. All three approaches
are applied to a simple uncertainty quantification of a planar nonlinear
thermal conduction problem. The results are compared to computationally intense
finite element simulations.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a novel framework to encode the local connectivity
patterns of brain, using Fisher Vectors (FV), Vector of Locally Aggregated
Descriptors (VLAD) and Bag-of-Words (BoW) methods. We first obtain local
descriptors, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs) from fMRI data, by forming
local meshes around anatomical regions, and estimating their relationship
within a neighborhood. Then, we extract a dictionary of relationships, called
\textit{brain connectivity dictionary} by fitting a generative Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) to a set of MADs, and selecting the codewords at the mean of each
component of the mixture. Codewords represent the connectivity patterns among
anatomical regions. We also encode MADs by VLAD and BoW methods using the
k-Means clustering.
  We classify the cognitive states of Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI
dataset, where we train support vector machines (SVM) by the encoded MADs.
Results demonstrate that, FV encoding of MADs can be successfully employed for
classification of cognitive tasks, and outperform the VLAD and BoW
representations. Moreover, we identify the significant Gaussians in mixture
models by computing energy of their corresponding FV parts, and analyze their
effect on classification accuracy. Finally, we suggest a new method to
visualize the codewords of brain connectivity dictionary.

 <dc:description>  The large amount of work on community detection and its applications leaves
unaddressed one important question: the statistical validation of the results.
In this paper we present a methodology able to clearly detect if the community
structure found by some algorithms is statistically significant or is a result
of chance, merely due to edge positions in the network. Given a community
detection method and a network of interest, our proposal examines the stability
of the partition recovered against random perturbations of the original graph
structure. To address this issue, we specify a perturbation strategy and a null
model to build a set of procedures based on a special measure of clustering
distance, namely Variation of Information, using tools set up for functional
data analysis. The procedures determine whether the obtained clustering departs
significantly from the null model. This strongly supports the robustness
against perturbation of the algorithm used to identify the community structure.
We show the results obtained with the proposed technique on simulated and real
datasets.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification (re-id) is the task of matching multiple occurrences
of the same person from different cameras, poses, lighting conditions, and a
multitude of other factors which alter the visual appearance. Typically, this
is achieved by learning either optimal features or matching metrics which are
adapted to specific pairs of camera views dictated by the pairwise labelled
training datasets. In this work, we formulate a deep learning based novel
approach to automatic prototype-domain discovery for domain perceptive
(adaptive) person re-id (rather than camera pair specific learning) for any
camera views scalable to new unseen scenes without training data. We learn a
separate re-id model for each of the discovered prototype-domains and during
model deployment, use the person probe image to select automatically the model
of the closest prototype domain. Our approach requires neither supervised nor
unsupervised domain adaptation learning, i.e. no data available from the target
domains. We evaluate extensively our model under realistic re-id conditions
using automatically detected bounding boxes with low-resolution and partial
occlusion. We show that our approach outperforms most of the state-of-the-art
supervised and unsupervised methods on the latest CUHK-SYSU and PRW benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  To understand the sophisticated control mechanisms of the human's endocrine
system is a challenging task that is a crucial step towards precise medical
treatment of many disfunctions and diseases. Although mathematical models
describing the endocrine system as a whole are still elusive, recently some
substantial progress has been made in analyzing theoretically its subsystems
(or axes) that regulate production of specific hormones. Many of the relevant
mathematical models are similar in structure to (or squarely based on) the
celebrated Goodwin's oscillator. Such models are convenient to explain stable
periodic oscillations at hormones' level by representing the corresponding
endocrine regulation circuits as cyclic feedback systems. However, many real
hormonal regulation mechanisms (in particular, testosterone regulation) are in
fact known to have non-cyclic structures and involve multiple feedbacks; a
Goodwin-type model thus represents only a part of such a complicated mechanism.
In this paper, we examine a new mathematical model of hormonal regulation,
obtained from the classical Goodwin's oscillator by introducing an additional
negative feedback. Local stability properties of the proposed model are
studied, and we show that the local instability of its unique equilibrium
implies oscillatory behavior of almost all solutions. Furthermore, under
additional restrictions we prove that almost all solutions converge to periodic
ones.

 <dc:description>  Presence of a logically centralized controller in software-defined networks
enables smart and fine-grained management of network traffic. Generally,
traffic management includes measurement, analysis and control of traffic in
order to improve resource utilization. This is done by inspecting corresponding
performance requirements using metrics such as packet delay, jitter, loss rate
and bandwidth utilization from global network view. There has been many works
regarding traffic management of software-defined networks and how it could help
to efficiently allocate resources. However, the vast majority of these
solutions are bounded to indirect information retrieved within the border of
ingress and egress switches. This means that the three stage loop of
measurement, analysis and control is performed on switches in between this
border while the traffic flowing in network originates from applications on end
hosts. In this work, we present a framework for incorporating network
applications into the task of traffic management using the concept of
software-defined networking. We demonstrate how this could help applications to
receive desired level of quality of service by implementing a prototype of an
API for flow bandwidth reservation using OpenFlow and OVSDB protocols.

 <dc:description>  The supertree problem asking for a tree displaying a set of consistent input
trees has been largely considered for the reconstruction of species trees.
Here, we rather explore this framework for the sake of reconstructing a gene
tree from a set of input gene trees on partial data. In this perspective, the
phylogenetic tree for the species containing the genes of interest can be used
to choose among the many possible compatible &quot;supergenetrees&quot;, the most natural
criteria being to minimize a reconciliation cost. We develop a variety of
algorithmic solutions for the construction and correction of gene trees using
the supertree framework. A dynamic programming supertree algorithm for
constructing or correcting gene trees, exponential in the number of input
trees, is first developed for the less constrained version of the problem. It
is then adapted to gene trees with nodes labeled as duplication or speciation,
the additional constraint being to preserve the orthology and paralogy
relations between genes. Then, a quadratic time algorithm is developed for
efficiently correcting an initial gene tree while preserving a set of &quot;trusted&quot;
subtrees, as well as the relative phylogenetic distance between them, in both
cases of labeled or unlabeled input trees. By applying these algorithms to the
set of Ensembl gene trees, we show that this new correction framework is
particularly useful to correct weaklysupported duplication nodes. The C++
source code for the algorithms and simulations described in the paper are
available at https://github.com/UdeM-LBIT/SuGeT.

 <dc:title>Formalising Real Numbers in Homotopy Type Theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gilbert, Ga&#xeb;tan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cauchy reals can be defined as a quotient of Cauchy sequences of rationals.
The limit of a Cauchy sequence of Cauchy reals is defined through lifting it to
a sequence of Cauchy sequences of rationals. This lifting requires the axiom of
countable choice or excluded middle, neither of which is available in homotopy
type theory. To address this, the Univalent Foundations Program uses a higher
inductive-inductive type to define the Cauchy reals as the free Cauchy complete
metric space generated by the rationals. We generalize this construction to
define the free Cauchy complete metric space generated by an arbitrary metric
space. This forms a monad in the category of metric spaces with Lipschitz
functions. When applied to the rationals it defines the Cauchy reals. Finally,
we can use Altenkirch and Danielson (2016)'s partiality monad to define a
semi-decision procedure comparing a real number and a rational number.
  The entire construction has been formalized in the Coq proof assistant. It is
available at https://github.com/SkySkimmer/HoTTClasses/tree/CPP2017 .

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this study is to propose a model that predicts the social and
psychological factors that affect the individuals collaborative learning
outcome in group projects. The model is established on the basis of two
theories, namely, the multilevel analysis and the cooperative game theory
(CGT). In CGT, a group of players form a coalition and a set of payoffs for
each member in the coalition. Shapely values is one of the most important
solution concepts in CGT. It represents a fair and efficient distribution of
payoffs among members of a coalition. The proposed approach was applied on a
sample that consisted of 78 freshman students, in their first semester, who
were studying philosophical thinking course and instructed by the same
professor. Tools for the data collection included self-assessments, peer
assessments, quizzes and observations. The research concluded that learning
outcome and contribution are best prophesied by the extent of engagement the
content is purveying. Whereas personality traits, as well as, learning styles
have the least impact on contribution. In addition, results show that Shapley
values can be used as good vaticinators for individuals learning outcomes.
These results indicate that CGT can be used as a good engine for analyzing
interactions that recur in collaborative learning.

 <dc:description>  We investigate metric learning in the context of dynamic time warping (DTW),
the by far most popular dissimilarity measure used for the comparison and
analysis of motion capture data. While metric learning enables a
problem-adapted representation of data, the majority of meth- ods has been
proposed for vectorial data only. In this contribution, we extend the popular
principle offered by the large margin nearest neighbours learner (LMNN) to DTW
by treating the resulting component-wise dissimilarity values as features. We
demonstrate, that this principle greatly enhances the classification accuracy
in several benchmarks. Further, we show that recent auxiliary concepts such as
metric regularisation can be transferred from the vectorial case to
component-wise DTW in a similar way. We illustrate, that metric regularisation
constitutes a crucial prerequisite for the interpretation of the resulting
relevance profiles.

 <dc:description>  This letter presents an experimental study and a novel modelling approach of
the wireless channel of smart utility meters placed in basements or sculleries.
The experimental data consist of signal strength measurements of consumption
report packets. Since such packets are only registered if they can be decoded
by the receiver, the part of the signal strength distribution that falls below
the receiver sensitivity threshold is not observable. We combine a Rician
fading model with a bias function that captures the cut-off in the observed
signal strength measurements. Two sets of experimental data are analysed. It is
shown that the proposed method offers an approximation of the distribution of
the signal strength measurements that is better than a na\&quot;ive Rician fitting.

 <dc:title>Harmonic Sum-based Method for Heart Rate Estimation using PPG Signals
  Affected with Motion Artifacts</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Wearable photoplethysmography (WPPG) has recently become a common technology
in heart rate (HR) monitoring. General observation is that the motion artifacts
change the statistics of the acquired PPG signal. Consequently, estimation of
HR from such a corrupted PPG signal is challenging. However, if an
accelerometer is also used to acquire the acceleration signal simultaneously,
it can provide helpful information that can be used to reduce the motion
artifacts in the PPG signal. By dint of repetitive movements of the subjects
hands while running, the accelerometer signal is found to be quasi-periodic.
Over short-time intervals, it can be modeled by a finite harmonic sum (HSUM).
Using the harmonic sum (HSUM) model, we obtain an estimate of the instantaneous
fundamental frequency of the accelerometer signal. Since the PPG signal is a
composite of the heart rate information (that is also quasi-periodic) and the
motion artifact, we fit a joint harmonic sum (HSUM) model to the PPG signal.
One of the harmonic sums corresponds to the heart-beat component in PPG and the
other models the motion artifact. However, the fundamental frequency of the
motion artifact has already been determined from the accelerometer signal.
Subsequently, the HR is estimated from the joint HSUM model. The mean absolute
error in HR estimates was 0.7359 beats per minute (BPM) with a standard
deviation of 0.8328 BPM for 2015 IEEE Signal Processing (SP) cup data. The
ground-truth HR was obtained from the simultaneously acquired ECG for
validating the accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed method is compared
with four methods that were recently developed and evaluated on the same
dataset.

 <dc:title>Towards an Accurate Mathematical Model of Generic Nominally-Typed OOP</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The construction of GNOOP as a domain-theoretic model of generic
nominally-typed OOP is currently underway. This extended abstract presents the
concepts of `nominal intervals' and `full generication' that are likely to help
in building GNOOP as an accurate mathematical model of generic nominally-typed
OOP. The abstract also presents few related category-theoretic suggestions. The
presented concepts and suggestions are particularly geared towards enabling
GNOOP to offer a precise and simple view of so-far-hard-to-analyze features of
generic OOP such as variance annotations (e.g., Java wildcard types) and erased
generics (e.g., Java type erasure).

 <dc:title>Tropical Vertex-Disjoint Cycles of a Vertex-Colored Digraph: Barter
  Exchange with Multiple Items Per Agent</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In a barter exchange market, agents bring items and seek to exchange their
items with one another. Agents may agree to a k-way exchange involving a cycle
of k agents. A barter exchange market can be represented by a digraph where the
vertices represent items and the edges out of a vertex indicate the items that
an agent is willing to accept in exchange for that item. It is known that the
problem of finding a set of vertex-disjoint cycles with the maximum total
number of vertices (MAX-SIZE-EXCHANGE) can be solved in polynomial time. We
consider a barter exchange where each agent may bring multiple items, and items
of the same agent are represented by vertices with the same color. A set of
cycles is said to be tropical if for every color there is a cycle that contains
a vertex of that color. We show that the problem of determining whether there
exists a tropical set of vertex-disjoint cycles in a digraph
(TROPICAL-EXCHANGE) is NP-complete and Log-APX-hard. This is equivalent to
determining whether it is possible to arrange an exchange of items among agents
such that every agent trades away at least one item. TROPICAL-MAX-SIZE-EXCHANGE
is a similar problem, where the goal is to find a set of vertex-disjoint cycles
that contains the maximum number of vertices and also contains all of the
colors in the graph. We show that this problem is likewise NP-complete and
Log-APX-hard. For the restricted case where there are at most two vertices of
each color (corresponding to a restriction that each agent may bring at most
two items), both problems remain NP-hard but are in APX. Finally, we consider
MAX-SIZE-TROPICAL-EXCHANGE, where the set of cycles must primarily include as
many colors as possible and secondarily include as many vertices as possible.
We show that this problem is NP-hard.

 <dc:description>  FP-Growth algorithm is a Frequent Pattern Min- ing (FPM) algorithm that has
been extensively used to study correlations and patterns in large scale
datasets. While several researchers have designed distributed memory FP-Growth
algorithms, it is pivotal to consider fault tolerant FP-Growth, which can
address the increasing fault rates in large scale systems. In this work, we
propose a novel parallel, algorithm-level fault-tolerant FP-Growth algorithm.
We leverage algorithmic properties and MPI advanced features to guarantee an
O(1) space complexity, achieved by using the dataset memory space itself for
checkpointing. We also propose a recovery algorithm that can use in-memory and
disk-based checkpointing, though in many cases the recovery can be completed
without any disk access, and incurring no memory overhead for checkpointing. We
evaluate our FT algorithm on a large scale InfiniBand cluster with several
large datasets using up to 2K cores. Our evaluation demonstrates excellent
efficiency for checkpointing and recovery in comparison to the disk-based
approach. We have also observed 20x average speed-up in comparison to Spark,
establishing that a well designed algorithm can easily outperform a solution
based on a general fault-tolerant programming model.

 <dc:description>  Conditional gradient algorithms (also often called Frank-Wolfe algorithms)
are popular due to their simplicity of only requiring a linear optimization
oracle and more recently they also gained significant traction for online
learning. While simple in principle, in many cases the actual implementation of
the linear optimization oracle is costly. We show a general method to lazify
various conditional gradient algorithms, which in actual computations leads to
several orders of magnitude of speedup in wall-clock time. This is achieved by
using a faster separation oracle instead of a linear optimization oracle,
relying only on few linear optimization oracle calls.

 <dc:description>  Key-based workload partitioning is a common strategy used in parallel stream
processing engines, enabling effective key-value tuple distribution over worker
threads in a logical operator. While randomized hashing on the keys is capable
of balancing the workload for key-based partitioning when the keys generally
follow a static distribution, it is likely to generate poor balancing
performance when workload variance occurs on the incoming data stream. This
paper presents a new key-based workload partitioning framework, with practical
algorithms to support dynamic workload assignment for stateful operators. The
framework combines hash-based and explicit key-based routing strategies for
workload distribution, which specifies the destination worker threads for a
handful of keys and assigns the other keys with the hashing function. When
short-term distribution fluctuations occur to the incoming data stream, the
system adaptively updates the routing table containing the chosen keys, in
order to rebalance the workload with minimal migration overhead within the
stateful operator. We formulate the rebalance operation as an optimization
problem, with multiple objectives on minimizing state migration costs,
controlling the size of the routing table and breaking workload imbalance among
worker threads. Despite of the NP-hardness nature behind the optimization
formulation, we carefully investigate and justify the heuristics behind key
(re)routing and state migration, to facilitate fast response to workload
variance with ignorable cost to the normal processing in the distributed
system. Empirical studies on synthetic data and real-world stream applications
validate the usefulness of our proposals and prove the huge advantage of our
approaches over state-of-the-art solutions in the literature.

 <dc:description>  In this work we consider adversarial contextual bandits with risk
constraints. At each round, nature prepares a context, a cost for each arm, and
additionally a risk for each arm. The learner leverages the context to pull an
arm and then receives the corresponding cost and risk associated with the
pulled arm. In addition to minimizing the cumulative cost, the learner also
needs to satisfy long-term risk constraints -- the average of the cumulative
risk from all pulled arms should not be larger than a pre-defined threshold. To
address this problem, we first study the full information setting where in each
round the learner receives an adversarial convex loss and a convex constraint.
We develop a meta algorithm leveraging online mirror descent for the full
information setting and extend it to contextual bandit with risk constraints
setting using expert advice. Our algorithms can achieve near-optimal regret in
terms of minimizing the total cost, while successfully maintaining a sublinear
growth of cumulative risk constraint violation.

$\{1,\ldots,N\}$ without replacement on modern architectures. The main result
is a simple divide-and-conquer scheme that makes sequential algorithms more
cache efficient and leads to a parallel algorithm running in expected time
$\mathcal{O}\left(n/p+\log p\right)$ on $p$ processors. The amount of
communication between the processors is very small and independent of the
sample size. We also discuss modifications needed for load balancing, reservoir
sampling, online sampling, sampling with replacement, Bernoulli sampling, and
vectorization on SIMD units or GPUs.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes method for detection, estimation of Thevenin equivalent
parameters to describe power system behavior. Thevenin equivalent estimation is
a challenge due to variation in system states caused by power flow in the
network. Thevenin equivalent calculation based on changes in system with
multiple sources integrated with grid, isolated distributed generator system is
analysed and nonlinear least square fit estimation technique for algorithm is
adopted. Linear least square fit is used with a linearized model. Performance
evaluation of proposed method is carried out through mathematical model,
nonlinear and linear least square fit based algorithm technique and simulation
through MATLAB/SIMULINK package. Accurate grid and source side impedance
estimation technique is applicable for distributed generation sources
interfaced with grid to improve dynamic response, stability, reliability when
subjected to faults or any other disturbances in network. Algorithm can
accurately estimate Thevenin equivalent of multiple sources connected in
parallel simultaneously with voltage and current phasor measurements at point
of common coupling. Mathematical analysis and simulation results validate the
effectiveness of proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach to machine translation
that has made great progress in recent years. However, recent studies show that
NMT generally produces fluent but inadequate translations (Tu et al. 2016b; Tu
et al. 2016a; He et al. 2016; Tu et al. 2017). This is in contrast to
conventional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which usually yields
adequate but non-fluent translations. It is natural, therefore, to leverage the
advantages of both models for better translations, and in this work we propose
to incorporate SMT model into NMT framework. More specifically, at each
decoding step, SMT offers additional recommendations of generated words based
on the decoding information from NMT (e.g., the generated partial translation
and attention history). Then we employ an auxiliary classifier to score the SMT
recommendations and a gating function to combine the SMT recommendations with
NMT generations, both of which are jointly trained within the NMT architecture
in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on Chinese-English translation
show that the proposed approach achieves significant and consistent
improvements over state-of-the-art NMT and SMT systems on multiple NIST test
sets.

 <dc:title>Polylogarithmic Bounds on the Competitiveness of Min-cost (Bipartite)
  Perfect Matching with Delays</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of online Min-cost Perfect Matching with Delays
(MPMD) recently introduced by Emek et al, (STOC 2016). This problem is defined
on an underlying $n$-point metric space. An adversary presents real-time
requests online at points of the metric space, and the algorithm is required to
match them, possibly after keeping them waiting for some time. The cost
incurred is the sum of the distances between matched pairs of points (the
connection cost), and the sum of the waiting times of the requests (the delay
cost). We present an algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(\log n)$, which
improves the upper bound of $O(\log^2n+\log\Delta)$ of Emek et al, by removing
the dependence on $\Delta$, the aspect ratio of the metric space (which can be
unbounded as a function of $n$). The core of our algorithm is a deterministic
algorithm for MPMD on metrics induced by edge-weighted trees of height $h$,
whose cost is guaranteed to be at most $O(1)$ times the connection cost plus
$O(h)$ times the delay cost of every feasible solution. The reduction from MPMD
on arbitrary metrics to MPMD on trees is achieved using the result on embedding
$n$-point metric spaces into distributions over weighted hierarchically
separated trees of height $O(\log n)$, with distortion $O(\log n)$. We also
prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ on the competitive ratio of any
randomized algorithm. This is the first lower bound which increases with $n$,
and is attained on the metric of $n$ equally spaced points on a line.
  The problem of Min-cost Bipartite Perfect Matching with Delays (MBPMD) is the
same as MPMD except that every request is either positive or negative, and
requests can be matched only if they have opposite polarity. We prove an upper
bound of $O(\log n)$ and a lower bound of $\Omega(\log^{1/3}n)$ on the
competitive ratio of MBPMD with a more involved analysis.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of inferring a grammar describing the output of a
functional program given a grammar describing its input. Solutions to this
problem are helpful for detecting bugs or proving safety properties of
functional programs, and several rewriting tools exist for solving this
problem. However, known grammar inference techniques are not able to take
evaluation strategies of the program into account. This yields very imprecise
results when the evaluation strategy matters. In this work, we adapt the Tree
Automata Completion algorithm to approximate accurately the set of terms
reachable by rewriting under the innermost strategy. We formally prove that the
proposed technique is sound and precise w.r.t. innermost rewriting. We show
that those results can be extended to the leftmost and rightmost innermost
case. The algorithms for the general innermost case have been implemented in
the Timbuk reachability tool. Experiments show that it noticeably improves the
accuracy of static analysis for functional programs using the call-by-value
evaluation strategy.

 <dc:title>The Peaking Phenomenon in Semi-supervised Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For the supervised least squares classifier, when the number of training
objects is smaller than the dimensionality of the data, adding more data to the
training set may first increase the error rate before decreasing it. This,
possibly counterintuitive, phenomenon is known as peaking. In this work, we
observe that a similar but more pronounced version of this phenomenon also
occurs in the semi-supervised setting, where instead of labeled objects,
unlabeled objects are added to the training set. We explain why the learning
curve has a more steep incline and a more gradual decline in this setting
through simulation studies and by applying an approximation of the learning
curve based on the work by Raudys &amp; Duin.

 <dc:description>  The human action classification task is a widely researched topic and is
still an open problem. Many state-of-the-arts approaches involve the usage of
bag-of-video-words with spatio-temporal local features to construct
characterizations for human actions. In order to improve beyond this standard
approach, we investigate the usage of co-occurrences between local features. We
propose the usage of co-occurrences information to characterize human actions.
A trade-off factor is used to define an optimal trade-off between vocabulary
size and classification rate. Next, a spatio-temporal co-occurrence technique
is applied to extract co-occurrence information between labeled local features.
Novel characterizations for human actions are then constructed. These include a
vector quantized correlogram-elements vector, a highly discriminative PCA
(Principal Components Analysis) co-occurrence vector and a Haralick texture
vector. Multi-channel kernel SVM (support vector machine) is utilized for
classification. For evaluation, the well known KTH as well as the challenging
UCF-Sports action datasets are used. We obtained state-of-the-arts
classification performance. We also demonstrated that we are able to fully
utilize co-occurrence information, and improve the standard bag-of-video-words
approach.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach and database which combines the inexpensive
generation of 3D object models via monocular or RGB-D camera images with 3D
printing and a state of the art object tracking algorithm. Unlike recent
efforts towards the creation of 3D object databases for robotics, our approach
does not require expensive and controlled 3D scanning setups and enables anyone
with a camera to scan, print and track complex objects for manipulation
research. The proposed approach results in highly detailed mesh models whose 3D
printed replicas are at times difficult to distinguish from the original. A key
motivation for utilizing 3D printed objects is the ability to precisely control
and vary object properties such as the mass distribution and size in the 3D
printing process to obtain reproducible conditions for robotic manipulation
research. We present CapriDB - an extensible database resulting from this
approach containing initially 40 textured and 3D printable mesh models together
with tracking features to facilitate the adoption of the proposed approach.

high-frequency, low-level &quot;spinal&quot; network with access to proprioceptive
sensors learns sensorimotor primitives by training on simple tasks. This
pre-trained module is fixed and connected to a low-frequency, high-level
&quot;cortical&quot; network, with access to all sensors, which drives behavior by
modulating the inputs to the spinal network. Where a monolithic end-to-end
architecture fails completely, learning with a pre-trained spinal module
succeeds at multiple high-level tasks, and enables the effective exploration
required to learn from sparse rewards. We test our proposed architecture on
three simulated bodies: a 16-dimensional swimming snake, a 20-dimensional

 <dc:title>Dynamic Buffer Management for Multimedia QoS in Beyond 3G Wireless
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yerima, Suleiman Y.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a dynamic buffer management scheme for QoS control of
multimedia services in beyond 3G wireless systems. The scheme is studied in the
context of the state-of-the-art 3.5G system i.e. the High Speed Downlink Packet
Access (HSDPA) which enhances 3G UMTS to support high-speed packet switched
services. Unlike earlier systems, UMTS-evolved systems from HSDPA and beyond
incorporate mechanisms such as packet scheduling and HARQ in the base station
necessitating data buffering at the air interface. This introduces a potential
bottleneck to end-to-end communication. Hence, buffer management at the air
interface is crucial for end-to-end QoS support of multimedia services with
multiplexed parallel diverse flows such as video and data in the same end-user
session. The dynamic buffer management scheme for HSDPA multimedia sessions
with aggregated real-time and non real-time flows is investigated via extensive
HSDPA simulations. The impact of the scheme on end-to-end traffic performance
is evaluated with an example multimedia session comprising a real-time
streaming flow concurrent with TCP-based non real-time flow. Results
demonstrate that the scheme can guarantee the end-to-end QoS of the real-time
streaming flow, whilst simultaneously protecting the non real-time flow from
starvation resulting in improved end-to-end throughput performance.

 <dc:description>  The capability of a given channel to communicate information is, a priori,
distinct from its capability to distribute shared randomness. In this article
we define randomness distribution capacities of quantum channels assisted by
forward, back, or two-way classical communication and compare these to the
corresponding communication capacities. With forward assistance or no
assistance, we find that they are equal. We establish the mutual information of
the channel as an upper bound on the two-way assisted randomness distribution
capacity. This implies that all of the capacities are equal for
classical-quantum channels. On the other hand, we show that the back-assisted
randomness distribution capacity of a quantum-classical channels is equal to
its mutual information. This is often strictly greater than the back-assisted
communication capacity. We give an explicit example of such a separation where
the randomness distribution protocol is noiseless.

 <dc:description>  We consider a set of learning agents in a collaborative peer-to-peer network,
where each agent learns a personalized model according to its own learning
objective. The question addressed in this paper is: how can agents improve upon
their locally trained model by communicating with other agents that have
similar objectives? We introduce and analyze two asynchronous gossip algorithms
running in a fully decentralized manner. Our first approach, inspired from
label propagation, aims to smooth pre-trained local models over the network
while accounting for the confidence that each agent has in its initial model.
In our second approach, agents jointly learn and propagate their model by
making iterative updates based on both their local dataset and the behavior of
their neighbors. To optimize this challenging objective, our decentralized
algorithm is based on ADMM.

 <dc:description>  Antennas of transmitters and receivers have been manipulated to increase the
capacity of transmission and reception of signals. Using many elements in
antennas to shape beams and direct nulls in a particular point for optimum
signal transmission and reception has over decades, had tremendous positive
influence in received power and signal to noise ratio (SNR). However, since the
antenna elements manipulation can be done both at base station and device
terminal, it gives rise to an important method of using several antennas to put
and obtain signals to and from space with increased capacity. This principle is
termed Multiple-input and Multiple-output (MIMO). This paper discusses
application of MIMO in the state of the art and next generation of wireless
systems (5G). It also discusses four models of MIMO, SISO, SIMO, MISO and MIMO,
considering three method of combing the signals from multipath propagations,
Selection combining (SC), Equal gain combing (EGC) and maximum ratio combining
(MRC). Spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing are also discussed as form of
MIMO. Finally, Massive or Hyper MIMO which is a new method of increasing
transmission capacity by very large scale for fifth generation of wireless
system is discussed with its challenges and opportunities. Key terms-Diversity
combining techniques, spatial multiplexing, channel state information (CSI).
Massive MIMO
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This is a simple review on the state of the art of MIMO and the
  future. It tries to address what Massive MIMO which is the MIMO that is
  expected to work for 5G networks will look like. Another generation of
  wireless networks is expected by 2020. It is simply written for educational
  purpose and not any commercial use. It is intended to help those trying to
  build knowledge in this area</dc:description>

 <dc:title>Achieving Perfect Location Privacy in Wireless Devices Using

 <dc:description>  The popularity of mobile devices and location-based services (LBS) has
created great concern regarding the location privacy of their users.
Anonymization is a common technique that is often used to protect the location
privacy of LBS users. Here, we present an information-theoretic approach to
define the notion of perfect location privacy. We show how LBS's should use the
anonymization method to ensure that their users can achieve perfect location
privacy. First, we assume that a user's current location is independent from
her past locations. Using this i.i.d model, we show that if the pseudonym of
the user is changed before $O(n^{\frac{2}{r-1}})$ observations are made by the
adversary for that user, then the user has perfect location privacy. Here, n is
the number of the users in the network and r is the number of all possible
locations that users can go to. Next, we model users' movements using Markov
chains to better model real-world movement patterns. We show that perfect
location privacy is achievable for a user if the user's pseudonym is changed

the user, where |E| is the number of edges in the user's Markov chain model.

 <dc:description>  Subspace clustering refers to the problem of segmenting data drawn from a
union of subspaces. State-of-the-art approaches for solving this problem follow
a two-stage approach. In the first step, an affinity matrix is learned from the
data using sparse or low-rank minimization techniques. In the second step, the
segmentation is found by applying spectral clustering to this affinity. While
this approach has led to state-of-the-art results in many applications, it is
sub-optimal because it does not exploit the fact that the affinity and the
segmentation depend on each other. In this paper, we propose a joint
optimization framework --- Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering (S$^3$C) ---
for learning both the affinity and the segmentation. The proposed S$^3$C
framework is based on expressing each data point as a structured sparse linear
combination of all other data points, where the structure is induced by a norm
that depends on the unknown segmentation. Moreover, we extend the proposed
S$^3$C framework into Constrained Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering
(CS$^3$C) in which available partial side-information is incorporated into the
stage of learning the affinity. We show that both the structured sparse
representation and the segmentation can be found via a combination of an
alternating direction method of multipliers with spectral clustering.
Experiments on a synthetic data set, the Extended Yale B data set, the Hopkins
155 motion segmentation database, and three cancer data sets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most fast-growing field in high
technologies nowadays. Therefore, lots of electronic devices include wireless
connections with several communication protocols (WiFi, ZigBee, Sigfox, LoRa
and so on). Nevertheless, designers of such components do not take care of
security features most of the time while focusing on communication reliability
(speed, throughput and low power consumption). As a consequence, several
wireless IoT devices transmit data in plaintext creating lots of security
breaches for both eavesdropping and data injection attacks. This work
introduces KeyJack, a preliminary proof-of-concept of a solution aiming to
eavesdrop wireless devices and hopefully perform injection attacks afterwards.
KeyJack operates on widely-used devices: our keyboards! This solution is based
on low-cost embedded electronics and gives an attacker or a white hat hacker
the possibility to retrieve data from John Doe's computer. This work also shows
that this approach could be used to any wireless device using 2.4GHz radio
chips like the NRF24L01 from Nordic Semiconductor.

 <dc:description>  The Gromov-Hausdorff distance provides a metric on the set of isometry
classes of compact metric spaces. Unfortunately, computing this metric directly
is believed to be computationally intractable. Motivated by applications in
shape matching and point-cloud comparison, we study a semidefinite programming
relaxation of the Gromov-Hausdorff metric. This relaxation can be computed in
polynomial time, and somewhat surprisingly is itself a pseudometric. We
describe the induced topology on the set of compact metric spaces. Finally, we
demonstrate the numerical performance of various algorithms for computing the
relaxed distance and apply these algorithms to several relevant data sets. In
particular we propose a greedy algorithm for finding the best correspondence
between finite metric spaces that can handle hundreds of points.

 <dc:description>  Various variants of the well known Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) have been proposed recently, which improve the empirical
performance of the original algorithm by structural modifications. However, in
practice it is often unclear which variation is best suited to the specific
optimization problem at hand. As one approach to tackle this issue, algorithmic
mechanisms attached to CMA-ES variants are considered and extracted as
functional \emph{modules}, allowing for combinations of them. This leads to a
configuration space over ES structures, which enables the exploration of
algorithm structures and paves the way toward novel algorithm generation.
Specifically, eleven modules are incorporated in this framework with two or
three alternative configurations for each module, resulting in $4\,608$
algorithms. A self-adaptive Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to efficiently
evolve effective ES-structures for given classes of optimization problems,
outperforming any classical CMA-ES variants from literature. The proposed
approach is evaluated on noiseless functions from BBOB suite. Furthermore, such
an observation is again confirmed on different function groups and
dimensionality, indicating the feasibility of ES configuration on real-world
problem classes.

 <dc:description>  A quantum network promises to enable long distance quantum communication, and
assemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each
network node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits
can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by
means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant
network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a
virtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once.
  Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from
computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage
entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each
quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a
physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to
create long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features
unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing
techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes
for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these
topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to
be stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing
decisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the virtual quantum links in a
model of entanglement generation.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the development of neural machine translation (NMT) has
significantly improved the translation quality of automatic machine
translation. While most sentences are more accurate and fluent than
translations by statistical machine translation (SMT)-based systems, in some
cases, the NMT system produces translations that have a completely different
meaning. This is especially the case when rare words occur.
  When using statistical machine translation, it has already been shown that
significant gains can be achieved by simplifying the input in a preprocessing
step. A commonly used example is the pre-reordering approach.
  In this work, we used phrase-based machine translation to pre-translate the
input into the target language. Then a neural machine translation system
generates the final hypothesis using the pre-translation. Thereby, we use
either only the output of the phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) system or
a combination of the PBMT output and the source sentence.
  We evaluate the technique on the English to German translation task. Using
this approach we are able to outperform the PBMT system as well as the baseline
neural MT system by up to 2 BLEU points. We analyzed the influence of the
quality of the initial system on the final result.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of nonparametric dependence detection. Many existing
methods suffer severe power loss due to non-uniform consistency, which we
illustrate with a paradox. To avoid such power loss, we approach the
nonparametric test of independence through the new framework of binary
expansion statistics (BEStat) and binary expansion testing (BET), which examine
dependence through a novel binary expansion filtration approximation of the
copula. Through a Hadamard-Walsh transform, we find that the cross interactions
of binary variables in the filtration are complete sufficient statistics for
dependence. These interactions are also uncorrelated under the null. By
utilizing these interactions, the BET avoids the problem of non-uniform
consistency and improves upon a wide class of commonly used methods (a) by
achieving the minimax rate in sample size requirement for specified power and
(b) by providing clear interpretations of global and local relationships upon
rejection of independence. The binary expansion approach also connects the test
statistics with the current computing system to facilitate efficient bitwise
implementation. We illustrate the BET by a study of the distribution of stars
in the night sky and by an exploratory data analysis of the TCGA breast cancer
data.

 <dc:description>  Conversational speech recognition has served as a flagship speech recognition
task since the release of the Switchboard corpus in the 1990s. In this paper,
we measure the human error rate on the widely used NIST 2000 test set, and find
that our latest automated system has reached human parity. The error rate of
professional transcribers is 5.9% for the Switchboard portion of the data, in
which newly acquainted pairs of people discuss an assigned topic, and 11.3% for
the CallHome portion where friends and family members have open-ended
conversations. In both cases, our automated system establishes a new state of
the art, and edges past the human benchmark, achieving error rates of 5.8% and
11.0%, respectively. The key to our system's performance is the use of various
convolutional and LSTM acoustic model architectures, combined with a novel
spatial smoothing method and lattice-free MMI acoustic training, multiple
recurrent neural network language modeling approaches, and a systematic use of
system combination.

 <dc:description>  Like many numerical methods, solvers for initial value problems (IVPs) on
ordinary differential equations estimate an analytically intractable quantity,
using the results of tractable computations as inputs. This structure is
closely connected to the notion of inference on latent variables in statistics.
We describe a class of algorithms that formulate the solution to an IVP as
inference on a latent path that is a draw from a Gaussian process probability
measure (or equivalently, the solution of a linear stochastic differential
equation). We then show that certain members of this class are connected
precisely to generalized linear methods for ODEs, a number of Runge--Kutta
methods, and Nordsieck methods. This probabilistic formulation of classic
methods is valuable in two ways: analytically, it highlights implicit prior
assumptions favoring certain approximate solutions to the IVP over others, and
gives a precise meaning to the old observation that these methods act like
filters. Practically, it endows the classic solvers with `docking points' for
notions of uncertainty and prior information about the initial value, the value
of the ODE itself, and the solution of the problem.

 <dc:description>  The sensitivity (i.e. dynamic response) of complex networked systems has not
been well understood, making difficult to predict whether new macroscopic
dynamic behavior will emerge even if we know exactly how individual nodes
behave and how they are coupled. Here we build a framework to quantify the
sensitivity of complex networked system of coupled dynamic units. We
characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of new
macroscopic dynamic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. We prove that these
conditions are satisfied only for architectures with power-law degree
distributions. Surprisingly, we find that highly connected nodes (i.e. hubs)
only dominate the sensitivity of the network up to certain critical frequency.

 <dc:title>Rule Extraction Algorithm for Deep Neural Networks: A Review</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hailesilassie, Tameru</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Despite the highest classification accuracy in wide varieties of application
areas, artificial neural network has one disadvantage. The way this Network
comes to a decision is not easily comprehensible. The lack of explanation
ability reduces the acceptability of neural network in data mining and decision
system. This drawback is the reason why researchers have proposed many rule
extraction algorithms to solve the problem. Recently, Deep Neural Network (DNN)
is achieving a profound result over the standard neural network for
classification and recognition problems. It is a hot machine learning area
proven both useful and innovative. This paper has thoroughly reviewed various
rule extraction algorithms, considering the classification scheme:
decompositional, pedagogical, and eclectics. It also presents the evaluation of
these algorithms based on the neural network structure with which the algorithm
is intended to work. The main contribution of this review is to show that there
is a limited study of rule extraction algorithm from DNN.

 <dc:description>  Coquand's cubical set model for homotopy type theory provides the basis for a
computational interpretation of the univalence axiom and some higher inductive
types, as implemented in the cubical proof assistant. This paper contributes to
the understanding of this model. We make three contributions:
  1. Johnstone's topological topos was created to present the geometric
realization of simplicial sets as a geometric morphism between toposes.
Johnstone shows that simplicial sets classify strict linear orders with
disjoint endpoints and that (classically) the unit interval is such an order.
Here we show that it can also be a target for cubical realization by showing
that Coquand's cubical sets classify the geometric theory of flat distributive
lattices. As a side result, we obtain a simplicial realization of a cubical
set.
  2. Using the internal `interval' in the topos of cubical sets, we construct a
Moore path model of identity types.
  3. We construct a premodel structure internally in the cubical type theory
and hence on the fibrant objects in cubical sets.

 <dc:description>  In animal monitoring applications, both animal detection and their movement
prediction are major tasks. While a variety of animal monitoring strategies
exist, most of them rely on mounting devices. However, in real world, it is
difficult to find these animals and install mounting devices. In this paper, we
propose an animal monitoring application by utilizing wireless sensor networks
(WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The objective of the application is
to detect locations of endangered species in large-scale wildlife areas and
monitor movement of animals without any attached devices. In this application,
sensors deployed throughout the observation area are responsible for gathering
animal information. The UAV flies above the observation area and collects the
information from sensors. To achieve the information efficiently, we propose a
path planning approach for the UAV based on a Markov decision process (MDP)
model. The UAV receives a certain amount of reward from an area if some animals
are detected at that location. We solve the MDP using Q-learning such that the
UAV prefers going to those areas that animals are detected before. Meanwhile,
the UAV explores other areas as well to cover the entire network and detects
changes in the animal positions. We first define the mathematical model
underlying the animal monitoring problem in terms of the value of information
(VoI) and rewards. We propose a network model including clusters of sensor
nodes and a single UAV that acts as a mobile sink and visits the clusters.
Then, one MDP-based path planning approach is designed to maximize the VoI
while reducing message delays. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
evaluated using two real-world movement datasets of zebras and leopard.
Simulation results show that our approach outperforms greedy, random heuristics
and the path planning based on the traveling salesman problem.

 <dc:description>  We present new versions of the previously published C and CUDA programs for

propagation in imaginary or real time. Presented programs are improved and
parallelized versions of previous programs, divided into three packages
according to the type of parallelization. First package contains improved and
threaded version of sequential C programs using OpenMP. Second package
additionally parallelizes three-dimensional variants of the OpenMP programs
using MPI, allowing them to be run on distributed-memory systems. Finally,
previous three-dimensional CUDA-parallelized programs are further parallelized
using MPI, similarly as the OpenMP programs. We also present speedup test
results obtained using new versions of programs in comparison with the previous
sequential C and parallel CUDA programs. The improvements to the sequential
version yield a speedup of 1.1 to 1.9, depending on the program. OpenMP
parallelization yields further speedup of 2 to 12 on a 16-core workstation,
while OpenMP/MPI version demonstrates a speedup of 11.5 to 16.5 on a computer
cluster with 32 nodes used. CUDA/MPI version shows a speedup of 9 to 10 on a
computer cluster with 32 nodes.

 <dc:description>  Link prediction aims to uncover the underlying relationship behind networks,
which could be utilized to predict the missing edges or identify the spurious
edges, and attracts much attention from various fields. The key issue of link
prediction is to estimate the likelihood of two nodes in networks. Most current
approaches of link prediction base on static structural analysis and ignore the
temporal aspects of evolving networks. Unlike previous work, in this paper, we
propose a popularity based structural perturbation method (PBSPM) that
characterizes the similarity of an edge not only from existing connections of
networks, but also from the popularity of its two endpoints, since popular
nodes have much more probability to form links between themselves. By taking
popularity of nodes into account, PBSPM could suppress nodes that have high
importance, but gradually become inactive. Therefore the proposed method is
inclined to predict potential edges between active nodes, rather than edges
between inactive nodes. Experimental results on four real networks show that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both in accuracy
and robustness in evolving networks.

 <dc:title>How Well Do Local Algorithms Solve Semidefinite Programs?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Several probabilistic models from high-dimensional statistics and machine
learning reveal an intriguing --and yet poorly understood-- dichotomy. Either
simple local algorithms succeed in estimating the object of interest, or even
sophisticated semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations fail.
  In order to explore this phenomenon, we study a classical SDP relaxation of
the minimum graph bisection problem, when applied to Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random
graphs with bounded average degree $d&gt;1$, and obtain several types of results.
First, we use a dual witness construction (using the so-called non-backtracking
matrix of the graph) to upper bound the SDP value. Second, we prove that a
simple local algorithm approximately solves the SDP to within a factor
$2d^2/(2d^2+d-1)$ of the upper bound. In particular, the local algorithm is at
most $8/9$ suboptimal, and $1+O(1/d)$ suboptimal for large degree.
  We then analyze a more sophisticated local algorithm, which aggregates
information according to the harmonic measure on the limiting Galton-Watson
(GW) tree. The resulting lower bound is expressed in terms of the conductance
of the GW tree and matches surprisingly well the empirically determined SDP
values on large-scale Erd\H{o}s-Renyi graphs.
  We finally consider the planted partition model. In this case, purely local
algorithms are known to fail, but they do succeed if a small amount of side
information is available. Our results imply quantitative bounds on the
threshold for partial recovery using SDP in this model.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a new way to create smooth piecewise polynomial free-form
spline surfaces from quad- meshes that include T-junctions, where surface
strips start or terminate. All mesh nodes can be interpreted as control points
of geometrically-smooth, piecewise polynomials that we call GT-splines.
GT-splines are B-spline-like and cover T-junctions by two or four patches of
degree bi-4. They complement multi-sided surface constructions in generating
free-form surfaces with adaptive layout. Since GT-splines do not require a
global coordination of knot intervals, GT-constructions are easy to deploy and
can provide smooth surfaces with T-junctions where T-splines can not have a
smooth parameterization. GT-constructions display a uniform highlight line
distribution on input meshes where alternatives, such as Catmull-Clark
subdivision, exhibit oscillations.

 <dc:description>  Over the past decade, online social media has had a tremendous impact on the
way people engage in social activism. For instance, about 26M Facebook users
expressed their support in upholding the cause of marriage equality by
overlaying their profile pictures with rainbow-colored filters. Similarly,
hundreds of thousands of users changed their profile pictures to a black dot
condemning incidents of sexual violence in India. This act of demonstrating
support for social causes by changing online profile pictures is being referred
to as pictivism. In this paper, we analyze the psycho-demographic profiles,
social networking behavior, and personal interests of users who participated in
the Facebook Rainbow campaign. Our study is based on a sample of about 800K
detailed profiles of Facebook users combining questionnaire-based psychological
scores with Facebook profile data. Our analysis provides detailed insights into
psycho-demographic profiles of the campaign participants. We found that
personality traits such as openness and neuroticism are both positively
associated with the likelihood of supporting the campaign, while
conscientiousness exhibited a negative correlation. We also observed that
females, religious disbelievers, democrats and adults in the age group of 20 to
30 years are more likely to be a part of the campaign. Our research further
confirms the findings of several previous studies which suggest that a user is
more likely to participate in an online campaign if a large fraction of his/her
friends are already doing so. We also developed machine learning models for
predicting campaign participation. Users' personal interests, approximated by
Facebook user like activity, turned out to be the best indicator of campaign
participation. Our results demonstrated that a predictive model which leverages
the aforementioned features accurately identifies campaign participants
(AUC=0.76).

In this paper, we extend existing end-to-end attention-based models that can be

performs sequence prediction directly at the character level. To gain a better

 <dc:title>Compact Linearization for Binary Quadratic Problems subject to

 <dc:description>  We prove new necessary and sufficient conditions to carry out a compact
linearization approach for a general class of binary quadratic problems subject
to assignment constraints as it has been proposed by Liberti in 2007. The new
conditions resolve inconsistencies that can occur when the original method is
used. We also present a mixed-integer linear program to compute a
minimally-sized linearization. When all the assignment constraints have
non-overlapping variable support, this program is shown to have a totally
unimodular constraint matrix. Finally, we give a polynomial-time combinatorial
algorithm that is exact in this case and can still be used as a heuristic
otherwise.

 <dc:description>  Achieving safe control under uncertainty is a key problem that needs to be
tackled for enabling real-world autonomous robots and cyber-physical systems.
This paper introduces Probabilistic Safety Programs (PSP) that embed both the
uncertainty in the environment as well as invariants that determine safety
parameters. The goal of these PSPs is to evaluate future actions or
trajectories and determine how likely it is that the system will stay safe
under uncertainty. We propose to perform these evaluations by first compiling
the PSP to a graphical model then using a fast variational inference algorithm.
We highlight the efficacy of the framework on the task of safe control of
quadrotors and autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.

 <dc:description>  Crowdsourcing is the primary means to generate training data at scale, and
when combined with sophisticated machine learning algorithms, crowdsourcing is
an enabler for a variety of emergent automated applications impacting all
spheres of our lives. This paper surveys the emerging field of formally
reasoning about and optimizing open-ended crowdsourcing, a popular and
crucially important, but severely understudied class of crowdsourcing---the
next frontier in crowdsourced data management. The underlying challenges
include distilling the right answer when none of the workers agree with each
other, teasing apart the various perspectives adopted by workers when answering
tasks, and effectively selecting between the many open-ended operators
appropriate for a problem. We describe the approaches that we've found to be
effective for open-ended crowdsourcing, drawing from our experiences in this
space.

 <dc:description>  In many security and healthcare systems a sequence of features/sensors/tests
are used for detection and diagnosis. Each test outputs a prediction of the
latent state, and carries with it inherent costs. Our objective is to {\it
learn} strategies for selecting tests to optimize accuracy \&amp; costs.
Unfortunately it is often impossible to acquire in-situ ground truth
annotations and we are left with the problem of unsupervised sensor selection
(USS). We pose USS as a version of stochastic partial monitoring problem with
an {\it unusual} reward structure (even noisy annotations are unavailable).
Unsurprisingly no learner can achieve sublinear regret without further
assumptions. To this end we propose the notion of weak-dominance. This is a
condition on the joint probability distribution of test outputs and latent
state and says that whenever a test is accurate on an example, a later test in
the sequence is likely to be accurate as well. We empirically verify that weak
dominance holds on real datasets and prove that it is a maximal condition for

 <dc:description>  The number of optimization techniques in the combinatorial domain is large
and diversified. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of real benchmarks to
validate optimization algorithms. In this work we introduce VRPBench, a tool to
create instances and visualize solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
in a planar graph embedded in the Euclidean 2D space. We use VRPBench to model
a real-world mail delivery case of the city of Artur Nogueira. Such scenarios
were characterized as a multi-objective optimization of the VRP. We extracted a
weighted graph from a digital map of the city to create a challenging benchmark
for the VRP. Each instance models one generic day of mail delivery with
hundreds to thousands of delivery points, thus allowing both the comparison and
validation of optimization algorithms for routing problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce two indoor Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
positioning methods using augmented sparse recovery algorithms. These schemes
render a sparse user's position vector, and in parallel, minimize the distance
between the online measurement and radio map. The overall localization scheme
for both methods consists of three steps: 1) coarse localization, obtained from
comparing the online measurements with clustered radio map. A novel graph-based
method is proposed to cluster the offline fingerprints. In the online phase, a
Region Of Interest (ROI) is selected within which we search for the user's
location; 2) Access Point (AP) selection; and 3) fine localization through the
novel sparse recovery algorithms. Since the online measurements are subject to
inordinate measurement readings, called outliers, the sparse recovery methods
are modified in order to jointly estimate the outliers and user's position
vector. The outlier detection procedure identifies the APs whose readings are
either not available or erroneous. The proposed localization methods have been
tested with Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements in a typical office
environment and the results show that they can localize the user with
significantly high accuracy and resolution which is superior to the results
from competing WLAN fingerprinting localization methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces novel schemes for indoor localization, outlier
detection, and radio map interpolation using Wireless Local Area Networks
(WLANs). The localization method consists of a novel multicomponent
optimization technique that minimizes the squared $\ell_{2}$-norm of the
residuals between the radio map and the online Received Signal Strength (RSS)
measurements, the $\ell_{1}$-norm of the user's location vector, and weighted
$\ell_{2}$-norms of layered groups of Reference Points (RPs). RPs are grouped
using a new criterion based on the similarity between the so-called Access
Point (AP) coverage vectors. In addition, since AP readings are prone to
containing inordinate readings, called outliers, an augmented optimization
problem is proposed to detect the outliers and localize the user with cleaned
online measurements. Moreover, a novel scheme to record fingerprints from a
smaller number of RPs and estimate the radio map at RPs without recorded
fingerprints is developed using sparse recovery techniques. All localization
schemes are tested on RSS fingerprints collected from a real environment. The
overall scheme has comparable complexity with competing approaches, while it
performs with high accuracy under a small number of APs and finer granularity
of RPs.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) has become a promising choice for indoor
positioning as the only existing and established infrastructure, to localize
the mobile and stationary users indoors. However, since WLAN has been initially
designed for wireless networking and not positioning, the localization task
based on WLAN signals has several challenges. Amongst the WLAN positioning
methods, WLAN fingerprinting localization has recently achieved great attention
due to its promising results. WLAN fingerprinting faces several challenges and
hence, in this paper, our goal is to overview these challenges and the
state-of-the-art solutions. This paper consists of three main parts: 1)
Conventional localization schemes; 2) State-of-the-art approaches; 3) Practical
deployment challenges. Since all the proposed methods in WLAN literature have
been conducted and tested in different settings, the reported results are not
equally comparable. So, we compare some of the main localization schemes in a
single real environment and assess their localization accuracy, positioning
error statistics, and complexity. Our results depict illustrative evaluation of
WLAN localization systems and guide to future improvement opportunities.

 <dc:description>  At the tipping point, it is known that small incident can trigger dramatic
societal shift. Getting early-warning signals for such changes are valuable to
avoid detrimental outcomes such as riots or collapses of nations. However, it
is notoriously hard to capture the processes of such transitions in the
real-world. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of a major shift in public
opinion in the form of political support. Instead of simple swapping of ruling
parties, we study the regime shift of a party popularity based on its
attractiveness by examining the American presidential elections during
1980-2012. A single irreversible transition is detected in 1991. Once a
transition happens, recovery to the original level of attractiveness does not
bring popularity of the political party back. Remarkably, this transition is
corroborated by tell-tale early-warning signature of critical slowing down. Our
approach is applicable to shifts in public attitude within any social system.

 <dc:title>Proximal Algorithms and Temporal Differences for Large Linear Systems:
  Extrapolation, Approximation, and Simulation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bertsekas, Dimitri P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider large linear fixed point problems and solution with
proximal algorithms. We show that, under certain assumptions, there is a close
connection between proximal iterations, which are prominent in numerical
analysis and optimization, and multistep methods of the temporal difference
type such as TD(lambda), LSTD(lambda), and LSPE(lambda), which are central in
simulation-based approximate dynamic programming. As an application of this
connection, we show that we may accelerate the standard proximal algorithm by
extrapolation towards the multistep iteration, which generically has a faster
convergence rate. We also use the connection with multistep methods to
integrate into the proximal algorithmic context several new ideas that have
emerged in the approximate dynamic programming context. In particular, we
consider algorithms that project each proximal iterate onto the subspace
spanned by a small number of basis functions, using low-dimensional
calculations and simulation, and we discuss various algorithmic options from
approximate dynamic programming.

 <dc:description>  With the seamless coverage of wireless cellular networks in modern society,
it is interesting to consider the shape of wireless cellular coverage. Is the
shape a regular hexagon, an irregular polygon, or another complex geometrical
shape? Based on fractal theory, the statistical characteristic of the wireless
cellular coverage boundary is determined by the measured wireless cellular data
collected from Shanghai, China. The measured results indicate that the wireless
cellular coverage boundary presents an extremely irregular geometrical shape,
which is also called a statistical fractal shape. Moreover, the statistical
fractal characteristics of the wireless cellular coverage boundary have been
validated by values of the Hurst parameter estimated in angular scales. The
statistical fractal characteristics of the wireless cellular coverage boundary
can be used to evaluate and design the handoff scheme of mobile user terminals
in wireless cellular networks.

 <dc:description>  To have a robot actively supporting a human during a collaborative task, it
is crucial that robots are able to identify the current action in order to
predict the next one. Common approaches make use of high-level knowledge, such
as object affordances, semantics or understanding of actions in terms of pre-
and post-conditions. These approaches often require hand-coded a priori
knowledge, time- and resource-intensive or supervised learning techniques.
  We propose to reframe this problem as an appearance-based place recognition
problem. In our framework, we regard sequences of visual images of human
actions as a map in analogy to the visual place recognition problem. Observing
the task for the second time, our approach is able to recognize pre-observed
actions in a one-shot learning approach and is thereby able to recognize the
current observation in the task space. We propose two new methods for creating
and aligning action observations within a task map. We compare and verify our
approaches with real data of humans assembling several types of IKEA flat
packs.

 <dc:title>A Tensor Network Kalman filter with an application in recursive MIMO

 <dc:description>  This article introduces a Tensor Network Kalman filter, which can estimate
state vectors that are exponentially large without ever having to explicitly
construct them. The Tensor Network Kalman filter also easily accommodates the
case where several different state vectors need to be estimated simultaneously.
The key lies in rewriting the standard Kalman equations as tensor equations and
then implementing them using Tensor Networks, which effectively transforms the
exponential storage cost and computational complexity into a linear one. We
showcase the power of the proposed framework through an application in
recursive nonlinear system identification of high-order discrete-time
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Volterra systems. The identification
problem is transformed into a linear state estimation problem wherein the state
vector contains all Volterra kernel coefficients and is estimated using the
Tensor Network Kalman filter. The accuracy and robustness of the scheme are
demonstrated via numerical experiments, which show that updating the Kalman
filter estimate of a state vector of length $10^9$ and its covariance matrix
takes about 0.007s on a standard desktop computer in Matlab.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchical modulation (HM) is able to provide different levels of
protection for data streams and achieve a rate region that cannot be realized
by traditional orthogonal schemes, such as time division (TD). Nevertheless,
criterions and algorithms for general HM design are not available in existing
literatures. In this paper, we jointly optimize the constellation positions and
binary labels for HM to be used in additive white gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel. Based on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) with successive
interference cancellation (SIC) capacity, our main purpose is to maximize the
rate of one data stream, with power constrains and the constrain that the rate
of other data streams should be larger than given thresholds. Multi-start
interior-point algorithm is used to carry out the constellation optimization
problems and methods to reduce optimization complexity are also proposed in
this paper. Numerical results verify the performance gains of optimized HM
compared with optimized quadrature amplidude modulation (QAM) based HM and
other orthogonal transmission methods.

 <dc:description>  When delegations to an assembly or council represent differently sized
constituencies, they are often allocated voting weights which increase in
population numbers (EU Council, US Electoral College, etc.). The Penrose square
root rule (PSRR) is the main benchmark for fair representation of all
bottom-tier voters in the top-tier decision making body, but rests on the
restrictive assumption of independent binary decisions. We consider intervals
of alternatives with single-peaked preferences instead, and presume positive
correlation of local voters. This calls for a replacement of the PSRR by a
linear Shapley rule: representation is fair if the Shapley value of the
delegates is proportional to their constituency sizes.

 <dc:description>  To improve the performance of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for early

\TheName{} -- a novel framework for \emph{\underline{E}HR based
\underline{E}arly \underline{D}etection of \underline{D}iseases} on top of
\emph{Covariance-Regularized} LDA models. Specifically, \TheName\ employs a
\emph{non-sparse} inverse covariance matrix (or namely precision matrix)
estimator derived from graphical lasso and incorporates the estimator into LDA
classifiers to improve classification accuracy. Theoretical analysis on
\TheName\ shows that it can bound the expected error rate of LDA
classification, under certain assumptions. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments using a large-scale real-world EHR dataset -- CHSN. We compared our
solution with other regularized LDA and downstream classifiers. The result
shows \TheName\ outperforms all baselines and backups our theoretical analysis.

 <dc:title>Makespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding via Reductions to
  Propositional Satisfiability</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Surynek, Pavel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of makespan optimal solving of cooperative path finding (CPF) is
addressed in this paper. The task in CPF is to relocate a group of agents in a
non-colliding way so that each agent eventually reaches its goal location from
the given initial location. The abstraction adopted in this work assumes that
agents are discrete items moving in an undirected graph by traversing edges.
Makespan optimal solving of CPF means to generate solutions that are as short
as possi-ble in terms of the total number of time steps required for the
execution of the solution.
  We show that reducing CPF to propositional satisfiability (SAT) represents a
viable option for obtaining makespan optimal solutions. Several encodings of
CPF into propositional formulae are suggested and experimentally evaluated. The
evaluation indicates that SAT based CPF solving outperforms other makespan
optimal methods significantly in highly constrained situations (environments
that are densely occupied by agents).

 <dc:description>  Mobile applications and on-body devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous
tools for physical activity tracking. We propose utilizing a self-tracker's
habits to support continuous prediction of whether they will reach their daily
step goal, thus enabling a variety of potential persuasive interventions. Our
aim is to improve the prediction by leveraging historical data and other
qualitative (motivation for using the systems, location, gender) and,
quantitative (age) features. We have collected datasets from two activity
tracking platforms (Moves and Fitbit) and aim to check if the model we derive
from one is generalizable over the other. In the following paper we establish a
pipeline for extracting the data and formatting it for modeling. We discuss the
approach we took and our findings while selecting the features and
classification models for the dataset. We further discuss the notion of
generalizability of the model across different types of dataset and the
probable inclusion of non standard features to further improve the model's
accuracy.

 <dc:description>  The language that we produce reflects our personality, and various personal
and demographic characteristics can be detected in natural language texts. We
focus on one particular personal trait of the author, gender, and study how it
is manifested in original texts and in translations. We show that author's
gender has a powerful, clear signal in originals texts, but this signal is
obfuscated in human and machine translation. We then propose simple
domain-adaptation techniques that help retain the original gender traits in the
translation, without harming the quality of the translation, thereby creating
more personalized machine translation systems.

 <dc:description>  Digital forensic evidence acquisition speed is traditionally limited by two
main factors: the read speed of the storage device being investigated, i.e.,
the read speed of the disk, memory, remote storage, mobile device, etc.), and
the write speed of the system used for storing the acquired data. Digital
forensic investigators can somewhat mitigate the latter issue through the use
of high-speed storage options, such as networked RAID storage, in the
controlled environment of the forensic laboratory. However, traditionally,
little can be done to improve the acquisition speed past its physical read
speed from the target device itself. The protracted time taken for data
acquisition wastes digital forensic experts' time, contributes to digital
forensic investigation backlogs worldwide, and delays pertinent information
from potentially influencing the direction of an investigation. In a remote
acquisition scenario, a third contributing factor can also become a detriment
to the overall acquisition time - typically the Internet upload speed of the
acquisition system. This paper explores an alternative to the traditional
evidence acquisition model through the leveraging of a forensic data
deduplication system. The advantages that a deduplicated approach can provide
over the current digital forensic evidence acquisition process are outlined and
some preliminary results of a prototype implementation are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning (ML) is believed to be an effective and efficient tool to
build reliable prediction model or extract useful structure from an avalanche
of data. However, ML is also criticized by its difficulty in interpretation and
complicated parameter tuning. In contrast, visualization is able to well
organize and visually encode the entangled information in data and guild
audiences to simpler perceptual inferences and analytic thinking. But large
scale and high dimensional data will usually lead to the failure of many
visualization methods. In this paper, we close a loop between ML and
visualization via interaction between ML algorithm and users, so machine
intelligence and human intelligence can cooperate and improve each other in a
mutually rewarding way. In particular, we propose &quot;transparent boosting tree
(TBT)&quot;, which visualizes both the model structure and prediction statistics of
each step in the learning process of gradient boosting tree to user, and
involves user's feedback operations to trees into the learning process. In TBT,
ML is in charge of updating weights in learning model and filtering information
shown to user from the big data, while visualization is in charge of providing
a visual understanding of ML model to facilitate user exploration. It combines
the advantages of both ML in big data statistics and human in decision making
based on domain knowledge. We develop a user friendly interface for this novel
learning method, and apply it to two datasets collected from real applications.
Our study shows that making ML transparent by using interactive visualization
can significantly improve the exploration of ML algorithms, give rise to novel
insights of ML models, and integrates both machine and human intelligence.

 <dc:description>  The rating score prediction is widely studied in recommender system, which
predicts the rating scores of users on items through making use of the
user-item interaction information. Besides the rating information between users
and items, lots of additional information have been employed to promote
recommendations, such as social relation and geographic location. Expenditure
information on each transaction between users and items is widely available on
e-commerce websites, often appearing next to the rating information, while
there is seldom study on the correlation between expenditures and rating
scores. In this paper, we first study their correlations in real data sets and
propose the expenditure aware rating prediction problem. From the data sets
crawled from a well-known social media platform Dianping in China, we find some
insightful correlations between expenditures and rating scores: 1) transactions
or experiences with higher expenditures usually lead to higher rating scores;
2) when the real expenditures are higher than users' normal spending behavior,
the users usually give higher scores; and 3) there are multiple grades of
expenditure behaviors. Based on these three observations, we propose an
Expenditure ware RatingPrediction method (EARP), based on low-rank matrix
factorization, to effectively incorporate the expenditure information.
Extensive experiments on five real data sets show that EARP not only always
outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines but also discovers the latent
characteristics of users and businesses.

 <dc:description>  The automatic analysis of the surgical process, from videos recorded during
surgeries, could be very useful to surgeons, both for training and for
acquiring new techniques. The training process could be optimized by
automatically providing some targeted recommendations or warnings, similar to
the expert surgeon's guidance. In this paper, we propose to reuse videos
recorded and stored during cataract surgeries to perform the analysis. The
proposed system allows to automatically recognize, in real time, what the
surgeon is doing: what surgical phase or, more precisely, what surgical step he
or she is performing. This recognition relies on the inference of a multilevel
statistical model which uses 1) the conditional relations between levels of
description (steps and phases) and 2) the temporal relations among steps and
among phases. The model accepts two types of inputs: 1) the presence of
surgical tools, manually provided by the surgeons, or 2) motion in videos,
automatically analyzed through the Content Based Video retrieval (CBVR)
paradigm. Different data-driven statistical models are evaluated in this paper.
For this project, a dataset of 30 cataract surgery videos was collected at
Brest University hospital. The system was evaluated in terms of area under the
ROC curve. Promising results were obtained using either the presence of
surgical tools ($A_z$ = 0.983) or motion analysis ($A_z$ = 0.759). The
generality of the method allows to adapt it to any kinds of surgeries. The
proposed solution could be used in a computer assisted surgery tool to support
surgeons during the surgery.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a sequential sensor scheduling and remote estimation
problem with one sensor and one estimator. The sensor makes sequential
observations about the state of an underlying memoryless stochastic process and
makes a decision as to whether or not to send this measurement to the
estimator. The sensor and the estimator have the common objective of minimizing
expected distortion in the estimation of the state of the process, over a
finite time horizon. The sensor is either charged a cost for each transmission
or constrained on transmission times. As opposed to the prior work where
communication between the sensor and the estimator was assumed to be perfect
(noiseless), in this work an additive noise channel with fixed power constraint
is considered; hence, the sensor has to encode its message before transmission.
Under some technical assumptions, we obtain the optimal encoding and estimation
policies in conjunction with the optimal transmission schedule. The impact of
the presence of a noisy channel is analyzed numerically based on dynamic
programming. This analysis yields some rather surprising results such as a
phase transition phenomenon in the number of used transmission opportunities,
which was not encountered in the noiseless communication setting.

 <dc:description>  Electrical machines commonly consist of moving and stationary parts. The
field simulation of such devices can be very demanding if the underlying
numerical scheme is solely based on a domain discretization, such as in case of
the Finite Element Method (FEM). Here, a coupling scheme based on FEM together
with Boundary Element Methods (BEM) is presented that neither hinges on
re-meshing techniques nor deals with a special treatment of sliding interfaces.
While the numerics are certainly more involved the reward is obvious: The
modeling costs decrease and the application engineer is provided with an
easy-to-use, versatile, and accurate simulation tool.

 <dc:description>  As a wide class of resource management problems in wireless communications
are nonconvex and even NP-hard in many cases, finding globally optimal
solutions to these problems is of little practical interest. Towards more
pragmatic approaches, there is a rich literature on iterative methods aiming at
finding a solution satisfying necessary optimality conditions to these
problems. These approaches have been derived under several similar mathematical
frameworks such as inner approximation algorithm, concave-convex procedure,
majorization-minimization algorithm, and successive convex approximation (SCA).
However, a large portion of existing algorithms arrive at a relatively generic
program at each iteration, which is less computationally efficient compared to
a more standard convex formulation. This paper proposes \emph{numerically
efficient} transformations and approximations for SCA-based methods to deal
with nonconvexity in wireless communications design. More specifically, the
central goal is to show that various nonconvex problems in wireless
communications can be iteratively solved by conic quadratic optimization. We
revisit various examples to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
approximations. Theoretical complexity analysis and numerical results show the
superior efficiency in terms of computational cost of our proposed solutions
compared to the existing ones.

 <dc:description>  Federated Learning is a machine learning setting where the goal is to train a
high-quality centralized model while training data remains distributed over a
large number of clients each with unreliable and relatively slow network
connections. We consider learning algorithms for this setting where on each
round, each client independently computes an update to the current model based
on its local data, and communicates this update to a central server, where the
client-side updates are aggregated to compute a new global model. The typical
clients in this setting are mobile phones, and communication efficiency is of
the utmost importance.
  In this paper, we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs:
structured updates, where we directly learn an update from a restricted space
parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g. either low-rank or a
random mask; and sketched updates, where we learn a full model update and then
compress it using a combination of quantization, random rotations, and
subsampling before sending it to the server. Experiments on both convolutional
and recurrent networks show that the proposed methods can reduce the
communication cost by two orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  Complexity theory provides a wealth of complexity classes for analyzing the
complexity of decision and counting problems. Despite the practical relevance
of enumeration problems, the tools provided by complexity theory for this
important class of problems are very limited. In particular, complexity classes
analogous to the polynomial hierarchy and an appropriate notion of problem
reduction are missing. In this work, we lay the foundations for a complexity
theory of hard enumeration problems by proposing a hierarchy of complexity
classes and by investigating notions of reductions for enumeration problems.

 <dc:description>  Reconstructing weighted networks from partial information is necessary in
many important circumstances, e.g. for a correct estimation of systemic risk.
It has been shown that, in order to achieve an accurate reconstruction, it is
crucial to reliably replicate the empirical degree sequence, which is however
unknown in many realistic situations. More recently, it has been found that the
knowledge of the degree sequence can be replaced by the knowledge of the
strength sequence, which is typically accessible, complemented by that of the
total number of links, thus considerably relaxing the observational
requirements. Here we further relax these requirements and devise a procedure
valid when even the the total number of links is unavailable. We assume that,
apart from the heterogeneity induced by the degree sequence itself, the network
is homogeneous, so that its (global) link density can be estimated by sampling
subsets of nodes with representative density. We show that the best way of
sampling nodes is the random selection scheme, any other procedure being biased
towards unrealistically large, or small, link densities. We then introduce our
core technique for reconstructing both the topology and the link weights of the
unknown network in detail. When tested on real economic and financial data
sets, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy and is very robust with respect
to the sampled subsets, thus representing a reliable practical tool whenever
the available topological information is restricted to small portions of nodes.

 <dc:description>  Consider a hypergraph $H_n^d$ where the vertices are points of the
$d$-dimensional combinatorial cube $n^d$ and the edges are all sets of $n$
points such that they are in one line. We study the structure of the group of
automorphisms of $H_n^d$, i.e., permutations of points of $n^d$ preserving the
edges. In this paper we provide a complete characterization. Moreover, we
consider the Colored Cube Isomorphism problem of deciding whether for two
colorings of the vertices of $H_n^d$ there exists an automorphism of $H_n^d$
preserving the colors. We show that this problem is ${\sf GI}$-complete.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an asynchronous incremental aggregated gradient algorithm
and its implementation in a parameter server framework for solving regularized
optimization problems. The algorithm can handle both general convex (possibly
non-smooth) regularizers and general convex constraints. When the empirical
data loss is strongly convex, we establish linear convergence rate, give
explicit expressions for step-size choices that guarantee convergence to the
optimum, and bound the associated convergence factors. The expressions have an
explicit dependence on the degree of asynchrony and recover classical results
under synchronous operation. Simulations and implementations on commercial
compute clouds validate our findings.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes Team Delft's robot, which won the Amazon Picking
Challenge 2016, including both the Picking and the Stowing competitions. The
goal of the challenge is to automate pick and place operations in unstructured
environments, specifically the shelves in an Amazon warehouse. Team Delft's
robot is based on an industrial robot arm, 3D cameras and a customized gripper.
The robot's software uses ROS to integrate off-the-shelf components and modules
developed specifically for the competition, implementing Deep Learning and
other AI techniques for object recognition and pose estimation, grasp planning
and motion planning. This paper describes the main components in the system,
and discusses its performance and results at the Amazon Picking Challenge 2016
finals.

 <dc:description>  Chemically or optically powered active matter plays an increasingly important
role in materials design but its computational potential has yet to be explored
systematically. The competition between energy consumption and dissipation
imposes stringent physical constraints on the information transport in active
flow networks, facilitating global optimization strategies that are not well
understood. Here, we combine insights from recent microbial experiments with
concepts from lattice-field theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to
introduce a generic theoretical framework for active matter logic (AML).
Highlighting conceptual differences with classical and quantum computation, we
demonstrate how the inherent non-locality of incompressible active flow
networks can be utilized to construct universal logical operations, Fredkin
gates and memory storage in SR latches through the synchronized
self-organization of many individual network components. Our work lays the
conceptual foundation for developing autonomous microfluidic transport devices
driven by bacterial fluids, active liquid crystals or chemically engineered
motile colloids.

 <dc:title>Active Network Alignment: A Matching-Based Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Malmi, Eric</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Network alignment is the problem of matching the nodes of two graphs,
maximizing the similarity of the matched nodes and the edges between them. This
problem is encountered in a wide array of applications-from biological networks
to social networks to ontologies-where multiple networked data sources need to
be integrated. Due to the difficulty of the task, an accurate alignment can
rarely be found without human assistance. Thus, it is of great practical
importance to develop network alignment algorithms that can optimally leverage
experts who are able to provide the correct alignment for a small number of
nodes. Yet, only a handful of existing works address this active network
alignment setting.
  The majority of the existing active methods focus on absolute queries (&quot;are
nodes $a$ and $b$ the same or not?&quot;), whereas we argue that it is generally
easier for a human expert to answer relative queries (&quot;which node in the set
$\{b_1, \ldots, b_n\}$ is the most similar to node $a$?&quot;). This paper
introduces two novel relative-query strategies, TopMatchings and
GibbsMatchings, which can be applied on top of any network alignment method
that constructs and solves a bipartite matching problem. Our methods identify
the most informative nodes to query by sampling the matchings of the bipartite
graph associated to the network-alignment instance.
  We compare the proposed approaches to several commonly-used query strategies
and perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our
sampling-based strategies yield the highest overall performance, outperforming
all the baseline methods by more than 15 percentage points in some cases. In
terms of accuracy, TopMatchings and GibbsMatchings perform comparably. However,
GibbsMatchings is significantly more scalable, but it also requires
hyperparameter tuning for a temperature parameter.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this work is to classify the aerospace structure defects detected
by eddy current non-destructive testing. The proposed method is based on the
assumption that the defect is bound to the reaction of the probe coil impedance
during the test. Impedance plane analysis is used to extract a feature vector
from the shape of the coil impedance in the complex plane, through the use of
some geometric parameters. Shape recognition is tested with three different
machine-learning based classifiers: decision trees, neural networks and Naive
Bayes. The performance of the proposed detection system are measured in terms
of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and Matthews correlation
coefficient. Several experiments are performed on dataset of eddy current
signal samples for aircraft structures. The obtained results demonstrate the
usefulness of our approach and the competiveness against existing descriptors.

 <dc:description>  This study concerns with the diagnosis of aerospace structure defects by
applying a HPC parallel implementation of a novel learning algorithm, named
U-BRAIN. The Soft Computing approach allows advanced multi-parameter data
processing in composite materials testing. The HPC parallel implementation
overcomes the limits due to the great amount of data and the complexity of data
processing. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the
U-BRAIN parallel implementation as defect classifier in aerospace structures.
The resulting system is implemented on a Linux-based cluster with multi-core
architecture.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the impact of different types of features applied to
learning to re-rank questions in community Question Answering. We tested our
models on two datasets released in SemEval-2016 Task 3 on &quot;Community Question
Answering&quot;. Task 3 targeted real-life Web fora both in English and Arabic. Our
models include bag-of-words features (BoW), syntactic tree kernels (TKs), rank
features, embeddings, and machine translation evaluation features. To the best
of our knowledge, structural kernels have barely been applied to the question
reranking task, where they have to model paraphrase relations. In the case of
the English question re-ranking task, we compare our learning to rank (L2R)
algorithms against a strong baseline given by the Google-generated ranking
(GR). The results show that i) the shallow structures used in our TKs are
robust enough to noisy data and ii) improving GR is possible, but effective BoW
features and TKs along with an accurate model of GR features in the used L2R
algorithm are required. In the case of the Arabic question re-ranking task, for
the first time we applied tree kernels on syntactic trees of Arabic sentences.
Our approaches to both tasks obtained the second best results on SemEval-2016
subtasks B on English and D on Arabic.

 <dc:description>  Today's Internet utilizes a multitude of different protocols. While some of
these protocols were first implemented and used and later documented, other
were first specified and then implemented. Regardless of how protocols came to
be, their definitions can contain traps that lead to insecure implementations
or deployments. A classical example is insufficiently strict authentication
requirements in a protocol specification. The resulting Misconfigurations,
i.e., not enabling strong authentication, are common root causes for Internet
security incidents. Indeed, Internet protocols have been commonly designed
without security in mind which leads to a multitude of misconfiguration traps.
While this is slowly changing, to strict security considerations can have a
similarly bad effect. Due to complex implementations and insufficient
documentation, security features may remain unused, leaving deployments
vulnerable.
  In this paper we provide a systematization of the security traps found in
common Internet protocols. By separating protocols in four classes we identify
major factors that lead to common security traps. These insights together with
observations about end-user centric usability and security by default are then
used to derive recommendations for improving existing and designing new
protocols---without such security sensitive traps for operators, implementors
and users.

 <dc:description>  Since the first online demonstration of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) by
LISA, NMT development has recently moved from laboratory to production systems
as demonstrated by several entities announcing roll-out of NMT engines to
replace their existing technologies. NMT systems have a large number of
training configurations and the training process of such systems is usually
very long, often a few weeks, so role of experimentation is critical and
important to share. In this work, we present our approach to production-ready
systems simultaneously with release of online demonstrators covering a large
variety of languages (12 languages, for 32 language pairs). We explore
different practical choices: an efficient and evolutive open-source framework;
data preparation; network architecture; additional implemented features; tuning
for production; etc. We discuss about evaluation methodology, present our first
findings and we finally outline further work.
  Our ultimate goal is to share our expertise to build competitive production
systems for &quot;generic&quot; translation. We aim at contributing to set up a
collaborative framework to speed-up adoption of the technology, foster further
research efforts and enable the delivery and adoption to/by industry of
use-case specific engines integrated in real production workflows. Mastering of
the technology would allow us to build translation engines suited for
particular needs, outperforming current simplest/uniform systems.

The latter consists in recognizing the operation phase for each frames of
endoscopic videos. In this technical report, we compare several classification
models and temporal smoothing methods. Our submitted solution is a fine tuned
Residual Network-200 on 80% of the training set with temporal smoothing using
simple temporal averaging of the predictions and a Hidden Markov Model modeling
the sequence.

 <dc:title>Weighted Positive Binary Decision Diagrams for Exact Probabilistic

 <dc:description>  Recent work on weighted model counting has been very successfully applied to
the problem of probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. The probability
distribution is encoded into a Boolean normal form and compiled to a target
language, in order to represent local structure expressed among conditional
probabilities more efficiently. We show that further improvements are possible,
by exploiting the knowledge that is lost during the encoding phase and
incorporating it into a compiler inspired by Satisfiability Modulo Theories.
Constraints among variables are used as a background theory, which allows us to
optimize the Shannon decomposition. We propose a new language, called Weighted
Positive Binary Decision Diagrams, that reduces the cost of probabilistic
inference by using this decomposition variant to induce an arithmetic circuit
of reduced size.

 <dc:description>  Conceived in the early 1990s, Experience Replay (ER) has been shown to be a
successful mechanism to allow online learning algorithms to reuse past
experiences. Traditionally, ER can be applied to all machine learning paradigms
(i.e., unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning). Recently, ER has
contributed to improving the performance of deep reinforcement learning. Yet,
its application to many practical settings is still limited by the memory
requirements of ER, necessary to explicitly store previous observations. To
remedy this issue, we explore a novel approach, Online Contrastive Divergence
with Generative Replay (OCD_GR), which uses the generative capability of
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) instead of recorded past experiences. The
RBM is trained online, and does not require the system to store any of the
observed data points. We compare OCD_GR to ER on 9 real-world datasets,
considering a worst-case scenario (data points arriving in sorted order) as
well as a more realistic one (sequential random-order data points). Our results
show that in 64.28% of the cases OCD_GR outperforms ER and in the remaining
35.72% it has an almost equal performance, while having a considerably reduced
space complexity (i.e., memory usage) at a comparable time complexity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a causal analog to the purely observational Dynamic
Bayesian Networks, which we call Dynamic Causal Networks. We provide a sound
and complete algorithm for identification of Dynamic Causal Net- works, namely,
for computing the effect of an intervention or experiment, based on passive
observations only, whenever possible. We note the existence of two types of
confounder variables that affect in substantially different ways the iden-
tification procedures, a distinction with no analog in either Dynamic Bayesian
Networks or standard causal graphs. We further propose a procedure for the
transportability of causal effects in Dynamic Causal Network settings, where
the re- sult of causal experiments in a source domain may be used for the
identification of causal effects in a target domain.

 <dc:description>  An important goal of online comparison shopping services is to &quot;convert&quot; a
viewer from general product category pages (for example product groups such as
&quot;smartphones&quot; or &quot;air-conditioners&quot;) to detailed product pages and ultimately
to order pages. Comparison shopping websites provide a familiar web interface
as well as a chance for consumers to purchase items at competitive prices. In
return for providing access to a large market of potential consumers, the
comparison shopping service usually receives financial compensation for product
clicks and orders. This study looked at 2.5 million product listing visits at
price.com.hk to determine whether a modification in the way prices are
displayed on general category pages resulted in more &quot;conversions&quot; to product
detail pages. We found a statistically significant improvement over-all as a
result of the new price display resulting in 3.6% more product clicks over all
categories. Additional analysis showed that the effect is heterogeneous among
different categories, and in a few cases there may be some categories
negatively affected by the display modification.

 <dc:description>  Information entropy has been proved to be an effective tool to quantify the
structural importance of complex networks. In the previous work (Xu et al, 2016
\cite{xu2016}), we measure the contribution of a path in link prediction with
information entropy. In this paper, we further quantify the contribution of a
path with both path entropy and path weight, and propose a weighted prediction
index based on the contributions of paths, namely Weighted Path Entropy (WPE),
to improve the prediction accuracy in weighted networks. Empirical experiments
on six weighted real-world networks show that WPE achieves higher prediction
accuracy than three typical weighted indices.

 <dc:description>  Numerous automatic continuous emotion detection system studies have examined
mostly use of videos and images containing individual person expressing
emotions. This study examines the detection of spontaneous emotions in a group
and crowd settings. Edge detection was used with a grid of lines
superimposition to extract the features. The feature movement in terms of
movement from the reference point was used to track across sequences of images
from the color channel. Additionally the video data capturing was done on
spontaneous emotions invoked by watching sports events from group of
participants. The method was view and occlusion independent and the results
were not affected by presence of multiple people chaotically expressing various
emotions. The edge thresholds of 0.2 and grid thresholds of 20 showed the best
accuracy results. The overall accuracy of the group emotion classifier was
70.9%.

 <dc:description>  The goal of our research is to develop methods advancing automatic visual
recognition. In order to predict the unique or multiple labels associated to an
image, we study different kind of Deep Neural Networks architectures and
methods for supervised features learning. We first draw up a state-of-the-art
review of the Convolutional Neural Networks aiming to understand the history
behind this family of statistical models, the limit of modern architectures and
the novel techniques currently used to train deep CNNs. The originality of our
work lies in our approach focusing on tasks with a low amount of data. We
introduce different models and techniques to achieve the best accuracy on
several kind of datasets, such as a medium dataset of food recipes (100k
images) for building a web API, or a small dataset of satellite images (6,000)
for the DSG online challenge that we've won. We also draw up the
state-of-the-art in Weakly Supervised Learning, introducing different kind of
CNNs able to localize regions of interest. Our last contribution is a
framework, build on top of Torch7, for training and testing deep models on any
visual recognition tasks and on datasets of any scale.

 <dc:title>A Scalable Multi-Stage Packet-Switch for Data Center Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  The growing trends of data centers over last decades including social
networking, cloud-based applications and storage technologies enabled many
advances to take place in the networking area. Recent changes imply continuous
demand for bandwidth to manage the large amount of packetized traffic. Cluster
switches and routers make the switching fabric in a Data Center Network (DCN)
environment and provide interconnectivity between elements of the same DC and
inter DCs. To handle the constantly variable loads, switches need deliver
outstanding throughput along with resiliency and scalability for DCN
requirements. Conventional DCN switches adopt crossbars or/and blocks of
memories mounted in a multistage fashion (commonly 2-Tiers or 3-Tiers).
However, current multistage switches, with their space-memory variants, are
either too complex to implement, have poor performance, or not cost effective.
We propose a novel and highly scalable multistage switch based on
Networks-on-Chip (NoC) fabrics for DCNs. In particular, we describe a
three-stage Clos packet-switch with a Round Robin packets dispatching scheme
where each central stage module is based on a Unidirectional NoC (UDN), instead
of the conventional single-hop crossbar. The design, referred to as Clos-UDN,
overcomes shortcomings of traditional multistage architectures as it (i)
Obviates the need for a complex and costly input modules, by means of few, yet
simple, input FIFO queues. (ii) Avoids the need for a complex and synchronized
scheduling process over a high number of input-output modules and/or port
pairs. (iii) Provides speedup, load balancing and path-diversity thanks to a
dynamic dispatching scheme as well as the NoC based fabric nature. Simulations
show that the Clos-UDN outperforms some common multistage switches under a
range of input traffics, making it highly appealing for ultra-high capacity DC
networks.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a Deep convolutional network model for Identity-Aware
Transfer (DIAT) of facial attributes. Given the source input image and the
reference attribute, DIAT aims to generate a facial image (i.e., target image)
that not only owns the reference attribute but also keep the same or similar
identity to the input image. We develop a two-stage scheme to transfer the
input image to each reference attribute label. A feed-forward transform network
is first trained by combining perceptual identity-aware loss and GAN-based
attribute loss, and a face enhancement network is then introduced to improve
the visual quality. We further define perceptual identity loss on the
convolutional feature maps of the attribute discriminator, resulting in a
DIAT-A model. Our DIAT and DIAT-A models can provide a unified solution for
several representative facial attribute transfer tasks such as expression
transfer, accessory removal, age progression, and gender transfer. The
experimental results validate their effectiveness. Even for some
identity-related attribute (e.g., gender), our DIAT-A can obtain visually
impressive results by changing the attribute while retaining most identity
features of the source image.

 <dc:description>  Channel estimation is of critical importance in millimeter-wave (mmWave)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Due to the use of large antenna
arrays, low-complexity mmWave specific channel estimation algorithms are
required. In this paper, an auxiliary beam pair design is proposed to provide
high-resolution estimates of the channel's angle-of-departure (AoD) and
angle-of-arrival (AoA) for mmWave MIMO systems. By performing an amplitude
comparison with respect to each auxiliary beam pair, a set of ratio measures
that characterize the channel's AoD and AoA are obtained by the receiver.
Either the best ratio measure or the estimated AoD is quantized and fed back to
the transmitter via a feedback channel. The proposed technique can be
incorporated into control channel design to minimize initial access delay.
Though the design principles are derived assuming a high-power regime,
evaluation under more realistic assumption shows that by employing the proposed
method, good angle estimation performance is achieved under various
signal-to-noise ratio levels and channel conditions.

 <dc:description>  The use of a functional language to implement proof strategies as proof
tactics in interactive theorem provers, often provides short, concise and
elegant implementations. Whilst being elegant, the use of higher order features
and combinator languages often results in a very procedural view of a strategy,
which may deviate significantly from the high-level ideas behind it. This can
make a tactic hard to understand and hence difficult to to debug and maintain
for experts and non-experts alike: one often has to tear apart complex
combinations of lower level tactics manually in order to analyse a failure in
the overall strategy. In an industrial technology transfer project, we have
been working on porting a very large and complex proof tactic into PSGraph, a
graphical language for representing proof strategies, supported by the Tinker
tool. The goal of this work is to improve understandability and maintainability
of tactics. Motivated by some initial successes with this, we here extend
PSGraph with additional features for development and debugging. Through the
re-implementation and refactoring of several existing tactics, we demonstrates
the advantages of PSGraph compared with a typical linear (term-based) tactic
language with respect to debugging, readability and maintenance. In order to
act as guidance for others, we give a fairly detailed comparison of the user
experience with the two approaches. The paper is supported by a web page
providing further details about the implementation as well as interactive
illustrations of the examples.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we study the optimal configuration of the physical layer in
wireless networks by means of Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) modeling. In
particular, assume the physical layer is characterized by a set of potential
operating points, with each point corresponding to a rate and reliability pair;
for example, these pairs might be obtained through a now-standard
diversity-vs-multiplexing tradeoff characterization. Given the current network
state (e.g., buffer occupancies), a Decision Maker (DM) needs to dynamically
decide which operating point to use. The SMDP problem formulation allows us to
choose from these pairs an optimal selection, which is expressed by a decision
rule as a function of the number of awaiting packets in the source's finite
queue, channel state, size of the packet to be transmitted. We derive a general
solution which covers various model configurations, including packet size
distributions and varying channels. For the specific case of exponential
transmission time, we analytically prove the optimal policy has a threshold
structure. Numerical results validate this finding, as well as depict
muti-threshold policies for time varying channels such as the Gilber-Elliott
channel.

 <dc:description>  The k-means algorithm is one of the most common clustering algorithms and
widely used in data mining and pattern recognition. The increasing
computational requirement of big data applications makes hardware acceleration
for the k-means algorithm necessary. In this paper, a simplified Map-Reduce
architecture is proposed to implement the k-means algorithm on an FPGA.
Algorithmic segmentation, data path elaboration and automatic control are
applied to optimize the architecture for high performance. In addition, high
level synthesis technique is utilized to reduce development cycles and
complexity. For a single iteration in the k-means algorithm, a throughput of
28.74 Gbps is achieved. The performance shows at least 3.93x speedup compared
with four representative existing FPGA-based implementations and can satisfy
the demand of big data applications.

 <dc:description>  A promising approach to defend against side channel attacks is to build
programs that are leakage resilient, in a formal sense. One such formal notion
of leakage resilience is the n-threshold-probing model proposed in the seminal
work by Ishai et al. In a recent work, Eldib and Wang have proposed a method
for automatically synthesizing programs that are leakage resilient according to
this model, for the case n=1. In this paper, we show that the
n-threshold-probing model of leakage resilience enjoys a certain
compositionality property that can be exploited for synthesis. We use the
property to design a synthesis method that efficiently synthesizes
leakage-resilient programs in a compositional manner, for the general case of n
&gt; 1. We have implemented a prototype of the synthesis algorithm, and we
demonstrate its effectiveness by synthesizing leakage-resilient versions of
benchmarks taken from the literature.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we define a novel census signal temporal logic (CensusSTL)
that focuses on the number of agents in different subsets of a group that
complete a certain task specified by the signal temporal logic (STL). CensusSTL
consists of an &quot;inner logic&quot; STL formula and an &quot;outer logic&quot; STL formula. We
present a new inference algorithm to infer CensusSTL formulae from the
trajectory data of a group of agents. We first identify the &quot;inner logic&quot; STL
formula and then infer the subgroups based on whether the agents' behaviors
satisfy the &quot;inner logic&quot; formula at each time point. We use two different
approaches to infer the subgroups based on similarity and complementarity,
respectively. The &quot;outer logic&quot; CensusSTL formula is inferred from the census
trajectories of different subgroups. We apply the algorithm in analyzing data
from a soccer match by inferring the CensusSTL formula for different subgroups
of a soccer team.

 <dc:description>  Short internet video clips like vines present a significantly wild
distribution compared to traditional video datasets. In this paper, we focus on
the problem of unsupervised action classification in wild vines using
traditional labeled datasets. To this end, we use a data augmentation based
simple domain adaptation strategy. We utilise semantic word2vec space as a
common subspace to embed video features from both, labeled source domain and
unlablled target domain. Our method incrementally augments the labeled source
with target samples and iteratively modifies the embedding function to bring
the source and target distributions together. Additionally, we utilise a
multi-modal representation that incorporates noisy semantic information
available in form of hash-tags. We show the effectiveness of this simple
adaptation technique on a test set of vines and achieve notable improvements in
performance.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the downlink performance of K-tier heteregeneous
cellular networks (HCNs) under general settings. First, Gaussian approximation
bounds for the standardized aggregate wireless interference (AWI) in dense
K-tier HCNs are obtained for when base stations (BSs) in each tier are
distributed over the plane according to a spatial and general Poisson point
process. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance is used to measure deviations of
the distribution of the standardized AWI from the standard normal distribution.
An explicit and analytical expression bounding the KS distance between these
two distributions is obtained as a function of a broad range of network
parameters such as per-tier transmission power levels, per-tier BS intensity,
BS locations, general fading statistics, and general bounded path-loss models.
Bounds achieve a good statistical match between the standardized AWI
distribution and its normal approximation even for moderately dense HCNs.
Second, various spatial performance metrics of interest such as outage
capacity, ergodic capacity and area spectral efficiency in the downlink of
K-tier HCNs for general signal propogation models are investigated by making
use of the derived distribution approximation results. Considering two specific
BS association policies, it is shown that the derived performance bounds track
the actual performance metrics reasonably well for a wide range of BS
intensities, with the gap among them becoming negligibly small for denser HCN
deployments.

 <dc:description>  We provide conditions under which trajectory outcomes in mechanical systems
subject to unilateral constraints depend piecewise-differentiably on initial
conditions, even as the sequence of constraint activations and deactivations
varies. This builds on prior work that provided conditions ensuring existence,
uniqueness, and continuity of trajectory outcomes, and extends previous
differentiability results that applied only to fixed constraint (de)activation
sequences. We discuss extensions of our result and implications for assessing
stability and controllability.

 <dc:description>  The mixing time of a graph is an important metric, which is not only useful
in analyzing connectivity and expansion properties of the network, but also
serves as a key parameter in designing efficient algorithms. We present an
efficient distributed algorithm for computing the mixing time of undirected
graphs. Our algorithm estimates the mixing time $\tau_s$ (with respect to a
source node $s$) of any $n$-node undirected graph in $O(\tau_s \log n)$ rounds.
Our algorithm is based on random walks and require very little memory and use
lightweight local computations, and work in the CONGEST model. Hence our
algorithm is scalable under bandwidth constraints and can be an helpful
building block in the design of topologically aware networks.
