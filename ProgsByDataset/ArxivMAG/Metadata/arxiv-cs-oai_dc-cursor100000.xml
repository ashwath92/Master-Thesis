 <dc:title>Why is Compiling Lifted Inference into a Low-Level Language so
  Effective?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  First-order knowledge compilation techniques have proven efficient for lifted
inference. They compile a relational probability model into a target circuit on
which many inference queries can be answered efficiently. Early methods used
data structures as their target circuit. In our KR-2016 paper, we showed that
compiling to a low-level program instead of a data structure offers orders of
magnitude speedup, resulting in the state-of-the-art lifted inference
technique. In this paper, we conduct experiments to address two questions
regarding our KR-2016 results: 1- does the speedup come from more efficient
compilation or more efficient reasoning with the target circuit?, and 2- why
are low-level programs more efficient target circuits than data structures?

 <dc:description>  Observational studies are based on accurate assessment of human state. A
behavior recognition system that models interlocutors' state in real-time can
significantly aid the mental health domain. However, behavior recognition from
speech remains a challenging task since it is difficult to find generalizable
and representative features because of noisy and high-dimensional data,
especially when data is limited and annotated coarsely and subjectively. Deep
Neural Networks (DNN) have shown promise in a wide range of machine learning
tasks, but for Behavioral Signal Processing (BSP) tasks their application has
been constrained due to limited quantity of data. We propose a
Sparsely-Connected and Disjointly-Trained DNN (SD-DNN) framework to deal with
limited data. First, we break the acoustic feature set into subsets and train
multiple distinct classifiers. Then, the hidden layers of these classifiers
become parts of a deeper network that integrates all feature streams. The
overall system allows for full connectivity while limiting the number of
parameters trained at any time and allows convergence possible with even
limited data. We present results on multiple behavior codes in the couples'
therapy domain and demonstrate the benefits in behavior classification
accuracy. We also show the viability of this system towards live behavior
annotations.

 <dc:description>  In this work we study variance in the results of neural network training on a
wide variety of configurations in automatic speech recognition. Although this
variance itself is well known, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
paper that performs an extensive empirical study on its effects in speech
recognition. We view training as sampling from a distribution and show that
these distributions can have a substantial variance. These results show the
urgent need to rethink the way in which results in the literature are reported
and interpreted.

 <dc:description>  Minimal mutual coherence of discrete noiselets and Haar wavelets makes this
pair of bases an essential choice for the measurement and compression matrices
in compressed-sensing-based single-pixel detectors. In this paper we propose an
efficient way of using complex-valued and non-binary noiselet functions for
object sampling in single-pixel cameras with binary spatial light modulators
and incoherent illumination. The proposed method allows to determine m complex
noiselet coefficients from m+1 binary sampling measurements. Further, we
introduce a modification to the complex fast noiselet transform, which enables
computationally-efficient real-time generation of the binary noiselet-based
patterns using efficient integer calculations on bundled patterns. The proposed
method is verified experimentally with a single-pixel camera system using a
binary spatial light modulator.

 <dc:title>Settling the complexity of computing approximate two-player Nash
  equilibria</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rubinstein, Aviad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We prove that there exists a constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ such that, assuming the
Exponential Time Hypothesis for PPAD, computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash
equilibrium in a two-player (nXn) game requires quasi-polynomial time,
$n^{\log^{1-o(1)} n}$. This matches (up to the o(1) term) the algorithm of
Lipton, Markakis, and Mehta [LMM03].
  Our proof relies on a variety of techniques from the study of
probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP); this is the first time that such
ideas are used for a reduction between problems inside PPAD.
  En route, we also prove new hardness results for computing Nash equilibria in
games with many players. In particular, we show that computing an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium in a game with n players requires
$2^{\Omega(n)}$ oracle queries to the payoff tensors. This resolves an open
problem posed by Hart and Nisan [HN13], Babichenko [Bab14], and Chen et al.
[CCT15]. In fact, our results for n-player games are stronger: they hold with
respect to the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-WeakNash relaxation recently introduced by
Babichenko et al. [BPR16].

 <dc:title>A New Approach to Dimensionality Reduction for Anomaly Detection in Data

 <dc:description>  The monitoring and management of high-volume feature-rich traffic in large
networks offers significant challenges in storage, transmission and
computational costs. The predominant approach to reducing these costs is based
on performing a linear mapping of the data to a low-dimensional subspace such
that a certain large percentage of the variance in the data is preserved in the
low-dimensional representation. This variance-based subspace approach to
dimensionality reduction forces a fixed choice of the number of dimensions, is
not responsive to real-time shifts in observed traffic patterns, and is
vulnerable to normal traffic spoofing. Based on theoretical insights proved in
this paper, we propose a new distance-based approach to dimensionality
reduction motivated by the fact that the real-time structural differences
between the covariance matrices of the observed and the normal traffic is more
relevant to anomaly detection than the structure of the training data alone.
Our approach, called the distance-based subspace method, allows a different
number of reduced dimensions in different time windows and arrives at only the
number of dimensions necessary for effective anomaly detection. We present
centralized and distributed versions of our algorithm and, using simulation on
real traffic traces, demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative advantages of
the distance-based subspace approach.

 <dc:title>Fast Reconstruction Algorithm for Perturbed Compressive Sensing Based on
  Total Least-Squares and Proximal Splitting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Arablouei, Reza</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of finding a sparse solution for an underdetermined
linear system of equations when the known parameters on both sides of the
system are subject to perturbation. This problem is particularly relevant to
reconstruction in fully-perturbed compressive-sensing setups where both the
projected measurements of an unknown sparse vector and the knowledge of the
associated projection matrix are perturbed due to noise, error, mismatch, etc.
We propose a new iterative algorithm for tackling this problem. The proposed
algorithm utilizes the proximal-gradient method to find a sparse total
least-squares solution by minimizing an l1-regularized Rayleigh-quotient cost
function. We determine the step-size of the algorithm at each iteration using
an adaptive rule accompanied by backtracking line search to improve the
algorithm's convergence speed and preserve its stability. The proposed
algorithm is considerably faster than a popular previously-proposed algorithm,
which employs the alternating-direction method and coordinate-descent
iterations, as it requires significantly fewer computations to deliver the same
accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm via
simulation results.

 <dc:description>  The goal of this paper is to assess the utility of Reduced-Order Models
(ROMs) developed from 3D physics-based models for predicting transient thermal
power output for an enhanced geothermal reservoir while explicitly accounting
for uncertainties in the subsurface system and site-specific details. Numerical
simulations are performed based on Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) of model
inputs drawn from uniform probability distributions. Key sensitive parameters
are identified from these simulations, which are fracture zone permeability,
well/skin factor, bottom hole pressure, and injection flow rate. The inputs for
ROMs are based on these key sensitive parameters. The ROMs are then used to
evaluate the influence of subsurface attributes on thermal power production
curves. The resulting ROMs are compared with field-data and the detailed
physics-based numerical simulations. We propose three different ROMs with
different levels of model parsimony, each describing key and essential features
of the power production curves. ROM-1 is able to accurately reproduce the power
output of numerical simulations for low values of permeabilities and certain
features of the field-scale data, and is relatively parsimonious. ROM-2 is a
more complex model than ROM-1 but it accurately describes the field-data. At
higher permeabilities, ROM-2 reproduces numerical results better than ROM-1,
however, there is a considerable deviation at low fracture zone permeabilities.
ROM-3 is developed by taking the best aspects of ROM-1 and ROM-2 and provides a
middle ground for model parsimony. It is able to describe various features of
numerical simulations and field-data. From the proposed workflow, we
demonstrate that the proposed simple ROMs are able to capture various complex
features of the power production curves of Fenton Hill HDR system. For typical
EGS applications, ROM-2 and ROM-3 outperform ROM-1.

 <dc:title>Addressing the Regression Test Problem with Change Impact Analysis for
  Ada</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jones, Andrew V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The regression test selection problem--selecting a subset of a test-suite
given a change--has been studied widely over the past two decades. However, the
problem has seen little attention when constrained to high-criticality
developments and where a &quot;safe&quot; selection of tests need to be chosen. Further,
no practical approaches have been presented for the programming language Ada.
In this paper, we introduce an approach to solving the selection problem given
a combination of both static and dynamic data for a program and a change-set.
We present a change impact analysis for Ada that selects the safe set of tests
that need to be re-executed to ensure no regressions. We have implemented the
approach in the commercial, unit-testing tool VectorCAST, and validated it on a
number of open-source examples. On an example of a fully-functioning Ada
implementation of a DNS server (IRONSIDES), the experimental results show a 97%
reduction in test-case execution.

 <dc:description>  The suffix array, perhaps the most important data structure in modern string
processing, is often augmented with the longest common prefix (LCP) array which
stores the lengths of the LCPs for lexicographically adjacent suffixes of a
string. Together the two arrays are roughly equivalent to the suffix tree with
the LCP array representing the tree shape.
  In order to better understand the combinatorics of LCP arrays, we consider
the problem of inferring a string from an LCP array, i.e., determining whether
a given array of integers is a valid LCP array, and if it is, reconstructing
some string or all strings with that LCP array. There are recent studies of
inferring a string from a suffix tree shape but using significantly more
information (in the form of suffix links) than is available in the LCP array.
  We provide two main results. (1) We describe two algorithms for inferring
strings from an LCP array when we allow a generalized form of LCP array defined
for a multiset of cyclic strings: a linear time algorithm for binary alphabet
and a general algorithm with polynomial time complexity for a constant alphabet
size. (2) We prove that determining whether a given integer array is a valid
LCP array is NP-complete when we require more restricted forms of LCP array
defined for a single cyclic or non-cyclic string or a multiset of non-cyclic
strings. The result holds whether or not the alphabet is restricted to be
binary. In combination, the two results show that the generalized form of LCP
array for a multiset of cyclic strings is fundamentally different from the
other more restricted forms.

multiple facts is required. We propose Query-Reduction Network (QRN), a variant
of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that effectively handles both short-term
(local) and long-term (global) sequential dependencies to reason over multiple
facts. QRN considers the context sentences as a sequence of state-changing
triggers, and reduces the original query to a more informed query as it
observes each trigger (context sentence) through time. Our experiments show
that QRN produces the state-of-the-art results in bAbI QA and dialog tasks, and
in a real goal-oriented dialog dataset. In addition, QRN formulation allows
parallelization on RNN's time axis, saving an order of magnitude in time
complexity for training and inference.

 <dc:description>  Effective convolutional neural networks are trained on large sets of labeled
data. However, creating large labeled datasets is a very costly and
time-consuming task. Semi-supervised learning uses unlabeled data to train a
model with higher accuracy when there is a limited set of labeled data
available. In this paper, we consider the problem of semi-supervised learning
with convolutional neural networks. Techniques such as randomized data
augmentation, dropout and random max-pooling provide better generalization and
stability for classifiers that are trained using gradient descent. Multiple
passes of an individual sample through the network might lead to different
predictions due to the non-deterministic behavior of these techniques. We
propose an unsupervised loss function that takes advantage of the stochastic
nature of these methods and minimizes the difference between the predictions of
multiple passes of a training sample through the network. We evaluate the
proposed method on several benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  With the aim of studying social properties of belief merging and having a
better understanding of impossibility, we extend in three ways the framework of
logic-based merging introduced by Konieczny and Pino P\'erez. First, at the
level of representation of the information, we pass from belief bases to
complex epistemic states. Second, the profiles are represented as functions of
finite societies to the set of epistemic states (a sort of vectors) and not as
multisets of epistemic states. Third, we extend the set of rational postulates
in order to consider the epistemic versions of the classical postulates of
Social Choice Theory: Standard Domain, Pareto Property, Independence of
Irrelevant Alternatives and Absence of Dictator. These epistemic versions of
social postulates are given, essentially, in terms of the finite propositional
logic. We state some representation theorems for these operators. These
extensions and representation theorems allow us to establish an epistemic and
very general version of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. One of the interesting
features of our result, is that it holds for different representations of
epistemic states; for instance conditionals, Ordinal Conditional functions and,
of course, total preorders.

 <dc:description>  We present a new algorithm for multi-region segmentation of 2D images with
objects that may partially occlude each other. Our algorithm is based on the
observation hat human performance on this task is based both on prior knowledge
about plausible shapes and taking into account the presence of occluding
objects whose shape is already known - once an occluded region is identified,
the shape prior can be used to guess the shape of the missing part. We capture
the former aspect using a deep learning model of shape; for the latter, we
simultaneously minimize the energy of all regions and consider only unoccluded
pixels for data agreement.
  Existing algorithms incorporating object shape priors consider every object
separately in turn and can't distinguish genuine deviation from the expected
shape from parts missing due to occlusion. We show that our method
significantly improves on the performance of a representative algorithm, as
evaluated on both preprocessed natural and synthetic images. Furthermore, on
the synthetic images, we recover the ground truth segmentation with good
accuracy.

 <dc:description>  The fastest known algorithm for factoring univariate polynomials over finite
fields is the Kedlaya-Umans (fast modular composition) implementation of the
Kaltofen-Shoup algorithm. It is randomized and takes $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}\log
q + n \log^2 q)$ time to factor polynomials of degree $n$ over the finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. A significant open problem is if the $3/2$
exponent can be improved. We study a collection of algebraic problems and
establish a web of reductions between them. A consequence is that an algorithm
for any one of these problems with exponent better than $3/2$ would yield an
algorithm for polynomial factorization with exponent better than $3/2$.

in understanding the inner workings of this protocol as well as cryptography
and security experts to review the underlying concepts and assumptions.
  In this design paper we are outlining the perspective of chat message
protection through the Strongvelope module. This is different from the product
(the Mega chat) and the transport means which it will be used with. Aspects of
the chat product and transport are only referred to where appropriate, but are

 <dc:description>  While end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable
progress recently, NMT systems only rely on parallel corpora for parameter
estimation. Since parallel corpora are usually limited in quantity, quality,
and coverage, especially for low-resource languages, it is appealing to exploit
monolingual corpora to improve NMT. We propose a semi-supervised approach for
training NMT models on the concatenation of labeled (parallel corpora) and
unlabeled (monolingual corpora) data. The central idea is to reconstruct the
monolingual corpora using an autoencoder, in which the source-to-target and
target-to-source translation models serve as the encoder and decoder,
respectively. Our approach can not only exploit the monolingual corpora of the
target language, but also of the source language. Experiments on the
Chinese-English dataset show that our approach achieves significant
improvements over state-of-the-art SMT and NMT systems.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an agreement-based approach to learning parallel lexicons and
phrases from non-parallel corpora. The basic idea is to encourage two
asymmetric latent-variable translation models (i.e., source-to-target and
target-to-source) to agree on identifying latent phrase and word alignments.
The agreement is defined at both word and phrase levels. We develop a Viterbi
EM algorithm for jointly training the two unidirectional models efficiently.
Experiments on the Chinese-English dataset show that agreement-based learning
significantly improves both alignment and translation performance.

 <dc:description>  This document is a technical overview and discussion of our work, a protocol
for secure group messaging. By secure we mean for the actual users i.e.
end-to-end security, as opposed to &quot;secure&quot; for irrelevant third parties.
  Our work provides everything needed to run a messaging session between real
users on top of a real transport protocol. That is, we specify not just a key
exchange, but when and how to run these relative to transport-layer events; how
to achieve liveness properties such as reliability and consistency, that are
time-sensitive and lie outside of the send-receive logic that cryptography-only
protocols often restrict themselves to; and offer suggestions for displaying
accurate (i.e. secure) but not overwhelming information in user interfaces.
  We aim towards a general-purpose unified protocol. In other words, we'd
prefer to avoid creating a completely new protocol merely to support
automation, or asynchronity, or a different transport protocol. This would add
complexity to the overall ecosystem of communications protocols. It is simply
unnecessary if the original protocol is designed well, as we have tried to do.
  That aim is not complete -- our full protocol system, as currently
implemented, is suitable only for use with certain instant messaging protocols.
However, we have tried to separate out conceptually-independent concerns, and
solve these individually using minimal assumptions even if other components
make extra assumptions. This means that many components of our full system can
be reused in future protocol extensions, and we know exactly which components
must be replaced in order to lift the existing constraints on our full system.

 <dc:description>  For secure communication it is not just sufficient to use strong cryptography
with good and strong keys, but to actually have the assurance, that the keys in
use for it are authentic and from the contact one is expecting to communicate
with. Without that, it is possible to be subject to impersonation or
man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
  Mega meets this problem by providing a hierarchical authentication mechanism
for contacts and their keys. To avoid any hassle when using multiple types of
keys and key pairs for different purposes, the whole authentication mechanism
is brought down to a single &quot;identity key&quot;.

 <dc:description>  With power consumption becoming a critical processor design issue,
specialized architectures for low power processing are becoming popular.
Several studies have shown that neural networks can be used for signal
processing and pattern recognition applications. This study examines the design
of memristor based multicore neural processors that would be used primarily to
process data directly from sensors. Additionally, we have examined the design
of SRAM based neural processors for the same task. Full system evaluation of
the multicore processors based on these specialized cores were performed taking
I/O and routing circuits into consideration. The area and power benefits were
compared with traditional multicore RISC processors. Our results show that the
memristor based architectures can provide an energy efficiency between three
and five orders of magnitude greater than that of RISC processors for the
benchmarks examined.

 <dc:description>  Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be a powerful framework for
learning policies from complex high-dimensional sensory inputs to actions in
complex tasks, such as the Atari domain. In this paper, we explore output
representation modeling in the form of temporal abstraction to improve
convergence and reliability of deep reinforcement learning approaches. We
concentrate on macro-actions, and evaluate these on different Atari 2600 games,
where we show that they yield significant improvements in learning speed.
Additionally, we show that they can even achieve better scores than DQN. We
offer analysis and explanation for both convergence and final results,
revealing a problem deep RL approaches have with sparse reward signals.

 <dc:description>  Natural scene character recognition is challenging due to the cluttered
background, which is hard to separate from text. In this paper, we propose a
novel method for robust scene character recognition. Specifically, we first use
robust principal component analysis (PCA) to denoise character image by
recovering the missing low-rank component and filtering out the sparse noise
term, and then use a simple Histogram of oriented Gradient (HOG) to perform
image feature extraction, and finally, use a sparse representation based
classifier for recognition. In experiments on four public datasets, namely the
Char74K dataset, ICADAR 2003 robust reading dataset, Street View Text (SVT)
dataset and IIIT5K-word dataset, our method was demonstrated to be competitive
with the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of selecting an optimal mask for an image manifold,
i.e., choosing a subset of the pixels of the image that preserves the
manifold's geometric structure present in the original data. Such masking
implements a form of compressive sensing through emerging imaging sensor
platforms for which the power expense grows with the number of pixels acquired.
Our goal is for the manifold learned from masked images to resemble its full
image counterpart as closely as possible. More precisely, we show that one can
indeed accurately learn an image manifold without having to consider a large
majority of the image pixels. In doing so, we consider two masking methods that
preserve the local and global geometric structure of the manifold,
respectively. In each case, the process of finding the optimal masking pattern
can be cast as a binary integer program, which is computationally expensive but
can be approximated by a fast greedy algorithm. Numerical experiments show that
the relevant manifold structure is preserved through the data-dependent masking
process, even for modest mask sizes.

 <dc:description>  Attention mechanisms have attracted considerable interest in image captioning
due to its powerful performance. However, existing methods use only visual
content as attention and whether textual context can improve attention in image
captioning remains unsolved. To explore this problem, we propose a novel
attention mechanism, called \textit{text-conditional attention}, which allows
the caption generator to focus on certain image features given previously
generated text. To obtain text-related image features for our attention model,
we adopt the guiding Long Short-Term Memory (gLSTM) captioning architecture
with CNN fine-tuning. Our proposed method allows joint learning of the image
embedding, text embedding, text-conditional attention and language model with
one network architecture in an end-to-end manner. We perform extensive
experiments on the MS-COCO dataset. The experimental results show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art captioning methods on various quantitative
metrics as well as in human evaluation, which supports the use of our
text-conditional attention in image captioning.

 <dc:description>  We consider sequential decision problems in which we adaptively choose one of
finitely many alternatives and observe a stochastic reward. We offer a new
perspective of interpreting Bayesian ranking and selection problems as adaptive
stochastic multi-set maximization problems and derive the first finite-time
bound of the knowledge-gradient policy for adaptive submodular objective
functions. In addition, we introduce the concept of prior-optimality and
provide another insight into the performance of the knowledge gradient policy
based on the submodular assumption on the value of information. We demonstrate
submodularity for the two-alternative case and provide other conditions for
more general problems, bringing out the issue and importance of submodularity
in learning problems. Empirical experiments are conducted to further illustrate
the finite time behavior of the knowledge gradient policy.

 <dc:description>  Video captioning has been attracting broad research attention in multimedia
community. However, most existing approaches either ignore temporal information
among video frames or just employ local contextual temporal knowledge. In this
work, we propose a novel video captioning framework, termed as
\emph{Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory} (BiLSTM), which deeply captures
bidirectional global temporal structure in video. Specifically, we first devise
a joint visual modelling approach to encode video data by combining a forward
LSTM pass, a backward LSTM pass, together with visual features from
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Then, we inject the derived video
representation into the subsequent language model for initialization. The
benefits are in two folds: 1) comprehensively preserving sequential and visual
information; and 2) adaptively learning dense visual features and sparse
semantic representations for videos and sentences, respectively. We verify the
effectiveness of our proposed video captioning framework on a commonly-used
benchmark, i.e., Microsoft Video Description (MSVD) corpus, and the
experimental results demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed approach
as compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We envision a future time when wearable cameras are worn by the masses and
recording first-person point-of-view videos of everyday life. While these
cameras can enable new assistive technologies and novel research challenges,
they also raise serious privacy concerns. For example, first-person videos
passively recorded by wearable cameras will necessarily include anyone who
comes into the view of a camera -- with or without consent. Motivated by these
benefits and risks, we developed a self-search technique tailored to
first-person videos. The key observation of our work is that the egocentric
head motion of a target person (ie, the self) is observed both in the
point-of-view video of the target and observer. The motion correlation between
the target person's video and the observer's video can then be used to identify
instances of the self uniquely. We incorporate this feature into the proposed
approach that computes the motion correlation over densely-sampled trajectories
to search for a target individual in observer videos. Our approach
significantly improves self-search performance over several well-known face
detectors and recognizers. Furthermore, we show how our approach can enable
several practical applications such as privacy filtering, target video
retrieval, and social group clustering.

 <dc:description>  Distributed antenna systems (DAS) have been widely implemented in
state-of-the-art cellular communication systems to cover dead spots. Recent
studies have also indicated that DAS have advantages in wireless energy
transfer (WET). In this paper, we study simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) DAS in the
downlink which consists of arbitrarily distributed remote antenna units (RAUs).
In order to save the energy cost, we adopt energy cooperation of energy
harvesting (EH) and two-way energy flows to let the RAUs trade their harvested
energy through the smart grid network. Under individual EH constraints, per-RAU
power constraints and various smart grid considerations, we investigate a power
management strategy that determines how to utilize the stochastically spatially
distributed harvested energy at the RAUs and how to trade the energy with the
smart grid simultaneously to supply maximum wireless information transfer (WIT)
with a minimum WET constraint for a receiver adopting power splitting (PS). Our
analysis shows that the optimal design can be achieved in two steps. The first
step is to maximize a new objective that can simultaneously maximize both WET
and WIT, considering both the smart grid profitable and smart grid neutral
cases. For the grid-profitable case, we derive the optimal full power strategy
and provide a closed-form result to see under what condition this strategy is
used. On the other hand, for the grid-neutral case, we illustrate that the
optimal power policy has a double-threshold structure and present an optimal
allocation strategy. The second step is then to solve the whole problem by
obtaining the splitting power ratio based on the minimum WET constraint.
Simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance under various
settings and characterize the double-threshold structure.

 <dc:description>  We present the Siamese Continuous Bag of Words (Siamese CBOW) model, a neural
network for efficient estimation of high-quality sentence embeddings. Averaging
the embeddings of words in a sentence has proven to be a surprisingly
successful and efficient way of obtaining sentence embeddings. However, word
embeddings trained with the methods currently available are not optimized for
the task of sentence representation, and, thus, likely to be suboptimal.
Siamese CBOW handles this problem by training word embeddings directly for the
purpose of being averaged. The underlying neural network learns word embeddings
by predicting, from a sentence representation, its surrounding sentences. We
show the robustness of the Siamese CBOW model by evaluating it on 20 datasets
stemming from a wide variety of sources.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised learning is the most challenging problem in machine learning and
especially in deep learning. Among many scenarios, we study an unsupervised
learning problem of high economic value --- learning to predict without costly
pairing of input data and corresponding labels. Part of the difficulty in this
problem is a lack of solid evaluation measures. In this paper, we take a
practical approach to grounding unsupervised learning by using the same success
criterion as for supervised learning in prediction tasks but we do not require
the presence of paired input-output training data. In particular, we propose an
objective function that aims to make the predicted outputs fit well the
structure of the output while preserving the correlation between the input and
the predicted output. We experiment with a synthetic structural prediction
problem and show that even with simple linear classifiers, the objective
function is already highly non-convex. We further demonstrate the nature of
this non-convex optimization problem as well as potential solutions. In
particular, we show that with regularization via a generative model, learning
with the proposed unsupervised objective function converges to an optimal
solution.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to many text matching
tasks, such as paraphrase identification, question answering, and machine
translation. Although ad-hoc retrieval can also be formalized as a text
matching task, few deep models have been tested on it. In this paper, we study
a state-of-the-art deep matching model, namely MatchPyramid, on the ad-hoc
retrieval task. The MatchPyramid model employs a convolutional neural network
over the interactions between query and document to produce the matching score.
We conducted extensive experiments to study the impact of different pooling
sizes, interaction functions and kernel sizes on the retrieval performance.
Finally, we show that the MatchPyramid models can significantly outperform
several recently introduced deep matching models on the retrieval task, but
still cannot compete with the traditional retrieval models, such as BM25 and
language models.

  In this paper we give a partial solution to this problem and show that for

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the throughput maximization problem for a three-node relay
channel with non-ideal circuit power. In particular, the relay operates in a
half-duplex manner, and the decode-and-forward (DF) relaying scheme is adopted.
Considering the extra power consumption by the circuits, the optimal power
allocation to maximize the throughput of the considered system over an infinite
time horizon is investigated. First, two special scenarios, i.e., the direct
link transmission (only use the direct link to transmit) and the relay assisted
transmission (the source and the relay transmit with equal probability), are
studied, and the corresponding optimal power allocations are obtained. By
transforming two non-convex problems into quasiconcave ones, the closed-form
solutions show that the source and the relay transmit with certain probability,
which is determined by the average power budgets, circuit power consumptions,
and channel gains. Next, based on the above results, the optimal power
allocation for both the cases with and without direct link is derived, which is
shown to be a mixed transmission scheme between the direct link transmission
and the relay assisted transmission.

 <dc:title>Acceleration of Statistical Detection of Zero-day Malware in the Memory
  Dump Using CUDA-enabled GPU Hardware</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on the anticipatory enhancement of methods of detecting
stealth software. Cyber security detection tools are insufficiently powerful to
reveal the most recent cyber-attacks which use malware. In this paper, we will
present first an idea of the highest stealth malware, as this is the most
complicated scenario for detection because it combines both existing
anti-forensic techniques together with their potential improvements. Second, we
present new detection methods, which are resilient to this hidden prototype. To
help solve this detection challenge, we have analyzed Windows memory content
using a new method of Shannon Entropy calculation; methods of digital
photogrammetry; the Zipf Mandelbrot law, as well as by disassembling the memory
content and analyzing the output. Finally, we present an idea and architecture
of the software tool, which uses CUDA enabled GPU hardware to speed-up memory
forensics. All three ideas are currently a work in progress.

 <dc:description>  Random walks on bipartite networks have been used extensively to design
personalized recommendation methods. While aging has been identified as a key
component in the growth of information networks, most research has focused on
the networks' structural properties and neglected the often available time
information. Time has been largely ignored both by the investigated
recommendation methods as well as by the methodology used to evaluate them. We
show that this time-unaware approach overestimates the methods' recommendation
performance. Motivated by microscopic rules of network growth, we propose a
time-aware modification of an existing recommendation method and show that by
combining the temporal and structural aspects, it outperforms the existing
methods. The performance improvements are particularly striking in systems with
fast aging.

 <dc:description>  Given an array $\mathcal{A}$ of $n$ elements and a value $2 \leq k \leq n$, a
frequent item or $k$-majority element is an element occurring in $\mathcal{A}$
more than $n/k$ times. The $k$-majority problem requires finding all of the
$k$-majority elements. In this paper we deal with parallel shared-memory
algorithms for frequent items; we present a shared-memory version of the Space
Saving algorithm and we study its behavior with regard to accuracy and
performance on many and multi-core processors, including the Intel Phi
accelerator. We also investigate a hybrid MPI/OpenMP version against a pure MPI
based version. Through extensive experimental results we prove that the
MPI/OpenMP parallel version of the algorithm significantly enhances the
performance of the earlier pure MPI version of the same algorithm. Results also
prove that for this algorithm the Intel Phi accelerator does not introduce any
improvement with respect to the Xeon octa-core processor.

 <dc:description>  Learning to solve complex sequences of tasks--while both leveraging transfer
and avoiding catastrophic forgetting--remains a key obstacle to achieving
human-level intelligence. The progressive networks approach represents a step
forward in this direction: they are immune to forgetting and can leverage prior
knowledge via lateral connections to previously learned features. We evaluate
this architecture extensively on a wide variety of reinforcement learning tasks
(Atari and 3D maze games), and show that it outperforms common baselines based
on pretraining and finetuning. Using a novel sensitivity measure, we
demonstrate that transfer occurs at both low-level sensory and high-level
control layers of the learned policy.

 <dc:title>Strong Converse Theorems for Multimessage Networks with Tight Cut-Set
  Bound</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fong, Silas L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tan, Vincent Y. F.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers a multimessage network where each node may send a
message to any other node in the network. Under the discrete memoryless model,
we prove the strong converse theorem for any network with tight cut-set bound,
i.e., whose cut-set bound is achievable. Our result implies that for any
network with tight cut-set bound and any fixed rate vector that resides outside
the capacity region, the average error probabilities of any sequence of
length-$n$ codes operated at the rate vector must tend to $1$ as $n$ grows. The
proof is based on the method of types. The proof techniques are inspired by the
work of Csisz\'{a}r and K\&quot;{o}rner in 1982 which fully characterized the
reliability function of any discrete memoryless channel (DMC) with feedback for
rates above capacity. In addition, we generalize the strong converse theorem to
the Gaussian model where each node is subject to a peak power constraint.
Important consequences of our results are new strong converses for the Gaussian
multiple access channel (MAC) with feedback and the following relay channels
under both models: The degraded relay channel (RC), the RC with orthogonal
sender components, and the general RC with feedback.

 <dc:title>Fair Simulation for Nondeterministic and Probabilistic Buechi Automata:
  a Coalgebraic Perspective</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Urabe, Natsuki</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Notions of simulation, among other uses, provide a computationally tractable
and sound (but not necessarily complete) proof method for language inclusion.
They have been comprehensively studied by Lynch and Vaandrager for
nondeterministic and timed systems; for B\&quot;{u}chi automata the notion of fair
simulation has been introduced by Henzinger, Kupferman and Rajamani. We
contribute to a generalization of fair simulation in two different directions:
one for nondeterministic tree automata previously studied by Bomhard; and the
other for probabilistic word automata with finite state spaces, both under the
B\&quot;{u}chi acceptance condition. The former nondeterministic definition is
formulated in terms of systems of fixed-point equations, hence is readily
translated to parity games and is then amenable to Jurdzi\'{n}ski's algorithm;
the latter probabilistic definition bears a strong ranking-function flavor.
These two different-looking definitions are derived from one source, namely our
coalgebraic modeling of B\&quot;{u}chi automata. Based on these coalgebraic
observations, we also prove their soundness: a simulation indeed witnesses
language inclusion.

 <dc:description>  Template-based code generator development as part of model-drivendevelopment
(MDD) demands for strong mechanisms and tools that support developers to
improve robustness, i.e., the desired code is generated for the specified
inputs. Although different testing methods have been proposed,a method for
testing only parts of template-based code generators that can be employed in
the early stage of development is lacking. Thus, in this paper we present an
approach and an implementation based on JUnit to test template-based code
generators. Rather than testing a complete code generator,it facilitates
partial testing by supporting the execution of templates with a mocked
environment. This eases testing of code generators in early stages of
development as well as testing new orchanged parts of a code generator. To test
the source code generated by the templates under test, different methods are
presented including string comparisons, API-based assertions, and abstract
syntax tree based assertions.

 <dc:description>  We present and evaluate a new model for Natural Language Generation (NLG) in
Spoken Dialogue Systems, based on statistical planning, given noisy feedback
from the current generation context (e.g. a user and a surface realiser). We
study its use in a standard NLG problem: how to present information (in this
case a set of search results) to users, given the complex trade- offs between
utterance length, amount of information conveyed, and cognitive load. We set
these trade-offs by analysing existing MATCH data. We then train a NLG pol- icy
using Reinforcement Learning (RL), which adapts its behaviour to noisy feed-
back from the current generation context. This policy is compared to several
base- lines derived from previous work in this area. The learned policy
significantly out- performs all the prior approaches.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel deep recurrent neural network architecture that learns to
build implicit plans in an end-to-end manner by purely interacting with an
environment in reinforcement learning setting. The network builds an internal
plan, which is continuously updated upon observation of the next input from the
environment. It can also partition this internal representation into contiguous
sub- sequences by learning for how long the plan can be committed to - i.e.
followed without re-planing. Combining these properties, the proposed model,
dubbed STRategic Attentive Writer (STRAW) can learn high-level, temporally
abstracted macro- actions of varying lengths that are solely learnt from data
without any prior information. These macro-actions enable both structured
exploration and economic computation. We experimentally demonstrate that STRAW
delivers strong improvements on several ATARI games by employing temporally
extended planning strategies (e.g. Ms. Pacman and Frostbite). It is at the same
time a general algorithm that can be applied on any sequence data. To that end,
we also show that when trained on text prediction task, STRAW naturally
predicts frequent n-grams (instead of macro-actions), demonstrating the
generality of the approach.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the geodesic walk for sampling Riemannian manifolds and apply it
to the problem of generating uniform random points from polytopes in R^n
specified by m inequalities. The walk is a discrete-time simulation of a
stochastic differential equation (SDE) on the Riemannian manifold equipped with
the metric induced by the Hessian of a convex function; each step is the
solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The resulting sampling
algorithm for polytopes mixes in O*(mn^{3/4}) steps. This is the first walk
that breaks the quadratic barrier for mixing in high dimension, improving on
the previous best bound of O*(mn) by Kannan and Narayanan for the Dikin walk.
We also show that each step of the geodesic walk (solving an ODE) can be
implemented efficiently, thus improving the time complexity for sampling
polytopes. Our analysis of the geodesic walk for general Hessian manifolds does
not assume positive curvature and might be of independent interest.

of the early layers with the high informative-ness (and hence recall) of the
later layers. To this end, we build an inverse cascade that, going backward
from the later to the earlier convolutional layers of the CNN, selects the most
promising locations and refines them in a coarse-to-fine manner. The method is
efficient, because i) it re-uses the same features extracted for detection, ii)
it aggregates features using integral images, and iii) it avoids a dense
evaluation of the proposals thanks to the use of the inverse coarse-to-fine
cascade. The method is also accurate. We show that our DeepProposals outperform
most of the previously proposed object proposal and action proposal approaches
and, when plugged into a CNN-based object detector, produce state-of-the-art
detection performance.

 <dc:title>Notes on socio-economic transparency mechanisms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Geiger, Philipp</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Clearly, socio-economic freedom requires some extent of transparency
regarding the implications of choices. In this paper, we review some
established mechanisms for achieving such transparency, without any claim to
completeness, and briefly discuss potential future directions. Our
investigation is structured by four &quot;challenges&quot; under which we subsume the
various requirements on, and approaches to, socio-economic transparency
mechanisms. One main focus is on the inference, i.e., statistical, aspect of
such mechanisms.

 <dc:title>TwinCloud: Secure Cloud Sharing Without Explicit Key Management</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  With the advent of cloud technologies, there is a growing number of
easy-to-use services to store files and share them with other cloud users. By
providing security features, cloud service providers try to encourage users to
store personal files or corporate documents on their servers. However, their
server-side encryption solutions are not satisfactory when the server itself is
not trusted. Although, there are several client-side solutions to provide
security for cloud sharing, they are not used extensively because of usability
issues in key management.
  In this paper, we propose TwinCloud which is an innovative solution with the
goal of providing a secure system to users without compromising the usability
of cloud sharing. TwinCloud achieves this by bringing a novel solution to the
complex key exchange problem and by providing a simple and practical approach
to store and share files by hiding all the cryptographic and key-distribution
operations from users. Serving as a gateway, TwinCloud uses two or more cloud
providers to store the encryption keys and encrypted files in separate clouds
which ease the secure sharing without a need for trust to either of the cloud
service providers with the assumption that they do not collude with each other.
We implemented TwinCloud as a lightweight application and make it available as
open-source. The results of our usability study show the prospect of the secure
sharing solution of TwinCloud.

 <dc:title>A conceptual approach to model co-evolution of urban structures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Urban structures encompass settlements, characterized by the spatial
distribution of built-up areas, but also transportation structures, to connect
these built-up areas. These two structures are very different in their origin
and function, fulfilling complementary needs: (i) to access space, and (ii) to
occupy space. Their evolution cannot be understood by looking at the dynamics
of urban aggregations and transportation systems separately. Instead, existing
built-up areas feed back on the further development of transportation
structures, and the availability of the latter feeds back on the future growth
of urban aggregations. To model this co-evolution, we propose an agent-based
approach that builds on existing agent-based models for the evolution of trail
systems and of urban settlements. The key element in these separate approaches
is a generalized communication of agents by means of an adaptive landscape.
This landscape is only generated by the agents, but once it exists, it feeds
back on their further actions. The emerging trail system or urban aggregation
results as a self-organized structure from these collective interactions. In
our co-evolutionary approach, we couple these two separate models by means of
meta-agents that represent humans with their different demands for housing and
mobility. We characterize our approach as a statistical ensemble approach,
which allows to capture the potential of urban evolution in a bottom-up manner,
but can be validated against empirical observations.

 <dc:description>  Recent work by Elmasry et al. (STACS 2015) and Asano et al. (ISAAC 2014),
reconsidered classical fundamental graph algorithms focusing on improving the
space complexity. We continue this line of work focusing on space. Our first
result is a simple data structure that can maintain any subset $S$ of a
universe of $n$ elements using $n+o(n)$ bits and support in constant time,
apart from the standard insert, delete and membership queries, the operation
{\it findany} that finds and returns any element of the set (or outputs that
the set is empty). Using this we give a BFS implementation that takes $O(m+n)$
time using at most $2n+o(n)$ bits. Later, we further improve the space
requirement of BFS to at most $1.585n + o(n)$ bits. We demonstrate the use of
our data structure by developing another data structure using it that can
represent a sequence of $n$ non-negative integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$ using
at most $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + 2n + o(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i+n)$ bits and, in constant
time, determine whether the $i$-th element is $0$ or decrement it otherwise. We
also discuss an algorithm for finding a minimum weight spanning tree of a
weighted undirected graph using at most $n+o(n)$ bits. We also provide an
implementation for DFS that takes $O(m+n)$ time and $O(n \lg(m/n))$ bits. Using
this DFS algorithm and other careful implementations, we can test
biconnectivity, 2-edge connectivity, and determine cut vertices, bridges etc
among others, essentially within the same time and space bounds required for
DFS. These improve the space required for earlier implementations from $\Omega
(n\lg n)$ bits.

 <dc:description>  Traffic engineering has been used in IP and MPLS networks for a number of
years as a tool for making more efficient use of capacity by explicitly routing
traffic demands where there is available network capacity that would otherwise
be unused. Deployment of traffic engineering imposes an additional layer of
complexity to network design and operations, however, which has constrained its
adoption for capacity optimisation. The rise of Software Defined Networks has
renewed interest in the use of traffic engineering approaches leveraging
centralised network controllers for capacity optimisation. We argue that future
networks can realise the network optimisation benefits of traffic engineering
without incurring additional network complexity through closer coupling between
the network and the applications and services using the network. This can be
achieved through leveraging a network- and traffic-aware controller to directly
influence where applications and services site or locate service instances,
i.e. which implicitly impacts the paths that the applications or services
traffic demands take through the network. We call this technique Demand
Engineering. Demand Engineering has the additional benefit of providing an
admission control capability, i.e. which can provide an assurance that network
SLAs can be met. In this paper we describe the concept of Demand Engineering,
give examples of its use and present simulation results indicating its
potential benefits. We also compare demand engineering to traffic engineering.

 <dc:description>  In online social networks, users tend to select information that adhere to
their system of beliefs and to form polarized groups of like minded people.
Polarization as well as its effects on online social interactions have been
extensively investigated. Still, the relation between group formation and
personality traits remains unclear. A better understanding of the cognitive and
psychological determinants of online social dynamics might help to design more
efficient communication strategies and to challenge the digital misinformation
threat. In this work, we focus on users commenting posts published by US
Facebook pages supporting scientific and conspiracy-like narratives, and we
classify the personality traits of those users according to their online
behavior. We show that different and conflicting communities are populated by
users showing similar psychological profiles, and that the dominant personality
model is the same in both scientific and conspiracy echo chambers. Moreover, we
observe that the permanence within echo chambers slightly shapes users'
psychological profiles. Our results suggest that the presence of specific
personality traits in individuals lead to their considerable involvement in
supporting narratives inside virtual echo chambers.

 <dc:description>  While significant progress has been made separately on analytics systems for
scalable stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and private SGD, none of the major
scalable analytics frameworks have incorporated differentially private SGD.
There are two inter-related issues for this disconnect between research and
practice: (1) low model accuracy due to added noise to guarantee privacy, and
(2) high development and runtime overhead of the private algorithms. This paper
takes a first step to remedy this disconnect and proposes a private SGD
algorithm to address \emph{both} issues in an integrated manner. In contrast to
the white-box approach adopted by previous work, we revisit and use the
classical technique of {\em output perturbation} to devise a novel &quot;bolt-on&quot;
approach to private SGD. While our approach trivially addresses (2), it makes
(1) even more challenging. We address this challenge by providing a novel
analysis of the $L_2$-sensitivity of SGD, which allows, under the same privacy
guarantees, better convergence of SGD when only a constant number of passes can
be made over the data. We integrate our algorithm, as well as other
state-of-the-art differentially private SGD, into Bismarck, a popular scalable
SGD-based analytics system on top of an RDBMS. Extensive experiments show that
our algorithm can be easily integrated, incurs virtually no overhead, scales
well, and most importantly, yields substantially better (up to 4X) test
accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithms on many real datasets.

 <dc:description>  Data streaming relies on continuous queries to process unbounded streams of
data in a real-time fashion. It is commonly demanding in computation capacity,
given that the relevant applications involve very large volumes of data. Data
structures act as articulation points and maintain the state of data streaming
operators, potentially supporting high parallelism and balancing the work
between them. Prompted by this fact, in this work we study and analyze
parallelization needs of these articulation points, focusing on the problem of
streaming multiway aggregation, where large data volumes are received from
multiple input streams. The analysis of the parallelization needs, as well as
of the use and limitations of existing aggregate designs and their data
structures, leads us to identify needs for proper shared objects that can
achieve low-latency and high throughput multiway aggregation. We present the
requirements of such objects as abstract data types and we provide efficient
lock-free linearizable algorithmic implementations of them, along with new
multiway aggregate algorithmic designs that leverage them, supporting both
deterministic order-sensitive and order-insensitive aggregate functions.
Furthermore, we point out future directions that open through these
contributions. The paper includes an extensive experimental study, based on a
variety of aggregation continuous queries on two large datasets extracted from
SoundCloud, a music social network, and from a Smart Grid network. In all the
experiments, the proposed data structures and the enhanced aggregate operators
improved the processing performance significantly, up to one order of
magnitude, in terms of both throughput and latency, over the commonly-used
techniques based on queues.

 <dc:description>  Besides advanced telecommunications techniques, the most prominent evolution
of wireless networks is the densification of network deployment. In particular,
the increasing access points/users density and reduced cell size significantly
enhance spatial reuse, thereby improving network capacity. Nevertheless, does
network ultra-densification and over-deployment always boost the performance of
wireless networks? Since the distance from transmitters to receivers is greatly
reduced in dense networks, signal is more likely to be propagated from long- to
short-range region. Without considering short-range propagation features,
conventional understanding of the impact of network densification becomes
doubtful. With this regard, it is imperative to reconsider the pros and cons
brought by network densification. In this article, we first discuss the
short-range propagation features in densely deployed network and verify through
experimental results the validity of the proposed short-range propagation
model. Considering short-range propagation, we further explore the fundamental
impact of network densification on network capacity, aided by which a concrete
interpretation of ultra-densification is presented from the network capacity
perspective. Meanwhile, as short-range propagation makes interference more
complicated and difficult to handle, we discuss possible approaches to further
enhance network capacity in ultra-dense wireless networks. Moreover, key
challenges are presented to suggest future directions.

 <dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been successful in en- hancing noisy speech
signals. Enhancement is achieved by learning a nonlinear mapping function from
the features of the corrupted speech signal to that of the reference clean
speech signal. The quality of predicted features can be improved by providing
additional side channel information that is robust to noise, such as visual
cues. In this paper we propose a novel deep learning model inspired by insights
from human audio visual perception. In the proposed unified hybrid
architecture, features from a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that processes
the visual cues and features from a fully connected DNN that processes the
audio signal are integrated using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
(BiLSTM) network. The parameters of the hybrid model are jointly learned using
backpropagation. We compare the quality of enhanced speech from the hybrid
models with those from traditional DNN and BiLSTM models.

safely exploring finite Markov decision processes (MDP). We define safety in
terms of an, a priori unknown, safety constraint that depends on states and
actions. We aim to explore the MDP under this constraint, assuming that the
unknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian
process prior. We develop a novel algorithm for this task and prove that it is
able to completely explore the safely reachable part of the MDP without
violating the safety constraint. To achieve this, it cautiously explores safe
states and actions in order to gain statistical confidence about the safety of
unvisited state-action pairs from noisy observations collected while navigating
the environment. Moreover, the algorithm explicitly considers reachability when
exploring the MDP, ensuring that it does not get stuck in any state with no
safe way out. We demonstrate our method on digital terrain models for the task
of exploring an unknown map with a rover.

 <dc:description>  Interlingua based Machine Translation (MT) aims to encode multiple languages
into a common linguistic representation and then decode sentences in multiple
target languages from this representation. In this work we explore this idea in
the context of neural encoder decoder architectures, albeit on a smaller scale
and without MT as the end goal. Specifically, we consider the case of three
languages or modalities X, Z and Y wherein we are interested in generating
sequences in Y starting from information available in X. However, there is no
parallel training data available between X and Y but, training data is
available between X &amp; Z and Z &amp; Y (as is often the case in many real world
applications). Z thus acts as a pivot/bridge. An obvious solution, which is
perhaps less elegant but works very well in practice is to train a two stage
model which first converts from X to Z and then from Z to Y. Instead we explore
an interlingua inspired solution which jointly learns to do the following (i)
encode X and Z to a common representation and (ii) decode Y from this common
representation. We evaluate our model on two tasks: (i) bridge transliteration
and (ii) bridge captioning. We report promising results in both these
applications and believe that this is a right step towards truly interlingua
inspired encoder decoder architectures.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study sparse spike deconvolution over the space of
complex-valued measures when the input measure is a finite sum of Dirac masses.
We introduce a modified version of the Beurling Lasso (BLasso), a semi-definite
program that we refer to as the Concomitant Beurling Lasso (CBLasso). This new
procedure estimates the target measure and the unknown noise level
simultaneously. Contrary to previous estimators in the literature, theory holds
for a tuning parameter that depends only on the sample size, so that it can be
used for unknown noise level problems. Consistent noise level estimation is
standardly proved. As for Radon measure estimation, theoretical guarantees
match the previous state-of-the-art results in Super-Resolution regarding
minimax prediction and localization. The proofs are based on a bound on the
noise level given by a new tail estimate of the supremum of a stationary
non-Gaussian process through the Rice method.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent studies have demonstrated that correntropy is an efficient tool for
analyzing higher-order statistical moments in nonGaussian noise environments.
Although it has been used with complex data, some adaptations were then
necessary without deriving a generic form so that similarities between complex
random variables can be aggregated. This paper presents a novel probabilistic
interpretation for correntropy using complex-valued data called complex
correntropy. An analytical recursive solution for the maximum complex
correntropy criterion (MCCC) is introduced as based on the fixedpoint solution.
This technique is applied to a simple system identification case study, as the
results demonstrate prominent advantages regarding the proposed cost function
if compared to the complex recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. By using
such probabilistic interpretation, correntropy can be applied to solve several
problems involving complex data in a more straightforward way.

 <dc:description>  The pattern matching problem with swaps is to find all occurrences of a
pattern in a text while allowing the pattern to swap adjacent symbols. The goal
is to design fast matching algorithm that takes advantage of the bit
parallelism of bitwise machine instructions and has only streaming access to
the input. We introduce a new approach to solve this problem based on the graph
theoretic model and compare its performance to previously known algorithms. We
also show that an approach using deterministic finite automata cannot achieve
similarly efficient algorithms. Furthermore, we describe a fatal flaw in some
of the previously published algorithms based on the same model. Finally, we
provide experimental evaluation of our algorithm on real-world data.

 <dc:description>  Tissue surface shape and reflectance spectra provide rich intra-operative
information useful in surgical guidance. We propose a hybrid system which
displays an endoscopic image with a fast joint inspection of tissue surface
shape using structured light (SL) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI). For SL a
miniature fibre probe is used to project a coloured spot pattern onto the
tissue surface. In HSI mode standard endoscopic illumination is used, with the
fibre probe collecting reflected light and encoding the spatial information
into a linear format that can be imaged onto the slit of a spectrograph.
Correspondence between the arrangement of fibres at the distal and proximal
ends of the bundle was found using spectral encoding. Then during pattern
decoding, a fully convolutional network (FCN) was used for spot detection,
followed by a matching propagation algorithm for spot identification. This
method enabled fast reconstruction (12 frames per second) using a GPU. The
hyperspectral image was combined with the white light image and the
reconstructed surface, showing the spectral information of different areas.
Validation of this system using phantom and ex vivo experiments has been
demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a novel approach for representing and evolving
deformable active contours. The method combines piecewise regular B{\'e}zier
models and curve evolution defined by local Free Form Deformation. The contour
deformation is locally constrained which allows contour convergence with almost
linear complexity while adapting to various shape settings and handling
topology changes of the active contour.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new active contour scheme for visual
free space perception and segmentation using omnidirectional images acquired by
a robot exploring unknown indoor and outdoor environments. Several experiments
validate the approach with comparison to state-of-the art parametric and
geometric active contours and provide fast and real-time robot free space
segmentation and navigation.

 <dc:description>  Traffic learning and prediction is at the heart of the evaluation of the
performance of telecommunications networks and attracts a lot of attention in
wired broadband networks. Now, benefiting from the big data in cellular
networks, it becomes possible to make the analyses one step further into the
application level. In this paper, we firstly collect a significant amount of
application-level traffic data from cellular network operators. Afterwards,
with the aid of the traffic &quot;big data&quot;, we make a comprehensive study over the
modeling and prediction framework of cellular network traffic. Our results
solidly demonstrate that there universally exist some traffic statistical
modeling characteristics, including ALPHA-stable modeled property in the
temporal domain and the sparsity in the spatial domain. Meanwhile, the results
also demonstrate the distinctions originated from the uniqueness of different
service types of applications. Furthermore, we propose a new traffic prediction
framework to encompass and explore these aforementioned characteristics and
then develop a dictionary learning-based alternating direction method to solve
it. Besides, we validate the prediction accuracy improvement and the robustness
of the proposed framework through extensive simulation results.

 <dc:description>  In wireless networks, interferences between trans- missions are modelled
either in time or frequency domain. In this article, we jointly analyze
interferences in the time- frequency domain using a stochastic geometry model
assuming the total time-frequency resources to be a two-dimensional plane and
transmissions from Internet of Things (IoT) devices time- frequency patterns on
this plane. To evaluate the interference, we quantify the overlap between the
information packets: provided that the overlap is not too strong, the packets
are not necessarily lost due to capture effect. This flexible model can be used
for multiple medium access scenarios and is especially adapted to the random
time-frequency access schemes used in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs). By
characterizing the outage probability and throughput, our approach permits to
evaluate the performance of two representative LPWA technologies
Sigfox{\textsuperscript \textregistered} and LoRaWA{\textsuperscript

 <dc:description>  In this work, we investigate an efficient numerical approach for solving
higher order statistical methods for blind and semi-blind signal recovery from
non-ideal channels. We develop numerical algorithms based on convex
optimization relaxation for minimization of higher order statistical cost
functions. The new formulation through convex relaxation overcomes the local
convergence problem of existing gradient descent based algorithms and applies
to several well-known cost functions for effective blind signal recovery
including blind equalization and blind source separation in both
single-input-single-output (SISO) and multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems.
We also propose a fourth order pilot based cost function that benefits from
this approach. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach is suitable
for short-length packet data transmission using only a few pilot symbols.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently employed to solve
problems from both the computer vision and medical image analysis fields.
Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images
while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In
this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a
volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end
on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the
whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise
during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with
situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground
and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes
available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear
transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation
that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while
requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous
methods.

 <dc:description>  To what extent is the success of deep visualization due to the training?
Could we do deep visualization using untrained, random weight networks? To
address this issue, we explore new and powerful generative models for three
popular deep visualization tasks using untrained, random weight convolutional
neural networks. First we invert representations in feature spaces and
reconstruct images from white noise inputs. The reconstruction quality is
statistically higher than that of the same method applied on well trained
networks with the same architecture. Next we synthesize textures using scaled
correlations of representations in multiple layers and our results are almost
indistinguishable with the original natural texture and the synthesized
textures based on the trained network. Third, by recasting the content of an
image in the style of various artworks, we create artistic images with high
perceptual quality, highly competitive to the prior work of Gatys et al. on
pretrained networks. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of image
representations using untrained deep neural networks. Our work provides a new
and fascinating tool to study the representation of deep network architecture

 <dc:title>Ambiguities in one-dimensional phase retrieval from magnitudes of a

 <dc:description>  Phase retrieval problems occur in a wide range of applications in physics and
engineering. Usually, these problems consist in the recovery of an unknown
signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform. In some applications,
however, the given intensity arises from a different transformation such as the
Fresnel or fractional Fourier transform. More generally, we here consider the
phase retrieval of an unknown signal from the magnitudes of an arbitrary linear
canonical transform. Using the close relation between the Fourier and the
linear canonical transform, we investigate the arising ambiguities of these
phase retrieval problems and transfer the well-known characterizations of the
solution sets from the classical Fourier phase retrieval problem to the new
setting.

 <dc:description>  During the last decade bike sharing systems have emerged as a public
transport mode in urban short trips in more than 500 major cities around the
world. For the mobility service mode, many challenges from its operations are
not well addressed yet, for example, how to develop the bike sharing systems to
be able to effectively satisfy the fluctuating demands both for bikes and for
vacant lockers. To this end, it is a key to give performance analysis of the
bike sharing systems. This paper first describes a large-scale bike sharing
system. Then the bike sharing system is abstracted as a closed queueing network
with multi-class customers, where the virtual customers and the virtual nodes
are set up, and the service rates as well as the relative arrival rates are
established. Finally, this paper gives a product-form solution to the steady
state joint probabilities of queue lengths, and gives performance analysis of
the bike sharing system. Therefore, this paper provides a unified framework for
analyzing closed queueing networks in the study of bike sharing systems. We
hope the methodology and results of this paper can be applicable in the study
of more general bike sharing systems.

 <dc:description>  We describe ASAGA, an asynchronous parallel version of the incremental
gradient algorithm SAGA that enjoys fast linear convergence rates. Through a
novel perspective, we revisit and clarify a subtle but important technical
issue present in a large fraction of the recent convergence rate proofs for
asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms, and propose a simplification of
the recently introduced &quot;perturbed iterate&quot; framework that resolves it. We
thereby prove that ASAGA can obtain a theoretical linear speedup on multi-core
systems even without sparsity assumptions. We present results of an
implementation on a 40-core architecture illustrating the practical speedup as
well as the hardware overhead.

 <dc:description>  Word embeddings play a significant role in many modern NLP systems. Since
learning one representation per word is problematic for polysemous words and
homonymous words, researchers propose to use one embedding per word sense.
Their approaches mainly train word sense embeddings on a corpus. In this paper,
we propose to use word sense definitions to learn one embedding per word sense.
Experimental results on word similarity tasks and a word sense disambiguation
task show that word sense embeddings produced by our approach are of high
quality.

 <dc:description>  Maps --- specifically floor plans --- are useful for a variety of tasks from
arranging furniture to designating conceptual or functional spaces (e.g.,
kitchen, walkway). We present a simple algorithm for quickly laying a floor
plan (or other conceptual map) onto a SLAM map, creating a one-to-one mapping
between them. Our goal was to enable using a floor plan (or other hand-drawn or
annotated map) in robotic applications instead of the typical SLAM map created
by the robot. We look at two use cases, specifying &quot;no-go&quot; regions within a
room and locating objects within a scanned room. Although a user study showed
no statistical difference between the two types of maps in terms of performance
on this spatial memory task, we argue that floor plans are closer to the mental
maps people would naturally draw to characterize spaces.

 <dc:description>  This paper provides a review and commentary on the past, present, and future
of numerical optimization algorithms in the context of machine learning
applications. Through case studies on text classification and the training of
deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine
learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that
large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the
stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while
conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter.
Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a
straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior,
and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance.
This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods
for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main
streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic
directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.

 <dc:description>  The Device-to-Device (D2D) communication principle is a key enabler of direct
localized communication between mobile nodes and is expected to propel a
plethora of novel multimedia services. However, even though it offers a wide
set of capabilities mainly due to the proximity and resource reuse gains,
interference must be carefully controlled to maximize the achievable rate for
coexisting cellular and D2D users. The scope of this work is to provide an
interference-aware real-time resource allocation (RA) framework for relay-aided
D2D communications that underlay cellular networks. The main objective is to
maximize the overall network throughput by guaranteeing a minimum rate
threshold for cellular and D2D links. To this direction, genetic algorithms
(GAs) are proven to be powerful and versatile methodologies that account for
not only enhanced performance but also reduced computational complexity in
emerging wireless networks. Numerical investigations highlight the performance
gains compared to baseline RA methods and especially in highly dense scenarios
which will be the case in future 5G networks.

 <dc:description>  The Computer Vision Research Lab at the University of Notre Dame began
collecting iris images in the spring semester of 2004. The initial data
collections used an LG 2200 iris imaging system for image acquisition. Image
datasets acquired in 2004-2005 at Notre Dame with this LG 2200 have been used
in the ICE 2005 and ICE 2006 iris biometric evaluations. The ICE 2005 iris
image dataset has been distributed to over 100 research groups around the
world. The purpose of this document is to describe the content of the
ND-IRIS-0405 iris image dataset. This dataset is a superset of the iris image
datasets used in ICE 2005 and ICE 2006. The ND 2004-2005 iris image dataset
contains 64,980 images corresponding to 356 unique subjects, and 712 unique
irises. The age range of the subjects is 18 to 75 years old. 158 of the
subjects are female, and 198 are male. 250 of the subjects are Caucasian, 82
are Asian, and 24 are other ethnicities.

 <dc:description>  We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a function $E(t)$ being of
minimum phase, and hence for its phase being univocally determined by its
intensity $|E(t)|^2$. This condition is based on the knowledge of $E(t)$ alone
and not of its analytic continuation in the complex plane, thus greatly
simplifying its practical applicability. We apply these results to find the
class of all band-limited signals that correspond to distinct receiver states
when the detector is sensitive to the field intensity only and insensitive to
the field phase, and discuss the performance of a recently proposed
transmission scheme able to linearly detect all distinguishable states.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose and investigate a novel end-to-end method for
automatically generating short email responses, called Smart Reply. It
generates semantically diverse suggestions that can be used as complete email
responses with just one tap on mobile. The system is currently used in Inbox by
Gmail and is responsible for assisting with 10% of all mobile responses. It is
designed to work at very high throughput and process hundreds of millions of
messages daily. The system exploits state-of-the-art, large-scale deep
learning.
  We describe the architecture of the system as well as the challenges that we
faced while building it, like response diversity and scalability. We also
introduce a new method for semantic clustering of user-generated content that
requires only a modest amount of explicitly labeled data.

 <dc:description>  We propose here a multiplex network approach to investigate simultaneously
different types of dependency in complex data sets. In particular, we consider
multiplex networks made of four layers corresponding respectively to linear,
non-linear, tail, and partial correlations among a set of financial time
series. We construct the sparse graph on each layer using a standard network
filtering procedure, and we then analyse the structural properties of the
obtained multiplex networks. The study of the time evolution of the multiplex
constructed from financial data uncovers important changes in intrinsically
multiplex properties of the network, and such changes are associated with
periods of financial stress. We observe that some features are unique to the
multiplex structure and would not be visible otherwise by the separate analysis
of the single-layer networks corresponding to each dependency measure.

 <dc:description>  Grid cells, discovered more than a decade ago [5], are neurons in the brain
of mammals that fire when the animal is located near certain specific points in
its familiar terrain. Intriguingly, these points form, for a single cell, a
two-dimensional triangular grid, not unlike our Figure 3. Grid cells are widely
believed to be involved in path integration, that is, the maintenance of a
location state through the summation of small displacements. We provide
theoretical evidence for this assertion by showing that cells with grid-like
tuning curves are indeed well adapted for the path integration task. In
particular we prove that, in one dimension under Gaussian noise, the
sensitivity of measuring small displacements is maximized by a population of
neurons whose tuning curves are near-sinusoids -- that is to say, with peaks
forming a one-dimensional grid. We also show that effective computation of the
displacement is possible through a second population of cells whose sinusoid
tuning curves are in phase difference from the first. In two dimensions, under
additional assumptions it can be shown that measurement sensitivity is
optimized by the product of two sinusoids, again yielding a grid-like pattern.
We discuss the connection of our results to the triangular grid pattern
observed in animals.

 <dc:description>  We develop a novel framework to construct and analyze finite valued
mechanisms using tropical convex geometry. Our main results geometrically
characterize all possible incentive compatible mechanisms together with their
payments on arbitrary type spaces. We obtain a geometric interpretation of
revenue equivalence which allows for a more refined analysis than previous
results. A distinct feature of our theory is that it is constructive.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents cltorch, a hardware-agnostic backend for the Torch neural
network framework. cltorch enables training of deep neural networks on GPUs
from diverse hardware vendors, including AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel. cltorch
contains sufficient implementation to run models such as AlexNet, VGG,
Overfeat, and GoogleNet. It is written using the OpenCL language, a portable
compute language, governed by the Khronos Group. cltorch is the top-ranked
hardware-agnostic machine learning framework on Chintala's convnet-benchmarks
page.
  This paper presents the technical challenges encountered whilst creating the
cltorch backend for Torch, and looks in detail at the challenges related to
obtaining a fast hardware-agnostic implementation.
  The convolutional layers are identified as the key area of focus for
accelerating hardware-agnostic frameworks. Possible approaches to accelerating
the convolutional implementation are identified including: implementation of
the convolutions using the implicitgemm or winograd algorithm, using a GEMM
implementation adapted to the geometries associated with the convolutional
algorithm, or using a pluggable hardware-specific convolutional implementation.

 <dc:description>  Multicasting can be done in two different ways: source based tree approach
and shared tree approach. Protocols such as Core Based Tree (CBT), Protocol
Independent Multicasting Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) use shared tree approach. Shared
tree approach is preferred over source-based tree approach because in the later
construction of minimum cost tree per source is needed unlike a single shared
tree in the former approach. In this paper, we present a candidate core
selection approach for shared tree multicasting so that in a multicast session
different senders can select different cores from the candidate core set based
on the senders' physical locations to allow an efficient multicore multicasting
approach.

 <dc:description>  Current machine algorithms for analysis of unstructured data typically show
low accuracies due to the need for human-like intelligence. Conversely, though
humans are much better than machine algorithms on analyzing unstructured data,
they are unpredictable, slower and can be erroneous or even malicious as
computing agents. Therefore, a hybrid platform that can intelligently
orchestrate machine and human computing resources would potentially be capable
of providing significantly better benefits compared to either type of computing
agent in isolation. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid human-machine
computing platform with integrated service level objectives (SLO) management
for complex tasks that can be decomposed into a dependency graph where nodes
represent subtasks. Initial experimental results are highly encouraging. To the
best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that attempts to design such a
hybrid human-machine computing platform with support for addressing the three
SLO parameters of accuracy, budget and completion time.

 <dc:description>  Our goal is to be able to build a generative model from a deep neural network
architecture to try to create music that has both harmony and melody and is
passable as music composed by humans. Previous work in music generation has
mainly been focused on creating a single melody. More recent work on polyphonic
music modeling, centered around time series probability density estimation, has
met some partial success. In particular, there has been a lot of work based off
of Recurrent Neural Networks combined with Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RNN-RBM) and other similar recurrent energy based models. Our approach,
however, is to perform end-to-end learning and generation with deep neural nets
alone.

 <dc:description>  We study the question of reconstructing two signals $f$ and $g$ from their
convolution $y = f\ast g$. This problem, known as {\em blind deconvolution},
pervades many areas of science and technology, including astronomy, medical
imaging, optics, and wireless communications. A key challenge of this intricate
non-convex optimization problem is that it might exhibit many local minima. We
present an efficient numerical algorithm that is guaranteed to recover the
exact solution, when the number of measurements is (up to log-factors) slightly
larger than the information-theoretical minimum, and under reasonable
conditions on $f$ and $g$. The proposed regularized gradient descent algorithm
converges at a geometric rate and is provably robust in the presence of noise.
To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first blind deconvolution
algorithm that is numerically efficient, robust against noise, and comes with
rigorous recovery guarantees under certain subspace conditions. Moreover,
numerical experiments do not only provide empirical verification of our theory,
but they also demonstrate that our method yields excellent performance even in
situations beyond our theoretical framework.

 <dc:description>  The framework of normalizing flows provides a general strategy for flexible
variational inference of posteriors over latent variables. We propose a new
type of normalizing flow, inverse autoregressive flow (IAF), that, in contrast
to earlier published flows, scales well to high-dimensional latent spaces. The
proposed flow consists of a chain of invertible transformations, where each
transformation is based on an autoregressive neural network. In experiments, we
show that IAF significantly improves upon diagonal Gaussian approximate
posteriors. In addition, we demonstrate that a novel type of variational
autoencoder, coupled with IAF, is competitive with neural autoregressive models
in terms of attained log-likelihood on natural images, while allowing
significantly faster synthesis.

 <dc:title>A New Energy Efficient MAC Protocol based on Redundant Radix for
  Wireless Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sinha, Koushik</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we first propose a redundant radix based number (RBN)
representation for encoding the data to be transmitted in a wireless network.
This RBN encoding uses three possible values - 0, 1 and $\bar 1$, for each
digit to be transmitted. We then propose to use silent periods (zero energy
transmission) for transmitting the 0's in the RBN encoded data thus obtained.
This is in contrast to most conventional communication strategies that utilize
energy based transmission (EbT) schemes, where energy expenditure occurs for
transmitting both 0 and 1 bit values. The binary to RBN conversion algorithm
presented here offers a significant reduction in the number of non-zero bits in
the resulting RBN encoded data. As a result, it provides a highly
energy-efficient technique for data transmission with silent periods for
transmitting 0's. We simulated our proposed technique with ideal radio device
characteristics and also with parameters of various commercially available
radio devices. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that with
ideal as well as some commercial device characteristics, our proposed
transmission scheme requires 69% less energy on an average, compared to the
energy based transmission schemes. This makes it very attractive for
application scenarios where the devices are highly energy constrained. Finally,
based on this transmission strategy, we have designed a MAC protocol that would
support the communication of such RBN encoded data frames.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new method to reconstruct data acquired in a local tomography
setup. This method uses an initial reconstruction and refines it by correcting
the low frequency artifacts known as the cupping effect. A basis of Gaussian
functions is used to correct the initial reconstruction. The coefficients of
this basis are iteratively optimized under the constraint of a known subregion.
Using a coarse basis reduces the degrees of freedom of the problem while
actually correcting the cupping effect. Simulations show that the known region
constraint yields an unbiased reconstruction, in accordance to uniqueness
theorems stated in local tomography.

 <dc:description>  An increasing number of domains are providing us with detailed trace data on
human decisions in settings where we can evaluate the quality of these
decisions via an algorithm. Motivated by this development, an emerging line of
work has begun to consider whether we can characterize and predict the kinds of
decisions where people are likely to make errors.
  To investigate what a general framework for human error prediction might look
like, we focus on a model system with a rich history in the behavioral
sciences: the decisions made by chess players as they select moves in a game.
We carry out our analysis at a large scale, employing datasets with several
million recorded games, and using chess tablebases to acquire a form of ground
truth for a subset of chess positions that have been completely solved by
computers but remain challenging even for the best players in the world.
  We organize our analysis around three categories of features that we argue
are present in most settings where the analysis of human error is applicable:
the skill of the decision-maker, the time available to make the decision, and
the inherent difficulty of the decision. We identify rich structure in all
three of these categories of features, and find strong evidence that in our
domain, features describing the inherent difficulty of an instance are
significantly more powerful than features based on skill or time.

 <dc:title>Signaling equilibria for dynamic LQG games with asymmetric information</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a finite horizon dynamic game with two players who observe their
types privately and take actions, which are publicly observed. Players' types
evolve as independent, controlled linear Gaussian processes and players incur
quadratic instantaneous costs. This forms a dynamic linear quadratic Gaussian
(LQG) game with asymmetric information. We show that under certain conditions,
players' strategies that are linear in their private types, together with
Gaussian beliefs form a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) of the game.
Furthermore, it is shown that this is a signaling equilibrium due to the fact
that future beliefs on players' types are affected by the equilibrium
strategies. We provide a backward-forward algorithm to find the PBE. Each step
of the backward algorithm reduces to solving an algebraic matrix equation for
every possible realization of the state estimate covariance matrix. The forward
algorithm consists of Kalman filter recursions, where state estimate covariance
matrices depend on equilibrium strategies.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the University of Cambridge submission to WMT16.
Motivated by the complementary nature of syntactical machine translation and
neural machine translation (NMT), we exploit the synergies of Hiero and NMT in
different combination schemes. Starting out with a simple neural lattice
rescoring approach, we show that the Hiero lattices are often too narrow for
NMT ensembles. Therefore, instead of a hard restriction of the NMT search space
to the lattice, we propose to loosely couple NMT and Hiero by composition with
a modified version of the edit distance transducer. The loose combination
outperforms lattice rescoring, especially when using multiple NMT systems in an
ensemble.

 <dc:description>  Semidefinite programs (SDP's) can be solved in polynomial time by interior
point methods, but scalability can be an issue. To address this shortcoming,
over a decade ago, Burer and Monteiro proposed to solve SDP's with few equality
constraints via rank-restricted, non-convex surrogates. Remarkably, for some
applications, local optimization methods seem to converge to global optima of
these non-convex surrogates reliably. Although some theory supports this
empirical success, a complete explanation of it remains an open question. In
this paper, we consider a class of SDP's which includes applications such as
max-cut, community detection in the stochastic block model, robust PCA, phase
retrieval and synchronization of rotations. We show that the low-rank
Burer-Monteiro formulation of SDP's in that class almost never has any spurious
local optima.

 <dc:description>  Statistics of article page views is useful for measuring the impact of
individual articles. Analyzing the temporal evolution of article page views, we
find that article page views usually decay over time after reaching a peak,
especially exhibiting relaxation with nonexponentiality. This finding suggests
that relaxation in article page views resembles physical aging as frequently
found in complex systems.

 <dc:description>  One of the most important combinatorial optimization problems is graph
coloring. There are several variations of this problem involving additional
constraints either on vertices or edges. They constitute models for real
applications, such as channel assignment in mobile wireless networks. In this
work, we consider some coloring problems involving distance constraints as
weighted edges, modeling them as distance geometry problems. Thus, the vertices
of the graph are considered as embedded on the real line and the coloring is
treated as an assignment of positive integers to the vertices, while the
distances correspond to line segments, where the goal is to find a feasible
intersection of them. We formulate different such coloring problems and show
feasibility conditions for some problems. We also propose implicit enumeration
methods for some of the optimization problems based on branch-and-prune methods
proposed for distance geometry problems in the literature. An empirical
analysis was undertaken, considering equality and inequality constraints,
uniform and arbitrary set of distances, and the performance of each variant of
the method considering the handling and propagation of the set of distances
involved.

 <dc:description>  Software popularity is a valuable information to modern open source
developers, who constantly want to know if their systems are attracting new
users, if new releases are gaining acceptance, or if they are meeting user's
expectations. In this paper, we describe a study on the popularity of software
systems hosted at GitHub, which is the world's largest collection of open
source software. GitHub provides an explicit way for users to manifest their
satisfaction with a hosted repository: the stargazers button. In our study, we
reveal the main factors that impact the number of stars of GitHub projects,
including programming language and application domain. We also study the impact
of new features on project popularity. Finally, we identify four main patterns
of popularity growth, which are derived after clustering the time series
representing the number of stars of 2,279 popular GitHub repositories. We hope
our results provide valuable insights to developers and maintainers, which can
help them on building and evolving systems in a competitive software market.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, hyperspectral image classification widely copes with spatial
information to improve accuracy. One of the most popular way to integrate such
information is to extract hierarchical features from a multiscale segmentation.
In the classification context, the extracted features are commonly concatenated
into a long vector (also called stacked vector), on which is applied a
conventional vector-based machine learning technique (e.g. SVM with Gaussian
kernel). In this paper, we rather propose to use a sequence structured kernel:
the spectrum kernel. We show that the conventional stacked vector-based kernel
is actually a special case of this kernel. Experiments conducted on various
publicly available hyperspectral datasets illustrate the improvement of the
proposed kernel w.r.t. conventional ones using the same hierarchical spatial
features.

 <dc:description>  In order to accelerate implementation of hyperelastic materials for finite
element analysis, we developed an automatic numerical algorithm that only
requires the strain energy function. This saves the effort on analytical
derivation and coding of stress and tangent modulus, which is time-consuming
and prone to human errors. Using the one-sided Newton difference quotients, the
proposed algorithm first perturbs deformation gradients and calculate the
difference on strain energy to approximate stress. Then, we perturb again to
get difference in stress to approximate tangent modulus. Accuracy of the
approximations were evaluated across the perturbation parameter space, where we
find the optimal amount of perturbation being $10^{-6}$ to obtain stress and
$10^{-4}$ to obtain tangent modulus. Single element verification in ABAQUS with
Neo-Hookean material resulted in a small stress error of only $7\times10^{-5}$
on average across uniaxial compression and tension, biaxial tension and simple
shear situations. A full 3D model with Holzapfel anisotropic material for
artery inflation generated a small relative error of $4\times10^{-6}$ for
inflated radius at $25 kPa$ pressure. Results of the verification tests suggest
that the proposed numerical method has good accuracy and convergence
performance, therefore a good material implementation algorithm in small scale
models and a useful debugging tool for large scale models.

 <dc:description>  We create a new online reduction of multiclass classification to binary
classification for which training and prediction time scale logarithmically
with the number of classes. Compared to previous approaches, we obtain
substantially better statistical performance for two reasons: First, we prove a
tighter and more complete boosting theorem, and second we translate the results
more directly into an algorithm. We show that several simple techniques give
rise to an algorithm that can compete with one-against-all in both space and
predictive power while offering exponential improvements in speed when the
number of classes is large.

 <dc:description>  We consider learning problems over training sets in which both, the number of
training examples and the dimension of the feature vectors, are large. To solve
these problems we propose the random parallel stochastic algorithm (RAPSA). We
call the algorithm random parallel because it utilizes multiple parallel
processors to operate on a randomly chosen subset of blocks of the feature
vector. We call the algorithm stochastic because processors choose training
subsets uniformly at random. Algorithms that are parallel in either of these
dimensions exist, but RAPSA is the first attempt at a methodology that is
parallel in both the selection of blocks and the selection of elements of the
training set. In RAPSA, processors utilize the randomly chosen functions to
compute the stochastic gradient component associated with a randomly chosen
block. The technical contribution of this paper is to show that this minimally
coordinated algorithm converges to the optimal classifier when the training
objective is convex. Moreover, we present an accelerated version of RAPSA
(ARAPSA) that incorporates the objective function curvature information by
premultiplying the descent direction by a Hessian approximation matrix. We
further extend the results for asynchronous settings and show that if the
processors perform their updates without any coordination the algorithms are
still convergent to the optimal argument. RAPSA and its extensions are then
numerically evaluated on a linear estimation problem and a binary image
classification task using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new hierarchical model for human action
recognition using body joint locations. Our model can categorize complex
actions in videos, and perform spatio-temporal annotations of the atomic
actions that compose the complex action being performed.That is, for each
atomic action, the model generates temporal action annotations by estimating
its starting and ending times, as well as, spatial annotations by inferring the
human body parts that are involved in executing the action. our model includes
three key novel properties: (i) it can be trained with no spatial supervision,
as it can automatically discover active body parts from temporal action
annotations only; (ii) it jointly learns flexible representations for motion
poselets and actionlets that encode the visual variability of body parts and
atomic actions; (iii) a mechanism to discard idle or non-informative body parts
which increases its robustness to common pose estimation errors. We evaluate
the performance of our method using multiple action recognition benchmarks. Our
model consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art action
recognition methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the joint design of data compression and
802.15.4-based medium access control (MAC) protocol for smartgrids with
renewable energy. We study the setting where a number of nodes, each of which
comprises electricity load and/or renewable sources, report periodically their
injected powers to a data concentrator. Our design exploits the correlation of
the reported data in both time and space to efficiently design the data
compression using the compressed sensing (CS) technique and theMAC protocol so
that the reported data can be recovered reliably within minimum reporting time.
Specifically, we perform the following design tasks: i) we employ the
two-dimensional (2D) CS technique to compress the reported data in the
distributed manner; ii) we propose to adapt the 802.15.4 MAC protocol frame
structure to enable efficient data transmission and reliable data
reconstruction; and iii) we develop an analytical model based on which we can
obtain efficient MAC parameter configuration to minimize the reporting delay.
Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed framework compared to existing solutions.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Quorum-Based Channel-Hopping Distributed Coordination Scheme
  for Cognitive Radio Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jarrah, Esraa</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the most important challenges in deploying cognitive radio networks
(CRNs) is to find a common control channel (CCC) to all secondary users (SUs)
that enables efficient CR communications. This challenge is attributed to the
dynamic time-varying change of network topology, location and spectrum
availability conditions. Rendezvous, which is the process of establishing
control communications, is an essential requirement to enable efficient
communication between any two pair of CR nodes. The most popular CR rendezvous
protocols are based on quorum systems (QSs). Quorum systems are systematic
approaches, which have several attractive properties that can be utilized to
establish communication without the need of a CCC and so overcome the
rendezvous (RDV) problem.
  In this thesis, we propose new channel-hopping-based distributed rendezvous
algorithm based on grid-based-quorum techniques. The proposed algorithm
increases the probability of RDV within a single cycle by allowing CR nodes to
meet more often according to intersection property of quorum systems. Our
proposed algorithm is called Adaptive_Quorum-Based Channel-Hopping Distributed
Coordination Scheme for Cognitive Radio Networks. The main idea of our
algorithm is to dynamically adjusting the selected QS by CR users according to
the varying traffic loads in the CRN. The proposed algorithm decreases the
average time to rendezvous (TTR) and increase the probability of RDV. We
evaluate the performance of our algorithm through Matlab simulations. The
performance of proposed algorithm is compared with two different design scheme.
The results show that our algorithm can reduce TTR, increase the RDV, and
decrease the energy consumption per successful RDV.

 <dc:description>  We propose an approach for 3D reconstruction and segmentation of a single
object placed on a flat surface from an input video. Our approach is to perform
dense depth map estimation for multiple views using a proposed objective
function that preserves detail. The resulting depth maps are then fused using a
proposed implicit surface function that is robust to estimation error,
producing a smooth surface reconstruction of the entire scene. Finally, the
object is segmented from the remaining scene using a proposed 2D-3D
segmentation that incorporates image and depth cues with priors and
regularization over the 3D volume and 2D segmentations. We evaluate 3D
reconstructions qualitatively on our Object-Videos dataset, comparing to
fusion, multiview stereo, and segmentation baselines. We also quantitatively
evaluate the dense depth estimation using the RGBD Scenes V2 dataset [Henry et
al. 2013] and the segmentation using keyframe annotations of the Object-Videos
dataset.

 <dc:description>  The development of increasingly realistic experimental stimuli and task
environments is important for understanding behavior outside the laboratory. We
report a process for generating 3D human model stimuli that combines commonly
used graphics software and enables the flexible generation of animated human
models while providing parametric control over individualized identity
features. Our approach creates novel head models using FaceGen Modeller,
attaches them to commercially-purchased 3D avatar bodies in 3D Studio Max, and
generates Cal3D human models that are compatible with many virtual 3D
environments. Stimuli produced by this method can be embedded as animated 3D
avatars in interactive simulations or presented as 2D images embedded in scenes
for use in traditional laboratory experiments. The inherent flexibility in this
method makes the stimuli applicable to a broad range of basic and applied
research questions in the domain of person perception. We describe the steps of
the stimulus generation process, provide an example of their use in a
recognition memory paradigm, and highlight the adaptability of the method for
related avenues of research.

 <dc:description>  Phonemic or phonetic sub-word units are the most commonly used atomic
elements to represent speech signals in modern ASRs. However they are not the
optimal choice due to several reasons such as: large amount of effort required
to handcraft a pronunciation dictionary, pronunciation variations, human
mistakes and under-resourced dialects and languages. Here, we propose a
data-driven pronunciation estimation and acoustic modeling method which only
takes the orthographic transcription to jointly estimate a set of sub-word
units and a reliable dictionary. Experimental results show that the proposed
method which is based on semi-supervised training of a deep neural network
largely outperforms phoneme based continuous speech recognition on the TIMIT
dataset.

 <dc:title>SocialHBC: Social Networking and Secure Authentication using
  Interference-Robust Human Body Communication</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sen, Shreyas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the advent of cheap computing through five decades of continued
miniaturization following Moores Law, wearable devices are becoming
increasingly popular. These wearable devices are typically interconnected using
wireless body area network (WBAN). Human body communication (HBC) provides an
alternate energy-efficient communication technique between on-body wearable
devices by using the human body as a conducting medium. This allows order of
magnitude lower communication power, compared to WBAN, due to lower loss and
broadband signaling. Moreover, HBC is significantly more secure than WBAN, as
the information is contained within the human body and cannot be snooped on
unless the person is physically touched. In this paper, we highlight
applications of HBC as (1) Social Networking (e.g. LinkedIn/Facebook friend
request sent during Handshaking in a meeting/party), (2) Secure Authentication
using human-human or human-machine dynamic HBC and (3) ultra-low power, secure
BAN using intra-human HBC. One of the biggest technical bottlenecks of HBC has
been the interference (e.g. FM) picked up by the human body acting like an
antenna. In this work, for the first time, we introduce an integrating dual
data rate (DDR) receiver technique, that allows notch filtering (&gt;20 dB) of the
interference for interference-robust HBC.

 <dc:description>  Recently there has been significant research on power generation,
distribution and transmission efficiency especially in the case of renewable
resources. The main objective is reduction of energy losses and this requires
improvements on data acquisition and analysis. In this paper we address these
concerns by using consumers' electrical smart meter readings to estimate
network loading and this information can then be used for better capacity
planning. We compare Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods with traditional methods
for load forecasting. Our results indicate that DNN methods outperform most
traditional methods. This comes at the cost of additional computational
complexity but this can be addressed with the use of cloud resources. We also
illustrate how these results can be used to better support dynamic pricing.

 <dc:description>  Let $G_{(m,3,r)}=\langle x,y\mid x^m=1, y^3=1,yx=x^ry\rangle$ be a metacyclic
group of order $3m$, where ${\rm gcd}(m,r)=1$, $1&lt;r&lt;m$ and $r^3\equiv 1$ (mod
$m$). Then left ideals of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[G_{(m,3,r)}]$ are
called left metacyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of length $3m$, and
abbreviated as left $G_{(m,3,r)}$-codes. A system theory for left
$G_{(m,3,r)}$-codes is developed for the case of ${\rm gcd}(m,q)=1$ and
$r\equiv q^\epsilon$ for some positive integer $\epsilon$, only using finite
field theory and basic theory of cyclic codes and skew cyclic codes. The fact
that any left $G_{(m,3,r)}$-code is a direct sum of concatenated codes with
inner codes ${\cal A}_i$ and outer codes $C_i$ is proved, where ${\cal A}_i$ is
a minimal cyclic code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of length $m$ and $C_i$ is a skew
cyclic code of length $3$ over an extension field of $\mathbb{F}_q$. Then an
explicit expression for each outer code in any concatenated code is provided.
Moreover, the dual code of each left $G_{(m,3,r)}$-code is given and
self-orthogonal left $G_{(m,3,r)}$-codes are determined.

 <dc:description>  We provide a fundamental treatment of the molecular communication channel
wherein &quot;inscribed matter&quot; is transmitted across a spatial gap to provide
reliable signaling between a sender and receiver. Inscribed matter is defined
as an ensemble of &quot;tokens&quot; (molecules, objects, and so on) and is inspired, at
least partially, by biological systems where groups of individually constructed
discrete particles ranging from molecules through membrane-bound structures
containing molecules to viruses and organisms are released by a source and
travel to a target -- for example, morphogens or semiochemicals diffuse from
one cell, tissue or organism diffuse to another. For identical tokens that are
neither lost nor modified, we consider messages encoded using three candidate
communication schemes: a) token timing (timed release), b) token payload
(composition), and c) token timing plus payload. We provide capacity bounds for
each scheme and discuss their relative utility. We find that under not
unreasonable assumptions, megabit per second rates could be supported at
femtoWatt transmitter powers. Since quantities such as token concentration or
bin-counting are derivatives of token arrival timing, individual token timing
undergirds all molecular communication techniques. Thus, our modeling and
results about the physics of efficient token-based information transfer can
inform investigations of diverse theoretical and practical problems in
engineering and biology. This work, Part I, focuses on the information
theoretic bounds on capacity. Part II develops some of the mathematical and
information-theoretic ideas that support the bounds presented here.

 <dc:title>Large Antenna Analysis of Multi-Cell Full-Duplex Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bai, Jingwen</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study a multi-cell multi-user MIMO full-duplex network, where each base
station (BS) has multiple antennas with full-duplex capability supporting
single-antenna users with either full-duplex or half-duplex radios. We
characterize the up- and downlink ergodic achievable rates for the case of
linear precoders and receivers. The rate analysis includes practical
constraints such as imperfect self- interference cancellation, channel
estimation error, training overhead and pilot contamination. We show that the
2X gain of full-duplex over half-duplex system remains in the asymptotic regime
where the number of BS antennas grows infinitely large. We numerically evaluate
the finite SNR and antenna performance, which reveals that full-duplex networks
can use significantly fewer antennas to achieve spectral efficiency gain over
the half-duplex counterparts. In addition, the overall full-duplex gains can be
achieved under realistic 3GPP multi-cell network settings despite the increased
interference introduced in the full-duplex networks.

 <dc:description>  Our goal is to identify beneficial interventions from observational data. We
consider interventions that are narrowly focused (impacting few covariates) and
may be tailored to each individual or globally enacted over a population. For
applications where harmful intervention is drastically worse than proposing no
change, we propose a conservative definition of the optimal intervention.
Assuming the underlying relationship remains invariant under intervention, we
develop efficient algorithms to identify the optimal intervention policy from
limited data and provide theoretical guarantees for our approach in a Gaussian
Process setting. Although our methods assume covariates can be precisely
adjusted, they remain capable of improving outcomes in misspecified settings
where interventions incur unintentional downstream effects. Empirically, our
approach identifies good interventions in two practical applications: gene
perturbation and writing improvement.

 <dc:description>  First-order factoid question answering assumes that the question can be
answered by a single fact in a knowledge base (KB). While this does not seem
like a challenging task, many recent attempts that apply either complex
linguistic reasoning or deep neural networks achieve 65%-76% accuracy on
benchmark sets. Our approach formulates the task as two machine learning
problems: detecting the entities in the question, and classifying the question
as one of the relation types in the KB. We train a recurrent neural network to
solve each problem. On the SimpleQuestions dataset, our approach yields
substantial improvements over previously published results --- even neural
networks based on much more complex architectures. The simplicity of our
approach also has practical advantages, such as efficiency and modularity, that
are valuable especially in an industry setting. In fact, we present a
preliminary analysis of the performance of our model on real queries from
Comcast's X1 entertainment platform with millions of users every day.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With massive high-dimensional data now commonplace in research and industry,
there is a strong and growing demand for more scalable computational techniques
for data analysis and knowledge discovery. Key to turning these data into
knowledge is the ability to learn statistical models with high
interpretability. Current methods for learning statistical models either
produce models that are not interpretable or have prohibitive computational
costs when applied to massive data. In this paper we address this need by
presenting a scalable algorithm for partial least squares regression (PLS),
which we call compression-based PLS (cPLS), to learn predictive linear models
with a high interpretability from massive high-dimensional data. We propose a
novel grammar-compressed representation of data matrices that supports fast row
and column access while the data matrix is in a compressed form. The original
data matrix is grammar-compressed and then the linear model in PLS is learned
on the compressed data matrix, which results in a significant reduction in
working space, greatly improving scalability. We experimentally test cPLS on
its ability to learn linear models for classification, regression and feature
extraction with various massive high-dimensional data, and show that cPLS
performs superiorly in terms of prediction accuracy, computational efficiency,
and interpretability.

 <dc:description>  Hashing has shown its efficiency and effectiveness in facilitating
large-scale multimedia applications. Supervised knowledge e.g. semantic labels
or pair-wise relationship) associated to data is capable of significantly
improving the quality of hash codes and hash functions. However, confronted
with the rapid growth of newly-emerging concepts and multimedia data on the
Web, existing supervised hashing approaches may easily suffer from the scarcity
and validity of supervised information due to the expensive cost of manual
labelling. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing scheme, termed
\emph{zero-shot hashing} (ZSH), which compresses images of &quot;unseen&quot; categories
to binary codes with hash functions learned from limited training data of
&quot;seen&quot; categories. Specifically, we project independent data labels i.e.
0/1-form label vectors) into semantic embedding space, where semantic
relationships among all the labels can be precisely characterized and thus seen
supervised knowledge can be transferred to unseen classes. Moreover, in order
to cope with the semantic shift problem, we rotate the embedded space to more
suitably align the embedded semantics with the low-level visual feature space,
thereby alleviating the influence of semantic gap. In the meantime, to exert
positive effects on learning high-quality hash functions, we further propose to
preserve local structural property and discrete nature in binary codes.
Besides, we develop an efficient alternating algorithm to solve the ZSH model.
Extensive experiments conducted on various real-life datasets show the superior
zero-shot image retrieval performance of ZSH as compared to several
state-of-the-art hashing methods.

performance challenges that motivate clean slate solutions for content
dissemination, such as content centric networking. In this paper, we address
two of the fundamental problems faced by any content dissemination system:
content search and content placement.
  We consider a multi-tiered, multi-domain hierarchical system wherein random
walks are used to cope with the tradeoff between exploitation of known paths
towards custodians versus opportunistic exploration of replicas in a given
neighborhood. TTL-like mechanisms, referred to as reinforced counters, are used
for content placement. We propose an analytical model to study the interplay
between search and placement. The model yields closed form expressions for
metrics of interest such as the average delay experienced by users and the load
placed on custodians. Then, leveraging the model solution we pose a joint
placement-search optimization problem. We show that previously proposed
strategies for optimal placement, such as the square-root allocation, follow as
special cases of ours, and that a bang-bang search policy is optimal if content
allocation is given.

 <dc:description>  This paper is Part II of a two-paper set which develops a finest-grain
per-molecule timing treatment of molecular communication. We first consider a
simple one-molecule timing channel with a molecule launch deadline, similar to
but different from previous work (&quot;Bits Through Queues&quot;) where the constraint
was mean launch time. We also derive a number of results related to the {\em
ordering entropy}, a key quantity which undergirds the capacity bounds for the
molecular timing channel, both with and without token data payloads. We then
conclude with an upper bound on molecular timing-channel capacity.

 <dc:title>Performance Analysis of Target Parameters Estimation Using Multiple
  Widely Separated Antenna Arrays</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Target parameter estimation performance is investigated for a radar employing
a set of widely separated transmitting and receiving antenna arrays. Cases with
multiple extended targets are considered under two signal model assumptions:
stochastic and deterministic. The general expressions for the corresponding
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the asymptotic properties of the
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator are derived for a radar with $M_t$ arrays of
$L_t$ transmitting elements and $M_r$ arrays of $L_r$ receiving elements for
both types of signal models.
  It is shown that for an infinitely large product $M_tM_r$, and a finite
$L_r$, the ML estimator is consistent and efficient under the stochastic model,
while the deterministic model requires $M_tM_r$ to be finite and $L_r$ to be
infinitely large in order to guarantee consistency and efficiency.
  Monte Carlo simulations further investigate the estimation performance of the
proposed radar configuration in practical scenarios with finite $M_tM_r$ and
$L_r$, and a fixed total number of available receiving antenna elements, $M_r
L_r$. The numerical results demonstrate that grouping receiving elements into
properly sized arrays reduces the mean squared error (MSE) and decreases the
threshold SNR. In the numerical examples considered, the preferred
configurations employ $M_t M_r &gt; 1$. In fact, when $M_t M_r$ becomes too small,
due to the loss of the geometric gain, the estimation performance becomes
strongly dependent on the particular scenario and can degrade significantly,
while the CRLB may become a poor prediction of the MSE even for high SNR. This
suggests it may be advantageous to employ approaches where neither $M_tM_r$ nor
$L_r$ are too small.

 <dc:title>Towards Characterizing International Routing Detours</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  There are currently no requirements (technical or otherwise) that BGP paths
must be contained within national boundaries. Indeed, some paths experience
international detours, i.e., originate in one country, cross international
boundaries and return to the same country. In most cases these are sensible
traffic engineering or peering decisions at ISPs that serve multiple countries.
In some cases such detours may be suspicious. Characterizing international
detours is useful to a number of players: (a) network engineers trying to
diagnose persistent problems, (b) policy makers aiming at adhering to certain
national communication policies, (c) entrepreneurs looking for opportunities to
deploy new networks, or (d) privacy-conscious states trying to minimize the
amount of internal communication traversing different jurisdictions. In this
paper we characterize international detours in the Internet during the month of
January 2016. To detect detours we sample BGP RIBs every 8 hours from 461
RouteViews and RIPE RIS peers spanning 30 countries. Then geolocate visible
ASes by geolocating each BGP prefix announced by each AS, mapping its presence
at IXPs and geolocation infrastructure IPs. Finally, analyze each global BGP
RIB entry looking for detours. Our analysis shows more than 5K unique BGP
prefixes experienced a detour. A few ASes cause most detours and a small
fraction of prefixes were affected the most. We observe about 544K detours.
Detours either last for a few days or persist the entire month. Out of all the
detours, more than 90% were transient detours that lasted for 72 hours or less.
We also show different countries experience different characteristics of
detours.

 <dc:description>  We give upper and lower bounds on the power of subsystems of the Ideal Proof
System (IPS), the algebraic proof system recently proposed by Grochow and
Pitassi, where the circuits comprising the proof come from various restricted
algebraic circuit classes. This mimics an established research direction in the
boolean setting for subsystems of Extended Frege proofs, where proof-lines are
circuits from restricted boolean circuit classes. Except one, all of the
subsystems considered in this paper can simulate the well-studied
Nullstellensatz proof system, and prior to this work there were no known lower
bounds when measuring proof size by the algebraic complexity of the polynomials
(except with respect to degree, or to sparsity).
  We give two general methods of converting certain algebraic lower bounds into
proof complexity ones. Our methods require stronger notions of lower bounds,
which lower bound a polynomial as well as an entire family of polynomials it
defines. Our techniques are reminiscent of existing methods for converting
boolean circuit lower bounds into related proof complexity results, such as
feasible interpolation. We obtain the relevant types of lower bounds for a
variety of classes (sparse polynomials, depth-3 powering formulas, read-once
oblivious algebraic branching programs, and multilinear formulas), and infer
the relevant proof complexity results. We complement our lower bounds by giving
short refutations of the previously-studied subset-sum axiom using IPS
subsystems, allowing us to conclude strict separations between some of these
subsystems.

 <dc:description>  Organizations with a large user base, such as Samsung and Google, can
potentially benefit from collecting and mining users' data. However, doing so
raises privacy concerns, and risks accidental privacy breaches with serious
consequences. Local differential privacy (LDP) techniques address this problem
by only collecting randomized answers from each user, with guarantees of
plausible deniability; meanwhile, the aggregator can still build accurate
models and predictors by analyzing large amounts of such randomized data. So
far, existing LDP solutions either have severely restricted functionality, or
focus mainly on theoretical aspects such as asymptotical bounds rather than
practical usability and performance. Motivated by this, we propose Harmony, a
practical, accurate and efficient system for collecting and analyzing data from
smart device users, while satisfying LDP. Harmony applies to multi-dimensional
data containing both numerical and categorical attributes, and supports both
basic statistics (e.g., mean and frequency estimates), and complex machine
learning tasks (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression and SVM
classification). Experiments using real data confirm Harmony's effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a wireless-powered cooperative communication network
consisting of a source, a destination and a multi-antenna decode-and-forward
relay. We consider the relay as a wireless-powered node that has no external
power supply; but it is equipped with an energy harvesting (EH) unit and a
rechargeable battery such that it can harvest and accumulate energy from
radio-frequency signals broadcast by the source. By fully incorporating the EH
feature of the relay, we develop an opportunistic relaying protocol, termed
accumulate-then-forward (ATF), for the considered WPCCN. We then adopt the
discrete Markov chain to model the dynamic charging and discharging behaviors
of the relay battery. Based on this, we derive a closed-form expression for the
exact outage probability of the proposed ATF protocol. Numerical results show
that the ATF scheme can outperform the direct transmission one, especially when
the amount of energy consumed by relay for information forwarding is optimized.

 <dc:description>  We propose to prune a random forest (RF) for resource-constrained prediction.
We first construct a RF and then prune it to optimize expected feature cost &amp;
accuracy. We pose pruning RFs as a novel 0-1 integer program with linear
constraints that encourages feature re-use. We establish total unimodularity of
the constraint set to prove that the corresponding LP relaxation solves the
original integer program. We then exploit connections to combinatorial
optimization and develop an efficient primal-dual algorithm, scalable to large
datasets. In contrast to our bottom-up approach, which benefits from good RF
initialization, conventional methods are top-down acquiring features based on
their utility value and is generally intractable, requiring heuristics.
Empirically, our pruning algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art
resource-constrained algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Many textual software languages share common concepts such as defining and
referencing elements, hierarchical structures constraining the visibility of
names, and allowing for identical names for different element kinds. Symbol
tables are useful to handle those reference and visibility concepts. However,
developing a symbol table can be a tedious task that leads to an additional
effort for the language engineer. This paper presents a symbol table meta model
usable to define languagespecific symbol tables. Furthermore, we integrate this
symbol table meta model with a meta model of a grammar-based language
definition. This enables the language engineer to switch between the model
structure and the symbol table as needed. Finally, based on a grammarannotation
mechanism, our approach is able to generate a symbol table infrastructure that
can be used as is or serve as a basis for custom symbol tables.

 <dc:description>  Recently, mobile operators in many developing economies have launched &quot;Mobile
Money&quot; platforms that deliver basic financial services over the mobile phone
network. While many believe that these services can improve the lives of the
poor, a consistent difficulty has been identifying individuals most likely to
benefit from access to the new technology. Here, we combine terabyte-scale data
from three different mobile phone operators from Ghana, Pakistan, and Zambia,
to better understand the behavioral determinants of mobile money adoption. Our
supervised learning models provide insight into the best predictors of adoption
in three very distinct cultures. We find that models fit on one population fail
to generalize to another, and in general are highly context-dependent. These
findings highlight the need for a nuanced approach to understanding the role
and potential of financial services for the poor.

 <dc:description>  Migration crisis, climate change or tax havens: Global challenges need global
solutions. But agreeing on a joint approach is difficult without a common
ground for discussion. Public spheres are highly segmented because news are
mainly produced and received on a national level. Gain- ing a global view on
international debates about important issues is hindered by the enormous
quantity of news and by language barriers. Media analysis usually focuses only
on qualitative re- search. In this position statement, we argue that it is
imperative to pool methods from machine learning, journalism studies and
statistics to help bridging the segmented data of the international public
sphere, using the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as a
case study.

 <dc:description>  To keep a DSL clean, readable and reusable in different contexts, it is
useful to define a separate tagging language. A tag model logically adds
information to the tagged DSL model while technically keeping the artifacts
separated. Using a generic tagging language leads to promiscuous tag models,
whereas defining a target DSL-specific tag language has a high initial
overhead. This paper presents a systematic approach to define a DSL-specific
tag language and a corresponding schema language, combining the advantages of
both worlds: (a) the tag language specifically fits to the DSL, (b) the
artifacts are kept separated and enabling reuse with different tag decorations,
(c) the tag language follows a defined type schema, and (d) systematic
derivation considerably reduces the effort necessary to implement the tag
language. An example shows that it can at least partially be realized by a
generator and applied for any kind of DSL. Index Terms Software Engineering,

 <dc:description>  A network topology with low average shortest path length (ASPL) provides
efficient data transmission while the number of nodes and the number of links
incident to each node are often limited due to physical constraints. In this
paper, we consider the construction of low ASPL graphs under these constraints
by using stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms. Since the ASPL cannot be
calculated efficiently, the ASPL is not suitable for the evaluation function of
SLS algorithms. We first derive an equality and bounds for the ASPL of graphs
of diameter 3. Then, we propose use the simpliest upper bound represented by
the number of triangles and squares in the graph as an evaluation function for
graphs of diameter 3. We show that the proposed evaluation function can be
evaluated in O(1) time as the number of nodes and the maximum degree tend to
infinity by using some data tables. By using the simulated annealing with the
proposed evaluation function, we construct low ASPL regular graphs of diameter
3 with 10 000 nodes.

 <dc:description>  The majority problem is a special case of the heavy hitters problem. Given a
collection of coloured balls, the task is to identify the majority colour or
state that no such colour exists. Whilst the special case of two-colours has
been well studied, the average-case performance for arbitrarily many colours
has not. In this paper, we present heuristic analysis of the average-case
performance of three deterministic algorithms that appear in the literature. We
empirically validate our analysis with large scale simulations.

 <dc:description>  We develop a belief space planning (BSP) approach that advances the state of
the art by incorporating reasoning about data association (DA) within planning,
while considering additional sources of uncertainty. Existing BSP approaches
typically assume data association is given and perfect, an assumption that can
be harder to justify while operating, in the presence of localization
uncertainty, in ambiguous and perceptually aliased environments. In contrast,
our data association aware belief space planning (DA-BSP) approach explicitly
reasons about DA within belief evolution, and as such can better accommodate
these challenging real world scenarios. In particular, we show that due to
perceptual aliasing, the posterior belief becomes a mixture of probability
distribution functions, and design cost functions that measure the expected
level of ambiguity and posterior uncertainty. Using these and standard costs
(e.g.~control penalty, distance to goal) within the objective function, yields
a general framework that reliably represents action impact, and in particular,
capable of active disambiguation. Our approach is thus applicable to robust
active perception and autonomous navigation in perceptually aliased
environments. We demonstrate key aspects in basic and realistic simulations.

 <dc:description>  The incomplete moment generating function (IMGF) has paramount relevance in
communication theory, since it appears in a plethora of scenarios when
analyzing the performance of communication systems. We here present a general
method for calculating the IMGF of any arbitrary fading distribution. Then, we
provide exact closed-form expressions for the IMGF of the very general
{\kappa}-{\mu} shadowed fading model, which includes the popular
{\kappa}-{\mu}, {\eta}-{\mu}, Rician shadowed and other classical models as
particular cases. We illustrate the practical applicability of this result by
analyzing several scenarios of interest in wireless communications: (1)
Physical layer security in the presence of an eavesdropper, (2) Outage
probability analysis with interference and background noise, (3) Channel
capacity with side information at the transmitter and the receiver, and (4)
Average bit-error rate with adaptive modulation, when the fading on the desired
link can be modeled by any of the aforementioned distributions.

 <dc:description>  We describe an approach that uses combinatorial optimization and machine
learning to share the work between the host and device of heterogeneous
computing systems such that the overall application execution time is
minimized. We propose to use combinatorial optimization to search for the
optimal system configuration in the given parameter space (such as, the number
of threads, thread affinity, work distribution for the host and device). For
each system configuration that is suggested by combinatorial optimization, we
use machine learning for evaluation of the system performance. We evaluate our
approach experimentally using a heterogeneous platform that comprises two
12-core Intel Xeon E5 CPUs and an Intel Xeon Phi 7120P co-processor with 61
cores. Using our approach we are able to find a near-optimal system
configuration by performing only about 5% of all possible experiments.

 <dc:description>  Millimetre-wave communication (licensed or unlicensed) is envisaged to be an
important part of the fifth generation (5G) multi-RAT ecosystem. In this paper,
we consider the spectrum bands shared by 5G cellular base stations and some
existing networks, such as WiGig. Sharing the same band among such multiple
radio access technologies (RATs) is very challenging due to the lack of
centralized coordination and demands novel and efficient interference
mitigation and coexistence mechanisms to reduce the mutual interference. To
address this important challenge, we propose in this paper a novel multi-RAT
coexistence mechanism where neighbouring 5G and WiGig base stations, each
serving their own associated UEs, schedule their beam configurations in a
distributed manner such that their own utility function, e.g. spectral
efficiency, is maximized. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial
optimization problem and show via simulations that our proposed distributed
algorithms yield a comparable spectral efficiency for the entire networks as
that using an exhaustive search, which requires global coordination among
coexisting RATs and also has a much higher algorithmic complexity.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, the interest given by the scientific community to the investigation
of the data generated by social networks is increasing as much as the
exponential increasing of social network data. The data structure complexity is
one among the snags, which slowdown their understanding. On the other hand,
community detection in social networks helps the analyzers to reveal the
structure and the underlying semantic within communities. In this paper we
propose an interactive visualization approach relying on our application
NLCOMS, which uses synchronous and related views for graph and community
visualization. Additionally, we present our algorithm for community detection
in networks. A computation study is conducted on instances generated with the
LFR [9]-[10] benchmark. Finally, in order to assess our approach on real-world
data, we consider the data of the ANR-Info-RSN project. The latter addresses
community detection in Twitter.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a mutual coupling based calibration method for
time-division-duplex massive MIMO systems, which enables downlink precoding
based on uplink channel estimates. The entire calibration procedure is carried
out solely at the base station (BS) side by sounding all BS antenna pairs. An
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is derived, which processes the
measured channels in order to estimate calibration coefficients. The EM
algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art narrow-band calibration schemes
in a mean squared error (MSE) and sum-rate capacity sense. Like its
predecessors, the EM algorithm is general in the sense that it is not only
suitable to calibrate a co-located massive MIMO BS, but also very suitable for
calibrating multiple BSs in distributed MIMO systems.
  The proposed method is validated with experimental evidence obtained from a
massive MIMO testbed. In addition, we address the estimated narrow-band
calibration coefficients as a stochastic process across frequency, and study
the subspace of this process based on measurement data. With the insights of
this study, we propose an estimator which exploits the structure of the process
in order to reduce the calibration error across frequency. A model for the
calibration error is also proposed based on the asymptotic properties of the
estimator, and is validated with measurement results.

 <dc:description>  Good OCR results for historical printings rely on the availability of
recognition models trained on diplomatic transcriptions as ground truth, which
is both a scarce resource and time-consuming to generate. Instead of having to
train a separate model for each historical typeface, we propose a strategy to
start from models trained on a combined set of available transcriptions in a
variety of fonts. These \emph{mixed models} result in character accuracy rates
over 90\% on a test set of printings from the same period of time, but without
any representation in the training data, demonstrating the possibility to
overcome the typography barrier by generalizing from a few typefaces to a
larger set of (similar) fonts in use over a period of time. The output of these
mixed models is then used as a baseline to be further improved by both fully
automatic methods and semi-automatic methods involving a minimal amount of
manual transcriptions. In order to evaluate the recognition quality of each
model in a series of models generated during the training process in the
absence of any ground truth, we introduce two readily observable quantities
that correlate well with true accuracy. These quantities are \emph{mean
character confidence C} (as given by the OCR engine OCRopus) and \emph{mean
token lexicality L} (a distance measure of OCR tokens from modern wordforms
taking historical spelling patterns into account, which can be calculated for
any OCR engine). Whereas the fully automatic method is able to improve upon the
result of a mixed model by only 1-2 percentage points, already 100-200
hand-corrected lines lead to much better OCR results with character error rates
of only a few percent. This procedure minimizes the amount of ground truth
production and does not depend on the previous construction of a specific
typographic model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new framework to remove parts of the systematic
errors affecting popular restoration algorithms, with a special focus for image
processing tasks. Generalizing ideas that emerged for $\ell_1$ regularization,
we develop an approach re-fitting the results of standard methods towards the
input data. Total variation regularizations and non-local means are special
cases of interest. We identify important covariant information that should be
preserved by the re-fitting method, and emphasize the importance of preserving
the Jacobian (w.r.t. the observed signal) of the original estimator. Then, we
provide an approach that has a &quot;twicing&quot; flavor and allows re-fitting the
restored signal by adding back a local affine transformation of the residual
term. We illustrate the benefits of our method on numerical simulations for
image restoration tasks.

 <dc:description>  When simulators are energetically coupled in a co-simulation, residual
energies alter the total energy of the full coupled system. This distorts the
system dynamics, lowers the quality of the results, and can lead to
instability. By using power bonds to realize simulator coupling, the
Energy-Conservation-based Co-Simulation method (ECCO) [Sadjina et al. 2016]
exploits these concepts to define non-iterative global error estimation and
adaptive step size control relying on coupling variable data alone. Following
similar argumentation, the Nearly Energy Preserving Coupling Element (NEPCE)
[Benedikt et al. 2013] uses corrections to the simulator inputs to
approximately ensure energy conservation. Here, we discuss a modification to
NEPCE for when direct feed-through is present in one of the coupled simulators.
We further demonstrate how accuracy and efficiency in non-iterative
co-simulations are substantially enhanced when combining NEPCE with ECCO's
adaptive step size controller. A quarter car model with linear and nonlinear
damping characteristics serves as a co-simulation benchmark, and we observe
reductions of the coupling errors of up to 98% utilizing the concepts discussed
here.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been well acknowledged as a promising
paradigm for solving optimisation problems with multiple conflicting objectives
in the sense that they are able to locate a set of diverse approximations of
Pareto optimal solutions in a single run. EAs drive the search for approximated
solutions through maintaining a diverse population of solutions and by
recombining promising solutions selected from the population. Combining machine
learning techniques has shown great potentials since the intrinsic structure of
the Pareto optimal solutions of an multiobjective optimisation problem can be
learned and used to guide for effective recombination. However, existing
multiobjective EAs (MOEAs) based on structure learning spend too much
computational resources on learning. To address this problem, we propose to use
an online learning scheme. Based on the fact that offsprings along evolution
are streamy, dependent and non-stationary (which implies that the intrinsic
structure, if any, is temporal and scale-variant), an online agglomerative
clustering algorithm is applied to adaptively discover the intrinsic structure
of the Pareto optimal solution set; and to guide effective offspring
recombination. Experimental results have shown significant improvement over
five state-of-the-art MOEAs on a set of well-known benchmark problems with
complicated Pareto sets and complex Pareto fronts.

 <dc:description>  We prove that the fully asynchronous dynamics of a Boolean network
$f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$ without negative loop can be simulated, in a very
specific way, by a monotone Boolean network with $2n$ components. We then use
this result to prove that, for every even $n$, there exists a monotone Boolean
network $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$, an initial configuration $x$ and a fixed
point $y$ of $f$ such that: (i) $y$ can be reached from $x$ with a fully
asynchronous updating strategy, and (ii) all such strategies contains at least
$2^{\frac{n}{2}}$ updates. This contrasts with the following known property: if
$f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$ is monotone, then, for every initial configuration
$x$, there exists a fixed point $y$ such that $y$ can be reached from $x$ with
a fully asynchronous strategy that contains at most $n$ updates.

 <dc:description>  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a trending field of research, showing
great promise in challenging problems such as playing Atari, solving Go and
controlling robots. While DRL agents perform well in practice we are still
lacking the tools to analayze their performance. In this work we present the
Semi-Aggregated MDP (SAMDP) model. A model best suited to describe policies
exhibiting both spatial and temporal hierarchies. We describe its advantages
for analyzing trained policies over other modeling approaches, and show that
under the right state representation, like that of DQN agents, SAMDP can help
to identify skills. We detail the automatic process of creating it from
recorded trajectories, up to presenting it on t-SNE maps. We explain how to
evaluate its fitness and show surprising results indicating high compatibility
with the policy at hand. We conclude by showing how using the SAMDP model, an
extra performance gain can be squeezed from the agent.

 <dc:description>  To ensure reliable communication in randomly varying and error-prone
channels, wireless systems use adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) as well as
hybrid ARQ (HARQ). In order to elucidate their compatibility and interaction,
we compare the throughput provided by AMC, HARQ, and their combination
(AMC-HARQ) under two operational conditions: in slow- and fast block-fading
channels. Considering both, incremental redundancy HARQ (HARQ-IR) and
repetition redundancy HARQ (HARQ-RR) we optimize the rate-decision regions for
AMC/HARQ and compare them in terms of attainable throughput. Under a fairly
general model of the channel variation and the decoding functions, we conclude
that i) adding HARQ on top of AMC may be counterproductive in the high average
signal- to-noise ratio regime for fast fading channels, and ii) HARQ is useful
for slow fading channels, but it provides moderate throughput gains. We provide
explanations for these results which allow us to propose paths to improve
AMC-HARQ systems.

 <dc:description>  Campaigners, advertisers and activists are increasingly turning to social
recommendation mechanisms, provided by social media, for promoting their
products, services, brands and even ideas. However, many times, such social
network based campaigns perform poorly in practice because the intensity of the
recommendations drastically reduces beyond a few hops from the source. A
natural strategy for maintaining the intensity is to provide incentives. In
this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the cost incurred by the
campaigner for incentivizing a fraction of individuals in the social network,
while ensuring that the campaign message reaches a given expected fraction of
individuals. We also address the dual problem of maximizing the campaign
penetration for a resource constrained campaigner. To help us understand and
solve the above mentioned problems, we use percolation theory to formally state
them as optimization problems. These problems are not amenable to traditional
approaches because of a fixed point equation that needs to be solved
numerically. However, we use results from reliability theory to establish some
key properties of the fixed point, which in turn enables us to solve these
problems using algorithms that are linearithmic in maximum node degree.
Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of the analytical solution by performing
simulations on real world networks.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we investigate a coding strategy devised to increase the
throughput in hybrid ARQ (HARQ) transmission over block fading channel. In our
approach, the transmitter jointly encodes a variable number of bits for each
round of HARQ. The parameters (rates) of this joint coding can vary and may be
based on the negative acknowledgment (NACK) provided by the receiver or, on the
past (outdated) information about the channel states. These new degrees of
freedom allow us to improve the match between the codebook and the channel
states experienced by the receiver. The results indicate that significant gains
can be obtained using the proposed coding strategy, particularly notable when
the conventional HARQ fails to offer throughput improvement even if the number
of transmission rounds is increased. The new cross-packet HARQ is also
implemented using turbo codes where we show that the theoretically predicted
throughput gains materialize in practice, and we discuss the implementation
challenges.

 <dc:description>  We present a randomized algorithm for reconstructing directed rooted trees of
$n$ nodes and node degree at most $d$, by asking at most $O(dn\log^2 n)$ path
queries. Each path query takes as input an origin node and a target node, and
answers whether there is a directed path from the origin to the target.
Regarding lower bounds, we show that any randomized algorithm requires at least
$\Omega(n\log n)$ queries, while any deterministic algorithm requires at least
$\Omega(dn)$ queries. Additionally, we present a $O(dn\log^3 n)$ randomized
algorithm for noisy queries, and a $O(dn\log^2 n)$ randomized algorithm for
additive queries on weighted trees.

free graphs, where a \delta-fraction of edges and vertices are adversarially
corrupted. The noisy setting was first considered by Magen and Moharrami and
they gave a (1 + \delta)-estimation algorithm for the independent set problem.
Later, Chan and Har-Peled designed a local search algorithm that finds a (1 +
O(\delta))-approximate independent set. However, nothing was known regarding
other problems in the noisy setting. Our main contribution is a general
LP-based framework that yields a (1 + O(\delta log m log log m))-approximation
algorithm for noisy MAX-k-CSPs on m clauses.

 <dc:description>  Single-pixel cameras based on the concepts of compressed sensing (CS)
leverage the inherent structure of images to retrieve them with far fewer
measurements and operate efficiently over a significantly broader spectral
range than conventional silicon-based cameras. Recently, photonic time-stretch
(PTS) technique facilitates the emergence of high-speed single-pixel cameras. A
significant breakthrough in imaging speed of single-pixel cameras enables
observation of fast dynamic phenomena. However, according to CS theory, image
reconstruction is an iterative process that consumes enormous amounts of
computational time and cannot be performed in real time. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel single-pixel imaging technique that can produce
high-quality images through rapid acquisition of their effective spatial
Fourier spectrum. We employ phase-shifting sinusoidal structured illumination
instead of random illumination for spectrum acquisition and apply inverse
Fourier transform to the obtained spectrum for image restoration. We evaluate
the performance of our prototype system by recognizing quick response (QR)
codes and flow cytometric screening of cells. A frame rate of 625 kHz and a
compression ratio of 10% are experimentally demonstrated in accordance with the
recognition rate of the QR code. An imaging flow cytometer enabling
high-content screening with an unprecedented throughput of 100,000 cells/s is
also demonstrated. For real-time imaging applications, the proposed
single-pixel microscope can significantly reduce the time required for image
reconstruction by two orders of magnitude, which can be widely applied in
industrial quality control and label-free biomedical imaging.

 <dc:description>  Campaigners are increasingly using online social networking platforms for
promoting products, ideas and information. A popular method of promoting a
product or even an idea is incentivizing individuals to evangelize the idea
vigorously by providing them with referral rewards in the form of discounts,
cash backs, or social recognition. Due to budget constraints on scarce
resources such as money and manpower, it may not be possible to provide
incentives for the entire population, and hence incentives need to be allocated
judiciously to appropriate individuals for ensuring the highest possible
outreach size. We aim to do the same by formulating and solving an optimization
problem using percolation theory. In particular, we compute the set of
individuals that are provided incentives for minimizing the expected cost while
ensuring a given outreach size. We also solve the problem of computing the set
of individuals to be incentivized for maximizing the outreach size for given
cost budget. The optimization problem turns out to be non trivial; it involves
quantities that need to be computed by numerically solving a fixed point
equation. Our primary contribution is, that for a fairly general cost
structure, we show that the optimization problems can be solved by solving a
simple linear program. We believe that our approach of using percolation theory
to formulate an optimization problem is the first of its kind.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the first online complexity class, AOC, was introduced. The class
consists of many online problems where each request must be either accepted or
rejected, and the aim is to either minimize or maximize the number of accepted
requests, while maintaining a feasible solution. All AOC-complete problems
(including Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Dominating Set, and Set Cover) have
essentially the same advice complexity. In this paper, we study weighted
versions of problems in AOC, i.e., each request comes with a weight and the aim
is to either minimize or maximize the total weight of the accepted requests. In
contrast to the unweighted versions, we show that there is a significant
difference in the advice complexity of complete minimization and maximization
problems. We also show that our algorithmic techniques for dealing with
weighted requests can be extended to work for non-complete AOC problems such as
maximum matching (giving better results than what follow from the general AOC
results) and even non-AOC problems such as scheduling.

 <dc:description>  This paper improves the treatment of equality in guarded dependent type
theory (GDTT), by combining it with cubical type theory (CTT). GDTT is an
extensional type theory with guarded recursive types, which are useful for
building models of program logics, and for programming and reasoning with
coinductive types. We wish to implement GDTT with decidable type-checking,
while still supporting non-trivial equality proofs that reason about the
extensions of guarded recursive constructions. CTT is a variation of
Martin-L\&quot;of type theory in which the identity type is replaced by abstract
paths between terms. CTT provides a computational interpretation of functional
extensionality, is conjectured to have decidable type checking, and has an
implemented type-checker. Our new type theory, called guarded cubical type
theory, provides a computational interpretation of extensionality for guarded
recursive types. This further expands the foundations of CTT as a basis for
formalisation in mathematics and computer science. We present examples to
demonstrate the expressivity of our type theory, all of which have been checked
using a prototype type-checker implementation, and present semantics in a
presheaf category.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we provide faster algorithms for solving the geometric median
problem: given $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ compute a point that minimizes
the sum of Euclidean distances to the points. This is one of the oldest
non-trivial problems in computational geometry yet despite an abundance of
research the previous fastest algorithms for computing a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate geometric median were $O(d\cdot
n^{4/3}\epsilon^{-8/3})$ by Chin et. al,
$\tilde{O}(d\exp{\epsilon^{-4}\log\epsilon^{-1}})$ by Badoiu et. al,
$O(nd+\mathrm{poly}(d,\epsilon^{-1})$ by Feldman and Langberg, and
$O((nd)^{O(1)}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ by Parrilo and Sturmfels and Xue and Ye.
  In this paper we show how to compute a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate geometric
median in time $O(nd\log^{3}\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ and $O(d\epsilon^{-2})$. While
our $O(d\epsilon^{-2})$ is a fairly straightforward application of stochastic
subgradient descent, our $O(nd\log^{3}\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ time algorithm is a
novel long step interior point method. To achieve this running time we start
with a simple $O((nd)^{O(1)}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ time interior point method
and show how to improve it, ultimately building an algorithm that is quite
non-standard from the perspective of interior point literature. Our result is
one of very few cases we are aware of outperforming traditional interior point
theory and the only we are aware of using interior point methods to obtain a
nearly linear time algorithm for a canonical optimization problem that
traditionally requires superlinear time. We hope our work leads to further
improvements in this line of research.

 <dc:description>  The difficulty of multi-class classification generally increases with the
number of classes. Using data from a subset of the classes, can we predict how
well a classifier will scale with an increased number of classes? Under the
assumption that the classes are sampled exchangeably, and under the assumption
that the classifier is generative (e.g. QDA or Naive Bayes), we show that the
expected accuracy when the classifier is trained on $k$ classes is the $k-1$st
moment of a \emph{conditional accuracy distribution}, which can be estimated
from data. This provides the theoretical foundation for performance
extrapolation based on pseudolikelihood, unbiased estimation, and
high-dimensional asymptotics. We investigate the robustness of our methods to
non-generative classifiers in simulations and one optical character recognition
example.

 <dc:title>Estimating mutual information in high dimensions via classification
  error</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zheng, Charles Y.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multivariate pattern analyses approaches in neuroimaging are fundamentally
concerned with investigating the quantity and type of information processed by
various regions of the human brain; typically, estimates of classification
accuracy are used to quantify information. While a extensive and powerful
library of methods can be applied to train and assess classifiers, it is not
always clear how to use the resulting measures of classification performance to
draw scientific conclusions: e.g. for the purpose of evaluating redundancy
between brain regions. An additional confound for interpreting classification
performance is the dependence of the error rate on the number and choice of
distinct classes obtained for the classification task. In contrast, mutual
information is a quantity defined independently of the experimental design, and
has ideal properties for comparative analyses. Unfortunately, estimating the
mutual information based on observations becomes statistically infeasible in
high dimensions without some kind of assumption or prior.
  In this paper, we construct a novel classification-based estimator of mutual
information based on high-dimensional asymptotics. We show that in a particular
limiting regime, the mutual information is an invertible function of the
expected $k$-class Bayes error. While the theory is based on a large-sample,
high-dimensional limit, we demonstrate through simulations that our proposed
estimator has superior performance to the alternatives in problems of moderate
dimensionality.

 <dc:description>  One-shot learning is usually tackled by using generative models or
discriminative embeddings. Discriminative methods based on deep learning, which
are very effective in other learning scenarios, are ill-suited for one-shot
learning as they need large amounts of training data. In this paper, we propose
a method to learn the parameters of a deep model in one shot. We construct the
learner as a second deep network, called a learnet, which predicts the
parameters of a pupil network from a single exemplar. In this manner we obtain
an efficient feed-forward one-shot learner, trained end-to-end by minimizing a
one-shot classification objective in a learning to learn formulation. In order
to make the construction feasible, we propose a number of factorizations of the
parameters of the pupil network. We demonstrate encouraging results by learning
characters from single exemplars in Omniglot, and by tracking visual objects
from a single initial exemplar in the Visual Object Tracking benchmark.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, a connected sides cut $(U, V\backslash U)$ or
$\delta (U)$ is the set of edges of E linking all vertices of U to all vertices
of $V\backslash U$ such that the induced subgraphs $G[U]$ and $G[V\backslash
U]$ are connected. Given a positive weight function $w$ defined on $E$, the
maximum connected sides cut problem (MAX CS CUT) is to find a connected sides
cut $\Omega$ such that $w(\Omega)$ is maximum. MAX CS CUT is NP-hard. In this
paper, we give a linear time algorithm to solve MAX CS CUT for series parallel
graphs. We deduce a linear time algorithm for the minimum cut problem in the
same class of graphs without computing the maximum flow.

 <dc:description>  The automatic content analysis of mass media in the social sciences has
become necessary and possible with the raise of social media and computational
power. One particularly promising avenue of research concerns the use of
sentiment analysis in microblog streams. However, one of the main challenges
consists in aggregating sentiment polarity in a timely fashion that can be fed
to the prediction method. We investigated a large set of sentiment aggregate
functions and performed a regression analysis using political opinion polls as
gold standard. Our dataset contains nearly 233 000 tweets, classified according
to their polarity (positive, negative or neutral), regarding the five main
Portuguese political leaders during the Portuguese bailout (2011-2014). Results
show that different sentiment aggregate functions exhibit different feature
importance over time while the error keeps almost unchanged.

 <dc:description>  We study cyber security issues in networked control of a linear dynamical
system. Specifically, the dynamical system and the controller are assumed to be
connected through a communication channel that face malicious attacks as well
as random packet losses due to unreliability of transmissions. We provide a
probabilistic characterization for the link failures which allows us to study
combined effects of malicious and random packet losses. We first investigate
almost sure stabilization under an event-triggered control law, where we
utilize Lyapunov-like functions to characterize the triggering times at which
the plant and the controller attempt to exchange state and control data over
the network. We then provide a look at the networked control problem from the
attacker's perspective and explore malicious attacks that cause instability.
Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our results with numerical examples.

 <dc:title>Leadership Network and Team Performance in Interactive Contests</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Over the years, the concept of leadership has experienced a paradigm shift -
from solitary leader (centralized leadership) to de-centralized leadership or
distributed leadership. This paper explores the idea that centralized
leadership, as earlier suggested, negatively impacts team performance. I
applied the hypothesis to cricket, a sport in which leaders play an important
role in team's success. I generated batting partnership network and evaluated
the central-most player in the team, applying tools of social network analysis.
Analyzing 3420 matches in one day international cricket and 1979 Test matches
involving 10 teams, I examined the impact of centralized leadership in outcome
of a contest. I observed that the odds for winning a one day international
match under centralized leadership is 30% higher than the odds for winning
under de-centralized leadership. In both forms of cricket (Test and one day
international ), I failed to find evidence that distributed leadership is
associated with higher team performance. These results suggest important
implications for cricket administrators in development and management of
working teams.

a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a segment of
text from the corresponding reading passage. We analyze the dataset to
understand the types of reasoning required to answer the questions, leaning
heavily on dependency and constituency trees. We build a strong logistic

 <dc:title>Convolutional Residual Memory Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Moniz, Joel</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) yield state of the art results
on a wide variety of visual recognition problems. A number of state of the the
art methods for image recognition are based on networks with well over 100
layers and the performance vs. depth trend is moving towards networks in excess
of 1000 layers. In such extremely deep architectures the vanishing or exploding
gradient problem becomes a key issue. Recent evidence also indicates that
convolutional networks could benefit from an interface to explicitly
constructed memory mechanisms interacting with a CNN feature processing
hierarchy. Correspondingly, we propose and evaluate a memory mechanism enhanced
convolutional neural network architecture based on augmenting convolutional
residual networks with a long short term memory mechanism. We refer to this as
a convolutional residual memory network. To the best of our knowledge this
approach can yield state of the art performance on the CIFAR-100 benchmark and
compares well with other state of the art techniques on the CIFAR-10 and SVHN
benchmarks. This is achieved using networks with more breadth, much less depth
and much less overall computation relative to comparable deep ResNets without
the memory mechanism. Our experiments and analysis explore the importance of
the memory mechanism, network depth, breadth, and predictive performance.

 <dc:title>Isometry Groups of Combinatorial Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dyshko, Serhii</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Two isometry groups of combinatorial codes are described: the group of
automorphisms and the group of monomial automorphisms, which is the group of
those automorphisms that extend to monomial maps. Unlike the case of classical
linear codes, where these groups are the same, it is shown that for
combinatorial codes the groups can be arbitrary different. Particularly, there
exist codes with the full automorphism group and the trivial monomial
automorphism group. In the paper the two groups are characterized and codes
with predefined isometry groups are constructed.

 <dc:description>  We consider a dynamic collective choice problem where a large number of
players are cooperatively choosing between multiple destinations while being
influenced by the behavior of the group. For example, in a robotic swarm
exploring a new environment, a robot might have to choose between multiple
sites to visit, but at the same time it should remain close to the group to
achieve some coordinated tasks. We show that to find a social optimum for our
problem, one needs to solve a set of Linear Quadratic Regulator problems, whose
number increases exponentially with the size of the population. Alternatively,
we develop via the Mean Field Games methodology a set of decentralized
strategies that are independent of the size of the population. When the number
of agents is sufficiently large, these strategies qualify as approximately
socially optimal. To compute the approximate social optimum, each player needs
to know its own state and the statistical distributions of the players' initial
states and problem parameters. Finally, we give a numerical example where the
cooperative and noncooperative cases have opposite behaviors. Whereas in the
former the size of the majority increases with the social effect, in the
latter, the existence of a majority is disadvantaged.

 <dc:description>  Deciding effective and timely preventive measures against complex social
problems affecting relatively low income geographies is a difficult challenge.
There is a strong need to adopt intelligent automation based solutions with low
cost imprints to tackle these problems at larger scales. Starting with the
hypothesis that analytical modelling and analysis of social phenomena with high
accuracy is in general inherently hard, in this paper we propose design
framework to enable data-driven machine learning based adaptive solution
approach towards enabling more effective preventive measures. We use survey
data collected from a socio-economically backward region of India about
adolescent girls to illustrate the design approach.

 <dc:description>  Caching at mobile devices can facilitate device-to-device (D2D)
communications, which may significantly improve spectrum efficiency and
alleviate the heavy burden on backhaul links. However, most previous works
ignored user mobility, thus having limited practical applications. In this
paper, we take advantage of the user mobility pattern by the inter-contact
times between different users, and propose a mobility-aware caching placement
strategy to maximize the data offloading ratio, which is defined as the
percentage of the requested data that can be delivered via D2D links rather
than through base stations (BSs). Given the NP-hard caching placement problem,
we first propose an optimal dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to obtain a
performance benchmark, but with much lower complexity than exhaustive search.
We will then prove that the problem falls in the category of monotone
submodular maximization over a matroid constraint, and propose a time-efficient
greedy algorithm, which achieves an approximation ratio as 1/2. Simulation
results with real-life data-sets will validate the effectiveness of our
proposed mobility-aware caching placement strategy. We observe that users
moving at either a very low or very high speed should cache the most popular
files, while users moving at a medium speed should cache less popular files to
avoid duplication.

 <dc:description>  The proper handling of 3D orientations is a central element in many
optimization problems in engineering. Unfortunately many researchers and
engineers struggle with the formulation of such problems and often fall back to
suboptimal solutions. The existence of many different conventions further
complicates this issue, especially when interfacing multiple differing
implementations. This document discusses an alternative approach which makes
use of a more abstract notion of 3D orientations. The relative orientation
between two coordinate systems is primarily identified by the coordinate
mapping it induces. This is combined with the standard exponential map in order
to introduce representation-independent and minimal differentials, which are
very convenient in optimization based methods.

 <dc:title>Spectral decomposition method of dialog state tracking via collective
  matrix factorization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Perez, Julien</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The task of dialog management is commonly decomposed into two sequential
subtasks: dialog state tracking and dialog policy learning. In an end-to-end
dialog system, the aim of dialog state tracking is to accurately estimate the
true dialog state from noisy observations produced by the speech recognition
and the natural language understanding modules. The state tracking task is
primarily meant to support a dialog policy. From a probabilistic perspective,
this is achieved by maintaining a posterior distribution over hidden dialog
states composed of a set of context dependent variables. Once a dialog policy
is learned, it strives to select an optimal dialog act given the estimated
dialog state and a defined reward function. This paper introduces a novel
method of dialog state tracking based on a bilinear algebric decomposition
model that provides an efficient inference schema through collective matrix
factorization. We evaluate the proposed approach on the second Dialog State
Tracking Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset and we show that the proposed tracker gives
encouraging results compared to the state-of-the-art trackers that participated
in this standard benchmark. Finally, we show that the prediction schema is
computationally efficient in comparison to the previous approaches.

 <dc:description>  In the world of Big Data analytics, there is a series of tools aiming at
simplifying programming applications to be executed on clusters. Although each
tool claims to provide better programming, data and execution models, for which
only informal (and often confusing) semantics is generally provided, all share
a common underlying model, namely, the Dataflow model. The Dataflow model we
propose shows how various tools share the same expressiveness at different
levels of abstraction. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, we show
that the proposed model is (at least) as general as existing batch and
streaming frameworks (e.g., Spark, Flink, Storm), thus making it easier to
understand high-level data-processing applications written in such frameworks.
Second, we provide a layered model that can represent tools and applications
following the Dataflow paradigm and we show how the analyzed tools fit in each
level.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, due to the powerful abilities to deal with highly complex
tasks, the artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been studied in the hope of
achieving human-like performance in many applications. Since the ANNs have the
ability to approximate complex functions from observations, it is
straightforward to consider the ANNs for steganography. In this paper, we aim
to implement the well-known LSB substitution and matrix coding steganography
with the feed-forward neural networks (FNNs). Our experimental results have
shown that, the used FNNs can achieve the data embedding operation of the LSB
substitution and matrix coding steganography. For steganography with the ANNs,
though there may be some challenges to us, it would be very promising and
valuable to pay attention to the ANNs for steganography, which may be a new
direction for steganography.

 <dc:title>Generalized Direct Change Estimation in Ising Model Structure</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating change in the dependency structure
between two $p$-dimensional Ising models, based on respectively $n_1$ and $n_2$
samples drawn from the models. The change is assumed to be structured, e.g.,
sparse, block sparse, node-perturbed sparse, etc., such that it can be
characterized by a suitable (atomic) norm. We present and analyze a
norm-regularized estimator for directly estimating the change in structure,
without having to estimate the structures of the individual Ising models. The
estimator can work with any norm, and can be generalized to other graphical
models under mild assumptions. We show that only one set of samples, say $n_2$,
needs to satisfy the sample complexity requirement for the estimator to work,
and the estimation error decreases as $\frac{c}{\sqrt{\min(n_1,n_2)}}$, where
$c$ depends on the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball. For example, for
$\ell_1$ norm applied to $s$-sparse change, the change can be accurately
estimated with $\min(n_1,n_2)=O(s \log p)$ which is sharper than an existing
result $n_1= O(s^2 \log p)$ and $n_2 = O(n_1^2)$. Experimental results
illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed estimator are presented.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we show the possibility of recovering a sum of Dirac measures
on the rotation group $SO(3)$ from its low degree moments with respect to
Wigner D-functions only. The main Theorem of the paper states, that exact
recovery from moments up to degree $N$ is possible, if the support set of the
measure obeys a separation distance of $\frac{36}{N+1}$. In this case, the
sought measure is the unique solution of a total variation minimization. The
proof of the uniqueness requires localization estimates for interpolation
kernels and corresponding derivatives on the rotation group $SO(3)$ with
explicit constants.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new approach to crowd behaviour anomaly detection that
uses a set of efficiently computed, easily interpretable, scene-level holistic
features. This low-dimensional descriptor combines two features from the
literature: crowd collectiveness [1] and crowd conflict [2], with two newly
developed crowd features: mean motion speed and a new formulation of crowd
density. Two different anomaly detection approaches are investigated using
these features. When only normal training data is available we use a Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) for outlier detection. When both normal and abnormal
training data is available we use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary
classification. We evaluate on two crowd behaviour anomaly detection datasets,
achieving both state-of-the-art classification performance on the violent-flows
dataset [3] as well as better than real-time processing performance (40 frames
per second).

 <dc:description>  Transfer in reinforcement learning refers to the notion that generalization
should occur not only within a task but also across tasks. Our focus is on
transfer where the reward functions vary across tasks while the environment's
dynamics remain the same. The method we propose rests on two key ideas:
&quot;successor features,&quot; a value function representation that decouples the
dynamics of the environment from the rewards, and &quot;generalized policy
improvement,&quot; a generalization of dynamic programming's policy improvement step
that considers a set of policies rather than a single one. Put together, the
two ideas lead to an approach that integrates seamlessly within the
reinforcement learning framework and allows transfer to take place between
tasks without any restriction. The proposed method also provides performance
guarantees for the transferred policy even before any learning has taken place.
We derive two theorems that set our approach in firm theoretical ground and
present experiments that show that it successfully promotes transfer in
practice.

 <dc:description>  We show how to estimate a model's test error from unlabeled data, on
distributions very different from the training distribution, while assuming
only that certain conditional independencies are preserved between train and
test. We do not need to assume that the optimal predictor is the same between
train and test, or that the true distribution lies in any parametric family. We
can also efficiently differentiate the error estimate to perform unsupervised
discriminative learning. Our technical tool is the method of moments, which
allows us to exploit conditional independencies in the absence of a
fully-specified model. Our framework encompasses a large family of losses
including the log and exponential loss, and extends to structured output
settings such as hidden Markov models.

 <dc:title>Learning Infinite-Layer Networks: Without the Kernel Trick</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Infinite--Layer Networks (ILN) have recently been proposed as an architecture
that mimics neural networks while enjoying some of the advantages of kernel
methods. ILN are networks that integrate over infinitely many nodes within a
single hidden layer. It has been demonstrated by several authors that the
problem of learning ILN can be reduced to the kernel trick, implying that
whenever a certain integral can be computed analytically they are efficiently
learnable.
  In this work we give an online algorithm for ILN, which avoids the kernel
trick assumption. More generally and of independent interest, we show that
kernel methods in general can be exploited even when the kernel cannot be
efficiently computed but can only be estimated via sampling.
  We provide a regret analysis for our algorithm, showing that it matches the
sample complexity of methods which have access to kernel values. Thus, our
method is the first to demonstrate that the kernel trick is not necessary as
such, and random features suffice to obtain comparable performance.

 <dc:description>  As deep neural networks continue to revolutionize various application
domains, there is increasing interest in making these powerful models more
understandable and interpretable, and narrowing down the causes of good and bad
predictions. We focus on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), state of the art
models in speech recognition and translation. Our approach to increasing
interpretability is by combining an RNN with a hidden Markov model (HMM), a
simpler and more transparent model. We explore various combinations of RNNs and
HMMs: an HMM trained on LSTM states; a hybrid model where an HMM is trained
first, then a small LSTM is given HMM state distributions and trained to fill
in gaps in the HMM's performance; and a jointly trained hybrid model. We find
that the LSTM and HMM learn complementary information about the features in the
text.

 <dc:description>  In many healthcare settings, intuitive decision rules for risk stratification
can help effective hospital resource allocation. This paper introduces a novel
variant of decision tree algorithms that produces a chain of decisions, not a
general tree. Our algorithm, $\alpha$-Carving Decision Chain (ACDC),
sequentially carves out &quot;pure&quot; subsets of the majority class examples. The
resulting chain of decision rules yields a pure subset of the minority class
examples. Our approach is particularly effective in exploring large and
class-imbalanced health datasets. Moreover, ACDC provides an interactive
interpretation in conjunction with visual performance metrics such as Receiver
Operating Characteristics curve and Lift chart.

 <dc:description>  This work explores conditional image generation with a new image density
model based on the PixelCNN architecture. The model can be conditioned on any
vector, including descriptive labels or tags, or latent embeddings created by
other networks. When conditioned on class labels from the ImageNet database,
the model is able to generate diverse, realistic scenes representing distinct
animals, objects, landscapes and structures. When conditioned on an embedding
produced by a convolutional network given a single image of an unseen face, it
generates a variety of new portraits of the same person with different facial
expressions, poses and lighting conditions. We also show that conditional
PixelCNN can serve as a powerful decoder in an image autoencoder. Additionally,
the gated convolutional layers in the proposed model improve the log-likelihood
of PixelCNN to match the state-of-the-art performance of PixelRNN on ImageNet,
with greatly reduced computational cost.

 <dc:description>  We describe and motivate a proposed new approach to lowerbounding the circuit
complexity of boolean functions, based on a new formalization of &quot;patterns&quot; as
elements of a special basis of the vector space of all truth table properties.
We prove that a &quot;pattern basis&quot; with certain properties would lead to a useful
complexity formula of a specific form, and speculate on how to find such a
basis. This formula might take as long to compute on arbitrary functions as a
brute-force search among circuits, thus addressing the natural proofs barrier,
but has a form amenable to proving lower bounds for well-understood explicit
functions.

 <dc:title>Spatio-temporal Interference Correlation and Joint Coverage in Cellular

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper provides an analytical framework with foundations in stochastic
geometry to characterize the spatio-temporal interference correlation as well
as the joint coverage probability at two spatial locations in a cellular
network. In particular, modeling the locations of cellular base stations (BSs)
as a Poisson Point Process (PPP), we study interference correlation at two
spatial locations $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ separated by a distance $v$, when the
user follows \emph{closest BS association policy} at both spatial locations and
moves from $\ell_1$ to $\ell_2$. With this user displacement, two scenarios can
occur: i) the user is handed off to a new serving BS at $\ell_2$, or ii) no
handoff occurs and the user is served by the same BS at both locations. After
providing intermediate results such as probability of handoff and distance
distributions of the serving BS at the two user locations, we use them to
derive exact expressions for spatio-temporal interference correlation
coefficient and joint coverage probability for any distance separation $v$. We
also study two different handoff strategies: i) \emph{handoff skipping}, and
ii) \emph{conventional handoffs}, and derive the expressions of joint coverage
probability for both strategies. The exact analysis is not straightforward and
involves a careful treatment of the neighborhood of the two spatial locations
and the resulting handoff scenarios. To provide analytical insights, we also
provide easy-to-use expressions for two special cases: i) static user ($v =0$)
and ii) highly mobile user ($v \rightarrow \infty)$. As expected, our analysis
shows that the interference correlation and joint coverage probability decrease
with increasing $v$, with $v \rightarrow \infty$ corresponding to a completely
uncorrelated scenario.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new approach to the problem of neural network expressivity,
which seeks to characterize how structural properties of a neural network
family affect the functions it is able to compute. Our approach is based on an
interrelated set of measures of expressivity, unified by the novel notion of
trajectory length, which measures how the output of a network changes as the
input sweeps along a one-dimensional path. Our findings can be summarized as
follows:
  (1) The complexity of the computed function grows exponentially with depth.
  (2) All weights are not equal: trained networks are more sensitive to their
lower (initial) layer weights.
  (3) Regularizing on trajectory length (trajectory regularization) is a
simpler alternative to batch normalization, with the same performance.

 <dc:description>  We combine Riemannian geometry with the mean field theory of high dimensional
chaos to study the nature of signal propagation in generic, deep neural
networks with random weights. Our results reveal an order-to-chaos expressivity
phase transition, with networks in the chaotic phase computing nonlinear
functions whose global curvature grows exponentially with depth but not width.
We prove this generic class of deep random functions cannot be efficiently
computed by any shallow network, going beyond prior work restricted to the
analysis of single functions. Moreover, we formalize and quantitatively
demonstrate the long conjectured idea that deep networks can disentangle highly
curved manifolds in input space into flat manifolds in hidden space. Our
theoretical analysis of the expressive power of deep networks broadly applies
to arbitrary nonlinearities, and provides a quantitative underpinning for
previously abstract notions about the geometry of deep functions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework for video analysis
focused towards practical scenarios built on theoretical foundations from
sparse representation, including a novel descriptor for general purpose video
analysis. In our approach, we compute kinematic features from optical flow and
first and second-order derivatives of intensities to represent motion and
appearance respectively. These features are then used to construct covariance
matrices which capture joint statistics of both low-level motion and appearance
features extracted from a video. Using an over-complete dictionary of the
covariance based descriptors built from labeled training samples, we formulate
low-level event recognition as a sparse linear approximation problem. Within
this, we pose the sparse decomposition of a covariance matrix, which also
conforms to the space of semi-positive definite matrices, as a determinant
maximization problem. Also since covariance matrices lie on non-linear
Riemannian manifolds, we compare our former approach with a sparse linear
approximation alternative that is suitable for equivalent vector spaces of
covariance matrices. This is done by searching for the best projection of the
query data on a dictionary using an Orthogonal Matching pursuit algorithm. We
show the applicability of our video descriptor in two different application
domains - namely low-level event recognition in unconstrained scenarios and
gesture recognition using one shot learning. Our experiments provide promising
insights in large scale video analysis.

 <dc:description>  We consider a crowdsourcing model in which $n$ workers are asked to rate the
quality of $n$ items previously generated by other workers. An unknown set of
$\alpha n$ workers generate reliable ratings, while the remaining workers may
behave arbitrarily and possibly adversarially. The manager of the experiment
can also manually evaluate the quality of a small number of items, and wishes
to curate together almost all of the high-quality items with at most an
$\epsilon$ fraction of low-quality items. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that
this is possible with an amount of work required of the manager, and each
worker, that does not scale with $n$: the dataset can be curated with
$\tilde{O}\Big(\frac{1}{\beta\alpha^3\epsilon^4}\Big)$ ratings per worker, and
$\tilde{O}\Big(\frac{1}{\beta\epsilon^2}\Big)$ ratings by the manager, where
$\beta$ is the fraction of high-quality items. Our results extend to the more
general setting of peer prediction, including peer grading in online

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of learning a context-dependent mapping from utterances
to denotations. With only denotations at training time, we must search over a
combinatorially large space of logical forms, which is even larger with
context-dependent utterances. To cope with this challenge, we perform
successive projections of the full model onto simpler models that operate over
equivalence classes of logical forms. Though less expressive, we find that
these simpler models are much faster and can be surprisingly effective.
Moreover, they can be used to bootstrap the full model. Finally, we collected
three new context-dependent semantic parsing datasets, and develop a new
left-to-right parser.

 <dc:description>  In applications involving matching of image sets, the information from
multiple images must be effectively exploited to represent each set.
State-of-the-art methods use probabilistic distribution or subspace to model a
set and use specific distance measure to compare two sets. These methods are
slow to compute and not compact to use in a large scale scenario.
Learning-based hashing is often used in large scale image retrieval as they
provide a compact representation of each sample and the Hamming distance can be
used to efficiently compare two samples. However, most hashing methods encode
each image separately and discard knowledge that multiple images in the same
set represent the same object or person. We investigate the set hashing problem
by combining both set representation and hashing in a single deep neural
network. An image set is first passed to a CNN module to extract image
features, then these features are aggregated using two types of set feature to
capture both set specific and database-wide distribution information. The
computed set feature is then fed into a multilayer perceptron to learn a
compact binary embedding. Triplet loss is used to train the network by forming
set similarity relations using class labels. We extensively evaluate our
approach on datasets used for image matching and show highly competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) is a popular outlier detection
technique which constructs a flexible description of the input data. SVDD
computation time is high for large training datasets which limits its use in
big-data process-monitoring applications. We propose a new iterative
sampling-based method for SVDD training. The method incrementally learns the
training data description at each iteration by computing SVDD on an independent
random sample selected with replacement from the training data set. The
experimental results indicate that the proposed method is extremely fast and
provides a good data description .

 <dc:description>  We introduce D2O, a Python module for cluster-distributed multi-dimensional
numerical arrays. It acts as a layer of abstraction between the algorithm code
and the data-distribution logic. The main goal is to achieve usability without
losing numerical performance and scalability. D2O's global interface is similar
to the one of a numpy.ndarray, whereas the cluster node's local data is
directly accessible for use in customized high-performance modules. D2O is
written in pure Python which makes it portable and easy to use and modify.
Expensive operations are carried out by dedicated external libraries like numpy
and mpi4py. The performance of D2O is on a par with numpy for serial
applications and scales well when moving to an MPI cluster. D2O is open-source
software available under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3) at

 <dc:description>  Understanding why machine learning models behave the way they do empowers
both system designers and end-users in many ways: in model selection, feature
engineering, in order to trust and act upon the predictions, and in more
intuitive user interfaces. Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in
machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found
renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as
non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even
when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability
is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to
interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for
explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By
treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches
provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and
representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety
of users and models. We also outline the main challenges for such methods, and
review a recently-introduced model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) that
addresses these challenges.

 <dc:description>  Recent advancements in the development of memristive devices has opened new
opportunities for hardware implementation of non-Boolean computing. To this
end, the suitability of memristive devices for swarm intelligence algorithms
has enabled researchers to solve a maze in hardware. In this paper, we utilize
swarm intelligence of memristive networks to perform image edge detection.
First, we propose a hardware-friendly algorithm for image edge detection based
on ant colony. Second, we implement the image edge detection algorithm using
memristive networks. Furthermore, we explain the impact of various parameters
of the memristors on the efficacy of the implementation. Our results show 28%
improvement in the energy compared to a low power CMOS hardware implementation
based on stochastic circuits. Furthermore, our design occupies up to 5x less
area.

 <dc:description>  With the fast development of wireless technologies, wireless applications
have invaded various areas in people's lives with a wide range of capabilities.
Guaranteeing Quality-of-Service (QoS) is the key to the success of those
applications. One of the QoS requirements, service frequency, is very important
for tasks including multimedia transmission in the Internet of Things. A
service frequency constraint denotes the length of time period during which a
link can transmit at least once. Unfortunately, it has not been well addressed
yet. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework to schedule multi
transmitting flows in wireless networks considering service frequency
constraint for each link. In our model, the constraints for flows are
heterogeneous due to the diversity of users' behaviors. We first introduce a
new definition for network stability with service frequency constraints and
demonstrate that the novel scheduling policy is throughput-optimal in one
fundamental category of network models. After that, we discuss the performance
of a wireless network with service frequency constraints from the views of
capacity region and total queue length. Finally, a series of evaluations
indicate the proposed scheduling policy can guarantee service frequency and
achieve a good performance on the aspect of queue length of each flow.

 <dc:description>  This work explores coded caching in the symmetric $K$-user cache-aided MISO
BC with imperfect CSIT-type feedback, for the specific case where the cache
size is much smaller than the library size. Building on the recently explored
synergy between caching and delayed-CSIT, and building on the tradeoff between
caching and CSIT quality, the work proposes new schemes that boost the impact
of small caches, focusing on the case where the cumulative cache size is
smaller than the library size. For this small-cache setting, based on the
proposed near-optimal schemes, the work identifies the optimal cache-aided
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) performance within a factor of 4.

 <dc:description>  PLACES 2016 (full title: Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency- and
Communication-Centric Software) is the ninth edition of the PLACES workshop
series. After the first PLACES, which was affiliated to DisCoTec in 2008, the
workshop has been part of ETAPS every year since 2009 and is now an established
part of the ETAPS satellite events. PLACES 2016 was held on 8th April in
Eindhoven, The Netherlands. The workshop series was started in order to promote
the application of novel programming language ideas to the increasingly
important problem of developing software for systems in which concurrency and
communication are intrinsic aspects. This includes software for both multi-core
systems and large-scale distributed and/or service-oriented systems. The scope
of PLACES includes new programming language features, whole new programming
language designs, new type systems, new semantic approaches, new program
analysis techniques, and new implementation mechanisms. This volume consists of
the papers accepted for presentation at the workshop.

 <dc:description>  In spite of the vast literature on spreading dynamics on complex networks,
the role of local synergy, i.e., the interaction of elements that when combined
produce a total effect greater than the sum of the individualelements, has been
studied but only for irreversible spreading dynamics. Reversible spreading
dynamics are ubiquitous but their interplay with synergy has remained unknown.
To fill this knowledge gap, we articulate a model to incorporate local
synergistic effect into the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible process,
in which the probability for a susceptible node to become infected through an
infected neighbor is enhanced when the neighborhood of the latter contains a
number of infected nodes. We derive master equations incorporating the
synergistic effect, with predictions that agree well with the numerical
results. A striking finding is that, when a parameter characterizing the
strength of the synergy reinforcement effect is above a critical value, the
steady state density of the infected nodes versus the basic transmission rate
exhibits an explosively increasing behavior and a hysteresis loop emerges. In
fact, increasing the synergy strength can promote the spreading and reduce the
invasion and persistence thresholds of the hysteresis loop. A physical
understanding of the synergy promoting explosive spreading and the associated
hysteresis behavior can be obtained through a mean-field analysis.

 <dc:description>  Using network-based information to facilitate information spreading is an
essential task for spreading dynamics in complex networks, which will benefit
the promotion of technical innovations, healthy behaviors, new products, etc.
Focusing on degree correlated networks, we propose a preferential contact
strategy based on the local network structure and local informed density to
promote the information spreading. During the spreading process, an informed
node will preferentially select a contact target among its neighbors, basing on
their degrees or local informed densities. By extensively implementing
numerical simulations in synthetic and empirical networks, we find that when
only consider the local structure information, the convergence time of
information spreading will be remarkably reduced if low-degree neighbors are
favored as contact targets. Meanwhile, the minimum convergence time depends
non-monotonically on degree-degree correlation, and moderate correlation
coefficients result in most efficient information spreading. Incorporating the
informed density information into contact strategy, the convergence time of
information spreading can be further reduced. Finally, we show that by using
local informed density is more effective as compared with the global case.

 <dc:description>  Conventional word sense induction (WSI) methods usually represent each
instance with discrete linguistic features or cooccurrence features, and train
a model for each polysemous word individually. In this work, we propose to
learn sense embeddings for the WSI task. In the training stage, our method
induces several sense centroids (embedding) for each polysemous word. In the
testing stage, our method represents each instance as a contextual vector, and
induces its sense by finding the nearest sense centroid in the embedding space.
The advantages of our method are (1) distributed sense vectors are taken as the
knowledge representations which are trained discriminatively, and usually have
better performance than traditional count-based distributional models, and (2)
a general model for the whole vocabulary is jointly trained to induce sense
centroids under the mutlitask learning framework. Evaluated on SemEval-2010 WSI
dataset, our method outperforms all participants and most of the recent
state-of-the-art methods. We further verify the two advantages by comparing
with carefully designed baselines.

 <dc:description>  Robust face detection in the wild is one of the ultimate components to
support various facial related problems, i.e. unconstrained face recognition,
facial periocular recognition, facial landmarking and pose estimation, facial
expression recognition, 3D facial model construction, etc. Although the face
detection problem has been intensely studied for decades with various
commercial applications, it still meets problems in some real-world scenarios
due to numerous challenges, e.g. heavy facial occlusions, extremely low
resolutions, strong illumination, exceptionally pose variations, image or video
compression artifacts, etc. In this paper, we present a face detection approach
named Contextual Multi-Scale Region-based Convolution Neural Network (CMS-RCNN)
to robustly solve the problems mentioned above. Similar to the region-based
CNNs, our proposed network consists of the region proposal component and the
region-of-interest (RoI) detection component. However, far apart of that
network, there are two main contributions in our proposed network that play a
significant role to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in face detection.
Firstly, the multi-scale information is grouped both in region proposal and RoI
detection to deal with tiny face regions. Secondly, our proposed network allows
explicit body contextual reasoning in the network inspired from the intuition
of human vision system. The proposed approach is benchmarked on two recent
challenging face detection databases, i.e. the WIDER FACE Dataset which
contains high degree of variability, as well as the Face Detection Dataset and
Benchmark (FDDB). The experimental results show that our proposed approach
trained on WIDER FACE Dataset outperforms strong baselines on WIDER FACE
Dataset by a large margin, and consistently achieves competitive results on
FDDB against the recent state-of-the-art face detection methods.

 <dc:description>  The wide field of view (WFV) imaging system onboard the Chinese GaoFen-1
(GF-1) optical satellite has a 16-m resolution and four-day revisit cycle for
large-scale Earth observation. The advantages of the high temporal-spatial
resolution and the wide field of view make the GF-1 WFV imagery very popular.
However, cloud cover is an inevitable problem in GF-1 WFV imagery, which
influences its precise application. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection
in GF-1 WFV imagery is quite difficult due to the fact that there are only
three visible bands and one near-infrared band. In this paper, an automatic
multi-feature combined (MFC) method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow
detection in GF-1 WFV imagery. The MFC algorithm first implements threshold
segmentation based on the spectral features and mask refinement based on guided
filtering to generate a preliminary cloud mask. The geometric features are then
used in combination with the texture features to improve the cloud detection
results and produce the final cloud mask. Finally, the cloud shadow mask can be
acquired by means of the cloud and shadow matching and follow-up correction
process. The method was validated using 108 globally distributed scenes. The
results indicate that MFC performs well under most conditions, and the average
overall accuracy of MFC cloud detection is as high as 96.8%. In the contrastive
analysis with the official provided cloud fractions, MFC shows a significant
improvement in cloud fraction estimation, and achieves a high accuracy for the
cloud and cloud shadow detection in the GF-1 WFV imagery with fewer spectral
bands. The proposed method could be used as a preprocessing step in the future
to monitor land-cover change, and it could also be easily extended to other
optical satellite imagery which has a similar spectral setting.

 <dc:description>  Speculative techniques in microarchitectures relax various dependencies in
programs, which contributes to the complexity of (weak) memory models. We show
using WMM, a new weak memory model, that the model becomes simpler if it
includes load-value speculation and thus, does not enforce any dependency!
However, in the absence of good value-prediction techniques, a programmer may
end up paying a price for the extra fences. Thus, we also present WMM-D, which
enforces the dependencies captured by the current microarchitectures. WMM-D is
still much simpler than other existing models. We also show that non-atomic
multi-copy stores arise as a result of sharing write-through caches. We think
restricting microarchitectures to write-back caches (and thus simpler weak
memory models) will not incur any performance penalty. Nevertheless, we present
WMM-S, another extension to WMM, which could model the effects of non-atomic
multi-copy stores. WMM, WMM-D, and WMM-S are all defined using Instantaneous
Instruction Execution (I^2E), a new way of describing memory models without
explicit reordering or speculative execution.

 <dc:title>DecomposeMe: Simplifying ConvNets for End-to-End Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alvarez, Jose</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep learning and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been
successfully applied to most relevant tasks in the computer vision community.
However, these networks are computationally demanding and not suitable for
embedded devices where memory and time consumption are relevant.
  In this paper, we propose DecomposeMe, a simple but effective technique to
learn features using 1D convolutions. The proposed architecture enables both
simplicity and filter sharing leading to increased learning capacity. A
comprehensive set of large-scale experiments on ImageNet and Places2
demonstrates the ability of our method to improve performance while
significantly reducing the number of parameters required. Notably, on Places2,
we obtain an improvement in relative top-1 classification accuracy of 7.7\%
with an architecture that requires 92% fewer parameters compared to VGG-B. The
proposed network is also demonstrated to generalize to other tasks by
converting existing networks.

 <dc:description>  This technical report accompanies a research article that empirically studies
the problems related to inter-repository package dependencies in the R
ecosystem of statistical computing, with a focus on R packages hosted on CRAN
and GitHub. The current report provides supplementary material, reproducing an
anonymised and sanitised version of e-mail interviews that have been conducted
in November 2015 with five active R package maintainers. The goal was to gain a
better understanding in how R package maintainers develop and distribute their
packages through GitHub and CRAN. All five interviewees were actively
maintaining packages on GitHub, some were also active on CRAN. They have been
selected based on their profile (the number of R packages they maintain on
GitHub and/or CRAN) as well as their gender (three interviewees were male, two
were female).

 <dc:description>  Visual Question Answering (VQA) has attracted a lot of attention in both
Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities, not least because
it offers insight into the relationships between two important sources of
information. Current datasets, and the models built upon them, have focused on
questions which are answerable by direct analysis of the question and image
alone. The set of such questions that require no external information to answer
is interesting, but very limited. It excludes questions which require common
sense, or basic factual knowledge to answer, for example. Here we introduce
FVQA, a VQA dataset which requires, and supports, much deeper reasoning. FVQA
only contains questions which require external information to answer.
  We thus extend a conventional visual question answering dataset, which
contains image-question-answerg triplets, through additional
image-question-answer-supporting fact tuples. The supporting fact is
represented as a structural triplet, such as &lt;Cat,CapableOf,ClimbingTrees&gt;.
  We evaluate several baseline models on the FVQA dataset, and describe a novel
model which is capable of reasoning about an image on the basis of supporting
facts.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of efficient verification of multi-threaded programs
running over Total Store Order (TSO) memory model. It has been shown that even
with finite data domain programs, the complexity of control state reachability
under TSO is non-primitive recursive. In this paper, we first present a
bounded-buffer verification approach wherein a bound on the size of buffers is
placed; verification is performed incrementally by increasing the size of the
buffer with each iteration of the verification procedure until the said bound
is reached. For programs operating on finite data domains, we also demonstrate
the existence of a buffer bound k such that if the program is safe under that
bound, then it is also safe for unbounded buffers. We have implemented this
technique in a tool ProofTraPar. Our results against memorax [2], a
state-of-the-art sound and complete verifier for TSO memory model, have been
encouraging.

 <dc:description>  One of the most widely-implemented service standards provided by the Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to the user community is the Web Map Service (WMS).
WMS is widely employed globally, but there is limited knowledge of the global
distribution, adoption status or the service quality of these online WMS
resources. To fill this void, we investigated global WMSs resources and
performed distributed performance monitoring of these services. This paper
explicates a distributed monitoring framework that was used to monitor 46,296
WMSs continuously for over one year and a crawling method to discover these
WMSs. We analyzed server locations, provider types, themes, the spatiotemporal
coverage of map layers and the service versions for 41,703 valid WMSs.
Furthermore, we appraised the stability and performance of basic operations for
1210 selected WMSs (i.e., GetCapabilities and GetMap). We discuss the major
reasons for request errors and performance issues, as well as the relationship
between service response times and the spatiotemporal distribution of client
monitoring sites. This paper will help service providers, end users and
developers of standards to grasp the status of global WMS resources, as well as
to understand the adoption status of OGC standards. The conclusions drawn in
this paper can benefit geospatial resource discovery, service performance
evaluation and guide service performance improvements.

 <dc:description>  The capability to store data about business processes execution in so-called
Event Logs has brought to the diffusion of tools for the analysis of process
executions and for the assessment of the goodness of a process model.
Nonetheless, these tools are often very rigid in dealing with with Event Logs
that include incomplete information about the process execution. Thus, while
the ability of handling incomplete event data is one of the challenges
mentioned in the process mining manifesto, the evaluation of compliance of an
execution trace still requires an end-to-end complete trace to be performed.
  This paper exploits the power of abduction to provide a flexible, yet
computationally effective, framework to deal with different forms of
incompleteness in an Event Log. Moreover it proposes a refinement of the
classical notion of compliance into strong and conditional compliance to take
into account incomplete logs. Finally, performances evaluation in an
experimental setting shows the feasibility of the presented approach.

 <dc:description>  Stance detection is the task of classifying the attitude expressed in a text
towards a target such as Hillary Clinton to be &quot;positive&quot;, negative&quot; or
&quot;neutral&quot;. Previous work has assumed that either the target is mentioned in the
text or that training data for every target is given. This paper considers the
more challenging version of this task, where targets are not always mentioned
and no training data is available for the test targets. We experiment with
conditional LSTM encoding, which builds a representation of the tweet that is
dependent on the target, and demonstrate that it outperforms encoding the tweet
and the target independently. Performance is improved further when the
conditional model is augmented with bidirectional encoding. We evaluate our
approach on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus achieving
performance second best only to a system trained on semi-automatically labelled
tweets for the test target. When such weak supervision is added, our approach
achieves state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:title>Gender Inference using Statistical Name Characteristics in Twitter</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Much attention has been given to the task of gender inference of Twitter
users. Although names are strong gender indicators, the names of Twitter users
are rarely used as a feature; probably due to the high number of ill-formed
names, which cannot be found in any name dictionary. Instead of relying solely
on a name database, we propose a novel name classifier. Our approach extracts
characteristics from the user names and uses those in order to assign the names
to a gender. This enables us to classify international first names as well as
ill-formed names.

 <dc:title>Most central or least central? How much modeling decisions influence a

 <dc:description>  To understand a node's centrality in a multiplex network, its centrality
values in all the layers of the network can be aggregated. This requires a
normalization of the values, to allow their meaningful comparison and
aggregation over networks with different sizes and orders. The concrete choices
of such preprocessing steps like normalization and aggregation are almost never
discussed in network analytic papers. In this paper, we show that even sticking
to the most simple centrality index (the degree) but using different, classic
choices of normalization and aggregation strategies, can turn a node from being
among the most central to being among the least central. We present our results
by using an aggregation operator which scales between different, classic
aggregation strategies based on three multiplex networks. We also introduce a
new visualization and characterization of a node's sensitivity to the choice of
a normalization and aggregation strategy in multiplex networks. The observed
high sensitivity of single nodes to the specific choice of aggregation and
normalization strategies is of strong importance, especially for all kinds of
intelligence-analytic software as it questions the interpretations of the
findings.

 <dc:description>  We propose two parallel state-space exploration algorithms for hybrid systems
with the goal of enhancing performance on multi-core shared memory systems. The
first is an adaption of the parallel breadth first search in the SPIN model
checker. We show that the adapted algorithm does not provide the desired load
balancing for many hybrid systems benchmarks. The second is a task parallel
algorithm based on cheaply precomputing cost of post (continuous and discrete)
operations for effective load balancing. We illustrate the task parallel
algorithm and the cost precomputation of post operators on a
support-function-based algorithm for state-space exploration. The performance
comparison of the two algorithms displays a better CPU
utilization/load-balancing of the second over the first, except for certain
cases. The algorithms are implemented in the model checker XSpeed and our
experiments show a maximum speed-up of $900\times$ on a navigation benchmark
with respect to SpaceEx LGG scenario, comparing on the basis of equal number of
post operations evaluated.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the world of
computer vision over the last few years, pushing image classification beyond
human accuracy. The computational effort of today's CNNs requires power-hungry
parallel processors or GP-GPUs. Recent developments in CNN accelerators for
system-on-chip integration have reduced energy consumption significantly.
Unfortunately, even these highly optimized devices are above the power envelope
imposed by mobile and deeply embedded applications and face hard limitations
caused by CNN weight I/O and storage. This prevents the adoption of CNNs in
future ultra-low power Internet of Things end-nodes for near-sensor analytics.
Recent algorithmic and theoretical advancements enable competitive
classification accuracy even when limiting CNNs to binary (+1/-1) weights
during training. These new findings bring major optimization opportunities in
the arithmetic core by removing the need for expensive multiplications, as well
as reducing I/O bandwidth and storage. In this work, we present an accelerator
optimized for binary-weight CNNs that achieves 1510 GOp/s at 1.2 V on a core
area of only 1.33 MGE (Million Gate Equivalent) or 0.19 mm$^2$ and with a power
dissipation of 895 {\mu}W in UMC 65 nm technology at 0.6 V. Our accelerator
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of energy and area
efficiency achieving 61.2 TOp/s/W@0.6 V and 1135 GOp/s/MGE@1.2 V, respectively.

 <dc:title>Homogeneous Equations of Algebraic Petri Nets</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Algebraic Petri nets are a formalism for modeling distributed systems and
algorithms, describing control and data flow by combining Petri nets and
algebraic specification. One way to specify correctness of an algebraic Petri
net model $N$ is to specify a linear equation $E$ over the places of $N$ based
on term substitution, and coefficients from an abelian group $G$. Then, $E$ is
valid in $N$ iff $E$ is valid in each reachable marking of $N$ . Due to the
expressive power of Algebraic Petri nets, validity is generally undecidable.
Stable linear equations form a class of linear equations for which validity is
decidable. Place invariants yield a well-understood but incomplete
characterization of all stable linear equations. In this paper, we provide a
complete characterization of stability for the subclass of homogeneous linear
equations, by restricting ourselves to the interpretation of terms over the
Herbrand structure without considering further equality axioms. Based thereon,
we show that stability is decidable for homogeneous linear equations if $G$ is
a cyclic group.

 <dc:description>  Humans are generally good at learning abstract concepts about objects and
scenes (e.g.\ spatial orientation, relative sizes, etc.). Over the last years
convolutional neural networks have achieved almost human performance in
recognizing concrete classes (i.e.\ specific object categories). This paper
tests the performance of a current CNN (GoogLeNet) on the task of
differentiating between abstract classes which are trivially differentiable for
humans. We trained and tested the CNN on the two abstract classes of horizontal
and vertical orientation and determined how well the network is able to
transfer the learned classes to other, previously unseen objects.

 <dc:description>  Consider a continuous signal that cannot be observed directly. Instead, one
has access to multiple corrupted versions of the signal. The available
corrupted signals are correlated because they carry information about the
common remote signal. The goal is to reconstruct the original signal from the
data collected from its corrupted versions. The information theoretic
formulation of the remote reconstruction problem assumes that the corrupted
signals are uniformly sampled and the focus is on optimal compression of the
samples. In this paper we revisit this problem from a sampling perspective. We
look at the problem of finding the best sampling locations for each signal to
minimize the total reconstruction distortion of the remote signal. In finding
the sampling locations, one can take advantage of the correlation among the
corrupted signals. Our main contribution is a fundamental lower bound on the
reconstruction distortion for any arbitrary nonuniform sampling strategy. This
lower bound is valid for any sampling rate. Furthermore, it is tight and
matches the optimal reconstruction distortion in low and high sampling rates.
Moreover, it is shown that in the low sampling rate region, it is optimal to
use a certain nonuniform sampling scheme on all the signals. On the other hand,
in the high sampling rate region, it is optimal to uniformly sample all the
signals. We also consider the problem of finding the optimal sampling locations
to recover the set of corrupted signals, rather than the remote signal. Unlike
the information theoretic formulation of the problem in which these two
problems were equivalent, we show that they are not equivalent in our setting.

 <dc:description>  The importance of IXPs to interconnect different networks and exchange
traffic locally has been well studied over the last few years. However, far
less is known about the role IXPs play as a platform to enable large-scale
content delivery and to reach a world-wide customer base. In this paper, we
study the infrastructure deployment of a content hypergiant, Netflix, and show
that the combined worldwide IXP substrate is the major corner stone of its
Content Delivery Network. To meet its worldwide demand for high-quality video
delivery, Netflix has built a dedicated CDN. Its scale allows us to study a
major part of the Internet ecosystem, by observing how Netflix takes advantage
of the combined capabilities of IXPs and ISPs present in different regions. We
find wide disparities in the regional Netflix deployment and traffic levels at
IXPs and ISPs across various local ecosystems. This highlights the complexity
of large-scale content delivery as well as differences in the capabilities of
IXPs in specific regions. On a global scale we find that the footprint provided
by IXPs allows Netflix to deliver most of its traffic directly from them. This
highlights the additional role that IXPs play in the Internet ecosystem, not
just in terms of interconnection, but also allowing players such as Netflix to
deliver significant amounts of traffic.

 <dc:description>  Brlek et al. conjectured in 2008 that any fixed point of a primitive morphism
with finite palindromic defect is either periodic or its palindromic defect is
zero. Bucci and Vaslet disproved this conjecture in 2012 by a counterexample
over ternary alphabet. We prove that the conjecture is valid on binary
alphabet. We also describe a class of morphisms over multiliteral alphabet for
which the conjecture still holds. The proof is based on properties of extension
graphs.

 <dc:description>  Tensor networks have in recent years emerged as the powerful tools for
solving the large-scale optimization problems. One of the most popular tensor
network is tensor train (TT) decomposition that acts as the building blocks for
the complicated tensor networks. However, the TT decomposition highly depends
on permutations of tensor dimensions, due to its strictly sequential
multilinear products over latent cores, which leads to difficulties in finding
the optimal TT representation. In this paper, we introduce a fundamental tensor
decomposition model to represent a large dimensional tensor by a circular
multilinear products over a sequence of low dimensional cores, which can be
graphically interpreted as a cyclic interconnection of 3rd-order tensors, and
thus termed as tensor ring (TR) decomposition. The key advantage of TR model is
the circular dimensional permutation invariance which is gained by employing
the trace operation and treating the latent cores equivalently. TR model can be
viewed as a linear combination of TT decompositions, thus obtaining the
powerful and generalized representation abilities. For optimization of latent
cores, we present four different algorithms based on the sequential SVDs, ALS
scheme, and block-wise ALS techniques. Furthermore, the mathematical properties
of TR model are investigated, which shows that the basic multilinear algebra
can be performed efficiently by using TR representaions and the classical
tensor decompositions can be conveniently transformed into the TR
representation. Finally, the experiments on both synthetic signals and
real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of different
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Counting the number of permutations of a given total displacement is
equivalent to counting weighted Motzkin paths of a given area (Guay-Paquet and
Petersen, 2014). The former combinatorial problem is still open. In this work,
we show that this connection allows to construct efficient algorithms for
counting and for sampling such permutations. These algorithms provide a tool to
better understand the original combinatorial problem. A by-product of our
approach is a different way of counting based on certain building sequences for
Motzkin paths, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel unsupervised approach for multilingual sentiment analysis
driven by compositional syntax-based rules. On the one hand, we exploit some of
the main advantages of unsupervised algorithms: (1) the interpretability of
their output, in contrast with most supervised models, which behave as a black
box and (2) their robustness across different corpora and domains. On the other
hand, by introducing the concept of compositional operations and exploiting
syntactic information in the form of universal dependencies, we tackle one of
their main drawbacks: their rigidity on data that are structured differently
depending on the language concerned. Experiments show an improvement both over
existing unsupervised methods, and over state-of-the-art supervised models when
evaluating outside their corpus of origin. Experiments also show how the same
compositional operations can be shared across languages. The system is
available at http://www.grupolys.org/software/UUUSA/

 <dc:description>  This document presents a studies of the stochastic behavior of D-Wave qubits,
qubit cells, and qubit chains. The purpose of this paper is to address the
algorithmic behavior of execution rather than the physical behavior, though
they are related. The measurements from an actual D-Wave adiabatic quantum
computer are compare with calculated measurements from a theoretical adiabatic
quantum computer running with an effective temperature of zero. In this way the
paper attempts to shed light on how the D-Wave's behavior effects how well it
minimizes its objective function and why the D-Wave performs as it does.

 <dc:description>  The runtime of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) depends critically on their
parameter settings, which are often problem-specific. Automated schemes for
parameter tuning have been developed to alleviate the high costs of manual
parameter tuning. Experimental results indicate that self-adaptation, where
parameter settings are encoded in the genomes of individuals, can be effective
in continuous optimisation. However, results in discrete optimisation have been
less conclusive. Furthermore, a rigorous runtime analysis that explains how
self-adaptation can lead to asymptotic speedups has been missing. This paper
provides the first such analysis for discrete, population-based EAs. We apply
level-based analysis to show how a self-adaptive EA is capable of fine-tuning
its mutation rate, leading to exponential speedups over EAs using fixed
mutation rates.

 <dc:description>  In This paper we present a novel approach to spam filtering and demonstrate
its applicability with respect to SMS messages. Our approach requires minimum
features engineering and a small set of la- belled data samples. Features are
extracted using topic modelling based on latent Dirichlet allocation, and then
a comprehensive data model is created using a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder
(SDA). Topic modelling summarises the data providing ease of use and high
interpretability by visualising the topics using word clouds. Given that the
SMS messages can be regarded as either spam (unwanted) or ham (wanted), the SDA
is able to model the messages and accurately discriminate between the two
classes without the need for a pre-labelled training set. The results are
compared against the state-of-the-art spam detection algorithms with our
proposed approach achieving over 97% accuracy which compares favourably to the
best reported algorithms presented in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Finite volume methods (FVMs) constitute a popular class of methods for the
numerical simulation of fluid flows. Among the various components of these
methods, the discretisation of the gradient operator has received less
attention despite its fundamental importance with regards to the accuracy of
the FVM. The most popular gradient schemes are the divergence theorem (DT) (or
Green-Gauss) scheme, and the least-squares (LS) scheme. Both are widely
believed to be second-order accurate, but the present study shows that in fact
the common variant of the DT gradient is second-order accurate only on
structured meshes whereas it is zeroth-order accurate on general unstructured
meshes, and the LS gradient is second-order and first-order accurate,
respectively. This is explained through a theoretical analysis and is confirmed
by numerical tests. The schemes are then used within a FVM to solve a simple
diffusion equation on unstructured grids generated by several methods; the
results reveal that the zeroth-order accuracy of the DT gradient is inherited
by the FVM as a whole, and the discretisation error does not decrease with grid
refinement. On the other hand, use of the LS gradient leads to second-order
accurate results, as does the use of alternative, consistent, DT gradient
schemes, including a new iterative scheme that makes the common DT gradient
consistent at almost no extra cost. The numerical tests are performed using
both an in-house code and the popular public domain PDE solver OpenFOAM.

 <dc:description>  A low-complexity orthogonal multiplierless approximation for the 16-point
discrete cosine transform (DCT) was introduced. The proposed method was
designed to possess a very low computational cost. A fast algorithm based on
matrix factorization was proposed requiring only 60~additions. The proposed
architecture outperforms classical and state-of-the-art algorithms when
assessed as a tool for image and video compression. Digital VLSI hardware
implementations were also proposed being physically realized in FPGA technology
and implemented in 45 nm up to synthesis and place-route levels. Additionally,
the proposed method was embedded into a high efficiency video coding (HEVC)
reference software for actual proof-of-concept. Obtained results show
negligible video degradation when compared to Chen DCT algorithm in HEVC.

 <dc:description>  A polyhedral method to solve a system of polynomial equations exploits its
sparse structure via the Newton polytopes of the polynomials. We propose a
hybrid symbolic-numeric method to compute a Puiseux series expansion for every
space curve that is a solution of a polynomial system. The focus of this paper
concerns the difficult case when the leading powers of the Puiseux series of
the space curve are contained in the relative interior of a higher dimensional
cone of the tropical prevariety. We show that this difficult case does not
occur for polynomials with generic coefficients. To resolve this case, we
propose to apply polyhedral end games to recover tropisms hidden in the
tropical prevariety.

interpretable rules that capture the decisions of composers. This paper asks,
&quot;Can a machine behave like a music theorist?&quot; It presents MUS-ROVER, a
self-learning system for automatically discovering rules from symbolic music.
MUS-ROVER performs feature learning via $n$-gram models to extract
compositional rules --- statistical patterns over the resulting features. We
evaluate MUS-ROVER on Bach's (SATB) chorales, demonstrating that it can recover
known rules, as well as identify new, characteristic patterns for further
study. We discuss how the extracted rules can be used in both machine and human
composition.

 <dc:description>  Today's smartphones come equipped with a range of advanced sensors capable of
sensing motion, orientation, audio as well as environmental data with high
accuracy. With the existence of application distribution channels such as the
Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, researchers can distribute
applications and collect large scale data in ways that previously were not
possible. Motivated by the lack of a universal, multi-platform sensing library,
in this work we present the design and implementation of SensingKit, an
open-source continuous sensing system that supports both iOS and Android mobile
devices. One of the unique features of SensingKit is the support of the latest
beacon technologies based on Bluetooth Smart (BLE), such as iBeaconand
Eddystone. We evaluate and compare the power consumption of each supported
sensor individually, using an iPhone 5S device running on iOS 9. We believe
that this platform will be beneficial to all researchers and developers who
plan to use mobile sensing technology in large-scale experiments.

 <dc:description>  We consider stochastic optimization problems in multi-agent settings, where a
network of agents aims to learn parameters which are optimal in terms of a
global objective, while giving preference to locally observed streaming
information. To do so, we depart from the canonical decentralized optimization
framework where agreement constraints are enforced, and instead formulate a
problem where each agent minimizes a global objective while enforcing network
proximity constraints. This formulation includes online consensus optimization
as a special case, but allows for the more general hypothesis that there is
data heterogeneity across the network. To solve this problem, we propose using
a stochastic saddle point algorithm inspired by Arrow and Hurwicz. This method
yields a decentralized algorithm for processing observations sequentially
received at each node of the network. Using Lagrange multipliers to penalize
the discrepancy between them, only neighboring nodes exchange model
information. We establish that under a constant step-size regime the
time-average suboptimality and constraint violation are contained in a
neighborhood whose radius vanishes with increasing number of iterations. As a
consequence, we prove that the time-average primal vectors converge to the
optimal objective while satisfying the network proximity constraints. We apply
this method to the problem of sequentially estimating a correlated random field
in a sensor network, as well as an online source localization problem, both of
which demonstrate the empirical validity of the aforementioned convergence
results.

 <dc:description>  Automated discovery of early visual concepts from raw image data is a major
open challenge in AI research. Addressing this problem, we propose an
unsupervised approach for learning disentangled representations of the
underlying factors of variation. We draw inspiration from neuroscience, and
show how this can be achieved in an unsupervised generative model by applying
the same learning pressures as have been suggested to act in the ventral visual
stream in the brain. By enforcing redundancy reduction, encouraging statistical
independence, and exposure to data with transform continuities analogous to
those to which human infants are exposed, we obtain a variational autoencoder
(VAE) framework capable of learning disentangled factors. Our approach makes
few assumptions and works well across a wide variety of datasets. Furthermore,
our solution has useful emergent properties, such as zero-shot inference and an
intuitive understanding of &quot;objectness&quot;.

 <dc:description>  We conduct large-scale studies on `human attention' in Visual Question
Answering (VQA) to understand where humans choose to look to answer questions
about images. We design and test multiple game-inspired novel
attention-annotation interfaces that require the subject to sharpen regions of
a blurred image to answer a question. Thus, we introduce the VQA-HAT (Human
ATtention) dataset. We evaluate attention maps generated by state-of-the-art
VQA models against human attention both qualitatively (via visualizations) and
quantitatively (via rank-order correlation). Overall, our experiments show that
current attention models in VQA do not seem to be looking at the same regions
as humans.

 <dc:description>  Agents of general intelligence deployed in real-world scenarios must adapt to
ever-changing environmental conditions. While such adaptive agents may leverage
engineered knowledge, they will require the capacity to construct and evaluate
knowledge themselves from their own experience in a bottom-up, constructivist
fashion. This position paper builds on the idea of encoding knowledge as
temporally extended predictions through the use of general value functions.
Prior work has focused on learning predictions about externally derived signals
about a task or environment (e.g. battery level, joint position). Here we
advocate that the agent should also predict internally generated signals
regarding its own learning process - for example, an agent's confidence in its
learned predictions. Finally, we suggest how such information would be
beneficial in creating an introspective agent that is able to learn to make
good decisions in a complex, changing world.

 <dc:description>  It has been noticed that some external CVIs exhibit a preferential bias
towards a larger or smaller number of clusters which is monotonic (directly or
inversely) in the number of clusters in candidate partitions. This type of bias
is caused by the functional form of the CVI model. For example, the popular
Rand index (RI) exhibits a monotone increasing (NCinc) bias, while the Jaccard
Index (JI) index suffers from a monotone decreasing (NCdec) bias. This type of
bias has been previously recognized in the literature. In this work, we
identify a new type of bias arising from the distribution of the ground truth
(reference) partition against which candidate partitions are compared. We call
this new type of bias ground truth (GT) bias. This type of bias occurs if a
change in the reference partition causes a change in the bias status (e.g.,
NCinc, NCdec) of a CVI. For example, NCinc bias in the RI can be changed to
NCdec bias by skewing the distribution of clusters in the ground truth
partition. It is important for users to be aware of this new type of biased
behaviour, since it may affect the interpretations of CVI results. The
objective of this article is to study the empirical and theoretical
implications of GT bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
extensive study of such a property for external cluster validity indices.

 <dc:title>Adding Context to Concept Trees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Greer, Kieran</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Concept Trees are a type of database that can organise arbitrary textual
information using a very simple rule. Each tree tries to represent a single
cohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation and
semantic purposes. The trees are therefore a type of semantic network and would
benefit from having a consistent level of context for each of the nodes. The
Concept Tree nodes have a mathematical basis allowing for a consistent build
process. These would represent nouns or verbs in a text sentence, for example.
New to the design can then be lists of descriptive elements for each of the
nodes. The descriptors can also be weighted, but do not have to follow the
strict counting rule of the tree nodes. With the new descriptive layers, a much
richer type of knowledge can be achieved and still reasoned over automatically.
The linking structure of the licas network is very relevant to building the
concept trees now and forms the basis for their construction. The concept tree
- symbolic neural network relation is also extended further.

 <dc:description>  We derandomize G. Valiant's [J. ACM 62 (2015) Art. 13] subquadratic-time
algorithm for finding outlier correlations in binary data. Our derandomized
algorithm gives deterministic subquadratic scaling essentially for the same
parameter range as Valiant's randomized algorithm, but the precise constants we
save over quadratic scaling are more modest. Our main technical tool for
derandomization is an explicit family of correlation amplifiers built via a
family of zigzag-product expanders in Reingold, Vadhan, and Wigderson [Ann. of
Math. 155 (2002) 157--187]. We say that a function
$f:\{-1,1\}^d\rightarrow\{-1,1\}^D$ is a correlation amplifier with threshold
$0\leq\tau\leq 1$, error $\gamma\geq 1$, and strength $p$ an even positive
integer if for all pairs of vectors $x,y\in\{-1,1\}^d$ it holds that (i)
$|\langle x,y\rangle|&lt;\tau d$ implies $|\langle
f(x),f(y)\rangle|\leq(\tau\gamma)^pD$; and (ii) $|\langle x,y\rangle|\geq\tau
d$ implies $\bigl(\frac{\langle x,y\rangle}{\gamma d}\bigr)^pD
  \leq\langle f(x),f(y)\rangle\leq
  \bigl(\frac{\gamma\langle x,y\rangle}{d}\bigr)^pD$.

 <dc:description>  Research on vandalism in Wikipedia has been of interest for the last decade.
This paper performs a literature review on the subject, with the goal of
identifying the main research topics and approaches, methods and techniques
used. 67 papers have been reviewed. Main topic is the detection of vandalism,
although there is a increasing interest about content quality. The most
commonly used technique is machine learning, based on feature analysis. It
draws attention to the lack of research on information behavior of vandals.

 <dc:description>  Recruiters usually spend less than a minute looking at each r\'esum\'e when
deciding whether it's worth continuing the recruitment process with the
candidate. Recruiters focus on keywords, and it's almost impossible to
guarantee a fair process of candidate selection. The main scope of this paper
is to tackle this issue by introducing a data-driven approach that shows how to
process r\'esum\'es automatically and give recruiters more time to only examine
promising candidates. Furthermore, we show how to leverage Machine Learning and
Natural Language Processing in order to extract all required information from
the r\'esum\'es. Once the information is extracted, a ranking score is
calculated. The score describes how well the candidates fit based on their
education, work experience and skills. Later this paper illustrates a prototype
application that shows how this novel approach can increase the productivity of
recruiters. The application enables them to filter and rank candidates based on
predefined job descriptions. Guided by the ranking, recruiters can get deeper
insights from candidate profiles and validate why and how the application
ranked them. This application shows how to improve the hiring process by giving
an unbiased hiring decision support.

 <dc:description>  High resolution depth-maps, obtained by upsampling sparse range data from a
3D-LIDAR, find applications in many fields ranging from sensory perception to
semantic segmentation and object detection. Upsampling is often based on
combining data from a monocular camera to compensate the low-resolution of a
LIDAR. This paper, on the other hand, introduces a novel framework to obtain
dense depth-map solely from a single LIDAR point cloud; which is a research
direction that has been barely explored. The formulation behind the proposed
depth-mapping process relies on local spatial interpolation, using
sliding-window (mask) technique, and on the Bilateral Filter (BF) where the
variable of interest, the distance from the sensor, is considered in the
interpolation problem. In particular, the BF is conveniently modified to
perform depth-map upsampling such that the edges (foreground-background
discontinuities) are better preserved by means of a proposed method which
influences the range-based weighting term. Other methods for spatial upsampling
are discussed, evaluated and compared in terms of different error measures.
This paper also researches the role of the mask's size in the performance of
the implemented methods. Quantitative and qualitative results from experiments
on the KITTI Database, using LIDAR point clouds only, show very satisfactory
performance of the approach introduced in this work.

 <dc:description>  Submodular continuous functions are a category of (generally)
non-convex/non-concave functions with a wide spectrum of applications. We
characterize these functions and demonstrate that they can be maximized
efficiently with approximation guarantees. Specifically, i) We introduce the
weak DR property that gives a unified characterization of submodularity for all
set, integer-lattice and continuous functions; ii) for maximizing monotone
DR-submodular continuous functions under general down-closed convex
constraints, we propose a Frank-Wolfe variant with $(1-1/e)$ approximation
guarantee, and sub-linear convergence rate; iii) for maximizing general
non-monotone submodular continuous functions subject to box constraints, we
propose a DoubleGreedy algorithm with $1/3$ approximation guarantee. Submodular
continuous functions naturally find applications in various real-world
settings, including influence and revenue maximization with continuous
assignments, sensor energy management, multi-resolution data summarization,
facility location, etc. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms
efficiently generate superior solutions compared to baseline algorithms.

 <dc:title>Design of Synchronous Section-Carry Based Carry Lookahead Adders with
  Improved Figure of Merit</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Balasubramanian, P</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The section-carry based carry lookahead adder (SCBCLA) architecture was
proposed as an efficient alternative to the conventional carry lookahead adder
(CCLA) architecture for the physical implementation of computer arithmetic. In
previous related works, self-timed SCBCLA architectures and synchronous SCBCLA
architectures were realized using standard cells and FPGAs. In this work, we
deal with improved realizations of synchronous SCBCLA architectures designed in
a semi-custom fashion using standard cells. The improvement is quantified in
terms of a figure of merit (FOM), where the FOM is defined as the inverse
product of power, delay and area. Since power, delay and area of digital
designs are desirable to be minimized, the FOM is desirable to be maximized.
Starting from an efficient conventional carry lookahead generator, we show how
an optimized section-carry based carry lookahead generator is realized. In
comparison with our recent work dealing with standard cells based
implementation of SCBCLAs to perform 32-bit addition of two binary operands, we
show in this work that with improved section-carry based carry lookahead
generators, the resulting SCBCLAs exhibit significant improvements in FOM.
Compared to the earlier optimized hybrid SCBCLA, the proposed optimized hybrid
SCBCLA improves the FOM by 88.3%. Even the optimized hybrid CCLA features
improvement in FOM by 77.3% over the earlier optimized hybrid CCLA. However,
the proposed optimized hybrid SCBCLA is still the winner and has a better FOM
than the currently optimized hybrid CCLA by 15.3%. All the CCLAs and SCBCLAs
are implemented to realize 32-bit dual-operand binary addition using a 32/28nm
CMOS process.

 <dc:description>  An important task in quantum physics is the estimation of local quantities
for ground states of local Hamiltonians. Recently, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] defined
the complexity class P^QMA[log], and motivated its study by showing that the
physical task of estimating the expectation value of a local observable against
the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is P^QMA[log]-complete. In this paper,
we continue the study of P^QMA[log], obtaining the following results. (1) The
P^QMA[log]-completeness result of [Ambainis, CCC 2014] requires O(log(n))-local
observables and Hamiltonians. We show that simulating even a single qubit
measurement on ground states of 5-local Hamiltonians is P^QMA[log]-complete,
resolving an open question of Ambainis. (2) We formalize the complexity
theoretic study of estimating two-point correlation functions against ground
states, and show that this task is similarly P^QMA[log]-complete. (3)
P^QMA[log] is thought of as &quot;slightly harder&quot; than QMA. We justify this
formally by exploiting the hierarchical voting technique of [Beigel,
Hemachandra, Wechsung, SCT 1989] to show P^QMA[log] is in PP. This improves the
containment QMA is in PP [Kitaev, Watrous, STOC 2000]. (4) A central theme of
this work is the subtlety involved in the study of oracle classes in which the
oracle solves a promise problem. In this vein, we identify a flaw in [Ambainis,
CCC 2014] regarding a P^UQMA[log]-hardness proof for estimating spectral gaps
of local Hamiltonians. By introducing a &quot;query validation&quot; technique, we build
on [Ambainis, CCC 2014] to obtain P^UQMA[log]-hardness for estimating spectral
gaps under polynomial-time Turing reductions.

 <dc:description>  An ordered graph is a pair (G,&lt;) where G is a graph and &lt; is a total ordering
of its vertices. The ordered Ramsey number OR(G,&lt;) is the minimum number N such
that every ordered complete graph with N vertices and with edges colored by two
colors contains a monochromatic copy of (G,&lt;).
  We show that for every integer d&gt;2, almost every d-regular graph G satisfies
OR(G,&lt;) &gt;= n^{3/2-1/d}/(4 log(n)log(log n)) for every ordering (G,&lt;) of G. In
particular, there are 3-regular graphs G on n vertices for which the numbers
OR(G,&lt;) are superlinear in n, regardless of the ordering of G. This solves a
problem of Conlon, Fox, Lee, and Sudakov.
  On the other hand, we prove that every graph G on n vertices with maximum
degree 2 admits an ordering (G,&lt;) such that OR(G,&lt;) is linear in n.
  We also show that almost every ordered matching (M,&lt;) with n vertices and
with interval chromatic number two satisfies OR(M,&lt;) &gt;= cn^2/log^2(n) for some
absolute constant c.

 <dc:description>  The amount of data generated and stored in cloud systems has been increasing
exponentially. The examples of data include user generated data, machine
generated data as well as data crawled from the Internet. There have been
several frameworks with proven efficiency to store and process the petabyte
scale data such as Apache Hadoop, HDFS and several NoSQL frameworks. These
systems have been widely used in industry and thus are subject to several
research. The proposed data processing techniques should be compatible with the
above frameworks in order to be practical. One of the key data operations is
deriving equi-depth histograms as they are crucial in understanding the
statistical properties of the underlying data with many applications including
query optimization. In this paper, we focus on approximate equi-depth histogram
construction for big data and propose a novel merge based histogram
construction method with a histogram processing framework which constructs an
equi-depth histogram for a given time interval. The proposed method constructs
approximate equi-depth histograms by merging exact equi-depth histograms of
partitioned data by guaranteeing a maximum error bound on the number of items
in a bucket (bucket size) as well as any range on the histogram.

 <dc:description>  Fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are expected to utilize wide
bandwidths available at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies for enhancing
system throughput. However, the unfavorable channel conditions of mmWave links,
e.g., higher path loss and attenuation due to atmospheric gases or water vapor,
hinder reliable communications. To compensate for these severe losses, it is
essential to have a multitude of antennas to generate sharp and strong beams
for directional transmission. In this paper, we consider mmWave systems using
uniform planar array (UPA) antennas, which effectively place more antennas on a
two-dimensional grid. A hybrid beamforming setup is also considered to generate
beams by combining a multitude of antennas using only a few radio frequency
chains. We focus on designing a set of transmit beamformers generating beams
adapted to the directional characteristics of mmWave links assuming a UPA and
hybrid beamforming. We first define ideal beam patterns for UPA structures.
Each beamformer is constructed to minimize the mean squared error from the
corresponding ideal beam pattern. Simulation results verify that the proposed
codebooks enhance beamforming reliability and data rate in mmWave systems.

 <dc:description>  Why is our society multicultural? Based on the two mechanisms of homophily
and social influence, the classical model for the dissemination of cultures
proposed by Axelrod predicts the existence of a fragmented regime where
different cultures can coexist in a social network. However, in such model the
multicultural regime is achievable only when a high number of cultural traits
is present, and is not robust against cultural drift, i.e. the spontaneous
mutations of agents' traits. In real systems, social influence is inherently
organised in layers, meaning that individuals tend to diversify their
connections according to the topic on which they interact. In this work we show
that the observed persistence of multiculturality in real-world social systems
is a natural consequence of the layered organisation of social influence. We
find that the critical number of cultural traits that separates the
monocultural and the multicultural regimes depends on the redundancy of
pairwise connections across layers. Surprisingly, for low values of structural
redundancy the system is always in a multicultural state, independently on the
number of traits, and is robust to the presence of cultural drift. Moreover, we
show that layered social influence allows the coexistence of different levels
of consensus on different topics. The insight obtained from simulations on
synthetic graphs are confirmed by the analysis of two real-world social
networks, where the multicultural regime persists even for a very small number
of cultural traits, suggesting that the layered organisation of social
interactions might indeed be at the heart of multicultural societies.

 <dc:description>  Surprise describes a range of phenomena from unexpected events to behavioral
responses. We propose a measure of surprise and use it for surprise-driven
learning. Our surprise measure takes into account data likelihood as well as
the degree of commitment to a belief via the entropy of the belief
distribution. We find that surprise-minimizing learning dynamically adjusts the
balance between new and old information without the need of knowledge about the
temporal statistics of the environment. We apply our framework to a dynamic
decision-making task and a maze exploration task. Our surprise minimizing
framework is suitable for learning in complex environments, even if the
environment undergoes gradual or sudden changes and could eventually provide a
framework to study the behavior of humans and animals encountering surprising
events.

 <dc:description>  Identifying factors that affect human decision making and quantifying their
influence remain essential and challenging tasks for the design and
implementation of social and technological communication systems. We report
results of a behavioral experiment involving decision making in the face of an
impending natural disaster. In a controlled laboratory setting, we characterize
individual and group evacuation decision making influenced by several key
factors, including the likelihood of the disaster, available shelter capacity,
group size, and group decision protocol. Our results show that success in
individual decision making is not a strong predictor of group performance. We
use an artificial neural network trained on the collective behavior of subjects
to predict individual and group outcomes. Overall model accuracy increases with
the inclusion of a subject-specific performance parameter based on laboratory
trials that captures individual differences. In parallel, we demonstrate that
the social media activity of individual subjects, specifically their Facebook
use, can be used to generate an alternative individual personality profile that
leads to comparable model accuracy. Quantitative characterization and
prediction of collective decision making is crucial for the development of
effective policies to guide the action of populations in the face of threat or
uncertainty.

 <dc:description>  Raftery, Karny, and Ettler (2010) introduce an estimation technique, which
they refer to as Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA). In their application, DMA is
used to predict the output strip thickness for a cold rolling mill, where the
output is measured with a time delay. Recently, DMA has also shown to be useful
in macroeconomic and financial applications. In this paper, we present the eDMA
package for DMA estimation implemented in R. The eDMA package is especially
suited for practitioners in economics and finance, where typically a large
number of predictors are available. Our implementation is up to 133 times
faster then a standard implementation using a single-core CPU. Thus, with the
help of this package, practitioners are able to perform DMA on a standard PC
without resorting to large clusters, which are not easily available to all
researchers. We demonstrate the usefulness of this package through simulation
experiments and an empirical application using quarterly U.S. inflation data.

of words}, Adv. in Appl. Math. 50 (2013), 737-748], it was conjectured that any
infinite word whose palindromic lengths of factors are bounded is ultimately
periodic. We introduce variants of this conjecture and prove this conjecture in
particular cases. Especially we introduce left and right greedy palindromic
lengths. These lengths are always greater than or equals to the initial
palindromic length. When the greedy left (or right) palindromic lengths of
prefixes of a word are bounded then this word is ultimately periodic.

 <dc:title>Design and Implementation of a Novel Compatible Encoding Scheme in the

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a modulation scheme in the time domain based on
On-Off-Keying and proposes various compatible supports for different types of
image sensors. The content of this article is a sub-proposal to the IEEE
802.15.7r1 Task Group (TG7r1) aimed at Optical Wireless Communication (OWC)
using an image sensor as the receiver. The compatibility support is
indispensable for Image Sensor Communications (ISC) because the rolling shutter
image sensors currently available have different frame rates, shutter speeds,
sampling rates, and resolutions. However, focusing on unidirectional
communications (i.e., data broadcasting, beacons), an asynchronous
communication prototype is also discussed in the paper. Due to the physical
limitations associated with typical image sensors (including low and varying
frame rates, long exposures, and low shutter speeds), the link speed
performance is critically considered. Based on the practical measurement of
camera response to modulated light, an operating frequency range is suggested
along with the similar system architecture, decoding procedure, and algorithms.
A significant feature of our novel data frame structure is that it can support
both typical frame rate cameras (in the oversampling mode) as well as very low
frame rate cameras (in the error detection mode for a camera whose frame rate
is lower than the transmission packet rate). A high frame rate camera, i.e., no
less than 20 fps, is supported in an oversampling mode in which a majority
voting scheme for decoding data is applied. A low frame rate camera, i.e., when
the frame rate drops to less than 20 fps at some certain time, is supported by
an error detection mode in which any missing data sub-packet is detected in
decoding and later corrected by external code. Numerical results and valuable
analysis are also included to indicate the capability of the proposed schemes.

 <dc:description>  This article investigates the mobility management of an ultra dense cellular
network (UDN) from an energy-efficiency (EE) point of view. Many dormant base
stations (BSs) in a UDN do not transmit signals, and thus a received power
based handover (HO) approach as in traditional cellular networks is hardly
applicable. In addition, the limited front/backhaul capacity compared to a huge
number of BSs makes it difficult to implement a centralized HO and power
control. For these reasons, a novel user-centric association rule is proposed,
which jointly optimizes HO and power control for maximizing EE. The proposed
mobility management is able to cope not only with the spatial randomness of
user movement but also with temporally correlated wireless channels. The
proposed approach is implemented over a HO time window and tractable power
control policy by exploiting mean-field game (MFG) and stochastic geometry
(SG). Compared to a baseline with a fixed HO interval and transmit power, the
proposed approach achieves the 1.2 times higher long-term average EE at a
typical active BS.

 <dc:description>  Worldwide, in 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were
overweight. Of these, over 600 million were obese. Accurately documenting
dietary caloric intake is crucial to manage weight loss, but also presents
challenges because most of the current methods for dietary assessment must rely
on memory to recall foods eaten. The ultimate goal of our research is to
develop computer-aided technical solutions to enhance and improve the accuracy
of current measurements of dietary intake. Our proposed system in this paper
aims to improve the accuracy of dietary assessment by analyzing the food images
captured by mobile devices (e.g., smartphone). The key technique innovation in
this paper is the deep learning-based food image recognition algorithms.
Substantial research has demonstrated that digital imaging accurately estimates
dietary intake in many environments and it has many advantages over other
methods. However, how to derive the food information (e.g., food type and
portion size) from food image effectively and efficiently remains a challenging
and open research problem. We propose a new Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN)-based food image recognition algorithm to address this problem. We
applied our proposed approach to two real-world food image data sets (UEC-256
and Food-101) and achieved impressive results. To the best of our knowledge,
these results outperformed all other reported work using these two data sets.
Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach is a promising
solution for addressing the food image recognition problem. Our future work
includes further improving the performance of the algorithms and integrating
our system into a real-world mobile and cloud computing-based system to enhance
the accuracy of current measurements of dietary intake.

 <dc:title>Two Discourse Driven Language Models for Semantics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Peng, Haoruo</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Roth, Dan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Natural language understanding often requires deep semantic knowledge.
Expanding on previous proposals, we suggest that some important aspects of
semantic knowledge can be modeled as a language model if done at an appropriate
level of abstraction. We develop two distinct models that capture semantic
frame chains and discourse information while abstracting over the specific
mentions of predicates and entities. For each model, we investigate four
implementations: a &quot;standard&quot; N-gram language model and three discriminatively
trained &quot;neural&quot; language models that generate embeddings for semantic frames.
The quality of the semantic language models (SemLM) is evaluated both
intrinsically, using perplexity and a narrative cloze test and extrinsically -
we show that our SemLM helps improve performance on semantic natural language
processing tasks such as co-reference resolution and discourse parsing.

 <dc:description>  The field of Machine Learning and the topic of clustering within it is still
widely researched. Recently, researchers became interested in a new variant of
hierarchical clustering, where hierarchical (partial order) relationships exist
not only between clusters but also objects. In this variant of clustering,
objects can be assigned not only to leave, but other properties are also
defined. Although examples of this approach already exist in literature, the
authors have encountered a problem with the analysis and comparison of obtained
results. The problem is twofold. Firstly, there is a lack of evaluation
methods. Secondly, there is a lack of available benchmark data, at least the
authors failed to find them. The aim of this work is to fill the second gap.
The main contribution of this paper is a new method of generating hierarchical
structures of data. Additionally, the paper includes a theoretical analysis of
the generation parameters and their influence on the results. Comprehensive
experiments are presented and discussed. The dataset generator and visualiser
tools developed are publicly available for use

 <dc:description>  It is commonly believed that increasing the interpretability of a machine
learning model may decrease its predictive power. However, inspecting
input-output relationships of those models using visual analytics, while
treating them as black-box, can help to understand the reasoning behind
outcomes without sacrificing predictive quality. We identify a space of
possible solutions and provide two examples of where such techniques have been
successfully used in practice.

 <dc:description>  Sliding window convolutional networks (ConvNets) have become a popular
approach to computer vision problems such as image segmentation, and object
detection and localization. Here we consider the problem of inference, the
application of a previously trained ConvNet, with emphasis on 3D images. Our
goal is to maximize throughput, defined as average number of output voxels
computed per unit time. Other things being equal, processing a larger image
tends to increase throughput, because fractionally less computation is wasted
on the borders of the image. It follows that an apparently slower algorithm may
end up having higher throughput if it can process a larger image within the
constraint of the available RAM. We introduce novel CPU and GPU primitives for
convolutional and pooling layers, which are designed to minimize memory
overhead. The primitives include convolution based on highly efficient pruned
FFTs. Our theoretical analyses and empirical tests reveal a number of
interesting findings. For some ConvNet architectures, cuDNN is outperformed by
our FFT-based GPU primitives, and these in turn can be outperformed by our CPU
primitives. The CPU manages to achieve higher throughput because of its fast
access to more RAM. A novel primitive in which the GPU accesses host RAM can
significantly increase GPU throughput. Finally, a CPU-GPU algorithm achieves
the greatest throughput of all, 10x or more than other publicly available
implementations of sliding window 3D ConvNets. All of our code has been made
available as open source project.

 <dc:description>  Bidimensionality theory was introduced by Demaine et al. in 2005 as a tool to
obtain subexponential time parameterized algorithms on H-minor-free graphs.
Demaine and Hajiaghayi extended the theory to obtain polynomial time
approximation schemes (PTASs) for bidimen- sional problems. In this work, we
establish a third meta-algorithmic direction for bidimensionality theory by
relating it to the existence of linear kernels for parameterized problems. In
particular, we prove that every minor (respectively contraction) bidimensional
problem that satisfies a separation property and is expressible in Countable
Monadic Second Order Logic (CMSO), admits a linear kernel for classes of graphs
that exclude a fixed graph (respectively an apex graph) H as a minor. Our
results imply that a multitude of bidimensional problems admit linear kernels
on the corresponding graph classes. For most of these problems no polynomial
kernels on H-minor-free graphs were known prior to our work.

 <dc:description>  The e-book market is currently in a strong upswing. This research study deals
with the question which practical uses the e-book format EPUB3 offers for
(higher) education. By means of a didactic content analysis, a range of
interactive exercise types were developed as a result of conversations with
teachers. For this purpose, a didactic and technical concept has been
developed. Different kinds of exercises were prototypically implemented in an
e-book. Finally, a brief overview reflects the present state of the current
e-book readers. A subsequent discussion illuminates the strengths and
weaknesses of the format. In summary, it can be remarked that EPUB3 is suitable
for a variety of different exercises and that it is able to serve as a basic
format for forthcoming digital textbooks. Furthermore the openness of EPUB3
will assist Open Learning and Teaching in a meaningful way.

 <dc:description>  We propose a model of discrete time dynamic congestion games with atomic
players and a single source-destination pair. The latencies of edges are
composed by free-flow transit times and possible queuing time due to capacity
constraints. We give a precise description of the dynamics induced by the
individual strategies of players and of the corresponding costs, either when
the traffic is controlled by a planner, or when players act selfishly. In
parallel networks, optimal and equilibrium behavior eventually coincides, but
the selfish behavior of the first players has consequences that cannot be
undone and are paid by all future generations. In more general topologies, our
main contributions are three-fold.
  First, we show that equilibria are usually not unique. In particular, we
prove that there exists a sequence of networks such that the price of anarchy
is equal to $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and the price of
stability is equal to 1.
  Second, we illustrate a new dynamic version of Braess's paradox: the presence
of initial queues in a network may decrease the long-run costs in equilibrium.
This paradox may arise even in networks for which no Braess's paradox was
previously known.
  Third, we propose an extension to model seasonalities by assuming that
departure flows fluctuate periodically over time. We introduce a measure that
captures the queues induced by periodicity of inflows. This measure is the
increase in costs compared to uniform departures for optimal and equilibrium
flows in parallel networks.

 <dc:description>  The stochastic linear bandit problem proceeds in rounds where at each round
the algorithm selects a vector from a decision set after which it receives a
noisy linear loss parameterized by an unknown vector. The goal in such a
problem is to minimize the (pseudo) regret which is the difference between the
total expected loss of the algorithm and the total expected loss of the best
fixed vector in hindsight. In this paper, we consider settings where the
unknown parameter has structure, e.g., sparse, group sparse, low-rank, which
can be captured by a norm, e.g., $L_1$, $L_{(1,2)}$, nuclear norm. We focus on
constructing confidence ellipsoids which contain the unknown parameter across
all rounds with high-probability. We show the radius of such ellipsoids depend
on the Gaussian width of sets associated with the norm capturing the structure.
Such characterization leads to tighter confidence ellipsoids and, therefore,
sharper regret bounds compared to bounds in the existing literature which are
based on the ambient dimensionality.

using deep learning to create word-level and character-level models. The choice
between word-level and character-level models in each particular case was
informed through validation performance. Our final system is a combination of
classifiers using word-level or character-level models. We also employed novel

 <dc:description>  Tensor contractions constitute a key computational ingredient of numerical
multi-linear algebra. However, as the order and dimension of tensors grow, the
time and space complexities of tensor-based computations grow quickly. Existing
approaches for tensor contractions typically involves explicit copy and
transpose operations. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new BLAS-like
primitive STRIDEDBATCHEDGEMM that is capable of performing a wide range of
tensor contractions on CPU and GPU efficiently. Through systematic
benchmarking, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach over conventional
approaches. Concretely, we implement the Tucker decomposition and show that
using our kernels yields 100x speedup as compared to the implementation using

 <dc:description>  Existing timeline generation systems for complex events consider only
information from traditional media, ignoring the rich social context provided
by user-generated content that reveals representative public interests or
insightful opinions. We instead aim to generate socially-informed timelines
that contain both news article summaries and selected user comments. We present
an optimization framework designed to balance topical cohesion between the
article and comment summaries along with their informativeness and coverage of
the event. Automatic evaluations on real-world datasets that cover four complex
events show that our system produces more informative timelines than
state-of-the-art systems. In human evaluation, the associated comment summaries
are furthermore rated more insightful than editor's picks and comments ranked
highly by users.

 <dc:description>  We present a submodular function-based framework for query-focused opinion
summarization. Within our framework, relevance ordering produced by a
statistical ranker, and information coverage with respect to topic distribution
and diverse viewpoints are both encoded as submodular functions. Dispersion
functions are utilized to minimize the redundancy. We are the first to evaluate
different metrics of text similarity for submodularity-based summarization
methods. By experimenting on community QA and blog summarization, we show that
our system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both automatic evaluation
and human evaluation. A human evaluation task is conducted on Amazon Mechanical
Turk with scale, and shows that our systems are able to generate summaries of
high overall quality and information diversity.

 <dc:description>  Most satellites decouple the acquisition of a panchromatic image at high
spatial resolution from the acquisition of a multispectral image at lower
spatial resolution. Pansharpening is a fusion technique used to increase the
spatial resolution of the multispectral data while simultaneously preserving
its spectral information. In this paper, we consider pansharpening as an
optimization problem minimizing a cost function with a nonlocal regularization
term. The energy functional which is to be minimized decouples for each band,
thus permitting the application to misregistered spectral components. This
requirement is achieved by dropping the, commonly used, assumption that relates
the spectral and panchromatic modalities by a linear transformation. Instead, a
new constraint that preserves the radiometric ratio between the panchromatic
and each spectral component is introduced. An exhaustive performance comparison
of the proposed fusion method with several classical and state-of-the-art
pansharpening techniques illustrates its superiority in preserving spatial
details, reducing color distortions, and avoiding the creation of aliasing
artifacts.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the novel task of online dispute detection and propose a
sentiment analysis solution to the problem: we aim to identify the sequence of
sentence-level sentiments expressed during a discussion and to use them as
features in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON-DISPUTE label for the
discussion as a whole. We evaluate dispute detection approaches on a newly
created corpus of Wikipedia Talk page disputes and find that classifiers that
rely on our sentiment tagging features outperform those that do not. The best
model achieves a very promising F1 score of 0.78 and an accuracy of 0.80.

 <dc:description>  The large number of user-generated videos uploaded on to the Internet
everyday has led to many commercial video search engines, which mainly rely on
text metadata for search. However, metadata is often lacking for user-generated
videos, thus these videos are unsearchable by current search engines.
Therefore, content-based video retrieval (CBVR) tackles this metadata-scarcity
problem by directly analyzing the visual and audio streams of each video. CBVR
encompasses multiple research topics, including low-level feature design,
feature fusion, semantic detector training and video search/reranking. We
present novel strategies in these topics to enhance CBVR in both accuracy and
speed under different query inputs, including pure textual queries and query by
video examples. Our proposed strategies have been incorporated into our
submission for the TRECVID 2014 Multimedia Event Detection evaluation, where
our system outperformed other submissions in both text queries and video
example queries, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed
approaches.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of agreement and disagreement detection in online
discussions. An isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) based
sequential model is proposed to make predictions on sentence- or segment-level.
We automatically construct a socially-tuned lexicon that is bootstrapped from
existing general-purpose sentiment lexicons to further improve the performance.
We evaluate our agreement and disagreement tagging model on two disparate
online discussion corpora -- Wikipedia Talk pages and online debates. Our model
is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in both datasets. For
example, the isotonic CRF model achieves F1 scores of 0.74 and 0.67 for
agreement and disagreement detection, when a linear chain CRF obtains 0.58 and
0.56 for the discussions on Wikipedia Talk pages.

 <dc:description>  Visual analytics systems such as Tableau are increasingly popular for
interactive data exploration. These tools, however, do not currently assist
users with detecting or resolving potential data quality problems including the
well-known deduplication problem. Recent approaches for deduplication focus on
cleaning entire datasets and commonly require hundreds to thousands of user
labels. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in the context
of visual data analytics. We present a new approach for record deduplication
that strives to produce the cleanest view possible with a limited budget for
data labeling. The key idea behind our approach is to consider the impact that
individual tuples have on a visualization and to monitor how the view changes
during cleaning. With experiments on nine different visualizations for two
real-world datasets, we show that our approach produces significantly cleaner
views for small labeling budgets than state-of-the-art alternatives and that it
also stops the cleaning process after requesting fewer labels.

 <dc:description>  The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) held a grand
challenge to evaluate computational systems for the automated detection of
metastatic breast cancer in whole slide images of sentinel lymph node biopsies.
Our team won both competitions in the grand challenge, obtaining an area under
the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.925 for the task of whole slide image
classification and a score of 0.7051 for the tumor localization task. A
pathologist independently reviewed the same images, obtaining a whole slide
image classification AUC of 0.966 and a tumor localization score of 0.733.
Combining our deep learning system's predictions with the human pathologist's
diagnoses increased the pathologist's AUC to 0.995, representing an
approximately 85 percent reduction in human error rate. These results
demonstrate the power of using deep learning to produce significant
improvements in the accuracy of pathological diagnoses.

 <dc:title>Capacity of Continuous-Space Electromagnetic Channels with Lossy

 <dc:creator>Jeon, Wonseok</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the capacity of continuous-space electromagnetic channels,
where transceivers are confined in given lossy regions, is analyzed. First of
all, the regions confining the transceivers are assumed to be filled with
dielectric, which is either lossy or lossless. Then, for capacity analysis, we
use the exact power consumption that takes into account the electromagnetic
interaction between the field and the source. In addition, the exact noise
model followed from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in thermodynamics is
used at the receive side. The contribution of our work is summarized as
follows. First, we characterize the channel capacity as a function of the size
and the physical property of the regions confining the transceivers and
analytically show how the radiation efficiency affects the capacity. We also
show that the outgoing channel at the transmit side and the incoming channel at
the receive side are information-theoretically equivalent, and thus, the
capacities of both channels are the same. Additionally, the quality factor,
which is inversely proportional to the bandwidth, is theoretically derived, and
the relationship between the spatial degrees of freedom of the channel and the
quality factor is analyzed. Besides, we consider how the power consumption is
affected by the backscattered waves and compare the recent experimental
demonstration with our work by solving the gain-optimization problem with the
constraint on the quality factor.

decomposing the sequence to be indexed into an order component, containing

an exact matching problem on the order component followed by a verification
phase on the delta component. Experiments show that this approach is viable and
it is the first one offering simultaneously small space usage and fast

 <dc:description>  Multi-label classification has received considerable interest in recent
years. Multi-label classifiers have to address many problems including:
handling large-scale datasets with many instances and a large set of labels,
compensating missing label assignments in the training set, considering
correlations between labels, as well as exploiting unlabeled data to improve
prediction performance. To tackle datasets with a large set of labels,
embedding-based methods have been proposed which seek to represent the label
assignments in a low-dimensional space. Many state-of-the-art embedding-based
methods use a linear dimensionality reduction to represent the label
assignments in a low-dimensional space. However, by doing so, these methods
actually neglect the tail labels - labels that are infrequently assigned to
instances. We propose an embedding-based method that non-linearly embeds the
label vectors using an stochastic approach, thereby predicting the tail labels
more accurately. Moreover, the proposed method have excellent mechanisms for
handling missing labels, dealing with large-scale datasets, as well as
exploiting unlabeled data. With the best of our knowledge, our proposed method
is the first multi-label classifier that simultaneously addresses all of the
mentioned challenges. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method
outperforms stateof-the-art multi-label classifiers by a large margin, in terms
of prediction performance, as well as training time.

 <dc:description>  Motion behaviors of a rigid body can be characterized by a 6-dimensional
motion trajectory, which contains position vectors of a reference point on the
rigid body and rotations of this rigid body over time. This paper devises a
Rotation and Relative Velocity (RRV) descriptor by exploring the local
translational and rotational invariants of motion trajectories of rigid bodies,
which is insensitive to noise, invariant to rigid transformation and scaling. A
flexible metric is also introduced to measure the distance between two RRV
descriptors. The RRV descriptor is then applied to characterize motions of a
human body skeleton modeled as articulated interconnections of multiple rigid
bodies. To illustrate the descriptive ability of the RRV descriptor, we explore
it for different rigid body motion recognition tasks. The experimental results
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this simple RRV descriptor outperforms
the previous ones regarding recognition accuracy without increasing
computational cost.

 <dc:description>  Information cascades exist in a wide variety of platforms on Internet. A very
important real-world problem is to identify which information cascades can go
viral. A system addressing this problem can be used in a variety of
applications including public health, marketing and counter-terrorism. As a
cascade can be considered as compound of the social network and the time
series. However, in related literature where methods for solving the cascade
prediction problem were proposed, the experimental settings were often limited
to only a single metric for a specific problem formulation. Moreover, little
attention was paid to the run time of those methods. In this paper, we first
formulate the cascade prediction problem as both classification and regression.
Then we compare three categories of cascade prediction methods: centrality
based, feature based and point process based. We carry out the comparison
through evaluation of the methods by both accuracy metrics and run time. The
results show that feature based methods can outperform others in terms of
prediction accuracy but suffer from heavy overhead especially for large
datasets. While point process based methods can also run into issue of long run
time when the model can not well adapt to the data. This paper seeks to address
issues in order to allow developers of systems for social network analysis to
select the most appropriate method for predicting viral information cascades.

 <dc:title>How to Fake Multiply by a Gaussian Matrix</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Have you ever wanted to multiply an $n \times d$ matrix $X$, with $n \gg d$,
on the left by an $m \times n$ matrix $\tilde G$ of i.i.d. Gaussian random
variables, but could not afford to do it because it was too slow? In this work
we propose a new randomized $m \times n$ matrix $T$, for which one can compute
$T \cdot X$ in only $O(\text{nnz}(X)) + \tilde O(m^{1.5} \cdot d^{3})$ time,
for which the total variation distance between the distributions $T \cdot X$
and $\tilde G \cdot X$ is as small as desired, i.e., less than any positive
constant. Here $\text{nnz}(X)$ denotes the number of non-zero entries of $X$.
Assuming $\text{nnz}(X) \gg m^{1.5} \cdot d^{3}$, this is a significant savings
over the na\&quot;ive $O(\text{nnz}(X) m)$ time to compute $\tilde G \cdot X$.
Moreover, since the total variation distance is small, we can provably use $T
\cdot X$ in place of $\tilde G \cdot X$ in any application and have the same
guarantees as if we were using $\tilde G \cdot X$, up to a small positive
constant in error probability. We apply this transform to nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) and support vector machines (SVM).

 <dc:description>  Students opting for Engineering as their discipline is increasing rapidly.
But due to various factors and inappropriate primary education in India,
failure rates are high. Students are unable to excel in core engineering
because of complex and mathematical subjects. Hence, they fail in such
subjects. With the help of data mining techniques, we can predict the
performance of students in terms of grades and failure in subjects. This paper
performs a comparative analysis of various classification techniques, such as
Na\&quot;ive Bayes, LibSVM, J48, Random Forest, and JRip and tries to choose best
among these. Based on the results obtained, we found that Na\&quot;ive Bayes is the
most accurate method in terms of students failure prediction and JRip is most
accurate in terms of students grade prediction. We also found that JRip
marginally differs from Na\&quot;ive Bayes in terms of accuracy for students failure
prediction and gives us a set of rules from which we derive the key factors
influencing students performance. Finally, we suggest various ways to mitigate
these factors. This study is limited to Indian Education system scenarios.
However, the factors found can be helpful in other scenarios as well.

 <dc:title>Connecting web-based mapping services with scientific data repositories:
  collaborative curation and retrieval of simulation data via a geospatial
  interface</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jacobs, Christian T.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Increasing quantities of scientific data are becoming readily accessible via
online repositories such as those provided by Figshare and Zenodo.
Geoscientific simulations in particular generate large quantities of data, with
several research groups studying many, often overlapping areas of the world.
When studying a particular area, being able to keep track of one's own
simulations as well as those of collaborators can be challenging. This paper
describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new tool for visually
cataloguing and retrieving data associated with a given geographical location
through a web-based Google Maps interface. Each data repository is pin-pointed
on the map with a marker based on the geographical location that the dataset
corresponds to. By clicking on the markers, users can quickly inspect the
metadata of the repositories and download the associated data files. The crux
of the approach lies in the ability to easily query and retrieve data from
multiple sources via a common interface. While many advances are being made in
terms of scientific data repositories, the development of this new tool has
uncovered several issues and limitations of the current state-of-the-art which
are discussed herein, along with some ideas for the future.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an application-aware multipath packet forwarding
framework that integrates Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) and Software
Defined Networks (SDN). As the Internet provides a variety of services and
their performance requirement has become heterogeneous, it is common to come
across the scenario of multiple flows competing for a constrained resource such
as bandwidth, less jitter or low latency path. Such factors are application
specific requirement that is beyond the knowledge of a simple combination of
protocol type and port number. Better overall performance could be achieved if
the network is able to prioritize the flows and assign resources based on their
application specific requirement. Our system prioritizes each of the flows
using MLT and routes it through a path according to the flow priority and
network state using SDN. The proof of concept implementation has been done on
OpenvSwitch and evaluation results involving a large number of flows exhibited
a significant improvement over the traditional network setup. We also report
that the port number and protocol are not contributing to determine the
application in the decision-making process of Machine Learning (ML).

 <dc:title>Modelling Requirements for Content Recommendation Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the modelling of requirements for a content
Recommendation System (RS) for Online Social Networks (OSNs). On OSNs, a user
switches roles constantly between content generator and content receiver. The
goals and softgoals are different when the user is generating a post, as
opposed as replying to a post. In other words, the user is generating instances
of different entities, depending on the role she has: a generator generates
instances of a &quot;post&quot;, while the receiver generates instances of a &quot;reply&quot;.
Therefore, we believe that when addressing Requirements Engineering (RE) for
RS, it is necessary to distinguish these roles clearly.
  We aim to model an essential dynamic on OSN, namely that when a user creates
(posts) content, other users can ignore that content, or themselves start
generating new content in reply, or react to the initial posting. This dynamic
is key to designing OSNs, because it influences how active users are, and how
attractive the OSN is for existing, and to new users. We apply a well-known
Goal Oriented RE (GORE) technique, namely i-star, and show that this language
fails to capture this dynamic, and thus cannot be used alone to model the
problem domain. Hence, in order to represent this dynamic, its relationships to
other OSNs' requirements, and to capture all relevant information, we suggest
using another modelling language, namely Petri Nets, on top of i-star for the
modelling of the problem domain. We use Petri Nets because it is a tool that is
used to simulate the dynamic and concurrent activities of a system and can be
used by both practitioners and theoreticians.

 <dc:description>  A constant need to increase the network capacity for meeting the growing
demands of the subscribers has led to the evolution of cellular communication
networks from the first generation (1G) to the fifth generation (5G). There
will be billions of connected devices in the near future. Such a large number
of connections are expected to be heterogeneous in nature, demanding higher
data rates, lesser delays, enhanced system capacity and superior throughput.
The available spectrum resources are limited and need to be flexibly used by
the mobile network operators (MNOs) to cope with the rising demands. An
emerging facilitator of the upcoming high data rate demanding next generation
networks (NGNs) is device-to-device (D2D) communication. An extensive survey on
device-to-device (D2D) communication has been presented in this paper,
including the plus points it offers, the key open issues associated with it
like peer discovery, resource allocation etc, demanding special attention of
the research community, some of its integrant technologies like millimeter wave
D2D (mmWave), ultra dense networks (UDNs), cognitive D2D, handover procedure in
D2D and its numerous use cases. Architecture is suggested aiming to fulfill all
the subscriber demands in an optimal manner. The Appendix mentions some ongoing
standardization activities and research projects of D2D communication.

 <dc:description>  Predicting the fast-rising young researchers (Academic Rising Stars) in the
future provides useful guidance to the research community, e.g., offering
competitive candidates to university for young faculty hiring as they are
expected to have success academic careers. In this work, given a set of young
researchers who have published the first first-author paper recently, we solve
the problem of how to effectively predict the top k% researchers who achieve
the highest citation increment in \Delta t years. We explore a series of
factors that can drive an author to be fast-rising and design a novel impact
increment ranking learning (IIRL) algorithm that leverages those factors to
predict the academic rising stars. Experimental results on the large ArnetMiner
dataset with over 1.7 million authors demonstrate the effectiveness of IIRL.
Specifically, it outperforms all given benchmark methods, with over 8% average
improvement. Further analysis demonstrates that the prediction models for
different research topics follow the similar pattern. We also find that
temporal features are the best indicators for rising stars prediction, while
venue features are less relevant.

translation (SMT) system that the QCRI-Columbia-NYUAD (QCN) group submitted to
the NIST OpenMT'2015 competition. The competition focused on informal dialectal

processing and standardizing Arabic, e.g., using tools such as 3arrib and
MADAMIRA. We further trained a phrase-based SMT system using state-of-the-art
features and components such as operation sequence model, class-based language
model, sparse features, neural network joint model, genre-based
hierarchically-interpolated language model, unsupervised transliteration
mining, phrase-table merging, and hypothesis combination. Our system ranked
second on all three genres.

 <dc:description>  Recent deep learning based methods have achieved the state-of-the-art
performance for handwritten Chinese character recognition (HCCR) by learning
discriminative representations directly from raw data. Nevertheless, we believe
that the long-and-well investigated domain-specific knowledge should still help
to boost the performance of HCCR. By integrating the traditional
normalization-cooperated direction-decomposed feature map (directMap) with the
deep convolutional neural network (convNet), we are able to obtain new highest
accuracies for both online and offline HCCR on the ICDAR-2013 competition
database. With this new framework, we can eliminate the needs for data
augmentation and model ensemble, which are widely used in other systems to
achieve their best results. This makes our framework to be efficient and
effective for both training and testing. Furthermore, although
directMap+convNet can achieve the best results and surpass human-level
performance, we show that writer adaptation in this case is still effective. A
new adaptation layer is proposed to reduce the mismatch between training and
test data on a particular source layer. The adaptation process can be
efficiently and effectively implemented in an unsupervised manner. By adding
the adaptation layer into the pre-trained convNet, it can adapt to the new
handwriting styles of particular writers, and the recognition accuracy can be
further improved consistently and significantly. This paper gives an overview
and comparison of recent deep learning based approaches for HCCR, and also sets
new benchmarks for both online and offline HCCR.

 <dc:description>  Obtaining a survival strategy (policy) is one of the fundamental problems of
biological agents. In this paper, we generalize the formulation of previous
research related to the survival of an agent and we formulate the survival
problem as a maximization of the multi-step survival probability in future time
steps. We introduce a method for converting the maximization of multi-step
survival probability into a classical reinforcement learning problem. Using
this conversion, the reward function (negative temporal cost function) is
expressed as the log of the temporal survival probability. And we show that the
objective function of the reinforcement learning in this sense is proportional
to the variational lower bound of the original problem. Finally, We empirically
demonstrate that the agent learns survival behavior by using the reward
function introduced in this paper.

 <dc:description>  The femtocaching idea was proposed as a solution to compensate for the weak
backhaul capacity, by deploying coverage-limited nodes with high storage
capacity called femtocaches (FCs). In this paper, the macrocell offloading
problem in femtocaching-assisted cellular networks is investigated. The
objective is to minimize the number of transmissions by the macrocell base
station (MBS) given that all requests should be served simultaneously to
satisfy quality-of-experience (QoE) of the clients. We first formulate this MBS
offloading problem as an optimization problem over a network coding graph, and
show that it is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose an ONC-broadcast offloading
scheme that exploits both broadcasting and opportunistic network coding (ONC)
to minimize the number of required MBS transmissions. We utilize a random graph
model to approximate the performance of the proposed ONC-broadcast scheme in
terms of the resultant average number of transmissions by the MBS. Moreover,
despite the complexity of finding the optimal solution for each and every case,
we prove that this ONC-broadcast scheme is asymptotically optimal, i.e., for
large number of requests, the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a similar macrocell
offloading performance to that of the optimal solution. To implement the
ONC-broadcast scheme, we devise a heuristic that employs a dual conflict graph
or broadcasting at the FCs such that the remaining requests can be served using
the minimum number of transmissions at the MBS. Simulations show that the dual
graph scheme improves MBS offloading as compared to the traditional separate
graph scheme. Furthermore, the simple heuristic proposed to implement the
ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a very close performance to the optimal
ONC-broadcast scheme.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of decentralized (distributed) adaptive
learning, where the aim of the network is to train the coefficients of a widely
linear autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model by measurements collected by
the nodes. Such a problem arises in many sensor network-based applications such
as target tracking, fast rerouting, data reduction and data aggregation. We
assume that each node of the network uses the augmented complex adaptive
infinite impulse response (ACAIIR) filter as the learning rule, and nodes
interact with each other under an incremental mode of cooperation. Since the
proposed algorithm (incremental augmented complex IIR (IACA-IIR) algorithm)
relies on the augmented complex statistics, it can be used to model both types
of complex-valued signals (proper and improper signals). To evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm, we use both synthetic and real-world
complex signals in our simulations. The results exhibit superior performance of
the proposed algorithm over the non-cooperative ACAIIR algorithm.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the widely used smart meters in the energy sector, anomaly detection
becomes a crucial mean to study the unusual consumption behaviors of customers,
and to discover unexpected events of using energy promptly. Detecting
consumption anomalies is, essentially, a real-time big data analytics problem,
which does data mining on a large amount of parallel data streams from smart
meters. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning and statistical-based
anomaly detection method, and implement a Lambda system using the in-memory
distributed computing framework, Spark and its extension Spark Streaming. The
system supports not only iterative detection model refreshment from scalable
data sets, but also real-time detection on scalable live data streams. This
paper empirically evaluates the system and the detection algorithm, and the
results show the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed lambda
detection system.

to be bounded by a constant less than one.

 <dc:description>  Generic 3D reconstruction from a single image is a difficult problem. A lot
of data loss occurs in the projection. A domain based approach to
reconstruction where we solve a smaller set of problems for a particular use
case lead to greater returns. The project provides a way to automatically
generate full 3-D renditions of actual symmetric images that have some prior
information provided in the pipeline by a recognition algorithm. We provide a
critical analysis on how this can be enhanced and improved to provide a general
reconstruction framework for automatic reconstruction for any symmetric shape.

 <dc:title>A Hybrid ICT-Solution for Smart Meter Data Analytics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Xiufeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nielsen, Per Sieverts</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Smart meters are increasingly used worldwide. Smart meters are the advanced
meters capable of measuring energy consumption at a fine-grained time interval,
e.g., every 15 minutes. Smart meter data are typically bundled with social
economic data in analytics, such as meter geographic locations, weather
conditions and user information, which makes the data sets very sizable and the
analytics complex. Data mining and emerging cloud computing technologies make
collecting, processing, and analyzing the so-called big data possible. This
paper proposes an innovative ICT-solution to streamline smart meter data
analytics. The proposed solution offers an information integration pipeline for
ingesting data from smart meters, a scalable platform for processing and mining
big data sets, and a web portal for visualizing analytics results. The
implemented system has a hybrid architecture of using Spark or Hive for big
data processing, and using the machine learning toolkit, MADlib, for doing
in-database data analytics in PostgreSQL database. This paper evaluates the key
technologies of the proposed ICT-solution, and the results show the
effectiveness and efficiency of using the system for both batch and online
analytics.

 <dc:description>  The GraphBLAS standard (GraphBlas.org) is being developed to bring the
potential of matrix based graph algorithms to the broadest possible audience.
Mathematically the Graph- BLAS defines a core set of matrix-based graph
operations that can be used to implement a wide class of graph algorithms in a
wide range of programming environments. This paper provides an introduction to
the mathematics of the GraphBLAS. Graphs represent connections between vertices
with edges. Matrices can represent a wide range of graphs using adjacency
matrices or incidence matrices. Adjacency matrices are often easier to analyze
while incidence matrices are often better for representing data. Fortunately,
the two are easily connected by matrix mul- tiplication. A key feature of
matrix mathematics is that a very small number of matrix operations can be used
to manipulate a very wide range of graphs. This composability of small number
of operations is the foundation of the GraphBLAS. A standard such as the
GraphBLAS can only be effective if it has low performance overhead. Performance
measurements of prototype GraphBLAS implementations indicate that the overhead
is low.

 <dc:description>  Virtual machines and virtualized hardware have been around for over half a
century. The commoditization of the x86 platform and its rapidly growing
hardware capabilities have led to recent exponential growth in the use of
virtualization both in the enterprise and high performance computing (HPC). The
startup time of a virtualized environment is a key performance metric for high
performance computing in which the runtime of any individual task is typically
much shorter than the lifetime of a virtualized service in an enterprise
context. In this paper, a methodology for accurately measuring the startup
performance on an HPC system is described. The startup performance overhead of
three of the most mature, widely deployed cloud management frameworks
(OpenStack, OpenNebula, and Eucalyptus) is measured to determine their
suitability for workloads typically seen in an HPC environment. A 10x
performance difference is observed between the fastest (Eucalyptus) and the
slowest (OpenNebula) framework. This time difference is primarily due to delays
in waiting on networking in the cloud-init portion of the startup. The
methodology and measurements presented should facilitate the optimization of
startup across a variety of virtualization environments.

 <dc:description>  The success of SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases is a reflection of their
ability to provide significant functionality and performance benefits for
specific domains, such as financial transactions, internet search, and data
analysis. The BigDAWG polystore seeks to provide a mechanism to allow
applications to transparently achieve the benefits of diverse databases while
insulating applications from the details of these databases. Associative arrays
provide a common approach to the mathematics found in different databases: sets
(SQL), graphs (NoSQL), and matrices (NewSQL). This work presents the SQL
relational model in terms of associative arrays and identifies the key
mathematical properties that are preserved within SQL. These properties include
associativity, commutativity, distributivity, identities, annihilators, and
inverses. Performance measurements on distributivity and associativity show the
impact these properties can have on associative array operations. These results
demonstrate that associative arrays could provide a mathematical model for
polystores to optimize the exchange of data and execution queries.

 <dc:description>  As a contribution to interpretable machine learning research, we develop a
novel optimization framework for learning accurate and sparse two-level Boolean
rules. We consider rules in both conjunctive normal form (AND-of-ORs) and
disjunctive normal form (OR-of-ANDs). A principled objective function is
proposed to trade classification accuracy and interpretability, where we use
Hamming loss to characterize accuracy and sparsity to characterize
interpretability. We propose efficient procedures to optimize these objectives
based on linear programming (LP) relaxation, block coordinate descent, and
alternating minimization. Experiments show that our new algorithms provide very
good tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability.

 <dc:title>Generalizing to Unseen Entities and Entity Pairs with Row-less Universal

 <dc:description>  Universal schema predicts the types of entities and relations in a knowledge
base (KB) by jointly embedding the union of all available schema types---not
only types from multiple structured databases (such as Freebase or Wikipedia
infoboxes), but also types expressed as textual patterns from raw text. This
prediction is typically modeled as a matrix completion problem, with one type
per column, and either one or two entities per row (in the case of entity types
or binary relation types, respectively). Factorizing this sparsely observed
matrix yields a learned vector embedding for each row and each column. In this
paper we explore the problem of making predictions for entities or entity-pairs
unseen at training time (and hence without a pre-learned row embedding). We
propose an approach having no per-row parameters at all; rather we produce a
row vector on the fly using a learned aggregation function of the vectors of
the observed columns for that row. We experiment with various aggregation
functions, including neural network attention models. Our approach can be
understood as a natural language database, in that questions about KB entities
are answered by attending to textual or database evidence. In experiments
predicting both relations and entity types, we demonstrate that despite having
an order of magnitude fewer parameters than traditional universal schema, we
can match the accuracy of the traditional model, and more importantly, we can
now make predictions about unseen rows with nearly the same accuracy as rows

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a two-stage approach to strengthen piecewise
McCormick relaxations for mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) with
multi-linear terms. In the first stage, we exploit Constraint Programing (CP)
techniques to contract the variable bounds. In the second stage we partition
the variables domains using a dynamic multivariate partitioning scheme. Instead
of equally partitioning the domains of variables appearing in multi-linear
terms, we construct sparser partitions yet tighter relax- ations by iteratively
partitioning the variable domains in regions of interest. This approach
decouples the number of partitions from the size of the variable domains, leads
to a significant reduction in computation time, and limits the number of binary
variables that are introduced by the partitioning. We demonstrate the
performance of our algorithm on well-known benchmark problems from MINLPLIB and
discuss the computational benefits of CP-based bound tightening procedures.

 <dc:description>  We study a three-node network with a full-duplex base-station communicating
with one uplink and one downlink half-duplex node. In this network, both
self-interference and inter-node interference are present. We use an
antenna-theory-based channel model to study the spatial degrees of freedom of
such network, and study if and how much does spatial isolation outperforms
time-division (i.e. half-duplex) counterpart. Using degrees of freedom
analysis, we show that spatial isolation outperforms time division, unless the
angular spread of the objects that scatters to the intended users is overlapped
by the spread of objects that back scatters to the receivers.

 <dc:description>  From scientific research to commercial applications, eye tracking is an
important tool across many domains. Despite its range of applications, eye
tracking has yet to become a pervasive technology. We believe that we can put
the power of eye tracking in everyone's palm by building eye tracking software
that works on commodity hardware such as mobile phones and tablets, without the
need for additional sensors or devices. We tackle this problem by introducing
GazeCapture, the first large-scale dataset for eye tracking, containing data
from over 1450 people consisting of almost 2.5M frames. Using GazeCapture, we
train iTracker, a convolutional neural network for eye tracking, which achieves
a significant reduction in error over previous approaches while running in real
time (10-15fps) on a modern mobile device. Our model achieves a prediction
error of 1.71cm and 2.53cm without calibration on mobile phones and tablets
respectively. With calibration, this is reduced to 1.34cm and 2.12cm. Further,
we demonstrate that the features learned by iTracker generalize well to other
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. The code, data, and models are
available at http://gazecapture.csail.mit.edu.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for building an interpretable recommender system for
personalizing online content and promotions. Historical data available for the
system consists of customer features, provided content (promotions), and user
responses. Unlike in a standard multi-class classification setting,
misclassification costs depend on both recommended actions and customers. Our
method transforms such a data set to a new set which can be used with standard
interpretable multi-class classification algorithms. The transformation has the
desirable property that minimizing the standard misclassification penalty in
this new space is equivalent to minimizing the custom cost function.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The workshop series intends to cover research that investigates the
computational aspects of classical logic and mathematics. Its focus is on
unwinding the computational content of logical principles and proof in
mathematics based on these principles, aiming to bring together researchers
from both fields and exchange ideas.
  Classical Logic and Computation (CL&amp;C) 2016 was the sixth edition of this
workshop series held as a satellite to FSCD 2016 on June 23, 2016 in Porto,
Portugal.
  In this sixth edition we received 11 submissions of both short and full
papers. Eight (8) of these were selected to present at the meeting in Porto,
and five (5) full papers were initially accepted to appear at this EPTCS
special volume of which one was subsequently withdrawn by its authors. An
invited talk was given by Marc Bezem (U. of Bergen): Coherent Logic - an
overview. Other topics covered by this years submissions included:
computational content of proofs using nonstandard analysis, a structured
grammar-based approach to the Herbrand content of proofs, semantics of the
lambda-mu calculus, normalization of classical natural deduction proofs, proof
mining of noneffective proofs in convex optimization and algebra by functional
interpretations. I like to thank the members of the program committee for their
excellent work: Steffen van Bakel (London), Stefano Berardi (Torino), Fernando
Ferreira (Lisboa), Hugo de'Liguoro (Torino), Alexandre Miquel (Montevideo).

 <dc:description>  We consider the point process of signal strengths emitted from transmitters
in a wireless network and observed at a fixed position. In our model,
transmitters are placed deterministically or randomly according to a hard core
or Poisson point process and signals are subjected to power law path loss and
random propagation effects that may be correlated between transmitters.
  We provide bounds on the distance between the point process of signal
strengths and a Poisson process with the same mean measure, assuming correlated
log-normal shadowing. For &quot;strong shadowing&quot; and moderate correlations, we find
that the signal strengths are close to a Poisson process, generalizing a
recently shown analogous result for independent shadowing.

 <dc:description>  Recent progress in neural learning demonstrated that machines can do well in
regularized tasks, e.g., the game of Go. However, artistic activities such as
poem generation are still widely regarded as human's special capability. In
this paper, we demonstrate that a simple neural model can imitate human in some
tasks of art generation. We particularly focus on traditional Chinese poetry,
and show that machines can do as well as many contemporary poets and weakly
pass the Feigenbaum Test, a variant of Turing test in professional domains. Our
method is based on an attention-based recurrent neural network, which accepts a
set of keywords as the theme and generates poems by looking at each keyword
during the generation. A number of techniques are proposed to improve the
model, including character vector initialization, attention to input and
hybrid-style training. Compared to existing poetry generation methods, our
model can generate much more theme-consistent and semantic-rich poems.

 <dc:description>  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)consists in the concurrent
construction of a model of the environment (the map), and the estimation of the
state of the robot moving within it. The SLAM community has made astonishing
progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications,
and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey
the current state of SLAM. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto
standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad
set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric
and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees,
active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously
serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By
looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open
challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific
investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that
often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need SLAM? and
Is SLAM solved?

 <dc:description>  Open data has been around for many years but with the advancement of
technology and its steady adoption by businesses and governments it promises to
create new opportunities for the advancement of society as a whole. Many
popular open data platforms have focused on solving the problems faced by the
data producer and offers limited support for the data consumers in the way of
tools and supported processes for easy access, modeling and mining of data
within the various platforms. In this paper we present the specifications for a
data consumer oriented platform for open data, the Data-TAP. We demonstrate how
this platform is able to (a) meet the goal of leveraging the data resources of
existing Open Data platforms, (b) provide a means to standardize and structure
data to allow for the merging of related data resources and (c) use a
rule-based method for parsing resources. This paper will show how Data-TAP
provides an easy to use and understand interface for making open data
friendlier for consumers.

 <dc:title>Convergence of Nonlinear Observers on R^n with a Riemannian Metric (Part

 <dc:description>  In [1], it is established that a convergent observer with an infinite gain
margin can be designed for a given nonlinear system when a Riemannian metric
showing that the system is differentially detectable (i.e., the Lie derivative
of the Riemannian metric along the system vector field is negative in the space
tangent to the output function level sets) and the level sets of the output
function are geodesically convex is available. In this paper, we propose
techniques for designing a Riemannian metric satisfying the first property in
the case where the system is strongly infinitesimally observable (i.e., each
time-varying linear system resulting from the linearization along a solution to
the system satisfies a uniform observability property) or where it is strongly
differentially observable (i.e. the mapping state to output derivatives is an
injective immersion) or where it is Lagrangian. Also, we give results that are
complementary to those in [1]. In particular, we provide a locally convergent
observer and make a link to the existence of a reduced order observer. Examples
illustrating the results are presented.

 <dc:description>  Boson sampling, a specific quantum computation problem, is widely regarded to
be one of the most achievable fields in which quantum machine will outperform
the most powerful classical computer in the near term, although up to now no
upper-bound of how fast the classical computers can compute matrix permanents,
core problem of Boson sampling, has been reported. Here we test the computing
of the matrix permanent on Tianhe-2, a supercomputer retaining its position as
the world's No. 1 system for six times since June 2013. We arrived at the time
(about 77.41~112.44 minutes) to compute the permanent of a $50\times 50$ matrix
in an acceptable precision. In addition, we have found that Ryser's algorithm
will produce an unacceptable error with the increase of problem scale, compared
to Balasubramanian-Bax/Franklin-Glynn's algorithm in the same complexity. The
precision issue suggests carefully check in future research of Boson sampling,
and comprehensive comparison between quantum computer and classical computer.

 <dc:description>  We consider iterative voting models and position them within the general
framework of acyclic games and game forms. More specifically, we classify
convergence results based on the underlying assumptions on the agent scheduler
(the order of players) and the action scheduler (which better-reply is played).
  Our main technical result is providing a complete picture of conditions for
acyclicity in several variations of Plurality voting. In particular, we show
that (a) under the traditional lexicographic tie-breaking, the game converges
for any order of players under a weak restriction on voters' actions; and (b)
Plurality with randomized tie-breaking is not guaranteed to converge under
arbitrary agent schedulers, but from any initial state there is \emph{some}
path of better-replies to a Nash equilibrium. We thus show a first separation
between restricted-acyclicity and weak-acyclicity of game forms, thereby
settling an open question from [Kukushkin, IJGT 2011]. In addition, we refute
another conjecture regarding strongly-acyclic voting rules.

 <dc:description>  The notion of continuation is ubiquitous in many different areas of computer
science, including systems programming, programming languages, algorithmics,
semantics, logic, and constructive mathematics. In fact the concept of
continuation nicely realizes sophisticated control mechanisms, which are widely
used in a variety of applications. Since we cannot escape control features, it
becomes a challenge to provide them with sound reasoning principles.
  Indeed there is much research activity on understanding, representing, and
reasoning about elaborated non-local control structures, in particular in
declarative programming languages such as functional and logic languages. The
proceedings of the Workshop on Continuations 2015, held in London in April
2015, illustrate some of the afore mentioned topics and hopefully they will
inspire further research work on the subject.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we describe a statistical parametric speech synthesis approach
with unit-level acoustic representation. In conventional deep neural network
based speech synthesis, the input text features are repeated for the entire
duration of phoneme for mapping text and speech parameters. This mapping is
learnt at the frame-level which is the de-facto acoustic representation.
However much of this computational requirement can be drastically reduced if
every unit can be represented with a fixed-dimensional representation. Using
recurrent neural network based auto-encoder, we show that it is indeed possible
to map units of varying duration to a single vector. We then use this acoustic
representation at unit-level to synthesize speech using deep neural network
based statistical parametric speech synthesis technique. Results show that the
proposed approach is able to synthesize at the same quality as the conventional
frame based approach at a highly reduced computational cost.

 <dc:description>  Information-theoretic measures such as the entropy, cross-entropy and the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between two mixture models is a core primitive in
many signal processing tasks. Since the Kullback-Leibler divergence of mixtures
provably does not admit a closed-form formula, it is in practice either
estimated using costly Monte-Carlo stochastic integration, approximated, or
bounded using various techniques. We present a fast and generic method that
builds algorithmically closed-form lower and upper bounds on the entropy, the
cross-entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence of mixtures. We illustrate
the versatile method by reporting on our experiments for approximating the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between univariate exponential mixtures, Gaussian
mixtures, Rayleigh mixtures, and Gamma mixtures.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) has been widely used
for question answering (QA) tasks with promising performance. However, most
existing BRNN models extract the information of questions and answers by
directly using a pooling operation to generate the representation for loss or
similarity calculation. Hence, these existing models don't put supervision
(loss or similarity calculation) at every time step, which will lose some
useful information. In this paper, we propose a novel BRNN model called
full-time supervision based BRNN (FTS-BRNN), which can put supervision at every
time step. Experiments on the factoid QA task show that our FTS-BRNN can
outperform other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is an important application in
location-based social networks (LBSNs), which learns the user preference and
mobility pattern from check-in sequences to recommend POIs. However, previous
POI recommendation systems model check-in sequences based on either tensor
factorization or Markov chain model, which cannot capture contextual check-in
information in sequences. The contextual check-in information implies the
complementary functions among POIs that compose an individual's daily check-in
sequence. In this paper, we exploit the embedding learning technique to capture
the contextual check-in information and further propose the
\textit{{\textbf{SE}}}quential \textit{{\textbf{E}}}mbedding
\textit{{\textbf{R}}}ank (\textit{SEER}) model for POI recommendation. In
particular, the \textit{SEER} model learns user preferences via a pairwise
ranking model under the sequential constraint modeled by the POI embedding
learning method. Furthermore, we incorporate two important factors, i.e.,
temporal influence and geographical influence, into the \textit{SEER} model to
enhance the POI recommendation system. Due to the temporal variance of
sequences on different days, we propose a temporal POI embedding model and
incorporate the temporal POI representations into a temporal preference ranking
model to establish the \textit{T}emporal \textit{SEER} (\textit{T-SEER}) model.
In addition, We incorporate the geographical influence into the \textit{T-SEER}
model and develop the \textit{\textbf{Geo-Temporal}} \textit{{\textbf{SEER}}}
(\textit{GT-SEER}) model.

 <dc:description>  Reliability analysis of mechatronic systems is a recent field and a dynamic
branch of research. It is addressed whenever there is a need for reliable,
available, and safe systems. The studies of reliability must be conducted
earlier during the design phase, in order to reduce costs and the number of
prototypes required in the validation of the system. The process of reliability
is then deployed throughout the full cycle of development. This process is
broken down into three major phases: the predictive reliability, the
experimental reliability and operational reliability. The main objective of
this article is a kind of portrayal of the various studies enabling a
noteworthy mastery of the predictive reliability. The weak points are
highlighted. Presenting an overview of all the quantitative and qualitative
approaches concerned with modelling and evaluating the prediction of
reliability is so important for future reliability studies and for academic
research to come up with new methods and tools. The mechatronic system is a
hybrid system, it is dynamic, reconfigurable, and interactive. The modeling
carried out of reliability prediction must take into account these criteria.
Several methodologies have been developed in this track of research. In this
regard, the aforementioned methodologies will be analytically sketched in this
paper.

 <dc:description>  Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) are being studied intensively and gaining
importance as spectrum is the heavily underutilized. CRN has the capability to
exploit smartly the unutilized frequency spectrum. Recently, the research
community started to work in the area of cognitive radio routing. In a flat
topology, all nodes are of the same level and functionality, thus making it
simple and efficient for smaller networks. However, when the network is large
with sparse nodes, the routing information becomes more complex making
cluster-based techniques really relevant to tackle such situations. In a
cluster-based routing, all nodes in the network are dynamically organized into
partitions called groups or clusters. In each cluster, a cluster head is chosen
to help in the data transmission management and to maintain cluster membership
information. This paper proposes a novel routing protocol for cognitive radio
ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) based on clustering model which amends swiftly to the
topological changes and establishes the routing efficiently. Our proposed
approach is thoroughly evaluated through simulation study. The results state
the suitability of the proposed protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks
and demonstrate that it has better performance in terms of finding the
source-destination route, reducing the amount of messages that are transmitted
all over the network and minimizing the routing delay.

 <dc:title>You are Who You Know and How You Behave: Attribute Inference Attacks via

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose new privacy attacks to infer attributes (e.g., locations,
occupations, and interests) of online social network users. Our attacks
leverage seemingly innocent user information that is publicly available in
online social networks to infer missing attributes of targeted users. Given the
increasing availability of (seemingly innocent) user information online, our
results have serious implications for Internet privacy -- private attributes
can be inferred from users' publicly available data unless we take steps to
protect users from such inference attacks.
  To infer attributes of a targeted user, existing inference attacks leverage
either the user's publicly available social friends or the user's behavioral
records (e.g., the webpages that the user has liked on Facebook, the apps that
the user has reviewed on Google Play), but not both. As we will show, such
inference attacks achieve limited success rates. However, the problem becomes
qualitatively different if we consider both social friends and behavioral
records. To address this challenge, we develop a novel model to integrate
social friends and behavioral records and design new attacks based on our
model. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our
attacks. For instance, we observe that, in a real-world large-scale dataset
with 1.1 million users, our attack can correctly infer the cities a user lived
in for 57% of the users, via confidence estimation, we are able to increase the
attack success rate to over 90% if the attacker selectively attacks a half of
the users. Moreover, we show that our attack can correctly infer attributes for
significantly more users than previous attacks.

 <dc:description>  A good clustering can help a data analyst to explore and understand a data
set, but what constitutes a good clustering may depend on domain-specific and
application-specific criteria. These criteria can be difficult to formalize,
even when it is easy for an analyst to know a good clustering when they see
one. We present a new approach to interactive clustering for data exploration
called TINDER, based on a particularly simple feedback mechanism, in which an
analyst can reject a given clustering and request a new one, which is chosen to
be different from the previous clustering while fitting the data well. We
formalize this interaction in a Bayesian framework as a method for prior
elicitation, in which each different clustering is produced by a prior
distribution that is modified to discourage previously rejected clusterings. We
show that TINDER successfully produces a diverse set of clusterings, each of
equivalent quality, that are much more diverse than would be obtained by
randomized restarts.

the style of another given image. For example, a photograph can be transformed
to have the style of a famous painting. Here we address a potential shortcoming
of the original method: the algorithm transfers the colors of the original
painting, which can alter the appearance of the scene in undesirable ways. We
describe simple linear methods for transferring style while preserving colors.

 <dc:title>Digital Calibration Method for High Resolution in Analog/RF Designs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Renzhi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Transistor random mismatch continuously poses challenges for analog/RF
circuit design for achieving high accuracy and high yield as the process
technology advances. Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method
can improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general
calibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation,
we propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended
statistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES
method not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher
calibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES
based calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is
current source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify
this proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we
designed, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design.
The receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving
harmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the
ESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection
ratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a
current-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based
amplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance.
Simulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude
linearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC.

 <dc:description>  It is known that there exists a network which does not have a scalar linear
solution over any finite field but has a vector linear solution when message
dimension is $2$ [3]. It is not known whether this result can be generalized
for an arbitrary message dimension. In this paper, we show that there exists a
network which admits an $m$ dimensional vector linear solution, where $m$ is a
positive integer greater than or equal to $2$, but does not have a vector
linear solution over any finite field when the message dimension is less than
$m$.

 <dc:title>Can Scientific Impact Be Predicted?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A widely used measure of scientific impact is citations. However, due to
their heavy-tailed distribution, citations are fundamentally difficult to
predict. Instead, to characterize scientific impact, we address two analogous
questions asked by many scientific researchers: &quot;How will my h-index evolve
over time, and which of my previously or newly published papers will contribute
to it?&quot; To answer these questions, we perform two related tasks. First, we
develop a model to predict authors' future h-indices based on their current
scientific impact. Second, we examine the factors that drive papers---either
previously or newly published---to increase their authors' predicted future
h-indices. By leveraging relevant factors, we can predict an author's h-index
in five years with an R2 value of 0.92 and whether a previously (newly)
published paper will contribute to this future h-index with an F1 score of 0.99
(0.77). We find that topical authority and publication venue are crucial to
these effective predictions, while topic popularity is surprisingly
inconsequential. Further, we develop an online tool that allows users to
generate informed h-index predictions. Our work demonstrates the predictability
of scientific impact, and can help scholars to effectively leverage their
position of &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot;

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In just three years, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of
the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated
distributions. VAEs are appealing because they are built on top of standard
function approximators (neural networks), and can be trained with stochastic
gradient descent. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of
complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR
images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from
static images. This tutorial introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains
the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior. No prior
knowledge of variational Bayesian methods is assumed.

 <dc:description>  The gene family-free framework for comparative genomics aims at developing
methods for gene order analysis that do not require prior gene family
assignment, but work directly on a sequence similarity multipartite graph. We
present a model for constructing a median of three genomes in this family-free
setting, based on maximizing an objective function that generalizes the
classical breakpoint distance by integrating sequence similarity in the score
of a gene adjacency. We show that the corresponding computational problem is
MAX SNP-hard and we present a 0-1 linear program for its exact solution. The
result of our FF-median program is a median genome with median genes associated
to extant genes, in which median adjacencies are assumed to define positional
orthologs. We demonstrate through simulations and comparison with the OMA
orthology database that the herein presented method is able compute accurate
medians and positional orthologs for genomes comparable in size of bacterial
genomes.

 <dc:description>  Because computers may contain or interact with sensitive information, they
are often air-gapped and in this way kept isolated and disconnected from the
Internet. In recent years the ability of malware to communicate over an air-gap
by transmitting sonic and ultrasonic signals from a computer speaker to a
nearby receiver has been shown. In order to eliminate such acoustic channels,
current best practice recommends the elimination of speakers (internal or
external) in secure computers, thereby creating a so-called 'audio-gap'. In
this paper, we present Fansmitter, a malware that can acoustically exfiltrate
data from air-gapped computers, even when audio hardware and speakers are not
present. Our method utilizes the noise emitted from the CPU and chassis fans
which are present in virtually every computer today. We show that a software
can regulate the internal fans' speed in order to control the acoustic waveform
emitted from a computer. Binary data can be modulated and transmitted over
these audio signals to a remote microphone (e.g., on a nearby mobile phone). We
present Fansmitter's design considerations, including acoustic signature
analysis, data modulation, and data transmission. We also evaluate the acoustic
channel, present our results, and discuss countermeasures. Using our method we
successfully transmitted data from air-gapped computer without audio hardware,
to a smartphone receiver in the same room. We demonstrated the effective
transmission of encryption keys and passwords from a distance of zero to eight
meters, with bit rate of up to 900 bits/hour. We show that our method can also
be used to leak data from different types of IT equipment, embedded systems,
and IoT devices that have no audio hardware, but contain fans of various types
and sizes.

 <dc:description>  The goal of this thesis is to prove that $\pi_4(S^3) \simeq
\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ in homotopy type theory. In particular it is a
constructive and purely homotopy-theoretic proof. We first recall the basic
concepts of homotopy type theory, and we prove some well-known results about
the homotopy groups of spheres: the computation of the homotopy groups of the
circle, the triviality of those of the form $\pi_k(S^n)$ with $k &lt; n$, and the
construction of the Hopf fibration. We then move to more advanced tools. In
particular, we define the James construction which allows us to prove the
Freudenthal suspension theorem and the fact that there exists a natural number
$n$ such that $\pi_4(S^3) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Then we study the
smash product of spheres, we construct the cohomology ring of a space, and we
introduce the Hopf invariant, allowing us to narrow down the $n$ to either $1$
or $2$. The Hopf invariant also allows us to prove that all the groups of the
form $\pi_{4n-1}(S^{2n})$ are infinite. Finally we construct the Gysin exact
sequence, allowing us to compute the cohomology of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ and to prove
that $\pi_4(S^3) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and that more generally
$\pi_{n+1}(S^n) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ for every $n \ge 3$.

 <dc:title>Slack and Margin Rescaling as Convex Extensions of Supermodular
  Functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blaschko, Matthew B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Slack and margin rescaling are variants of the structured output SVM, which
is frequently applied to problems in computer vision such as image
segmentation, object localization, and learning parts based object models. They
define convex surrogates to task specific loss functions, which, when
specialized to non-additive loss functions for multi-label problems, yield
extensions to increasing set functions. We demonstrate in this paper that we
may use these concepts to define polynomial time convex extensions of arbitrary
supermodular functions, providing an analysis framework for the tightness of
these surrogates. This analysis framework shows that, while neither margin nor
slack rescaling dominate the other, known bounds on supermodular functions can
be used to derive extensions that dominate both of these, indicating possible
directions for defining novel structured output prediction surrogates. In
addition to the analysis of structured prediction loss functions, these results
imply an approach to supermodular minimization in which margin rescaling is
combined with non-polynomial time convex extensions to compute a sequence of LP
relaxations reminiscent of a cutting plane method. This approach is applied to
the problem of selecting representative exemplars from a set of images,
validating our theoretical contributions.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to a wide variety
of acoustic modeling tasks in recent years. These include the applications of
DNNs either in a discriminative feature extraction or in a hybrid acoustic
modeling scenario. Despite the rapid progress in this area, a number of
challenges remain in training DNNs. This paper presents an effective way of
training DNNs using a manifold learning based regularization framework. In this
framework, the parameters of the network are optimized to preserve underlying
manifold based relationships between speech feature vectors while minimizing a
measure of loss between network outputs and targets. This is achieved by
incorporating manifold based locality constraints in the objective criterion of
DNNs. Empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that training a network
with manifold constraints preserves structural compactness in the hidden layers
of the network. Manifold regularization is applied to train bottleneck DNNs for
feature extraction in hidden Markov model (HMM) based speech recognition. The
experiments in this work are conducted on the Aurora-2 spoken digits and the
Aurora-4 read news large vocabulary continuous speech recognition tasks. The
performance is measured in terms of word error rate (WER) on these tasks. It is
shown that the manifold regularized DNNs result in up to 37% reduction in WER
relative to standard DNNs.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a framework for the representation of uncertainty in the
estimates for software design projects for use throughout the entire project
lifecycle. The framework is flexible in order to accommodate uncertainty in the
project and utilises Monte Carlo simulation to compute the propagation of
uncertainty in effort estimates towards the total project uncertainty and
therefore gives a project manager the means to make informed decisions
throughout the project life. The framework also provides a mechanism for
accumulating project knowledge through the use of a historical database,
allowing effort estimates to be informed by, or indeed based upon, the outcome
of previous projects. Initial results using simulated data are presented and
avenues for further work are discussed.

problem that involves the task of covering a polygon shaped area with a series
of rectangular shaped panels. This has a number of applications in the
construction industry. This work examines the MCPO problem in order to
construct a model that captures essential parameters of the problem to be
solved automatically using numerical optimization algorithms. Three algorithms
have been implemented of the actual optimization task: the greedy search, the
Monte Carlo (MC) method, and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Results are presented
to show the relative effectiveness of the algorithms. This is followed by
critical analysis of various findings of this research.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have yielded the excellent performance
in a variety of computer vision tasks, where CNNs typically adopt a similar
structure consisting of convolution layers, pooling layers and fully connected
layers. In this paper, we propose to apply a novel method, namely Hybrid
Orthogonal Projection and Estimation (HOPE), to CNNs in order to introduce
orthogonality into the CNN structure. The HOPE model can be viewed as a hybrid
model to combine feature extraction using orthogonal linear projection with
mixture models. It is an effective model to extract useful information from the
original high-dimension feature vectors and meanwhile filter out irrelevant
noises. In this work, we present three different ways to apply the HOPE models
to CNNs, i.e., {\em HOPE-Input}, {\em single-HOPE-Block} and {\em
multi-HOPE-Blocks}. For {\em HOPE-Input} CNNs, a HOPE layer is directly used
right after the input to de-correlate high-dimension input feature vectors.
Alternatively, in {\em single-HOPE-Block} and {\em multi-HOPE-Blocks} CNNs, we
consider to use HOPE layers to replace one or more blocks in the CNNs, where
one block may include several convolutional layers and one pooling layer. The
experimental results on both Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 data sets have shown that
the orthogonal constraints imposed by the HOPE layers can significantly improve
the performance of CNNs in these image classification tasks (we have achieved
one of the best performance when image augmentation has not been applied, and
top 5 performance with image augmentation).

(ICIC) technique usually deal with Strict Frequency Reuse (FR) or Soft FR with
a reuse factor of $\Delta=1$ in a Rayleigh fading channel. It has been assumed
that all Base Stations (BSs) transmit continuously which leads to a reduction
on the impact of number of users and RBs on network performance. In this paper,
the performance of Soft FR with a reuse factor of $\Delta&gt;1$ in
Rayleigh-Lognormal fading channel is evaluated. The impact of the number of
users and Resource Blocks (RBs) on Intercell Interference (ICI) are presented
for Round Robin scheduling and indicator functions. The results show that there
are opposite trends between coverage probability of Cell-Center User (CCU) and
Cell-Edge User (CEU).

 <dc:description>  Typically, a memory request from a processor may need to go through many
intermediate interconnect routers, directory node, owner node, etc before it is
finally serviced. Current multiprocessors do not give preference to any
particular memory request. But certain memory requests are more critical to
multiprocessor's performance than other requests. Example: memory requests from
critical sections, load request feeding into multiple dependent instructions,
etc. This knowledge can be used to improve the performance of current
multiprocessors by letting the ordering point and the interconnect routers
prioritize critical requests over non-critical ones. In this paper, we evaluate
using SIMICS/GEMS infrastructure. For lock-intensive microbenchmarks,
criticality-aware multiprocessors showed 5-15% performance improvement over
baseline multiprocessor. Criticality aware multiprocessor provides a new
direction for tapping performance in a shared memory multiprocessor and can
provide substantial speedup in lock intensive benchmarks.

 <dc:title>Adapting ELM to Time Series Classification: A Novel Diversified Top-k
  Shapelets Extraction Method</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) is a single hidden layer feed-forward network,
where the weights between input and hidden layer are initialized randomly. ELM
is efficient due to its utilization of the analytical approach to compute
weights between hidden and output layer. However, ELM still fails to output the
semantic classification outcome. To address such limitation, in this paper, we
propose a diversified top-k shapelets transform framework, where the shapelets
are the subsequences i.e., the best representative and interpretative features
of each class. As we identified, the most challenge problems are how to extract
the best k shapelets in original candidate sets and how to automatically
determine the k value. Specifically, we first define the similar shapelets and
diversified top-k shapelets to construct diversity shapelets graph. Then, a
novel diversity graph based top-k shapelets extraction algorithm named as
\textbf{DivTopkshapelets}\ is proposed to search top-k diversified shapelets.
Finally, we propose a shapelets transformed ELM algorithm named as
\textbf{DivShapELM} to automatically determine the k value, which is further
utilized for time series classification. The experimental results over public
data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
traditional ELM algorithm in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Multiparty session calculi have been recently equipped with security
requirements, in order to guarantee properties such as access control and leak
freedom. However, the proposed security requirements seem to be overly
restrictive in some cases. In particular, a party is not allowed to communicate
any kind of public information after receiving a secret information. This does
not seem justified in case the two pieces of information are totally unrelated.
The aim of the present paper is to overcome this restriction, by designing a
type discipline for a simple multiparty session calculus, which classifies
messages according to their topics and allows unrestricted sequencing of
messages on independent topics.

 <dc:description>  Phasers pose an interesting synchronization mechanism that generalizes many
collective synchronization patterns seen in parallel programming languages,
including barriers, clocks, and point-to-point synchronization using latches or
semaphores. This work characterizes scheduling constraints on phaser
operations, by relating the execution state of two tasks that operate on the
same phaser. We propose a formalization of Habanero phasers,
May-Happen-In-Parallel, and Happens-Before relations for phaser operations, and
show that these relations conform with the semantics. Our formalization and
proofs are fully mechanized using the Coq proof assistant, and are available
online.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents a data-driven model of self-adaptivity for multiparty
sessions. System choreography is prescribed by a global type. Participants are
incarnated by processes associated with monitors, which control their
behaviour. Each participant can access and modify a set of global data, which
are able to trigger adaptations in the presence of critical changes of values.
  The use of the parallel composition for building global types, monitors and
processes enables a significant degree of flexibility: an adaptation step can
dynamically reconfigure a set of participants only, without altering the
remaining participants, even if the two groups communicate.

 <dc:description>  Context-Oriented Programming languages provide us with primitive constructs
to adapt program behaviour depending on the evolution of their operational
environment, namely the context. In previous work we proposed ML_CoDa, a

describes an extension of ML_CoDa to deal with adaptation to unpredictable
context changes notified by asynchronous events.

 <dc:title>From Events to Reactions: A Progress Report</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Syndicate is a new coordinated, concurrent programming language. It occupies
a novel point on the spectrum between the shared-everything paradigm of threads
and the shared-nothing approach of actors. Syndicate actors exchange messages
and share common knowledge via a carefully controlled database that clearly
scopes conversations. This approach clearly simplifies coordination of
concurrent activities. Experience in programming with Syndicate, however,
suggests a need to raise the level of linguistic abstraction. In addition to
writing event handlers and managing event subscriptions directly, the language
will have to support a reactive style of programming. This paper presents
event-oriented Syndicate programming and then describes a preliminary design
for augmenting it with new reactive programming constructs.

 <dc:description>  Much research has studied foundations for correct and reliable
communication-centric systems. A salient approach to correctness uses session
types to enforce structured communications; a recent approach to reliability
uses reversible actions as a way of reacting to unanticipated events or
failures. This note develops a simple observation: the machinery required to
define asynchronous semantics and monitoring can also support reversible
protocols. We propose a process framework of session communication in which
monitors support reversibility. A key novelty in our approach are session types
with present and past, which allow us to streamline the semantics of reversible
actions.

 <dc:description>  Message passing is widely used in industry to develop programs consisting of
several distributed communicating components. Developing functionally correct
message passing software is very challenging due to the concurrent nature of
message exchanges. Nonetheless, many safety-critical applications rely on the
message passing paradigm, including air traffic control systems and emergency
services, which makes proving their correctness crucial. We focus on the
modular verification of MPI programs by statically verifying concrete Java
code. We use separation logic to reason about local correctness and define
abstractions of the communication protocol in the process algebra used by
mCRL2. We call these abstractions futures as they predict how components will
interact during program execution. We establish a provable link between futures
and program code and analyse the abstract futures via model checking to prove
global correctness. Finally, we verify a leader election protocol to
demonstrate our approach.

 <dc:description>  Objects and actors are communicating state machines, offering and consuming
different services at different points in their lifecycle. Two complementary
challenges arise when programming such systems. When objects interact, their
state machines must be &quot;compatible&quot;, so that services are requested only when
they are available. Dually, when objects refine other objects, their state
machines must be &quot;compliant&quot;, so that services are honoured whenever they are
promised.
  In this paper we show how the idea of multiparty compatibility from the
session types literature can be applied to both of these problems. We present
an untyped language in which concurrent objects are checked automatically for
compatibility and compliance. For simple objects, checking can be exhaustive
and has the feel of a type system. More complex objects can be partially
validated via test cases, leading to a methodology closer to continuous
testing. Our proof-of-concept implementation is limited in some important
respects, but demonstrates the potential value of the approach and the
relationship to existing software development practices.

 <dc:title>Program Execution on Reconfigurable Multicore Architectures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Based on the two observations that diverse applications perform better on
different multicore architectures, and that different phases of an application
may have vastly different resource requirements, Pal et al. proposed a novel
reconfigurable hardware approach for executing multithreaded programs. Instead
of mapping a concurrent program to a fixed architecture, the architecture
adaptively reconfigures itself to meet the application's concurrency and
communication requirements, yielding significant improvements in performance.
Based on our earlier abstract operational framework for multicore execution
with hierarchical memory structures, we describe execution of multithreaded
programs on reconfigurable architectures that support a variety of clustered
configurations. Such reconfiguration may not preserve the semantics of programs
due to the possible introduction of race conditions arising from concurrent
accesses to shared memory by threads running on the different cores. We present
an intuitive partial ordering notion on the cluster configurations, and show
that the semantics of multithreaded programs is always preserved for
reconfigurations &quot;upward&quot; in that ordering, whereas semantics preservation for
arbitrary reconfigurations can be guaranteed for well-synchronised programs. We
further show that a simple approximate notion of efficiency of execution on the
different configurations can be obtained using the notion of amortised
bisimulations, and extend it to dynamic reconfiguration.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Nunchaku is a new higher-order counterexample generator based on a sequence
of transformations from polymorphic higher-order logic to first-order logic.
Unlike its predecessor Nitpick for Isabelle, it is designed as a stand-alone
tool, with frontends for various proof assistants. In this short paper, we
present some ideas to extend Nunchaku with partial support for dependent types
and type classes, to make frontends for Coq and other systems based on
dependent type theory more useful.

 <dc:description>  Hammers are tools that provide general purpose automation for formal proof
assistants. Despite the gaining popularity of the more advanced versions of
type theory, there are no hammers for such systems. We present an extension of
the various hammer components to type theory: (i) a translation of a
significant part of the Coq logic into the format of automated proof systems;
(ii) a proof reconstruction mechanism based on a Ben-Yelles-type algorithm
combined with limited rewriting, congruence closure and a first-order
generalization of the left rules of Dyckhoff's system LJT.

 <dc:description>  This extended abstract reports on current progress of SMTCoq, a communication
tool between the Coq proof assistant and external SAT and SMT solvers. Based on
a checker for generic first-order certificates implemented and proved correct
in Coq, SMTCoq offers facilities both to check external SAT and SMT answers and
to improve Coq's automation using such solvers, in a safe way. Currently
supporting the SAT solver zChaff, and the SMT solver veriT for the combination
of the theories of congruence closure and linear integer arithmetic, SMTCoq is
meant to be extendable with a reasonable amount of effort: we present work in
progress to support the SMT solver CVC4 and the theory of bit vectors.

 <dc:title>Towards the Integration of an Intuitionistic First-Order Prover into Coq</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kunze, Fabian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An efficient intuitionistic first-order prover integrated into Coq is useful
to replay proofs found by external automated theorem provers. We propose a
two-phase approach: An intuitionistic prover generates a certificate based on
the matrix characterization of intuitionistic first-order logic; the
certificate is then translated into a sequent-style proof.

 <dc:title>The Wiretapped Diamond-Relay Channel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Si-Hyeon</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a diamond-relay channel where the source is connected
to $M$ relays through orthogonal links and the relays transmit to the
destination over a wireless multiple-access channel in the presence of an
eavesdropper. The eavesdropper not only observes the relay transmissions
through another multiple-access channel, but also observes a certain number of
source-relay links. The legitimate terminals know neither the eavesdropper's
channel state information nor the location of source-relay links revealed to
the eavesdropper except the total number of such links.
  For this wiretapped diamond-relay channel, we establish the optimal secure
degrees of freedom. In the achievability part, our proposed scheme uses the
source-relay links to transmit a judiciously constructed combination of message
symbols, artificial noise symbols as well as fictitious message symbols
associated with secure network coding. The relays use a combination of
beamforming and interference alignment in their transmission scheme. For the
converse part, we take a genie-aided approach assuming that the location of
wiretapped links is known.

 <dc:title>Goldbach for Gaussian, Hurwitz, Octavian and Eisenstein primes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We formulate Goldbach type questions for Gaussian, Hurwitz, Octavian and
Eisenstein primes. They are different from Goldbach type statements by
Takayoshi Mitsui from 1960 for number fields or C.A. Holben and James Jordan
from 1968 for Gaussian integers. Here is what we meeasure: 1) Every even
Gaussian integer a+ib satisfying a&gt;2, b&gt;2 is a sum of two Gaussian primes with
positive coefficients. 2) Every Eisenstein integer a+bw with a&gt;3,b&gt;3 and
w=(1+sqrt(-3))/2 is the sum of two Eisenstein primes with positive
coefficients. Note that no evenness condition is asked in the Eisenstein case.
3) Every Lipschitz integer quaternion with positive entries is the sum of two
Hurwitz primes. 4) There exists a constant K such that every Octavian integer
with coefficients larger than K is the sum of two Octavian primes. Except in
the Octonion case, where the fewest experiments were done, the statements can
be linked to difficult questions like Landau or Bunyakovsky conjectures. We
therefore look also more closely and numerically at some Hardy-Littlewood
constants following early computations from Daniel Shanks and Marvin Wunderlich
from the 50ies and 70ies.

 <dc:title>Efficient Timestamps for Capturing Causality</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Consider an asynchronous system consisting of processes that communicate via
message-passing. The processes communicate over a potentially {\em incomplete}
communication network consisting of reliable bidirectional communication
channels. Thus, not every pair of processes is necessarily able to communicate
with each other directly. % For instance, when the communication network is a
{\em star} graph, there is a {\em central} process % that can communicate with
all the remaining processes (which are called {\em radial} processes), % but
the radial processes cannot communicate with each other directly.
  The goal of the algorithms discussed in this paper is to assign timestamps to
the events at all the processes such that (a) distinct events are assigned
distinct timestamps, and (b) the happened-before relationship between the
events can be inferred from the timestamps. We consider three types of
algorithms for assigning timestamps to events: (i) Online algorithms that must
(greedily) assign a timestamp to each event when the event occurs. (ii) Offline
algorithms that assign timestamps to event after a finite execution is
complete. (iii) Inline algorithms that assign a timestamp to each event when it
occurs, but may modify some elements of a timestamp again at a later time.
  For specific classes of graphs, particularly {\em star} graphs and graphs
with connectivity $\geq 1$, the paper presents bounds on the length of vector
timestamps assigned by an {\em online} algorithm. The paper then presents an
{\em inline} algorithm, which typically assigns substantially smaller
timestamps than the optimal-length {\em online} vector timestamps. In
particular, the inline algorithm assigns timestamp in the form of a tuple
containing $2c+2$ integer elements, where $c$ is the size of the vertex cover
for the underlying communication graph.

 <dc:description>  It is hard to operate and debug systems like OpenStack that integrate many
independently developed modules with multiple levels of abstractions. A major
challenge is to navigate through the complex dependencies and relationships of
the states in different modules or subsystems, to ensure the correctness and
consistency of these states. We present a system that captures the runtime
states and events from the entire OpenStack-Ceph stack, and automatically
organizes these data into a graph that we call system operation state graph
(SOSG).With SOSG we can use intuitive graph traversal techniques to solve
problems like reasoning about the state of a virtual machine. Also, using
graph-based anomaly detection, we can automatically discover hidden problems in
OpenStack. We have a scalable implementation of SOSG, and evaluate the approach
on a 125-node production OpenStack cluster, finding a number of interesting
problems.

 <dc:title>A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach for Spoken Term detection by Example

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  State of the art speech recognition systems use data-intensive
context-dependent phonemes as acoustic units. However, these approaches do not
translate well to low resourced languages where large amounts of training data
is not available. For such languages, automatic discovery of acoustic units is
critical. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of nonparametric
Bayesian models to acoustic unit discovery. We show that the discovered units
are correlated with phonemes and therefore are linguistically meaningful. We
also present a spoken term detection (STD) by example query algorithm based on
these automatically learned units. We show that our proposed system produces a
P@N of 61.2% and an EER of 13.95% on the TIMIT dataset. The improvement in the
EER is 5% while P@N is only slightly lower than the best reported system in the
literature.

defined by Gaussian primes we observe a circular spectral law for the
eigenvalues. We look at matrices defined by Gaussian primes and look at the
growth of the determinant, trace. We experiment with various Goldbach
conjectures for Gaussian primes, Eisenstein primes, Hurwitz primes or Octavian
primes. These conjectures relate with Landau or Bunyakovsky or Andrica type
conjectures for rational primes. We also look at some graphs finite simple
defined by primes. Finally we look at some spectra of almost periodic pseudo
random matrices defined by Diophantine irrational rotations, where fractal
spectral phenomena occur. The matrix is the real part of a van der Monde
matrix.

 <dc:description>  Connected Component Labeling (CCL) is an important step in pattern
recognition and image processing. It assigns labels to the pixels such that
adjacent pixels sharing the same features are assigned the same label.
Typically, CCL requires several passes over the data. We focus on two-pass
technique where each pixel is given a provisional label in the first pass
whereas an actual label is assigned in the second pass.
  We present a scalable parallel two-pass CCL algorithm, called PAREMSP, which
employs a scan strategy and the best union-find technique called REMSP, which
uses REM's algorithm for storing label equivalence information of pixels in a
2-D image. In the first pass, we divide the image among threads and each thread
runs the scan phase along with REMSP simultaneously. In the second phase, we
assign the final labels to the pixels. As REMSP is easily parallelizable, we
use the parallel version of REMSP for merging the pixels on the boundary. Our
experiments show the scalability of PAREMSP achieving speedups up to $20.1$
using $24$ cores on shared memory architecture using OpenMP for an image of
size $465.20$ MB. We find that our proposed parallel algorithm achieves linear
scaling for a large resolution fixed problem size as the number of processing
elements are increased. Additionally, the parallel algorithm does not make use
of any hardware specific routines, and thus is highly portable.

 <dc:description>  Cutwidth is one of the classic layout parameters for graphs. It measures how
well one can order the vertices of a graph in a linear manner, so that the
maximum number of edges between any prefix and its complement suffix is
minimized. As graphs of cutwidth at most $k$ are closed under taking
immersions, the results of Robertson and Seymour imply that there is a finite
list of minimal immersion obstructions for admitting a cut layout of width at
most $k$. We prove that every minimal immersion obstruction for cutwidth at
most $k$ has size at most $2^{O(k^3\log k)}$.
  As an interesting algorithmic byproduct, we design a new fixed-parameter
algorithm for computing the cutwidth of a graph that runs in time $2^{O(k^2\log
k)}\cdot n$, where $k$ is the optimum width and $n$ is the number of vertices.
While being slower by a $\log k$-factor in the exponent than the fastest known
algorithm, given by Thilikos, Bodlaender, and Serna in [Cutwidth I: A linear
time fixed parameter algorithm, J. Algorithms, 56(1):1--24, 2005] and [Cutwidth
II: Algorithms for partial $w$-trees of bounded degree, J. Algorithms,
56(1):25--49, 2005], our algorithm has the advantage of being simpler and

 <dc:description>  'Alice' is submitting one web search per five minutes, for three hours in a
row - is it normal? How to detect abnormal search behaviors, among Alice and
other users? Is there any distinct pattern in Alice's (or other users') search
behavior? We studied what is probably the largest, publicly available, query
log that contains more than 30 million queries from 0.6 million users. In this
paper, we present a novel, user-and group-level framework, M3A: Model,
MetaModel and Anomaly detection. For each user, we discover and explain a
surprising, bi-modal pattern of the inter-arrival time (IAT) of landed queries
(queries with user click-through). Specifically, the model Camel-Log is
proposed to describe such an IAT distribution; we then notice the correlations
among its parameters at the group level. Thus, we further propose the metamodel
Meta-Click, to capture and explain the two-dimensional, heavy-tail distribution
of the parameters. Combining Camel-Log and Meta-Click, the proposed M3A has the
following strong points: (1) the accurate modeling of marginal IAT
distribution, (2) quantitative interpretations, and (3) anomaly detection.

 <dc:title>Strategic Bidding for Producers in Nodal Electricity Markets: A Convex
  Relaxation Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Strategic bidding problems in electricity markets are widely studied in power
systems, often by formulating complex bi-level optimization problems that are
hard to solve. The state-of-the-art approach to solve such problems is to
reformulate them as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). However, the
computational time of such MILP reformulations grows dramatically, once the
network size increases, scheduling horizon increases, or randomness is taken
into consideration. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach
and propose effective and customized convex programming tools to solve the
strategic bidding problem for producers in nodal electricity markets. Our
approach is inspired by the Schmudgen's Positivstellensatz Theorem in
semi-algebraic geometry; but then we go through several steps based upon both
convex optimization and mixed-integer programming that results in obtaining
close to optimal bidding solutions, as evidenced by several numerical case
studies, besides having a huge advantage on reducing computation time. While
the computation time of the state-of-the-art MILP approach grows exponentially
when we increase the scheduling horizon or the number of random scenarios, the
computation time of our approach increases rather linearly.

 <dc:title>Consensus with Output Saturations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper consider a standard consensus algorithm under output saturations.
In the presence of output saturations, global consensus can not be realized due
to the existence of stable, unachievable equilibrium points for the consensus.
Therefore, this paper investigates necessary and sufficient initial conditions
for the achievement of consensus, that is an exact domain of attraction.
Specifically, this paper considers singe-integrator agents with both fixed and
time-varying undirected graphs, as well as double-integrator agents with fixed
undirected graph. Then, we derive that the consensus will be achieved if and
only if the average of the initial states (only velocities for
double-integrator agents with homogeneous saturation levels for the outputs) is
within the minimum saturation level. An extension to the case of fixed directed
graph is also provided in which an weighted average is required to be within
the minimum saturation limit.

 <dc:title>Optimal Finite-Length and Asymptotic Index Codes for Five or Fewer
  Receivers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ong, Lawrence</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Index coding models broadcast networks in which a sender sends different
messages to different receivers simultaneously, where each receiver may know
some of the messages a priori. The aim is to find the minimum (normalised)
index codelength that the sender sends. This paper considers unicast index
coding, where each receiver requests exactly one message, and each message is
requested by exactly one receiver. Each unicast index-coding instances can be
fully described by a directed graph and vice versa, where each vertex
corresponds to one receiver. For any directed graph representing a unicast
index-coding instance, we show that if a maximum acyclic induced subgraph
(MAIS) is obtained by removing two or fewer vertices from the graph, then the
minimum index codelength equals the number of vertices in the MAIS, and linear
codes are optimal for the corresponding index-coding instance. Using this
result, we solved all unicast index-coding instances with up to five receivers,
which correspond to all graphs with up to five vertices. For 9819
non-isomorphic graphs among all graphs up to five vertices, we obtained the
minimum index codelength for all message alphabet sizes; for the remaining 28
graphs, we obtained the minimum index codelength if the message alphabet size
is $k^2$ for any positive integer $k$. This work complements the result by
Arbabjolfaei et al. (ISIT 2013), who solved all unicast index-coding instances
with up to five receivers in the asymptotic regime, where the message alphabet
size tends to infinity.

 <dc:description>  Dimension reduction of multivariate data supervised by auxiliary information
is considered. A series of basis for dimension reduction is obtained as
minimizers of a novel criterion. The proposed method is akin to continuum
regression, and the resulting basis is called continuum directions. With a
presence of binary supervision data, these directions continuously bridge the
principal component, mean difference and linear discriminant directions, thus
ranging from unsupervised to fully supervised dimension reduction.
High-dimensional asymptotic studies of continuum directions for binary
supervision reveal several interesting facts. The conditions under which the
sample continuum directions are inconsistent, but their classification
performance is good, are specified. While the proposed method can be directly
used for binary and multi-category classification, its generalizations to
incorporate any form of auxiliary data are also presented. The proposed method
enjoys fast computation, and the performance is better or on par with more
computer-intensive alternatives.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new training method for a feedforward neural network having the
activation functions with the geometric contraction property. The method
consists of constructing a new functional that is less nonlinear in comparison
with the classical functional by removing the nonlinearity of the activation
functions from the output layer. We validate this new method by a series of
experiments that show an improved learning speed and also a better
classification error.

 <dc:title>Modeling and Self-Configuring SaaS Application</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The main objectives of SaaS application are to make the management and
control of software easier and take the management strain away from consumers.
However, it also leads to software services available globally and this has
been realized in our paper by designing a new model for SaaS application. The
three levels we have classified in our model easy adapted to workflow and
services. From the application layers meat-model description we discovered a
new algorithm for the self-configuration of SaaS application. We used a feature
model to define the variation of our model's management levels. The Xml file
obtained from the feature model gave interactive communication between three
levels and our new self-configuration algorithm. That increased the performance
by selecting from the web a suitable configuration for every level. We have
explained all the processes by an online booking example. Finally we present a
conclusion and future work.

 <dc:title>The Role of CNL and AMR in Scalable Abstractive Summarization for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the era of Big Data and Deep Learning, there is a common view that machine
learning approaches are the only way to cope with the robust and scalable
information extraction and summarization. It has been recently proposed that
the CNL approach could be scaled up, building on the concept of embedded CNL
and, thus, allowing for CNL-based information extraction from e.g. normative or
medical texts that are rather controlled by nature but still infringe the
boundaries of CNL. Although it is arguable if CNL can be exploited to approach
the robust wide-coverage semantic parsing for use cases like media monitoring,
its potential becomes much more obvious in the opposite direction: generation
of story highlights from the summarized AMR graphs, which is in the focus of
this position paper.

 <dc:description>  Virtualized network services consisting of multiple individual network
functions are already today deployed across multiple sites, so called multi-PoP
(points of presence) environ- ments. This allows to improve service performance
by optimizing its placement in the network. But prototyping and testing of
these complex distributed software systems becomes extremely challenging. The
reason is that not only the network service as such has to be tested but also
its integration with management and orchestration systems. Existing solutions,
like simulators, basic network emulators, or local cloud testbeds, do not
support all aspects of these tasks. To this end, we introduce MeDICINE, a novel
NFV prototyping platform that is able to execute production-ready network func-
tions, provided as software containers, in an emulated multi-PoP environment.
These network functions can be controlled by any third-party management and
orchestration system that connects to our platform through standard interfaces.
Based on this, a developer can use our platform to prototype and test complex
network services in a realistic environment running on his laptop.

 <dc:description>  We give a theoretical model of conjunctions $E\wedge F$ and implications
$E\implies F$ where $F$ is meaningful only when $E$ is true, a situation which
is very often encountered in everyday mathematics, and which was already
formalized by several type theorists. We present a version of these concepts
which should be more attractive for mathematicians and in particular for non
logicians, by using an extension of Lawvere's definition of the quantifiers. We
explain the link of this phenomenon with the principle of description, why this
dependency is obtained through the use of a &quot;hidden&quot; variable, and more
generally the link of these concepts with the vernacular language of
mathematics, which is actually our main motivation. Despite its links with
topos theory, this article is readable by non specialists.

 <dc:description>  Fingerprint recognition is widely used for verification and identification in
many commercial, governmental and forensic applications. The orientation field
(OF) plays an important role at various processing stages in fingerprint
recognition systems. OFs are used for image enhancement, fingerprint alignment,
for fingerprint liveness detection, fingerprint alteration detection and
fingerprint matching. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to globally
model an OF combined with locally adaptive methods. We show that this model
adapts perfectly to the 'true OF' in the limit. This perfect OF is described by
a small number of parameters with straightforward geometric interpretation.
Applications are manifold: Quick expert marking of very poor quality (for
instance latent) OFs, high fidelity low parameter OF compression and a direct
road to ground truth OFs markings for large databases, say. In this
contribution we describe an algorithm to perfectly estimate OF parameters
automatically or semi-automatically, depending on image quality, and we
establish the main underlying claim of high fidelity low parameter OF
compression.

 <dc:description>  A well-known combinatorial theorem says that a set of n non-collinear points
in the plane determines at least n distinct lines. Chen and Chv\'atal
conjectured that this theorem extends to metric spaces, with an appropriated
definition of line. In this work we prove a slightly stronger version of Chen
and Chv\'atal conjecture for a family of graphs containing chordal graphs and
distance-hereditary graphs.

 <dc:title>Nonlinear Interference Alignment in a One-dimensional Space</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Real interference alignment is efficient in breaking-up a one-dimensional
space over time-invariant channels into fractional dimensions. As such,
multiple symbols can be simultaneously transmitted with fractional
degrees-of-freedom (DoF). Of particular interest is when the one dimensional
space is partitioned into two fractional dimensions. In such scenario, the
interfering signals are confined to one sub-space and the intended signal is
confined to the other sub-space. Existing real interference alignment schemes
achieve near-capacity performance at high SNR for time-invariant channels.
However, such techniques yield poor achievable rate at finite SNR, which is of
interest from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose a radically
novel nonlinear interference alignment technique, which we refer to as
Interference Dissolution (ID). ID allows to break-up a one-dimensional space
into two fractional dimensions while achieving near-capacity performance for
the entire SNR range. This is achieved by aligning signals by signals, as
opposed to aligning signals by the channel. We introduce ID by considering a
time-invariant MISO channel. This channel has a one-dimensional space and
offers one DoF. We show that, by breaking-up the one dimensional space into two
sub-spaces, ID achieves a rate of two symbols per channel use while providing
$\frac{1}{2}$ DoF for each symbol. We analyze the performance of the proposed
ID scheme in terms of the achievable rate and the symbol error rate. In
characterizing the achievable rate of ID for the entire SNR range, we prove
that, assuming Gaussian signals, the sum achievable rate is at most one bit
away from the capacity. We present numerical examples to validate the
theoretical analysis. We also compare the performance of ID in terms of the
achievable rate performance to that of existing schemes and demonstrate ID's
superiority.

 <dc:description>  Graph coloring has been broadly used to discover concurrency in parallel
computing. To speedup graph coloring for large-scale datasets, parallel
algorithms have been proposed to leverage modern GPUs. Existing GPU
implementations either have limited performance or yield unsatisfactory
coloring quality (too many colors assigned). We present a work-efficient
parallel graph coloring implementation on GPUs with good coloring quality. Our
approach employs the speculative greedy scheme which inherently yields better
quality than the method of finding maximal independent set. In order to achieve
high performance on GPUs, we refine the algorithm to leverage efficient
operators and alleviate conflicts. We also incorporate common optimization
techniques to further improve performance. Our method is evaluated with both
synthetic and real-world sparse graphs on the NVIDIA GPU. Experimental results
show that our proposed implementation achieves averaged 4.1x (up to 8.9x)
speedup over the serial implementation. It also outperforms the existing GPU
implementation from the NVIDIA CUSPARSE library (2.2x average speedup), while
yielding much better coloring quality than CUSPARSE.

 <dc:description>  We introduce LAMBADA, a dataset to evaluate the capabilities of computational
models for text understanding by means of a word prediction task. LAMBADA is a
collection of narrative passages sharing the characteristic that human subjects
are able to guess their last word if they are exposed to the whole passage, but
not if they only see the last sentence preceding the target word. To succeed on
LAMBADA, computational models cannot simply rely on local context, but must be
able to keep track of information in the broader discourse. We show that
LAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of
several state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this
novel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to
encourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of
broad context in natural language text.

 <dc:description>  Harvesting the gain of a large number of antennas in a mmWave band has mainly
been relying on the costly operation of channel state information (CSI)
acquisition and cumbersome phase shifters. Recent works have started to
investigate the possibility to use receivers based on energy detection (ED),
where a single data stream is decoded based on the channel and noise energy.
The asymptotic features of the massive receiver array lead to a system where
the impact of the noise becomes predictable due to a noise hardening effect.
This in effect extends the communication range compared to the receiver with a
small number of antennas, as the latter is limited by the unpredictability of
the additive noise. When the channel has a large number of spatial degrees of
freedom, the system becomes robust to imperfect channel knowledge due to
channel hardening. We propose two detection methods based on the instantaneous
and average channel energy, respectively. Meanwhile, we design the detection
thresholds based on the asymptotic properties of the received energy.
Differently from existing works, we analyze the scaling law behavior of the
symbol-error-rate (SER). When the instantaneous channel energy is known, the
performance of ED approaches that of the coherent detection in high SNR
scenarios. When the receiver relies on the average channel energy, our
performance analysis is based on the exact SER, rather than an approximation.
It is shown that the logarithm of SER decreases linearly as a function of the
number of antennas. Additionally, a saturation appears at high SNR for PAM
constellations of order larger than two, due to the uncertainty on the channel
energy. Simulation results show that ED, with a much lower complexity, achieves
promising performance both in Rayleigh fading channels and in sparse channels.

 <dc:title>Multilevel Evaluation of Multidimensional Integral Transforms with
  Asymptotically Smooth Kernels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In many practical applications of numerical methods a substantial increase in
efficiency can be obtained by using local grid refinement, since the solution
is generally smooth in large parts of the domain and large gradients occur only
locally. Fast evaluation of integral transforms on such an adaptive grid
requires an algorithm that relies on the smoothness of the continuum kernel
only, independent of its discrete form. A multilevel algorithm with this
property was presented in [A. Brandt and C.H. Venner, SIAM J. Sci. Stat.
Comput. 19 (1998) pp.468-492] [Bra1998]. Ref. [Bra1998] shows that already on a
uniform grid the new algorithm is more efficient than earlier fast evaluation
algorithms, and elaborates the application to one-dimensional transforms. The
present work analyses the extension and implementation of the algorithm for
multidimensional transforms. The analysis conveys that the multidimensional
extension is nontrivial, on account of the occurence of nonlocal corrections.
However, by virtue of the asymptotic smoothness properties of the continuum
kernel, these corrections can again be evaluated fast. By recursion, it is then
possible to obtain the optimal work estimates indicated in [Bra1998].
Currently, only uniform grids are considered. Detailed numerical results will
be presented for a two dimensional model problem. The results demonstrate that
with the new algorithm the evaluation of multidimensional transforms is also
more efficient than with previous algorithms.

 <dc:title>Embodied Approximation of the Density Classification Problem via
  Morphological Adaptation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jones, Jeff</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Majority (or Density Classification) Problem in Cellular Automata (CA)
aims to converge a string of cells to a final homogeneous state which reflects
the majority of states present in the initial configuration. The problem is
challenging in CA as individual cells only possess information about their own
and local neighbour states. The problem is an exercise in the propagation and
processing of information within a distributed computational medium. We explore
whether the Majority Problem can be approximated in a similarly simple
distributed computing substrate - a multi-agent model of slime mould. An
initial pattern of discrete voting choices is represented by spatial
arrangement of the agent population, temporarily held in-place by an attractant
stimulus. When this stimulus is removed the model adapts its shape and size,
moving to form a minimal distance connecting line. The final position of this
line is shown, in simple examples, to successfully represent the majority vote
decision, and also accurately reflects the size of the majority. We note
properties, limitations and potential improvements to the approach before
returning full-circle by re-encoding this morphological adaptation approach in
a simple (and more space efficient) 1D CA model.

 <dc:title>On Capacity of the Writing onto Fast Fading Dirt Channel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rini, Stefano</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shamai, Shlomo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The &quot;Writing onto Fast Fading Dirt&quot; (WFFD) channel is investigated to study
the effects of partial channel knowledge on the capacity of the &quot;writing on
dirty paper&quot; channel. The WFFD channel is the Gel'fand-Pinsker channel in which
the output is obtained as the sum of the input, white Gaussian noise and a
fading-times-state term. The fading-times-state term is equal to the
element-wise product of the channel state sequence, known only at the
transmitter, and a fast fading process, known only at the receiver. We consider
the case of Gaussian distributed channel states and derive an approximate
characterization of capacity for different classes of fading distributions,
both continuous and discrete. In particular, we prove that if the fading
distribution concentrates in a sufficiently small interval, then capacity is
approximately equal to the AWGN capacity times the probability of this
interval. We also show that there exists a class of fading distributions for
which having the transmitter treat the fading-times-state term as additional
noise closely approaches capacity. Although a closed-form expression of the
capacity of the general WFFD channel remains unknown, our results show that the
presence of fading can severely reduce the usefulness of channel state
knowledge at the transmitter.

 <dc:description>  The Random Mutation Hill-Climbing algorithm is a direct search technique
mostly used in discrete domains. It repeats the process of randomly selecting a
neighbour of a best-so-far solution and accepts the neighbour if it is better
than or equal to it. In this work, we propose to use a novel method to select
the neighbour solution using a set of independent multi- armed bandit-style
selection units which results in a bandit-based Random Mutation Hill-Climbing
algorithm. The new algorithm significantly outperforms Random Mutation
Hill-Climbing in both OneMax (in noise-free and noisy cases) and Royal Road
problems (in the noise-free case). The algorithm shows particular promise for
discrete optimisation problems where each fitness evaluation is expensive.

 <dc:description>  Cryptanalysis of knapsack cipher is a fascinating problem which has eluded
the computing fraternity for decades. However, in most of the cases either the
time complexity of the proposed algorithm is colossal or an insufficient number
of samples have been taken for verification. The present work proposes a
Genetic Algorithm based technique for cryptanalysis of knapsack cipher. The
experiments conducted prove the validity of the technique. The results prove
that the technique is better than the existing techniques. An extensive review
has been carried out in order to find the gaps in the existing techniques. The
work paves the way of the application of computational intelligence techniques
to the discipline of cryptanalysis.

 <dc:description>  For discrete-time linear systems subject to parametric uncertainty described
by random variables, we develop a sampling-based Stochastic Model Predictive
Control algorithm. Unlike earlier results employing a scenario approximation,
we propose an offline sampling approach in the design phase instead of online
scenario generation. The paper highlights the structural difference between
online and offline sampling and provides rigorous bounds on the number of
samples needed to guarantee chance constraint satisfaction. The approach does
not only significantly speed up the online computation, but furthermore allows
to suitably tighten the constraints to guarantee robust recursive feasibility
when bounds on the uncertain variables are provided. Under mild assumptions,
asymptotic stability of the origin can be established.

 <dc:description>  Acoustic models based on long short-term memory recurrent neural networks
(LSTM-RNNs) were applied to statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) and
showed significant improvements in naturalness and latency over those based on
hidden Markov models (HMMs). This paper describes further optimizations of
LSTM-RNN-based SPSS for deployment on mobile devices; weight quantization,
multi-frame inference, and robust inference using an {\epsilon}-contaminated
Gaussian loss function. Experimental results in subjective listening tests show
that these optimizations can make LSTM-RNN-based SPSS comparable to HMM-based
SPSS in runtime speed while maintaining naturalness. Evaluations between
LSTM-RNN- based SPSS and HMM-driven unit selection speech synthesis are also

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe a method to discover frequent behavioral patterns
in event logs. We express these patterns as \emph{local process models}. Local
process model mining can be positioned in-between process discovery and episode
/ sequential pattern mining. The technique presented in this paper is able to
learn behavioral patterns involving sequential composition, concurrency, choice
and loop, like in process mining. However, we do not look at start-to-end
models, which distinguishes our approach from process discovery and creates a
link to episode / sequential pattern mining. We propose an incremental
procedure for building local process models capturing frequent patterns based
on so-called process trees. We propose five quality dimensions and
corresponding metrics for local process models, given an event log. We show
monotonicity properties for some quality dimensions, enabling a speedup of
local process model discovery through pruning. We demonstrate through a real
life case study that mining local patterns allows us to get insights in
processes where regular start-to-end process discovery techniques are only able
to learn unstructured, flower-like, models.

 <dc:title>Relative Natural Gradient for Learning Large Complex Models</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Fisher information and natural gradient provided deep insights and powerful
tools to artificial neural networks. However related analysis becomes more and
more difficult as the learner's structure turns large and complex. This paper
makes a preliminary step towards a new direction. We extract a local component
of a large neuron system, and defines its relative Fisher information metric
that describes accurately this small component, and is invariant to the other
parts of the system. This concept is important because the geometry structure
is much simplified and it can be easily applied to guide the learning of neural
networks. We provide an analysis on a list of commonly used components, and
demonstrate how to use this concept to further improve optimization.

 <dc:description>  Users of web search engines are known to mostly focus on the top ranked
results of the search engine result page. While many studies support this well
known information seeking pattern only few studies concentrate on the question
what users are missing by neglecting lower ranked results. To learn more about
the relevance distributions in the so-called long tail we conducted a relevance
assessment study with the Million Short long-tail web search engine. While we
see a clear difference in the content between the head and the tail of the
search engine result list we see no statistical significant differences in the
binary relevance judgments and weak significant differences when using graded
relevance. The tail contains different but still valuable results. We argue
that the long tail can be a rich source for the diversification of web search
engine result lists but it needs more evaluation to clearly describe the
differences.

 <dc:description>  Product classification is the task of automatically predicting a taxonomy
path for a product in a predefined taxonomy hierarchy given a textual product
description or title. For efficient product classification we require a
suitable representation for a document (the textual description of a product)
feature vector and efficient and fast algorithms for prediction. To address the
above challenges, we propose a new distributional semantics representation for
document vector formation. We also develop a new two-level ensemble approach
utilizing (with respect to the taxonomy tree) a path-wise, node-wise and
depth-wise classifiers for error reduction in the final product classification.
Our experiments show the effectiveness of the distributional representation and
the ensemble approach on data sets from a leading e-commerce platform and
achieve better results on various evaluation metrics compared to earlier
approaches.

 <dc:description>  Word embedding, specially with its recent developments, promises a
quantification of the similarity between terms. However, it is not clear to
which extent this similarity value can be genuinely meaningful and useful for
subsequent tasks. We explore how the similarity score obtained from the models
is really indicative of term relatedness. We first observe and quantify the
uncertainty factor of the word embedding models regarding to the similarity
value. Based on this factor, we introduce a general threshold on various
dimensions which effectively filters the highly related terms. Our evaluation
on four information retrieval collections supports the effectiveness of our
approach as the results of the introduced threshold are significantly better
than the baseline while being equal to or statistically indistinguishable from
the optimal results.

 <dc:description>  In this article, the design of secure lattice coset codes for general
wireless channels with fading and Gaussian noise is studied. Recalling the
eavesdropper's probability and information bounds, a variant of the latter is
given from which it is explicitly seen that both quantities are upper bounded
by (increasing functions of) the expected flatness factor of the faded lattice
related to the eavesdropper.
  By making use of a recently developed approximation of the theta series of a
lattice, it is further shown how the average flatness factor can be
approximated numerically. In particular, based on the numerical computations,
the average flatness factor not only bounds but also orders correctly the
performance of different lattices.

 <dc:description>  A key challenge in developing engaging social robots is creating convincing,
autonomous and responsive agents, which users perceive, and treat, as social
beings. As a part of the collaborative project: Expressive Agents for Symbiotic
Education and Learning (EASEL), this study examines the impact of autonomous
response to children's speech, by the humanoid robot Zeno, on their
interactions with it as a social entity. Results indicate that robot autonomy
and adult assistance during HRI can substantially influence children's
behaviour during interaction and their affect after. Children working with a
fully-autonomous, responsive robot demonstrated greater physical activity
following robot instruction than those working with a less responsive robot,
which required adult assistance to interact with. During dialogue with the
robot, children working with the fully-autonomous robot also looked towards the
robot in anticipation of its vocalisations on more occasions. In contrast, a
less responsive robot, requiring adult assistance to interact with, led to
greater self-report positive affect and more occasions of children looking to
the robot in response to its vocalisations. We discuss the broader implications
of these findings in terms of anthropomorphism of social robots and in relation
to the overall project strategy to further the understanding of how
interactions with social robots could lead to task-appropriate symbiotic
relationships.

 <dc:description>  Visual question answering (VQA) task not only bridges the gap between images
and language, but also requires that specific contents within the image are
understood as indicated by linguistic context of the question, in order to
generate the accurate answers. Thus, it is critical to build an efficient
embedding of images and texts. We implement DualNet, which fully takes
advantage of discriminative power of both image and textual features by
separately performing two operations. Building an ensemble of DualNet further
boosts the performance. Contrary to common belief, our method proved effective
in both real images and abstract scenes, in spite of significantly different
properties of respective domain. Our method was able to outperform previous
state-of-the-art methods in real images category even without explicitly
employing attention mechanism, and also outperformed our own state-of-the-art
method in abstract scenes category, which recently won the first place in VQA
Challenge 2016.

 <dc:description>  We have investigated the product life-cycles of almost 17 000 hit singles
performed on the 12 biggest national phonographic markets in Europe including:
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We have considered weekly singles
charts from the last 50 years (1966-2015) in each country. We analyze the
spread of hit singles popularity (chart topping) as an epidemiological process
performed on various European countries. Popular hit singles are contagious
from one country to another. Thus, we consider time delays between the initial
hit single release and reaching the highest position on consecutive national
singles charts. We create directed network of countries representing
transitions of hit singles popularity between countries. It is obtained by
simulating the most likely paths and picking up the most frequent links. A
country of initial hit single release is considered as a source of infection.
Our algorithm builds up spanning trees by attaching new nodes. The probability
of attachment depends on:
  1) new nodes immunity
  2) infectivity of previous nodes from the tree. Thus we obtain network of
popularity spread with a hub the UK, a bridge the Netherlands and outliers
Italy and Spain. We have found a characteristic topology of hit singles
popularity spread. The positive correlation between this network and geographic
or cultural grid-map of Europe is also observed. However, the network of
popularity spread has some typical properties of complex networks.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning algorithms are optimized to model statistical properties of
the training data. If the input data reflects stereotypes and biases of the
broader society, then the output of the learning algorithm also captures these
stereotypes. In this paper, we initiate the study of gender stereotypes in {\em
word embedding}, a popular framework to represent text data. As their use
becomes increasingly common, applications can inadvertently amplify unwanted
stereotypes. We show across multiple datasets that the embeddings contain
significant gender stereotypes, especially with regard to professions. We
created a novel gender analogy task and combined it with crowdsourcing to
systematically quantify the gender bias in a given embedding. We developed an
efficient algorithm that reduces gender stereotype using just a handful of
training examples while preserving the useful geometric properties of the
embedding. We evaluated our algorithm on several metrics. While we focus on
male/female stereotypes, our framework may be applicable to other types of
embedding biases.

 <dc:title>A Boltzmann Machine Implementation for the D-Wave</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dorband, John E.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The D-Wave is an adiabatic quantum computer. It is an understatement to say
that it is not a traditional computer. It can be viewed as a computational
accelerator or more precisely a computational oracle, where one asks it a
relevant question and it returns a useful answer. The question is how do you
ask a relevant question and how do you use the answer it returns. This paper
addresses these issues in a way that is pertinent to machine learning. A
Boltzmann machine is implemented with the D-Wave since the D-Wave is merely a
hardware instantiation of a partially connected Boltzmann machine. This paper
presents a prototype implementation of a 3-layered neural network where the
D-Wave is used as the middle (hidden) layer of the neural network. This paper
also explains how the D-Wave can be utilized in a multi-layer neural network
(more than 3 layers) and one in which each layer may be multiple times the size
of the D-Wave being used.

 <dc:description>  In compositional model-theoretic semantics, researchers assemble
truth-conditions or other kinds of denotations using the lambda calculus. It
was previously observed that the lambda terms and/or the denotations studied
tend to follow the same pattern: they are instances of a monad. In this paper,
we present an extension of the simply-typed lambda calculus that exploits this
uniformity using the recently discovered technique of effect handlers. We prove
that our calculus exhibits some of the key formal properties of the lambda
calculus and we use it to construct a modular semantics for a small fragment
that involves multiple distinct semantic phenomena.

 <dc:description>  For an autonomous agent, executing a poor policy may be costly or even
dangerous. For such agents, it is desirable to determine confidence interval
lower bounds on the performance of any given policy without executing said
policy. Current methods for exact high confidence off-policy evaluation that
use importance sampling require a substantial amount of data to achieve a tight
lower bound. Existing model-based methods only address the problem in discrete
state spaces. Since exact bounds are intractable for many domains we trade off
strict guarantees of safety for more data-efficient approximate bounds. In this
context, we propose two bootstrapping off-policy evaluation methods which use
learned MDP transition models in order to estimate lower confidence bounds on
policy performance with limited data in both continuous and discrete state
spaces. Since direct use of a model may introduce bias, we derive a theoretical
upper bound on model bias for when the model transition function is estimated
with i.i.d. trajectories. This bound broadens our understanding of the
conditions under which model-based methods have high bias. Finally, we
empirically evaluate our proposed methods and analyze the settings in which
different bootstrapping off-policy confidence interval methods succeed and
fail.

 <dc:description>  The size of nuclei in histological preparations from excised breast tumors is
predictive of patient outcome (large nuclei indicate poor outcome).
Pathologists take into account nuclear size when performing breast cancer
grading. In addition, the mean nuclear area (MNA) has been shown to have
independent prognostic value. The straightforward approach to measuring nuclear
size is by performing nuclei segmentation. We hypothesize that given an image
of a tumor region with known nuclei locations, the area of the individual
nuclei and region statistics such as the MNA can be reliably computed directly
from the image data by employing a machine learning model, without the
intermediate step of nuclei segmentation. Towards this goal, we train a deep
convolutional neural network model that is applied locally at each nucleus
location, and can reliably measure the area of the individual nuclei and the
MNA. Furthermore, we show how such an approach can be extended to perform
combined nuclei detection and measurement, which is reminiscent of
granulometry.

 <dc:description>  DIANE is a digital assistant system that aims to fasten the doctor access to
various informations at the hospital such as health care facility, medical
records, and also human resource data. The fasten access could be achieved by
implementing face recognition and live streaming as part of the digital
assistant system. By using face recognition, DIANE can identify patient's
identity. Moreover, DIANE could know patient's biodata and also patient's
medical records. Live streaming in DIANE enables doctor to communicate with
other doctors in different place. Through the increasing speed of doctor to
access the various informations at the hospital, it is expected that doctor can
make decisions more quickly. As a result, more and more patients can be treated
by the doctor properly.

  DIANE merupakan sebuah sistem digital assistant yang bertujuan untuk
mempercepat akses staf medik fungsional sebagai seorang profesional dengan
waktu terbatas terhadap informasi seperti layanan kesehatan, rekam medis, dan
personalia pada SIRS tingkat rumah sakit. Percepatan akses terhadap informasi
tersebut diwujudkan melalui penggunaan fitur face recognition dan live
streaming. Dengan menggunakan face recognition, DIANE dapat mengidentifikasi
pasien sehingga dapat memberikan tampilan data berupa biodata dan rekam medis
pasien. Sedangkan menggunakan live streaming pada DIANE, seorang staf medik
fungsional dapat berkomunikasi dengan staf medik fungsional di tempat lain.
Dengan peningkatan kecepatan akses terhadap beragam informasi tersebut
diharapkan seorang staf medik fungsional dapat mengambil keputusan dengan lebih
cepat. Akibatnya, semakin banyak pasien yang dapat ditangani oleh staf medik
fungsional dengan baik.

 <dc:description>  The cost of energy is becoming an increasingly important driver for the
operating cost of HPC systems, adding yet another facet to the challenge of
producing efficient code. In this paper, we investigate the energy implications
of trading computation for locality using Hilbert and Morton space-filling
curves with dense matrix-matrix multiplication. The advantage of these curves
is that they exhibit an inherent tiling effect without requiring specific
architecture tuning. By accessing the matrices in the order determined by the
space-filling curves, we can trade computation for locality. The index
computation overhead of the Morton curve is found to be balanced against its
locality and energy efficiency, while the overhead of the Hilbert curve
outweighs its improvements on our test system.

 <dc:description>  Several important tasks in medical image analysis can be stated in the form
of an optimization problem whose feasible solutions are connected subgraphs.
Examples include the reconstruction of neural or vascular structures under
connectedness constraints. We discuss the minimum cost connected subgraph
(MCCS) problem and its approximations from the perspective of medical
applications. We propose a) objective-dependent constraints and b) novel
constraint generation schemes to solve this optimization problem exactly by
means of a branch-and-cut algorithm. These are shown to improve scalability and
allow us to solve instances of two medical benchmark datasets to optimality for
the first time. This enables us to perform a quantitative comparison between
exact and approximative algorithms, where we identify the geodesic tree
algorithm as an excellent alternative to exact inference on the examined
datasets.

 <dc:description>  We describe a method for proactive information retrieval targeted at
retrieving relevant information during a writing task. In our method, the
current task and the needs of the user are estimated, and the potential next
steps are unobtrusively predicted based on the user's past actions. We focus on
the task of writing, in which the user is coalescing previously collected
information into a text. Our proactive system automatically recommends the user
relevant background information. The proposed system incorporates text input
prediction using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We present
simulations, which show that the system is able to reach higher precision
values in an exploratory search setting compared to both a baseline and a
comparison system.

 <dc:description>  At a time when information seekers first turn to digital sources for news and
opinion, it is critical that we understand the role that social media plays in
human behavior. This is especially true when information consumers also act as
information producers and editors through their online activity. In order to
better understand the effects that editorial ratings have on online human
behavior, we report the results of a two large-scale in-vivo experiments in
social media. We find that small, random rating manipulations on social media
posts and comments created significant changes in downstream ratings resulting
in significantly different final outcomes. We found positive herding effects
for positive treatments on posts, increasing the final rating by 11.02% on
average, but not for positive treatments on comments. Contrary to the results
of related work, we found negative herding effects for negative treatments on
posts and comments, decreasing the final ratings on average, of posts by 5.15%
and of comments by 37.4%. Compared to the control group, the probability of
reaching a high rating (&gt;=2000) for posts is increased by 24.6% when posts
receive the positive treatment and for comments is decreased by 46.6% when
comments receive the negative treatment.

 <dc:description>  The tagging of on-line content with informative keywords is a widespread
phenomenon from scientific article repositories through blogs to on-line news
portals. In most of the cases, the tags on a given item are free words chosen
by the authors independently. Therefore, relations among keywords in a
collection of news items is unknown. However, in most cases the topics and
concepts described by these keywords are forming a latent hierarchy, with the
more general topics and categories at the top, and more specialised ones at the
bottom. Here we apply a recent, cooccurrence-based tag hierarchy extraction
method to sets of keywords obtained from four different on-line news portals.
The resulting hierarchies show substantial differences not just in the topics
rendered as important (being at the top of the hierarchy) or of less interest
(categorised low in the hierarchy), but also in the underlying network
structure. This reveals discrepancies between the plausible keyword association
frameworks in the studied news portals.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the computation of second or higher order greeks of
financial securities. It combines two methods, Vibrato and automatic
differentiation and compares with other methods. We show that this combined
technique is faster than standard finite difference, more stable than automatic
differentiation of second order derivatives and more general than Malliavin
Calculus. We present a generic framework to compute any greeks and present
several applications on different types of financial contracts: European and
American options, multidimensional Basket Call and stochastic volatility models
such as Heston's model. We give also an algorithm to compute derivatives for
the Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo method for American options. We also extend
automatic differentiation for second order derivatives of options with
non-twice differentiable payoff. 1. Introduction. Due to BASEL III regulations,
banks are requested to evaluate the sensitivities of their portfolios every day
(risk assessment). Some of these portfolios are huge and sensitivities are time
consuming to compute accurately. Faced with the problem of building a software
for this task and distrusting automatic differentiation for non-differentiable
functions, we turned to an idea developed by Mike Giles called Vibrato. Vibrato
at core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and
pathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time,
stability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of
the full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second
derivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite
difference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its
precision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the
increment. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty
and its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in
finance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives
have to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the
precision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
feasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare
Vibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show
that it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise
for second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato. In [8], Capriotti
has recently investigated the coupling of different mathematical methods --
namely pathwise and likelihood ratio methods -- with an Automatic differ

 <dc:description>  We derive closed-form expressions for the poles and zeros of approximate
fractional integrator/differentiator filters, which correspond to spectral
roll-off filters having any desired log-log slope to a controllable degree of
accuracy over any bandwidth. The filters can be described as a uniform
exponential distribution of poles along the negative-real axis of the s plane,
with zeros interleaving them. Arbitrary spectral slopes are obtained by sliding
the array of zeros relative to the array of poles, where each array maintains
periodic spacing on a log scale. The nature of the slope approximation is close
to Chebyshev optimal in the interior of the pole-zero array, approaching
conjectured Chebyshev optimality over all frequencies in the limit as the order
approaches infinity. Practical designs can arbitrarily approach the
equal-ripple approximation by enlarging the pole-zero array band beyond the
desired frequency band. The spectral roll-off slope can be robustly modulated
in real time by varying only the zeros controlled by one slope parameter.
Software implementations are provided in matlab and Faust.

 <dc:description>  The emerging domain of data-enabled science necessitates development of
algorithms and tools for knowledge discovery. Human interaction with data
through well-constructed graphical representation can take special advantage of
our visual ability to identify patterns. We develop a data visualization
framework, called BiFold, for exploratory analysis of bipartite datasets that
describe binary relationships between groups of objects. Typical data examples
would include voting records, organizational memberships, and pairwise
associations, or other binary datasets. BiFold provides a low dimensional
embedding of data that represents similarity by visual nearness, analogous to
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). The unique and new feature of BiFold is its
ability to simultaneously capture both within-group and between-group
relationships among objects, enhancing knowledge discovery. We benchmark BiFold
using the {\it Southern Women Dataset}, where social groups are now visually
evident. We construct BiFold plots for two US voting datasets: For the
presidential election outcomes since 1976, BiFold illustrates the evolving
geopolitical structures that underlie these election results. For Senate
congressional voting, BiFold identifies a partisan coordinate, separating
senators into two parties while simultaneously visualizing a
bipartisan-coalition coordinate which captures the ultimate fate of the bills
(pass/fail). Finally, we consider a global cuisine dataset of the association
between recipes and food ingredients. BiFold allows us to visually compare and
contrast cuisines while also allowing identification of signature ingredients
of individual cuisines.

 <dc:description>  We propose DoReFa-Net, a method to train convolutional neural networks that
have low bitwidth weights and activations using low bitwidth parameter
gradients. In particular, during backward pass, parameter gradients are
stochastically quantized to low bitwidth numbers before being propagated to
convolutional layers. As convolutions during forward/backward passes can now
operate on low bitwidth weights and activations/gradients respectively,
DoReFa-Net can use bit convolution kernels to accelerate both training and
inference. Moreover, as bit convolutions can be efficiently implemented on CPU,
FPGA, ASIC and GPU, DoReFa-Net opens the way to accelerate training of low
bitwidth neural network on these hardware. Our experiments on SVHN and ImageNet
datasets prove that DoReFa-Net can achieve comparable prediction accuracy as
32-bit counterparts. For example, a DoReFa-Net derived from AlexNet that has
1-bit weights, 2-bit activations, can be trained from scratch using 6-bit
gradients to get 46.1\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet validation set. The
DoReFa-Net AlexNet model is released publicly.

As a pilot experiment, we used our categorization to manually annotate

 <dc:title>A constant-time algorithm for middle levels Gray codes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For any integer $n\geq 1$ a middle levels Gray code is a cyclic listing of
all $n$-element and $(n+1)$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,2n+1\}$ such that
any two consecutive subsets differ in adding or removing a single element. The
question whether such a Gray code exists for any $n\geq 1$ has been the subject
of intensive research during the last 30 years, and has been answered
affirmatively only recently [T. M\&quot;utze. Proof of the middle levels conjecture.
Proc. London Math. Soc., 112(4):677--713, 2016]. In a follow-up paper [T.
M\&quot;utze and J. Nummenpalo. An efficient algorithm for computing a middle levels
Gray code. Proc. ESA, 2015] this existence proof was turned into an algorithm
that computes each new set in the Gray code in time $\mathcal{O}(n)$ on
average. In this work we complete this line of research by presenting an
algorithm for computing a middle levels Gray code in optimal time and space:
Each new set is generated in time $\mathcal{O}(1)$, and the required space is
$\mathcal{O}(n)$.

growth. But what are the factors that make a country innovative? How do they
differ across different parts of the world and different stages of development?
In this work done in collaboration with the World Economic Forum (WEF), we
analyze the scores obtained through executive opinion surveys that constitute
the WEF's Global Competitiveness Index in conjunction with other country-level
metrics and indicators to identify actionable levers of innovation. The
findings can help country leaders and organizations shape the policies to drive

 <dc:description>  Many modern datacenter applications involve large-scale computations composed
of multiple data flows that need to be completed over a shared set of
distributed resources. Such a computation completes when all of its flows
complete. A useful abstraction for modeling such scenarios is a {\em coflow},
which is a collection of flows (e.g., tasks, packets, data transmissions) that
all share the same performance goal.
  In this paper, we present the first approximation algorithms for scheduling
coflows over general network topologies with the objective of minimizing total
weighted completion time. We consider two different models for coflows based on
the nature of individual flows: circuits, and packets. We design
constant-factor polynomial-time approximation algorithms for scheduling
packet-based coflows with or without given flow paths, and circuit-based
coflows with given flow paths. Furthermore, we give an $O(\log n/\log \log
n)$-approximation polynomial time algorithm for scheduling circuit-based
coflows where flow paths are not given (here $n$ is the number of network
edges).
  We obtain our results by developing a general framework for coflow schedules,
based on interval-indexed linear programs, which may extend to other coflow
models and objective functions and may also yield improved approximation bounds
for specific network scenarios. We also present an experimental evaluation of
our approach for circuit-based coflows that show a performance improvement of
at least 22% on average over competing heuristics.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses a question about music cognition: how do we derive
polymetric structures. A preference rule system is presented which is
implemented into a drum computer. The preference rule system allows inferring
local polymetric structures, like two-over-three and three-over-two. By
analyzing the micro-timing of West African percussion music a timing pattern
consisting of six pulses was discovered. It integrates binary and ternary
rhythmic feels. The presented drum computer integrates the discovered
superimposed polymetric swing (timing and velocity) appropriate to the rhythmic
sequence the user inputs. For binary sequences, the amount of binary swing is
increased and for ternary sequences, the ternary swing is increased.

 <dc:title>Parallel Priority-Flood Depression Filling For Trillion Cell Digital
  Elevation Models On Desktops Or Clusters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Barnes, Richard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Algorithms for extracting hydrologic features and properties from digital
elevation models (DEMs) are challenged by large datasets, which often cannot
fit within a computer's RAM. Depression filling is an important preconditioning
step to many of these algorithms. Here, I present a new, linearly-scaling
algorithm which parallelizes the Priority-Flood depression-filling algorithm by
subdividing a DEM into tiles. Using a single-producer, multi-consumer design,
the new algorithm works equally well on one core, multiple cores, or multiple
machines and can take advantage of large memories or cope with small ones.
Unlike previous algorithms, the new algorithm guarantees a fixed number of
memory access and communication events per subdivision of the DEM. In
comparison testing, this results in the new algorithm running generally faster
while using fewer resources than previous algorithms. For moderately sized
tiles, the algorithm exhibits ~60% strong and weak scaling efficiencies up to
48 cores, and linear time scaling across datasets ranging over three orders of
magnitude. The largest dataset on which I run the algorithm has 2 trillion
(2*10^12) cells. With 48 cores, processing required 4.8 hours wall-time (9.3
compute-days). This test is three orders of magnitude larger than any
previously performed in the literature. Complete, well-commented source code
and correctness tests are available for download from a repository.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a framework for output tracking control of both
minimum phase (MP) and non-minimum phase (NMP) systems {as well as systems with
transmission zeros on the unit circle}. Towards this end, we first address the
problem of unknown state and input reconstruction of non-minimum phase systems.
An unknown input observer (UIO) is designed that accurately reconstructs the
minimum phase states of the system. The reconstructed minimum phase states
serve as inputs to an FIR filter for a delayed non-minimum phase state
reconstruction. It is shown that a quantified upper bound of the reconstruction
error exponentially decreases as the estimation delay is increased. Therefore,
an almost perfect reconstruction can be achieved by selecting the delay to be
sufficiently large. Our proposed inversion scheme is then applied to solve the
output-tracking control problem. {We have also proposed a methodology to handle
the output tracking problem of systems that have transmission zeros on the unit
circle in addition to MP and NMP zeros.} Simulation case studies are also
presented that demonstrate the merits and capabilities of our proposed
methodologies.

 <dc:title>Neural networks with differentiable structure</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Miconi, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  While gradient descent has proven highly successful in learning connection
weights for neural networks, the actual structure of these networks is usually
determined by hand, or by other optimization algorithms. Here we describe a
simple method to make network structure differentiable, and therefore
accessible to gradient descent. We test this method on recurrent neural
networks applied to simple sequence prediction problems. Starting with initial
networks containing only one node, the method automatically builds networks
that successfully solve the tasks. The number of nodes in the final network
correlates with task difficulty. The method can dynamically increase network
size in response to an abrupt complexification in the task; however, reduction
in network size in response to task simplification is not evident for
reasonable meta-parameters. The method does not penalize network performance
for these test tasks: variable-size networks actually reach better performance
than fixed-size networks of higher, lower or identical size. We conclude by
discussing how this method could be applied to more complex networks, such as
feedforward layered networks, or multiple-area networks of arbitrary shape.

 <dc:title>A Data-driven Approach to Actuator and Sensor Fault Detection, Isolation

 <dc:creator>Naderi, Esmaeil</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Khorasani, Khashayar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose explicit state-space based fault detection,
isolation and estimation filters that are data-driven and are directly
identified and constructed from only the system input-output (I/O) measurements
and through estimating the system Markov parameters. The proposed methodology
does not involve a reduction step and does not require identification of the
system extended observability matrix or its left null space. The performance of
our proposed filters is directly connected to and linearly dependent on the
errors in the Markov parameters identification process. The estimation filters
operate with a subset of the system I/O data that is selected by the designer.
It is shown that the proposed filters provide asymptotically unbiased estimates
by invoking low order filters as long as the selected subsystem has a stable
inverse. We have derived the estimation error dynamics in terms of the Markov
parameters identification errors and have shown that they can be directly
synthesized from the healthy system I/O data. Consequently, the estimation
errors can be effectively compensated for. Finally, we have provided several
illustrative case study simulations that demonstrate and confirm the merits of
our proposed schemes as compared to methodologies that are available in the
literature.

 <dc:description>  The research community has considered in the past the application of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to control and operate networks. A
notable example is the Knowledge Plane proposed by D.Clark et al. However, such
techniques have not been extensively prototyped or deployed in the field yet.
In this paper, we explore the reasons for the lack of adoption and posit that
the rise of two recent paradigms: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network
Analytics (NA), will facilitate the adoption of AI techniques in the context of
network operation and control. We describe a new paradigm that accommodates and
exploits SDN, NA and AI, and provide use cases that illustrate its
applicability and benefits. We also present simple experimental results that
support its feasibility. We refer to this new paradigm as Knowledge-Defined
Networking (KDN).

 <dc:title>Enriched K-Tier HetNet Model to Enable the Analysis of User-Centric

 <dc:description>  One of the principal underlying assumptions of current approaches to the
analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) with random spatial
models is the uniform distribution of users independent of the base station
(BS) locations. This assumption is not quite accurate, especially for
user-centric capacity-driven small cell deployments where low-power BSs are
deployed in the areas of high user density, thus inducing a natural correlation
in the BS and user locations. In order to capture this correlation, we enrich
the existing K-tier Poisson Point Process (PPP) HetNet model by considering
user locations as Poisson Cluster Process (PCP) with the BSs at the cluster
centers. In particular, we provide the formal analysis of the downlink coverage
probability in terms of a general density functions describing the locations of
users around the BSs. The derived results are specialized for two cases of
interest: (i) Thomas cluster process, where the locations of the users around
BSs are Gaussian distributed, and (ii) Mat\'ern cluster process, where the
users are uniformly distributed inside a disc of a given radius. Tight
closed-form bounds for the coverage probability in these two cases are also
derived. Our results demonstrate that the coverage probability decreases as the
size of user clusters around BSs increases, ultimately collapsing to the result
obtained under the assumption of PPP distribution of users independent of the
BS locations when the cluster size goes to infinity. Using these results, we
also handle mixed user distributions consisting of two types of users: (i)
uniformly distributed, and (ii) clustered around certain tiers.

 <dc:title>Unbiased Inversion-Based Fault Estimation of Systems with Non-Minimum

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for inversion-based estimation of certain categories
of faults in discrete-time linear systems. First, we develop a novel
methodology for direct estimation of unknown inputs by using only measurements
of either minimum or non-minimum phase systems as well as systems with
transmission zeros on the unit circle. The unknown input is reconstructed from
its projections onto two subspaces. One projection is achieved through an
algebraic operation, whereas the other is given by a dynamic filter whose poles
coincide with the transmission zeros of the system. A feedback is then
introduced to stabilize the above filter dynamics as well as provide an
unbiased estimation of the unknown input. Next, we have applied our proposed
methodology to the problem of fault estimation and have shown that the proposed
inversion filter is unbiased for certain categories of faults. Finally, we have
illustrated the performance of our proposed methodologies through numerous
simulation studies to demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of the
developed strategies.

 <dc:description>  Designing and implementing efficient, provably correct parallel neural
network processing is challenging. Existing high-level parallel abstractions
like MapReduce are insufficiently expressive while low-level tools like MPI and
Pthreads leave ML experts repeatedly solving the same design challenges.
However, the diversity and large-scale data size have posed a significant
challenge to construct a flexible and high-performance implementation of deep
learning neural networks. To improve the performance and maintain the
scalability, we present CNNLab, a novel deep learning framework using GPU and
FPGA-based accelerators. CNNLab provides a uniform programming model to users
so that the hardware implementation and the scheduling are invisible to the
programmers. At runtime, CNNLab leverages the trade-offs between GPU and FPGA
before offloading the tasks to the accelerators. Experimental results on the
state-of-the-art Nvidia K40 GPU and Altera DE5 FPGA board demonstrate that the
CNNLab can provide a universal framework with efficient support for diverse
applications without increasing the burden of the programmers. Moreover, we
analyze the detailed quantitative performance, throughput, power, energy, and
performance density for both approaches. Experimental results leverage the
trade-offs between GPU and FPGA and provide useful practical experiences for
the deep learning research community.

 <dc:description>  We develop new methods based on graph motifs for graph clustering, allowing
more efficient detection of communities within networks. We focus on triangles
within graphs, but our techniques extend to other clique motifs as well. Our
intuition, which has been suggested but not formalized similarly in previous
works, is that triangles are a better signature of community than edges. We
therefore generalize the notion of conductance for a graph to {\em triangle
conductance}, where the edges are weighted according to the number of triangles
containing the edge. This methodology allows us to develop variations of
several existing clustering techniques, including spectral clustering, that
minimize triangles split by the cluster instead of edges cut by the cluster. We
provide theoretical results in a planted partition model to demonstrate the
potential for triangle conductance in clustering problems. We then show
experimentally the effectiveness of our methods to multiple applications in
machine learning and graph mining.

 <dc:description>  We show that learning algorithms satisfying a $\textit{low approximate
regret}$ property experience fast convergence to approximate optimality in a
large class of repeated games. Our property, which simply requires that each
learner has small regret compared to a $(1+\epsilon)$-multiplicative
approximation to the best action in hindsight, is ubiquitous among learning
algorithms; it is satisfied even by the vanilla Hedge forecaster. Our results
improve upon recent work of Syrgkanis et al. [SALS15] in a number of ways. We
require only that players observe payoffs under other players' realized
actions, as opposed to expected payoffs. We further show that convergence
occurs with high probability, and show convergence under bandit feedback.
Finally, we improve upon the speed of convergence by a factor of $n$, the
number of players. Both the scope of settings and the class of algorithms for
which our analysis provides fast convergence are considerably broader than in
previous work.
  Our framework applies to dynamic population games via a low approximate
regret property for shifting experts. Here we strengthen the results of
Lykouris et al. [LST16] in two ways: We allow players to select learning
algorithms from a larger class, which includes a minor variant of the basic
Hedge algorithm, and we increase the maximum churn in players for which
approximate optimality is achieved.
  In the bandit setting we present a new algorithm which provides a &quot;small
loss&quot;-type bound with improved dependence on the number of actions in utility
settings, and is both simple and efficient. This result may be of independent
interest.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we empirically explore the question: how can we assess the
quality of samples from some target distribution? We assume that the samples
are provided by some valid Monte Carlo procedure, so we are guaranteed that the
collection of samples will asymptotically approximate the true distribution.
Most current evaluation approaches focus on two questions: (1) Has the chain
mixed, that is, is it sampling from the distribution? and (2) How independent
are the samples (as MCMC procedures produce correlated samples)? Focusing on
the case of Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization, we empirically evaluate
standard metrics of sampler quality as well as propose new metrics to capture
aspects that these measures fail to expose. The aspect of sampling that is of
particular interest to us is the ability (or inability) of sampling methods to
move between multiple optima in NMF problems. As a proxy, we propose and study
a number of metrics that might quantify the diversity of a set of NMF
factorizations obtained by a sampler through quantifying the coverage of the
posterior distribution. We compare the performance of a number of standard
sampling methods for NMF in terms of these new metrics.

 <dc:description>  Distributed spectrum access (DSA) is challenging since an individual
secondary user often has limited sensing capabilities only. One key insight is
that channel recommendation among secondary users can help to take advantage of
the inherent correlation structure of spectrum availability in both time and
space, and enable users to obtain more informed spectrum opportunities. With
this insight, we advocate to leverage the wisdom of crowds, and devise social
recommendation aided DSA mechanisms to orient secondary users to make more
intelligent spectrum access decisions, for both strong and weak network
information cases. We start with the strong network information case where
secondary users have the statistical information. To mitigate the difficulty
due to the curse of dimensionality in the stochastic game approach, we take the
one-step Nash approach and cast the social recommendation aided DSA decision
making problem at each time slot as a strategic game. We show that it is a
potential game, and then devise an algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium by
exploiting its finite improvement property. For the weak information case where
secondary users do not have the statistical information, we develop a
distributed reinforcement learning mechanism for social recommendation aided
DSA based on the local observations of secondary users only. Appealing to the
maximum-norm contraction mapping, we also derive the conditions under which the
distributed mechanism converges and characterize the equilibrium therein.
Numerical results reveal that the proposed social recommendation aided DSA
mechanisms can achieve superior performance using real social data traces and
its performance loss in the weak network information case is insignificant,
compared with the strong network information case.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a method to reconstruct the 3D structure of generic
convex rooms from sound signals. Differently from most of the previous
approaches, the method is fully uncalibrated in the sense that no knowledge
about the microphones and sources position is needed. Moreover, we demonstrate
that it is possible to bypass the well known echo labeling problem, allowing to
reconstruct the room shape in a reasonable computation time without the need of
additional hypotheses on the echoes order of arrival. Finally, the method is
intrinsically robust to outliers and missing data in the echoes detection,
allowing to work also in low SNR conditions. The proposed pipeline formalises
the problem in different steps such as time of arrival estimation, microphones
and sources localization and walls estimation. After providing a solution to
these different problems we present a global optimization approach that links
together all the problems in a single optimization function. The accuracy and
robustness of the method is assessed on a wide set of simulated setups and in a
challenging real scenario. Moreover we make freely available for a challenging
dataset for 3D room reconstruction with accurate ground truth in a real
scenario.

sharing websites every day. Studying sentiment and subjectivity in these
opinion videos is experiencing a growing attention from academia and industry.
While sentiment analysis has been successful for text, it is an understudied
research question for videos and multimedia content. The biggest setbacks for
studies in this direction are lack of a proper dataset, methodology, baselines
and statistical analysis of how information from different modality sources
relate to each other. This paper introduces to the scientific community the
first opinion-level annotated corpus of sentiment and subjectivity analysis in
online videos called Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity dataset
(MOSI). The dataset is rigorously annotated with labels for subjectivity,
sentiment intensity, per-frame and per-opinion annotated visual features, and
per-milliseconds annotated audio features. Furthermore, we present baselines
for future studies in this direction as well as a new multimodal fusion
approach that jointly models spoken words and visual gestures.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in AI and robotics have claimed many incredible results with
deep learning, yet no work to date has applied deep learning to the problem of
liquid perception and reasoning. In this paper, we apply fully-convolutional
deep neural networks to the tasks of detecting and tracking liquids. We
evaluate three models: a single-frame network, multi-frame network, and a LSTM
recurrent network. Our results show that the best liquid detection results are
achieved when aggregating data over multiple frames, in contrast to standard
image segmentation. They also show that the LSTM network outperforms the other
two in both tasks. This suggests that LSTM-based neural networks have the
potential to be a key component for enabling robots to handle liquids using
robust, closed-loop controllers.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a simple new semantics for logic rules, founded
semantics, and its straightforward extension to another simple new semantics,
constraint semantics. The new semantics support unrestricted negation, as well
as unrestricted existential and universal quantifications. They are uniquely
expressive and intuitive by allowing assumptions about the predicates and rules
to be specified explicitly. They are completely declarative and easy to
understand and relate cleanly to prior semantics. In addition, founded
semantics can be computed in linear time in the size of the ground program.

 <dc:description>  Pursuit-evasion scenarios appear widely in robotics, security domains, and
many other real-world situations. We focus on two-player pursuit-evasion games
with concurrent moves, infinite horizon, and discounted rewards. We assume that
the players have a partial observability, however, the evader is given an
advantage of knowing the current position of the units of the pursuer. This
setting is particularly interesting for security domains where a robust
strategy, designed to maximize the utility in the worst-case scenario, is often
desirable. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithm that
provably converges to the value of a partially observable pursuit-evasion game
with infinite horizon. Our algorithm extends well-known value iteration
algorithm by exploiting that (1) the value functions of our game depend only on
position of the pursuer and the belief he has about the current position of the
evader, and (2) that these functions are piecewise linear and convex in the
belief space.

 <dc:description>  Semantic roles play an important role in extracting knowledge from text.
Current unsupervised approaches utilize features from grammar structures, to
induce semantic roles. The dependence on these grammars, however, makes it
difficult to adapt to noisy and new languages. In this paper we develop a
data-driven approach to identifying semantic roles, the approach is entirely
unsupervised up to the point where rules need to be learned to identify the
position the semantic role occurs. Specifically we develop a modified-ADIOS
algorithm based on ADIOS Solan et al. (2005) to learn grammar structures, and
use these grammar structures to learn the rules for identifying the semantic
roles based on the context in which the grammar structures appeared. The
results obtained are comparable with the current state-of-art models that are
inherently dependent on human annotated data.

 <dc:description>  An intriguing open question is whether measurements made on Big Data
recording human activities can yield us high-fidelity proxies of socio-economic
development and well-being. Can we monitor and predict the socio-economic
development of a territory just by observing the behavior of its inhabitants
through the lens of Big Data? In this paper, we design a data-driven analytical
framework that uses mobility measures and social measures extracted from mobile
phone data to estimate indicators for socio-economic development and
well-being. We discover that the diversity of mobility, defined in terms of
entropy of the individual users' trajectories, exhibits (i) significant
correlation with two different socio-economic indicators and (ii) the highest
importance in predictive models built to predict the socio-economic indicators.
Our analytical framework opens an interesting perspective to study human
behavior through the lens of Big Data by means of new statistical indicators
that quantify and possibly &quot;nowcast&quot; the well-being and the socio-economic
development of a territory.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we compare several Python tools for automatic differentiation.
In order to assess the difference in performance and precision, the problem of
finding the optimal geometrical structure of the cluster with identical atoms
is used as follows. First, we compare performance of calculating gradients for
the objective function. We showed that the PyADOL-C and PyCppAD tools have much
better performance for big clusters than the other ones. Second, we assess
precision of these two tools by calculating the difference between the obtained
at the optimal configuration gradient norms. We conclude that PyCppAD has the
best performance among others, while having almost the same precision as the
second- best performing tool - PyADOL-C.

 <dc:title>Multiple Hypothesis Colorization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Baig, Mohammad Haris</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Torresani, Lorenzo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we focus on the problem of colorization for image compression.
Since color information occupies a large proportion of the total storage size
of an image, a method that can predict accurate color from its grayscale
version can produce dramatic reduction in image file size. But colorization for
compression poses several challenges. First, while colorization for artistic
purposes simply involves predicting plausible chroma, colorization for
compression requires generating output colors that are as close as possible to
the ground truth. Second, many objects in the real world exhibit multiple
possible colors. Thus, to disambiguate the colorization problem some additional
information must be stored to reproduce the true colors with good accuracy. To
account for the multimodal color distribution of objects we propose a deep
tree-structured network that generates multiple color hypotheses for every
pixel from a grayscale picture (as opposed to a single color produced by most
prior colorization approaches). We show how to leverage the multimodal output
of our model to reproduce with high fidelity the true colors of an image by
storing very little additional information. In the experiments we show that our
proposed method outperforms traditional JPEG color coding by a large margin,
producing colors that are nearly indistinguishable from the ground truth at the
storage cost of just a few hundred bytes for high-resolution pictures!

 <dc:description>  Recent years with the popularity of mobile devices have witnessed an
explosive growth of mobile multimedia contents which dominate more than 50\% of
mobile data traffic. This significant growth poses a severe challenge for
future cellular networks. As a promising approach to overcome the challenge, we
advocate Content Retrieval At the Edge, a content-centric cooperative service
paradigm via device-to-device (D2D) communications to reduce cellular traffic
volume in mobile networks. By leveraging the Named Data Networking (NDN)
principle, we propose sNDN, a social-aware named data framework to achieve
efficient cooperative content retrieval. Specifically, sNDN introduces
Friendship Circle by grouping a user with her close friends of both high
mobility similarity and high content similarity. We construct NDN routing
tables conditioned on Friendship Circle encounter frequency to navigate a
content request and a content reply packet between Friendship Circles, and
leverage social properties in Friendship Circle to search for the final target
as inner-Friendship Circle routing. The evaluation results demonstrate that
sNDN can save cellular capacity greatly and outperform other content retrieval
schemes significantly.

 <dc:description>  We apply recurrent neural networks to the task of recognizing surgical
activities from robot kinematics. Prior work in this area focuses on
recognizing short, low-level activities, or gestures, and has been based on
variants of hidden Markov models and conditional random fields. In contrast, we
work on recognizing both gestures and longer, higher-level activites, or
maneuvers, and we model the mapping from kinematics to gestures/maneuvers with
recurrent neural networks. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply
recurrent neural networks to this task. Using a single model and a single set
of hyperparameters, we match state-of-the-art performance for gesture
recognition and advance state-of-the-art performance for maneuver recognition,
in terms of both accuracy and edit distance. Code is available at

 <dc:title>Optimal Storage Aware Caching Policies for Content-Centric Clouds</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Caches in Content-Centric Networks (CCN) are increasingly adopting flash
memory based storage. The current flash cache technology stores all files with
the largest possible expiry date, i.e. the files are written in the memory so
that they are retained for as long as possible. This, however, does not
leverage the CCN data characteristics where content is typically short-lived
and has a distinct popularity profile. Writing files in a cache using the
longest retention time damages the memory device thus reducing its lifetime.
However, writing using a small retention time can increase the content
retrieval delay, since, at the time a file is requested, the file may already
have been expired from the memory. This motivates us to consider a joint
optimization wherein we obtain optimal policies for jointly minimizing the
content retrieval delay (which is a network-centric objective) and the flash
damage (which is a device-centric objective). Caching decisions now not only
involve what to cache but also for how long to cache each file. We design
provably optimal policies and numerically compare them against prior policies.

data are lacking in various ways; difficult to access, biased, have poor
geographical or temporal resolution, or are significantly delayed. In this
paper, we describe how geolocation data from Twitter can be used to estimate
global mobility patterns and address these shortcomings. These findings will
inform how this novel data source can be harnessed to address humanitarian and

 <dc:description>  In this paper, two methods for multiple instance target characterization,
MI-SMF and MI-ACE, are presented. MI-SMF and MI-ACE estimate a discriminative
target signature from imprecisely-labeled and mixed training data. In many
applications, such as sub-pixel target detection in remotely-sensed
hyperspectral imagery, accurate pixel-level labels on training data is often
unavailable and infeasible to obtain. Furthermore, since sub-pixel targets are
smaller in size than the resolution of a single pixel, training data is
comprised only of mixed data points (in which target training points are
mixtures of responses from both target and non-target classes). Results show
improved, consistent performance over existing multiple instance concept
learning methods on several hyperspectral sub-pixel target detection problems.

 <dc:title>A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Method for Persistent
  Time-Sensitive Tasks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning has been applied to many interesting problems such as
the famous TD-gammon and the inverted helicopter flight. However, little effort
has been put into developing methods to learn policies for complex persistent
tasks and tasks that are time-sensitive. In this paper, we take a step towards
solving this problem by using signal temporal logic (STL) as task
specification, and taking advantage of the temporal abstraction feature that
the options framework provide. We show via simulation that a relatively easy to
implement algorithm that combines STL and options can learn a satisfactory
policy with a small number of training cases

 <dc:title>Bots, #StrongerIn, and #Brexit: Computational Propaganda during the

 <dc:description>  Bots are social media accounts that automate interaction with other users,
and they are active on the StrongerIn-Brexit conversation happening over
Twitter. These automated scripts generate content through these platforms and
then interact with people. Political bots are automated accounts that are
particularly active on public policy issues, elections, and political crises.
In this preliminary study on the use of political bots during the UK referendum
on EU membership, we analyze the tweeting patterns for both human users and
bots. We find that political bots have a small but strategic role in the
referendum conversations: (1) the family of hashtags associated with the
argument for leaving the EU dominates, (2) different perspectives on the issue
utilize different levels of automation, and (3) less than 1 percent of sampled
accounts generate almost a third of all the messages.

 <dc:description>  In statistical relational learning, the link prediction problem is key to
automatically understand the structure of large knowledge bases. As in previous
studies, we propose to solve this problem through latent factorization.
However, here we make use of complex valued embeddings. The composition of
complex embeddings can handle a large variety of binary relations, among them
symmetric and antisymmetric relations. Compared to state-of-the-art models such
as Neural Tensor Network and Holographic Embeddings, our approach based on
complex embeddings is arguably simpler, as it only uses the Hermitian dot
product, the complex counterpart of the standard dot product between real
vectors. Our approach is scalable to large datasets as it remains linear in
both space and time, while consistently outperforming alternative approaches on
standard link prediction benchmarks.

 <dc:title>A Probabilistic Generative Grammar for Semantic Parsing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a framework that couples the syntax and semantics of natural
language sentences in a generative model, in order to develop a semantic parser
that jointly infers the syntactic, morphological, and semantic representations
of a given sentence under the guidance of background knowledge. To generate a
sentence in our framework, a semantic statement is first sampled from a prior,
such as from a set of beliefs in a knowledge base. Given this semantic
statement, a grammar probabilistically generates the output sentence. A joint
semantic-syntactic parser is derived that returns the $k$-best semantic and
syntactic parses for a given sentence. The semantic prior is flexible, and can
be used to incorporate background knowledge during parsing, in ways unlike
previous semantic parsing approaches. For example, semantic statements
corresponding to beliefs in a knowledge base can be given higher prior
probability, type-correct statements can be given somewhat lower probability,
and beliefs outside the knowledge base can be given lower probability. The
construction of our grammar invokes a novel application of hierarchical
Dirichlet processes (HDPs), which in turn, requires a novel and efficient
inference approach. We present experimental results showing, for a simple
grammar, that our parser outperforms a state-of-the-art CCG semantic parser and
scales to knowledge bases with millions of beliefs.

 <dc:description>  Each year, roughly 30% of first-year students at US baccalaureate
institutions do not return for their second year and over $9 billion is spent
educating these students. Yet, little quantitative research has analyzed the
causes and possible remedies for student attrition. Here, we describe initial
efforts to model student dropout using the largest known dataset on higher
education attrition, which tracks over 32,500 students' demographics and
transcript records at one of the nation's largest public universities. Our
results highlight several early indicators of student attrition and show that
dropout can be accurately predicted even when predictions are based on a single
term of academic transcript data. These results highlight the potential for
machine learning to have an impact on student retention and success while
pointing to several promising directions for future work.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a new wrapper feature selection approach based on
Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, termed feature selection with maximum
JS-divergence (FSMJ), for text categorization. Unlike most existing feature
selection approaches, the proposed FSMJ approach is based on real-valued
features which provide more information for discrimination than binary-valued
features used in conventional approaches. We show that the FSMJ is a greedy
approach and the JS-divergence monotonically increases when more features are
selected. We conduct several experiments on real-life data sets, compared with
the state-of-the-art feature selection approaches for text categorization. The
superior performance of the proposed FSMJ approach demonstrates its
effectiveness and further indicates its wide potential applications on data
mining.

 <dc:description>  Can we train a system that, on any new input, either says &quot;don't know&quot; or
makes a prediction that is guaranteed to be correct? We answer the question in
the affirmative provided our model family is well-specified. Specifically, we
introduce the unanimity principle: only predict when all models consistent with
the training data predict the same output. We operationalize this principle for
semantic parsing, the task of mapping utterances to logical forms. We develop a
simple, efficient method that reasons over the infinite set of all consistent
models by only checking two of the models. We prove that our method obtains
100% precision even with a modest amount of training data from a possibly
adversarial distribution. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on the standard GeoQuery dataset.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel graph kernel specifically to address a
challenging problem in the field of cyber-security, namely, malware detection.
Previous research has revealed the following: (1) Graph representations of
programs are ideally suited for malware detection as they are robust against
several attacks, (2) Besides capturing topological neighbourhoods (i.e.,
structural information) from these graphs it is important to capture the
context under which the neighbourhoods are reachable to accurately detect
malicious neighbourhoods.
  We observe that state-of-the-art graph kernels, such as Weisfeiler-Lehman
kernel (WLK) capture the structural information well but fail to capture
contextual information. To address this, we develop the Contextual
Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (CWLK) which is capable of capturing both these types
of information. We show that for the malware detection problem, CWLK is more
expressive and hence more accurate than WLK while maintaining comparable
efficiency. Through our large-scale experiments with more than 50,000
real-world Android apps, we demonstrate that CWLK outperforms two
state-of-the-art graph kernels (including WLK) and three malware detection
techniques by more than 5.27% and 4.87% F-measure, respectively, while
maintaining high efficiency. This high accuracy and efficiency make CWLK
suitable for large-scale real-world malware detection.

 <dc:description>  Functional coroutines are a restricted form of control mechanism, where each
coroutine is represented with both a continuation and an environment. This
restriction was originally obtained by considering a constructive version of
Parigot's classical natural deduction which is sound and complete for the
Constant Domain logic. In this article, we present a refinement of de Groote's
abstract machine for functional coroutines and we prove its correctness.
Therefore, this abstract machine also provides a direct computational
interpretation of the Constant Domain logic.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel kernel-based generative classifier which is
defined in a distortion subspace using polynomial series expansion, named
Kernel-Distortion (KD) classifier. An iterative kernel selection algorithm is
developed to steadily improve classification performance by repeatedly removing
and adding kernels. The experimental results on character recognition
application not only show that the proposed generative classifier performs
better than many existing classifiers, but also illustrate that it has
different recognition capability compared to the state-of-the-art
discriminative classifier - deep belief network. The recognition diversity
indicates that a hybrid combination of the proposed generative classifier and
the discriminative classifier could further improve the classification
performance. Two hybrid combination methods, cascading and stacking, have been
implemented to verify the diversity and the improvement of the proposed
classifier.

 <dc:description>  Weak-head normalization is inconsistent with functional extensionality in the
call-by-name $\lambda$-calculus. We explore this problem from a new angle via
the conflict between extensionality and effects. Leveraging ideas from work on
the $\lambda$-calculus with control, we derive and justify alternative
operational semantics and a sequence of abstract machines for performing head
reduction. Head reduction avoids the problems with weak-head reduction and
extensionality, while our operational semantics and associated abstract
machines show us how to retain weak-head reduction's ease of implementation.

  In this paper, we present a typed translation of delimited-control operators
shift and reset with ATM into a familiar language with multi-prompt shift and
reset without ATM, which lets us use ATM in standard languages without
modifying the type system. Our translation generalizes Kiselyov's direct-style
implementation of typed printf, which uses two prompts to emulate the
modification of answer types, and passes them during computation. We prove that
our translation preserves typing. As the naive prompt-passing style translation
generates and passes many prompts even for pure terms, we show an optimized
translation that generate prompts only when needed, which is also
type-preserving. Finally, we give an implementation in the tagless-final style
which respects typing by construction.

 <dc:title>From Push/Enter to Eval/Apply by Program Transformation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Push/enter and eval/apply are two calling conventions used in implementations
of functional languages. In this paper, we explore the following observation:
when considering functions with multiple arguments, the stack under the
push/enter and eval/apply conventions behaves similarly to two particular
implementations of the list datatype: the regular cons-list and a form of lists
with lazy concatenation respectively. Along the lines of Danvy et al.'s
functional correspondence between definitional interpreters and abstract
machines, we use this observation to transform an abstract machine that
implements push/enter into an abstract machine that implements eval/apply. We
show that our method is flexible enough to transform the push/enter Spineless
Tagless G-machine (which is the semantic core of the GHC Haskell compiler) into
its eval/apply variant.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows connections between command injection attacks,
continuations, and the Lambek calculus: certain command injections, such as the
tautology attack on SQL, are shown to be a form of control effect that can be
typed using the Lambek calculus, generalizing the double-negation typing of
continuations. Lambek's syntactic calculus is a logic with two implicational
connectives taking their arguments from the left and right, respectively. These
connectives describe how strings interact with their left and right contexts
when building up syntactic structures. The calculus is a form of propositional
logic without structural rules, and so a forerunner of substructural logics
like Linear Logic and Separation Logic.

 <dc:title>Denotational Semantics of the Simplified Lambda-Mu Calculus and a New
  Deduction System of Classical Type Theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Akiba, Ken</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Classical (or Boolean) type theory is the type theory that allows the type
inference $\sigma \to \bot) \to \bot =&gt; \sigma$ (the type counterpart of
double-negation elimination), where $\sigma$ is any type and $\bot$ is
absurdity type. This paper first presents a denotational semantics for a
simplified version of Parigot's lambda-mu calculus, a premier example of
classical type theory. In this semantics the domain of each type is divided
into infinitely many ranks and contains not only the usual members of the type
at rank 0 but also their negative, conjunctive, and disjunctive shadows in the
higher ranks, which form an infinitely nested Boolean structure. Absurdity type
$\bot$ is identified as the type of truth values. The paper then presents a new
deduction system of classical type theory, a sequent calculus called the
classical type system (CTS), which involves the standard logical operators such
as negation, conjunction, and disjunction and thus reflects the discussed
semantic structure in a more straightforward fashion.

 <dc:title>The computational content of Nonstandard Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sanders, Sam</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Kohlenbach's proof mining program deals with the extraction of effective
information from typically ineffective proofs. Proof mining has its roots in
Kreisel's pioneering work on the so-called unwinding of proofs. The proof
mining of classical mathematics is rather restricted in scope due to the
existence of sentences without computational content which are provable from
the law of excluded middle and which involve only two quantifier alternations.
By contrast, we show that the proof mining of classical Nonstandard Analysis
has a very large scope. In particular, we will observe that this scope includes
any theorem of pure Nonstandard Analysis, where `pure' means that only
nonstandard definitions (and not the epsilon-delta kind) are used. In this
note, we survey results in analysis, computability theory, and Reverse
Mathematics.

 <dc:title>A note on strong normalization in classical natural deduction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Santo, Jos&#xe9; Esp&#xed;rito</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the context of natural deduction for propositional classical logic, with
classicality given by the inference rule reductio ad absurdum, we investigate
the De Morgan translation of disjunction in terms of negation and conjunction.
Once the translation is extended to proofs, it obtains a reduction of
provability to provability in the disjunction-free subsystem. It is natural to
ask whether a reduction is also obtained for, say, strong normalization; that
is, whether strong normalization for the disjunction-free system implies the
same property for the full system, and whether such lifting of the property can
be done along the De Morgan translation. Although natural, these questions are
neglected by the literature. We spell out the map of reduction steps induced by
the De Morgan translation of proofs. But we need to &quot;optimize&quot; such a map in
order to show that a reduction sequence in the full system from a proof
determines, in a length-preserving way, a reduction sequence in the
disjunction-free system from the De Morgan translation of the proof. In this
sense, the above questions have a positive answer.

 <dc:description>  Online matching has received significant attention over the last 15 years due
to its close connection to Internet advertising. As the seminal work of Karp,
Vazirani, and Vazirani has an optimal (1 - 1/e) competitive ratio in the
standard adversarial online model, much effort has gone into developing useful
online models that incorporate some stochasticity in the arrival process. One
such popular model is the &quot;known I.I.D. model&quot; where different customer-types
arrive online from a known distribution. We develop algorithms with improved
competitive ratios for some basic variants of this model with integral arrival
rates, including (a) the case of general weighted edges, where we improve the
best-known ratio of 0.667 due to Haeupler, Mirrokni and Zadimoghaddam to 0.705;
and (b) the vertex-weighted case, where we improve the 0.7250 ratio of Jaillet
and Lu to 0.7299. We also consider an extension of stochastic rewards, a
variant where each edge has an independent probability of being present. For
the setting of stochastic rewards with non-integral arrival rates, we present a
simple optimal non-adaptive algorithm with a ratio of 1 - 1/e. For the special
case where each edge is unweighted and has a uniform constant probability of
being present, we improve upon 1 - 1/e by proposing a strengthened LP
benchmark.

 <dc:title>Uniqueness Trees: A Possible Polynomial Approach to the Graph

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the novel `uniqueness tree' algorithm, as one possible
method for determining whether two finite, undirected graphs are isomorphic. We
prove that the algorithm has polynomial time complexity in the worst case, and
that it will always detect the presence of an isomorphism whenever one exists.
We also propose that the algorithm will equivalently discern the lack of an
isomorphism whenever one does not exist, and some initial justifications are
given for this proposition, although it cannot yet be rigorously proven.
Finally, we present experimental evidence for both the effectiveness and
efficiency of the uniqueness tree method, using data gathered from a practical
implementation of the algorithm. Some consequences and directions for further
research are discussed.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, neural network approaches for parsing have largely automated the
combination of individual features, but still rely on (often a larger number
of) atomic features created from human linguistic intuition, and potentially
omitting important global context. To further reduce feature engineering to the
bare minimum, we use bi-directional LSTM sentence representations to model a
parser state with only three sentence positions, which automatically identifies
important aspects of the entire sentence. This model achieves state-of-the-art
results among greedy dependency parsers for English. We also introduce a novel
transition system for constituency parsing which does not require binarization,
and together with the above architecture, achieves state-of-the-art results
among greedy parsers for both English and Chinese.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a low-complexity Gaussian Message Passing Iterative
Detection (GMPID) algorithm for massive Multiuser Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) system, in which a base station with $M$ antennas
serves $K$ Gaussian sources simultaneously. Both $K$ and $M$ are very large
numbers, and we consider the cases that $K&lt;M$. The GMPID is a low-complexity
message passing algorithm based on a fully connected loopy graph, which is well
understood to be not convergent in some cases. As it is hard to analyse the
GMPID directly, the large-scale property of the massive MU-MIMO is used to
simplify the analysis. Firstly, we prove that the variances of the GMPID
definitely converge to the mean square error of Minimum Mean Square Error
(MMSE) detection. Secondly, we propose two sufficient conditions that the means
of the GMPID converge to those of the MMSE detection. However, the means of
GMPID may not converge when $ K/M\geq (\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. Therefore, a new
convergent GMPID called SA-GMPID (scale-and-add GMPID) , which converges to the
MMSE detection in mean and variance for any $K&lt;M$ and has a faster convergence
speed than the GMPID, but has no higher complexity than the GMPID, is proposed.
Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the validity and accuracy of
the theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  The finite state Markov channel (FSMC), where the channel transition
probability is controlled by a state undergoing a Markov process, is a useful
model for the mobile wireless communication channel. In this paper, we
investigate the security issue in the mobile wireless communication systems by
considering the FSMC with an eavesdropper, which we call the finite state
Markov wiretap channel (FSM-WC). We assume that the state is perfectly known by
the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, and through a noiseless feedback
channel, the legitimate receiver sends his received channel output and the
state back to the transmitter after some time delay. Inner and outer bounds on
the capacity-equivocation regions of the FSM-WC with delayed state feedback and
with or without delayed channel output feedback are provided in this paper, and
we show that these bounds meet if the eavesdropper's received symbol is a
degraded version of the legitimate receiver's. The above results are further
explained via degraded Gaussian and Gaussian fading examples.

 <dc:title>Non-Coherent Direction of Arrival Estimation via Frequency Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This letter investigates the non-coherent Direction of Arrival (DOA)
estimation problem dealing with the DOA estimation from magnitude only
measurements of the array output. The magnitude squared of the array output is
expanded as a superposition of some harmonics. Hence, a frequency estimation
approach is used to find some nonlinear relations between DOAs, which results
in inherent ambiguities. To solve the nonlinear equations and resolve the
ambiguities, we assume a high amplitude reference target at low angles to
estimate the true DOA's with no ambiguities. However, the proposed algorithm
requires a large number of antenna array elements to accurately estimate the
DOA's. To overcome this drawback, and to enhance the estimation accuracy, we
suggest two variants of the algorithm. One is to add virtual elements in the
array and the second is to integrate multiple snapshots. Simulation results
show that the proposed frequency estimation-based algorithm outperforms the
non-coherent GESPAR algorithm in the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime and
it is two orders of magnitude faster than the non-coherent GESPAR algorithm.

 <dc:description>  A systematic review identifies and collates various clinical studies and
compares data elements and results in order to provide an evidence based answer
for a particular clinical question. The process is manual and involves lot of
time. A tool to automate this process is lacking. The aim of this work is to
develop a framework using natural language processing and machine learning to
build information extraction algorithms to identify data elements in a new
primary publication, without having to go through the expensive task of manual
annotation to build gold standards for each data element type. The system is
developed in two stages. Initially, it uses information contained in existing
systematic reviews to identify the sentences from the PDF files of the included
references that contain specific data elements of interest using a modified
Jaccard similarity measure. These sentences have been treated as labeled data.A
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on this labeled data to
extract data elements of interests from a new article. We conducted experiments
on Cochrane Database systematic reviews related to congestive heart failure
using inclusion criteria as an example data element. The empirical results show
that the proposed system automatically identifies sentences containing the data
element of interest with a high recall (93.75%) and reasonable precision
(27.05% - which means the reviewers have to read only 3.7 sentences on
average). The empirical results suggest that the tool is retrieving valuable
information from the reference articles, even when it is time-consuming to
identify them manually. Thus we hope that the tool will be useful for automatic
data extraction from biomedical research publications. The future scope of this
work is to generalize this information framework for all types of systematic
reviews.

 <dc:description>  Ontologies provide conceptual abstractions over data, in domains such as the
Internet of Things, in a way that sensor data can be harvested and interpreted
by people and applications. The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is the
de-facto standard for semantic representation of sensor observations and
metadata, and it is used at the core of the open source platform for the
Internet of Things, OpenIoT. In this paper we present a Schema Editor that
provides an intuitive web interface for defining new types of sensors, and
concrete instances of them, using the SSN ontology as the core model. This
editor is fully integrated with the OpenIoT platform for generating virtual
sensor descriptions and automating their semantic annotation and registration
process.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a fast and efficient segmentation technique for 2D
images and 3D point clouds of building facades. Facades of buildings are highly
structured and consequently most methods that have been proposed for this
problem aim to make use of this strong prior information. Contrary to most
prior work, we are describing a system that is almost domain independent and
consists of standard segmentation methods. We train a sequence of boosted
decision trees using auto-context features. This is learned using stacked
generalization. We find that this technique performs better, or comparable with
all previous published methods and present empirical results on all available
2D and 3D facade benchmark datasets. The proposed method is simple to
implement, easy to extend, and very efficient at test-time inference.

 <dc:description>  Spatially-sparse predictors are good models for brain decoding: they give
accurate predictions and their weight maps are interpretable as they focus on a
small number of regions. However, the state of the art, based on total
variation or graph-net, is computationally costly. Here we introduce sparsity
in the local neighborhood of each voxel with social-sparsity, a structured
shrinkage operator. We find that, on brain imaging classification problems,
social-sparsity performs almost as well as total-variation models and better
than graph-net, for a fraction of the computational cost. It also very clearly
outlines predictive regions. We give details of the model and the algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is an involuntary eye movement responsible for
stabilizing retinal images in the presence of relative motion between an
observer and the environment. Fully understanding the development of
optokinetic nystagmus requires a neurally plausible computational model that
accounts for the neural development and the behavior. To date, work in this
area has been limited. We propose a neurally plausible framework for the joint
development of disparity and motion tuning in the visual cortex, the
optokinetic and vergence eye movements. This framework models the joint
emergence of both perception and behavior, and accounts for the importance of
the development of normal vergence control and binocular vision in achieving
normal monocular OKN (mOKN) behaviors. Because the model includes behavior, we
can simulate the same perturbations as performed in past experiments, such as
artificially induced strabismus. The proposed model agrees both qualitatively
and quantitatively with a number of findings from the literature on both
binocular vision as well as the optokinetic reflex. Finally, our model also
makes quantitative predictions about the OKN behavior using the same methods
used to characterize the OKN in the experimental literature.

 <dc:description>  Outliers are samples that are generated by different mechanisms from other
normal data samples. Graphs, in particular social network graphs, may contain
nodes and edges that are made by scammers, malicious programs or mistakenly by
normal users. Detecting outlier nodes and edges is important for data mining
and graph analytics. However, previous research in the field has merely focused
on detecting outlier nodes. In this article, we study the properties of edges
and propose outlier edge detection algorithms using two random graph generation
models. We found that the edge-ego-network, which can be defined as the induced
graph that contains two end nodes of an edge, their neighboring nodes and the
edges that link these nodes, contains critical information to detect outlier
edges. We evaluated the proposed algorithms by injecting outlier edges into
some real-world graph data. Experiment results show that the proposed
algorithms can effectively detect outlier edges. In particular, the algorithm
based on the Preferential Attachment Random Graph Generation model consistently
gives good performance regardless of the test graph data. Further more, the
proposed algorithms are not limited in the area of outlier edge detection. We
demonstrate three different applications that benefit from the proposed
algorithms: 1) a preprocessing tool that improves the performance of graph
clustering algorithms; 2) an outlier node detection algorithm; and 3) a novel
noisy data clustering algorithm. These applications show the great potential of
the proposed outlier edge detection techniques.

 <dc:description>  Graph clustering is an important technique to understand the relationships
between the vertices in a big graph. In this paper, we propose a novel
random-walk-based graph clustering method. The proposed method restricts the
reach of the walking agent using an inflation function and a normalization
function. We analyze the behavior of the limited random walk procedure and
propose a novel algorithm for both global and local graph clustering problems.
Previous random-walk-based algorithms depend on the chosen fitness function to
find the clusters around a seed vertex. The proposed algorithm tackles the
problem in an entirely different manner. We use the limited random walk
procedure to find attracting vertices in a graph and use them as features to
cluster the vertices. According to the experimental results on the simulated
graph data and the real-world big graph data, the proposed method is superior
to the state-of-the-art methods in solving graph clustering problems. Since the
proposed method uses the embarrassingly parallel paradigm, it can be
efficiently implemented and embedded in any parallel computing environment such
as a MapReduce framework. Given enough computing resources, we are capable of
clustering graphs with millions of vertices and hundreds millions of edges in a
reasonable time.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we present a new approach to high level synthesis (HLS), where
high level functions are first mapped to an architectural template, before
hardware synthesis is performed. As FPGA platforms are especially suitable for
implementing streaming processing pipelines, we perform transformations on
conventional high level programs where they are turned into multi-stage
dataflow engines [1]. This target template naturally overlaps slow memory data
accesses with computations and therefore has much better tolerance towards
memory subsystem latency. Using a state-of-the-art HLS tool for the actual
circuit generation, we observe up to 9x improvement in overall performance when
the dataflow architectural template is used as an intermediate compilation
target.

 <dc:description>  We present a customizable soft architecture which allows for the execution of
GPGPU code on an FPGA without the need to recompile the design. Issues related
to scaling the overlay architecture to multiple GPGPU multiprocessors are
considered along with application-class architectural optimizations. The
overlay architecture is optimized for FPGA implementation to support efficient
use of embedded block memories and DSP blocks. This architecture supports
direct CUDA compilation of integer computations to a binary which is executable
on the FPGA-based GPGPU. The benefits of our architecture are evaluated for a
collection of five standard CUDA benchmarks which are compiled using standard
GPGPU compilation tools. Speedups of 44x, on average, versus a MicroBlaze
microprocessor are achieved. We show dynamic energy savings versus a soft-core
processor of 80% on average. Application-customized versions of the soft GPGPU
can be used to further reduce dynamic energy consumption by an average of 14%.

 <dc:description>  FPGAs are going mainstream. Major companies that were not traditionally
FPGA-focused are now seeking ways to exploit the benefits of reconfigurable
technology and provide it to their customers. In order to do so, a debug
ecosystem that provides for effective visibility into a working design and
quick debug turn-around times is essential. Overlays have the opportunity to
play a key role in this ecosystem. In this overview paper, we discuss how an
overlay fabric that allows the user to rapidly add debug instrumentation to a
design can be created and exploited. We discuss the requirements of such an
overlay and some of the research challenges and opportunities that need to be
addressed. To make our exposition concrete, we use two previously-published
examples of overlays that have been developed to implement debug
instrumentation.

 <dc:description>  Coarse grained overlay architectures improve FPGA design productivity by
providing fast compilation and software-like programmability. Throughput
oriented spatially configurable overlays typically suffer from area overheads
due to the requirement of one functional unit for each compute kernel
operation. Hence, these overlays have often been of limited size, supporting
only relatively small compute kernels while consuming considerable FPGA
resources. This paper examines the possibility of sharing the functional units
among kernel operations for reducing area overheads. We propose a linear
interconnected array of time-multiplexed FUs as an overlay architecture with
reduced instruction storage and interconnect resource requirements, which uses
a fully-pipelined, architecture-aware FU design supporting a fast context
switching time. The results presented show a reduction of up to 85% in FPGA
resource requirements compared to existing throughput oriented overlay
architectures, with an operating frequency which approaches the theoretical
limit for the FPGA device.

and apply this technique on TransE-a well-known embedding model for knowledge

better performance than obtained by other state-of-the-art embedding models on

 <dc:description>  Text-independent writer identification is challenging due to the huge
variation of written contents and the ambiguous written styles of different
writers. This paper proposes DeepWriter, a deep multi-stream CNN to learn deep
powerful representation for recognizing writers. DeepWriter takes local
handwritten patches as input and is trained with softmax classification loss.
The main contributions are: 1) we design and optimize multi-stream structure
for writer identification task; 2) we introduce data augmentation learning to
enhance the performance of DeepWriter; 3) we introduce a patch scanning
strategy to handle text image with different lengths. In addition, we find that
different languages such as English and Chinese may share common features for
writer identification, and joint training can yield better performance.
Experimental results on IAM and HWDB datasets show that our models achieve high
identification accuracy: 99.01% on 301 writers and 97.03% on 657 writers with
one English sentence input, 93.85% on 300 writers with one Chinese character
input, which outperform previous methods with a large margin. Moreover, our
models obtain accuracy of 98.01% on 301 writers with only 4 English alphabets
as input.

 <dc:description>  Currently, one of the hottest topics in the Internet of Things (IoT) research
domain regards the issue to overcome the heterogeneity of proprietary
technologies and systems so as to enable the integration of applications and
devices developed for different environments in a single interoperable
framework. Towards this objective, virtualization is widely used to foster
integration and creation of new services and applications. Similar benefits are
expected by its application in the smart grid arena. The use of a
virtualization middleware is expected to enrich the capabilities and
opportunities related to the use of smart grid devices. In this paper, we
propose key features for an interoperable, re-usable, elastic and secure smart
grid architecture which is cloud-based and relies on REST APIs. To highlight
the benefits, a practical case study is presented, where outlined
functionalities are implemented in a cloud-based IoT platform. The advantages
brought by the proposed middleware in terms of interoperability, re-usability,
privacy and elasticity of the underlying infrastructure are discussed.

 <dc:title>A Soft Processor Overlay with Tightly-coupled FPGA Accelerator</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  FPGA overlays are commonly implemented as coarse-grained reconfigurable
architectures with a goal to improve designers' productivity through balancing
flexibility and ease of configuration of the underlying fabric. To truly
facilitate full application acceleration, it is often necessary to also include
a highly efficient processor that integrates and collaborates with the
accelerators while maintaining the benefits of being implemented within the
same overlay framework. This paper presents an open-source soft processor that
is designed to tightly-couple with FPGA accelerators as part of an overlay
framework. RISC-V is chosen as the instruction set for its openness and
portability, and the soft processor is designed as a 4-stage pipeline to
balance resource consumption and performance when implemented on FPGAs. The
processor is generically implemented so as to promote design portability and
compatibility across different FPGA platforms. Experimental results show that
integrated software-hardware applications using the proposed tightly-coupled
architecture achieve comparable performance as hardware-only accelerators while
the proposed architecture provides additional run-time flexibility. The
processor has been synthesized to both low-end and high-performance FPGA
families from different vendors, achieving the highest frequency of 268.67MHz
and resource consumption comparable to existing RISC-V designs.

 <dc:title>Discretized Approaches to Schematization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Meulemans, Wouter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To produce cartographic maps, simplification is typically used to reduce
complexity of the map to a legible level. With schematic maps, however, this
simplification is pushed far beyond the legibility threshold and is instead
constrained by functional need and resemblance. Moreover, stylistic geometry is
often used to convey the schematic nature of the map. In this paper we explore
discretized approaches to computing a schematic shape $S$ for a simple polygon
$P$. We do so by overlaying a plane graph $G$ on $P$ as the solution space for
the schematic shape. Topological constraints imply that $S$ should describe a
simple polygon. We investigate two approaches, simple map matching and
connected face selection, based on commonly used similarity metrics.
  With the former, $S$ is a simple cycle $C$ in $G$ and we quantify resemblance
via the Fr\'echet distance. We prove that it is NP-hard to compute a cycle that
approximates the minimal Fr\'echet distance over all simple cycles in a plane
graph $G$. This result holds even if $G$ is a partial grid graph, if area
preservation is required and if we assume a given sequence of turns is
specified.
  With the latter, $S$ is a connected face set in $G$, quantifying resemblance
via the symmetric difference. Though the symmetric difference seems a less
strict measure, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute the optimal face set.
This result holds even if $G$ is full grid graph or a triangular or hexagonal
tiling, and if area preservation is required. Moreover, it is independent of
whether we allow the set of faces to have holes or not.

 <dc:title>Optimal Scheduling of Reliability-Constrained Relaying System under

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Under the assumption of outdated channel state information (CSI) at the
source, we consider the finite blocklength (FBL) throughput of a two-hop
relaying system. Previous work has considered this setting so far only for the
infinite blocklength case, where decoding can be arbitrarily reliable as long
as operating below the Shannon limit. In contrast, in the FBL regime residual
decoding errors can not be avoided even when transmitting below the Shannon
limit. This makes the scheduling problem at the source more vulnerable to
transmission errors, where we investigate the trade-off between the choice of
so called scheduling weights to avoid transmission errors and the resulting
coding rate. We show that the corresponding maximization of the throughput
under a reliability constraint can be solved efficiently by iterative
algorithms. Nevertheless, the optimal solution requires a recomputation of the
scheduling weights prior to each transmission. Thus, we also study heuristics
relying on choosing the scheduling weights only once. Through numerical
analysis, we first provide insights on the structure of the throughout under
different scheduling weights and channel correlation coefficients. We then turn
to the comparison of the optimal scheduling with the heuristic and show that
the performance gap between them is only significant for relay systems with
high average signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) on the backhaul and relaying link. In
particular, the optimal scheduling scheme provides most value in case that the
data transmission is subject to strict reliability constraints, justifying the
significant additional computational burden.

 <dc:title>Transmit Beamforming for Interference Exploitation in the Underlay
  Cognitive Radio Z-channel</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces novel transmit beamforming approaches for the cognitive
radio (CR) Z-channel. The proposed transmission schemes exploit non-causal
information about the interference at the SBS to re-design the CR beamforming
optimization problem. This is done with the objective to improve the quality of
service (QoS) of secondary users by taking advantage of constructive
interference in the secondary link. The beamformers are designed to minimize
the worst secondary user's symbol error probability (SEP) under constraints on
the instantaneous total transmit power, and the power of the instantaneous
interference in the primary link. The problem is formulated as a bivariate
probabilistic constrained programming (BPCP) problem. We show that the BPCP
problem can be transformed for practical SEPs into a convex optimization
problem that can be solved, e.g., by the barrier method. A computationally
efficient tight approximate approach is also developed to compute the
near-optimal solutions. Simulation results and analysis show that the average
computational complexity per downlink frame of the proposed approximate problem
is comparable to that of the conventional CR downlink beamforming problem. In
addition, both the proposed methods offer significant performance improvements
as compared to the conventional CR downlink beamforming, while guaranteeing the
QoS of primary users on an instantaneous basis, in contrast to the average QoS
guarantees of conventional beamformers.

 <dc:description>  Understanding fluctuation of users help stakeholders to provide a better
support to communities. Below we present an experiment where we detect
communities, their evolution and based on the data characterize users that
stay, leave or join a community. Using a resulted feature set and logistic
regression we operate with models of users that are joining and users that are
staying in a community. In the related work we emphasize a number of features
we will include in our future experiments to enhance train accuracy. This work
represents a first from a series of experiments devoted to user fluctuation in
communities.

 <dc:description>  Aggregators are playing an increasingly crucial role in the integration of
renewable generation in power systems. However, the intermittent nature of
renewable generation makes market interactions of aggregators difficult to
monitor and regulate, raising concerns about potential market manipulation by
aggregators. In this paper, we study this issue by quantifying the profit an
aggregator can obtain through strategic curtailment of generation in an
electricity market. We show that, while the problem of maximizing the benefit
from curtailment is hard in general, efficient algorithms exist when the
topology of the network is radial (acyclic). Further, we highlight that
significant increases in profit are possible via strategic curtailment in
practical settings.

 <dc:description>  Low rank approximation of matrices has been well studied in literature.
Singular value decomposition, QR decomposition with column pivoting, rank
revealing QR factorization (RRQR), Interpolative decomposition etc are
classical deterministic algorithms for low rank approximation. But these
techniques are very expensive $(O(n^{3})$ operations are required for $n\times
n$ matrices). There are several randomized algorithms available in the
literature which are not so expensive as the classical techniques (but the
complexity is not linear in n). So, it is very expensive to construct the low
rank approximation of a matrix if the dimension of the matrix is very large.
There are alternative techniques like Cross/Skeleton approximation which gives
the low-rank approximation with linear complexity in n . In this article we
review low rank approximation techniques briefly and give extensive references
of many techniques.

 <dc:description>  Optimal power flow (OPF) is the central optimization problem in electric
power grids. Although solved routinely in the course of power grid operations,
it is known to be strongly NP-hard in general, and weakly NP-hard over tree
networks. In this paper, we formulate the optimal power flow problem over tree
networks as an inference problem over a tree-structured graphical model where
the nodal variables are low-dimensional vectors. We adapt the standard dynamic
programming algorithm for inference over a tree-structured graphical model to
the OPF problem. Combining this with an interval discretization of the nodal
variables, we develop an approximation algorithm for the OPF problem. Further,
we use techniques from constraint programming (CP) to perform interval
computations and adaptive bound propagation to obtain practically efficient
algorithms. Compared to previous algorithms that solve OPF with optimality
guarantees using convex relaxations, our approach is able to work for arbitrary
distribution networks and handle mixed-integer optimization problems. Further,
it can be implemented in a distributed message-passing fashion that is scalable
and is suitable for &quot;smart grid&quot; applications like control of distributed
energy resources. We evaluate our technique numerically on several benchmark
networks and show that practical OPF problems can be solved effectively using
this approach.

 <dc:description>  This volume constitutes the proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on
Physics and Computation (PC 2016). The workshop was held on the 14th of July
2016 in Manchester, UK, as a satellite workshop to UCNC 2016, the 15th
International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation.
  The goal of the workshop series is to bring together researches working on
the interaction between physics and the theory of computation. This
intrinsically interdisciplinary domain of research strives to go beyond the
traditional use of mathematics as a tool to model and understand the behaviour
of physical systems. Instead, it looks to the the theory of computation and
information to provide new insights into physical systems and processes, and,
in turn, how these insights can lead to new methods, models and notation of
computation and new approaches to computational and mathematical problems.
Topics falling into this category at the interface of physics and computation
that are within the scope of the conference include, amongst many others, the
axiomatisation of physics, hypercomputation, the role of information in
physical systems, quantum information, randomness in physics, theories of
measurement, and the philosophy of physics and computation.

 <dc:description>  Half a decade after Bitcoin became the first widely used cryptocurrency,
blockchains are receiving considerable interest from industry and the research
community. Modern blockchains feature services such as name registration and
smart contracts. Some employ new forms of consensus, such as proof-of-stake
instead of proof-of-work. However, these blockchains are so far relatively
poorly investigated, despite the fact that they move considerable assets. In
this paper, we explore three representative, modern blockchains---Ethereum,
Namecoin, and Peercoin. Our focus is on the features that set them apart from
the pure currency use case of Bitcoin. We investigate the blockchains' activity
in terms of transactions and usage patterns, identifying some curiosities in
the process. For Ethereum, we are mostly interested in the smart contract
functionality it offers. We also carry out a brief analysis of issues that are
introduced by negligent design of smart contracts. In the case of Namecoin, our
focus is how the name registration is used and has developed over time. For
Peercoin, we are interested in the use of proof-of-stake, as this consensus
algorithm is poorly understood yet used to move considerable value. Finally, we
relate the above to the fundamental characteristics of the underlying
peer-to-peer networks. We present a crawler for Ethereum and give statistics on
the network size. For Peercoin and Namecoin, we identify the relatively small
size of the networks and the weak bootstrapping process.

 <dc:description>  Recent deep learning based approaches have achieved great success on
handwriting recognition. Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted
writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on
recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only one
aspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task
is to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters.
In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network
(RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a
generative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize
Chinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural
network (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwriting
trajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach is
an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and
does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combining
an LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the
ICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, a
conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for
automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters
(in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the
discriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the
effectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for
the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters.

 <dc:title>An Uncertainty-Aware Approach to Optimal Configuration of Stream

 <dc:creator>Jamshidi, Pooyan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Casale, Giuliano</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Finding optimal configurations for Stream Processing Systems (SPS) is a
challenging problem due to the large number of parameters that can influence
their performance and the lack of analytical models to anticipate the effect of
a change. To tackle this issue, we consider tuning methods where an
experimenter is given a limited budget of experiments and needs to carefully
allocate this budget to find optimal configurations. We propose in this setting
Bayesian Optimization for Configuration Optimization (BO4CO), an auto-tuning
algorithm that leverages Gaussian Processes (GPs) to iteratively capture
posterior distributions of the configuration spaces and sequentially drive the
experimentation. Validation based on Apache Storm demonstrates that our
approach locates optimal configurations within a limited experimental budget,
with an improvement of SPS performance typically of at least an order of
magnitude compared to existing configuration algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Order-invariant formulas access an ordering on a structure's universe, but
the model relation is independent of the used ordering. Order invariance is
frequently used for logic-based approaches in computer science. Order-invariant
formulas capture unordered problems of complexity classes and they model the
independence of the answer to a database query from low-level aspects of
databases. We study the expressive power of order-invariant monadic
second-order (MSO) and first-order (FO) logic on restricted classes of
structures that admit certain forms of tree decompositions (not necessarily of
bounded width).
  While order-invariant MSO is more expressive than MSO and, even, CMSO (MSO
with modulo-counting predicates), we show that order-invariant MSO and CMSO are
equally expressive on graphs of bounded tree width and on planar graphs. This
extends an earlier result for trees due to Courcelle. Moreover, we show that
all properties definable in order-invariant FO are also definable in MSO on
these classes. These results are applications of a theorem that shows how to
lift up definability results for order-invariant logics from the bags of a
graph's tree decomposition to the graph itself.

 <dc:title>An artificial neural network to find correlation patterns in an

 <dc:description>  Methods to find correlation among variables are of interest to many
disciplines, including statistics, machine learning, (big) data mining and
neurosciences. Parameters that measure correlation between two variables are of
limited utility when used with multiple variables. In this work, I propose a
simple criterion to measure correlation among an arbitrary number of variables,
based on a data set. The central idea is to i) design a function of the
variables that can take different forms depending on a set of parameters, ii)
calculate the difference between a statistics associated to the function
computed on the data set and the same statistics computed on a randomised
version of the data set, called &quot;scrambled&quot; data set, and iii) optimise the
parameters to maximise this difference. Many such functions can be organised in
layers, which can in turn be stacked one on top of the other, forming a neural
network. The function parameters are searched with an enhanced genetic
algortihm called POET and the resulting method is tested on a cancer gene data
set. The method may have potential implications for some issues that affect the
field of neural networks, such as overfitting, the need to process huge amounts
of data for training and the presence of &quot;adversarial examples&quot;.

 <dc:description>  Rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has
brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on
society. In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of
accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful
behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present
a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk,
categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong
objective function (&quot;avoiding side effects&quot; and &quot;avoiding reward hacking&quot;), an
objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently (&quot;scalable
supervision&quot;), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (&quot;safe
exploration&quot; and &quot;distributional shift&quot;). We review previous work in these
areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to
cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to
think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.

 <dc:title>Faster Computation of Path-Width</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>F&#xfc;rer, Martin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Tree-width and path-width are widely successful concepts. Many NP-hard
problems have efficient solutions when restricted to graphs of bounded
tree-width. Many efficient algorithms are based on a tree decomposition.
Sometimes the more restricted path decomposition is required. The bottleneck
for such algorithms is often the computation of the width and a corresponding
tree or path decomposition. For graphs with $n$ vertices and tree-width or
path-width $k$, the standard linear time algorithm to compute these
decompositions dates back to 1996. Its running time is linear in $n$ and
exponential in $k^3$ and not usable in practice. Here we present a more
efficient algorithm to compute the path-width and provide a path decomposition.
Its running time is $2^{O(k^2)} n$. In the classical algorithm of Bodlaender
and Kloks, the path decomposition is computed from a tree decomposition. Here,
an optimal path decomposition is computed from a path decomposition of about
twice the width. The latter is computed from a constant factor smaller graph.

 <dc:description>  In digital circuits, metastability can cause deteriorated signals that
neither are logical 0 or logical 1, breaking the abstraction of Boolean logic.
Unfortunately, any way of reading a signal from an unsynchronized clock domain
or performing an analog-to-digital conversion incurs the risk of a metastable
upset; no digital circuit can deterministically avoid, resolve, or detect
metastability (Marino, 1981). Synchronizers, the only traditional
countermeasure, exponentially decrease the odds of maintained metastability
over time. Trading synchronization delay for an increased probability to
resolve metastability to logical 0 or 1, they do not guarantee success.
  We propose a fundamentally different approach: It is possible to contain
metastability by fine-grained logical masking so that it cannot infect the
entire circuit. This technique guarantees a limited degree of metastability
in---and uncertainty about---the output.
  At the heart of our approach lies a time- and value-discrete model for
metastability in synchronous clocked digital circuits. Metastability is
propagated in a worst-case fashion, allowing to derive deterministic
guarantees, without and unlike synchronizers. The proposed model permits
positive results and passes the test of reproducing Marino's impossibility
results. We fully classify which functions can be computed by circuits with
standard registers. Regarding masking registers, we show that they become
computationally strictly more powerful with each clock cycle, resulting in a
non-trivial hierarchy of computable functions.

 <dc:title>Lower Bounds on Parameter Modulation-Estimation Under Bandwidth
  Constraints</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weinberger, Nir</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Merhav, Neri</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of modulating the value of a parameter onto a
band-limited signal to be transmitted over a continuous-time, additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, and estimating this parameter at the receiver.
The performance is measured by the mean power-$\alpha$ error (MP$\alpha$E),
which is defined as the worst-case $\alpha$-th order moment of the absolute
estimation error. The optimal exponential decay rate of the MP$\alpha$E as a
function of the transmission time, is investigated. Two upper (converse) bounds
on the MP$\alpha$E exponent are derived, on the basis of known bounds for the
AWGN channel of inputs with unlimited bandwidth. The bounds are computed for
typical values of the error moment and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the
SNR asymptotics of the different bounds are analyzed. The new bounds are
compared to known converse and achievability bounds, which were derived from
channel coding considerations.

 <dc:description>  Consider a non-hamiltonian graph $G$. $G$ is &lt;i&gt;hypohamiltonian&lt;/i&gt; if for
every vertex $v$ in $G$, the graph $G - v$ is hamiltonian. $G$ is &lt;i&gt;almost
hypohamiltonian&lt;/i&gt; if there exists a vertex $w$ in $G$ such that $G - w$ is
non-hamiltonian, and $G - v$ is hamiltonian for every vertex $v \ne w$. McKay
asked in [J. Graph Theory, doi: 10.1002/jgt.22043] whether infinitely many
planar cubic hypohamiltonian graphs of girth 5 exist. We settle this question
affirmatively.
  The second author asked in [J. Graph Theory 79 (2015) 63--81] to find all
orders for which almost hypohamiltonian graphs exist---we solve this problem as
well. To this end, we present a specialised algorithm which generates complete
sets of almost hypohamiltonian graphs for various orders. Furthermore, we show
that the smallest cubic almost hypohamiltonian graphs have order 26. We also
provide a lower bound for the order of the smallest planar almost
hypohamiltonian graph and improve the upper bound for the order of the smallest
planar almost hypohamiltonian graph containing a cubic vertex. Finally, we
determine the smallest planar almost hypohamiltonian graphs of girth 5, both in
the general and cubic case.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study contention resolution protocols from a game-theoretic
perspective. We focus on \emph{acknowledgment-based} protocols, where a user
gets feedback from the channel only when she attempts transmission. In this
case she will learn whether her transmission was successful or not. Users that
do not transmit will not receive any feedback. We are interested in equilibrium
protocols, where no player has an incentive to deviate.
  The limited feedback makes the design of equilibrium protocols a hard task as
best response policies usually have to be modeled as Partially Observable
Markov Decision Processes, which are hard to analyze. Nevertheless, we show how
to circumvent this for the case of two players and present an equilibrium
protocol. For many players, we give impossibility results for a large class of
acknowledgment-based protocols, namely \emph{age-based} and \emph{backoff}
protocols with finite expected finishing time. Finally, we provide an age-based
equilibrium protocol, which has infinite expected finishing time, but every
player finishes in linear time with high probability.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Jaeger, Vertigan, and Welsh [15] proved a dichotomy for the complexity of
evaluating the Tutte polynomial at fixed points: The evaluation is #P-hard
almost everywhere, and the remaining points admit polynomial-time algorithms.
Dell, Husfeldt, and Wahl\'en [9] and Husfeldt and Taslaman [12], in combination
with Curticapean [7], extended the #P-hardness results to tight lower bounds
under the counting exponential time hypothesis #ETH, with the exception of the
line $y=1$, which was left open. We complete the dichotomy theorem for the
Tutte polynomial under #ETH by proving that the number of all acyclic subgraphs
of a given $n$-vertex graph cannot be determined in time $exp(o(n))$ unless
#ETH fails.
  Another dichotomy theorem we strengthen is the one of Creignou and Hermann
[6] for counting the number of satisfying assignments to a constraint
satisfaction problem instance over the Boolean domain. We prove that all
#P-hard cases are also hard under #ETH. The main ingredient is to prove that
the number of independent sets in bipartite graphs with $n$ vertices cannot be
computed in time $exp(o(n))$ unless #ETH fails. In order to prove our results,
we use the block interpolation idea by Curticapean [7] and transfer it to
systems of linear equations that might not directly correspond to
interpolation.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised learning and supervised learning are key research topics in deep
learning. However, as high-capacity supervised neural networks trained with a
large amount of labels have achieved remarkable success in many computer vision
tasks, the availability of large-scale labeled images reduced the significance
of unsupervised learning. Inspired by the recent trend toward revisiting the
importance of unsupervised learning, we investigate joint supervised and
unsupervised learning in a large-scale setting by augmenting existing neural
networks with decoding pathways for reconstruction. First, we demonstrate that
the intermediate activations of pretrained large-scale classification networks
preserve almost all the information of input images except a portion of local
spatial details. Then, by end-to-end training of the entire augmented
architecture with the reconstructive objective, we show improvement of the
network performance for supervised tasks. We evaluate several variants of
autoencoders, including the recently proposed &quot;what-where&quot; autoencoder that
uses the encoder pooling switches, to study the importance of the architecture
design. Taking the 16-layer VGGNet trained under the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012
protocol as a strong baseline for image classification, our methods improve the
validation-set accuracy by a noticeable margin.

 <dc:description>  We study the responses of two tactile sensors, the fingertip sensor from the
iCub and the BioTac under different external stimuli. The question of interest
is to which degree both sensors i) allow the estimation of force exerted on the
sensor and ii) enable the recognition of differing degrees of curvature. Making
use of a force controlled linear motor affecting the tactile sensors we acquire
several high-quality data sets allowing the study of both sensors under exactly
the same conditions. We also examined the structure of the representation of
tactile stimuli in the recorded tactile sensor data using t-SNE embeddings. The
experiments show that both the iCub and the BioTac excel in different settings.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a distributed Newton method for consensus
optimization. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including
ADMM. The key idea is to exploit the sparsity of the dual Hessian and recast
the computation of the Newton step as one of efficiently solving symmetric
diagonally dominant linear equations. We validate our algorithm both
theoretically and empirically. On the theory side, we demonstrate that our
algorithm exhibits superlinear convergence within a neighborhood of optimality.
Empirically, we show the superiority of this new method on a variety of machine
learning problems. The proposed approach is scalable to very large problems and
has a low communication overhead.

 <dc:description>  As a result of the application of a technique of multistep processes
stochastic models construction the range of models, implemented as a
self-consistent differential equations, was obtained. These are partial
differential equations (master equation, the Fokker--Planck equation) and
stochastic differential equations (Langevin equation). However, analytical
methods do not always allow to research these equations adequately. It is
proposed to use the combined analytical and numerical approach studying these
equations. For this purpose the numerical part is realized within the framework
of symbolic computation. It is recommended to apply stochastic Runge--Kutta
methods for numerical study of stochastic differential equations in the form of
the Langevin. Under this approach, a program complex on the basis of analytical
calculations metasystem Sage is developed. For model verification logarithmic
walks and Black--Scholes two-dimensional model are used. To illustrate the
stochastic &quot;predator--prey&quot; type model is used. The utility of the combined
numerical-analytical approach is demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  The Block Tree is a recently proposed data structure that reaches compression
close to Lempel-Ziv while supporting efficient direct access to text
substrings. In this paper we show how a self-index can be built on top of a
Block Tree so that it provides efficient pattern searches while using space
proportional to that of the original data structure. More precisely, if a
Lempel-Ziv parse cuts a text of length $n$ into $z$ non-overlapping phrases,
then our index uses $O(z\log(n/z))$ words and finds the $occ$ occurrences of a
pattern of length $m$ in time $O(m\log n+occ\log^\epsilon n)$ for any constant
$\epsilon&gt;0$.

 <dc:description>  Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering natural-language
questions about images. We introduce the novel problem of determining the
relevance of questions to images in VQA. Current VQA models do not reason about
whether a question is even related to the given image (e.g. What is the capital
of Argentina?) or if it requires information from external resources to answer
correctly. This can break the continuity of a dialogue in human-machine
interaction. Our approaches for determining relevance are composed of two
stages. Given an image and a question, (1) we first determine whether the
question is visual or not, (2) if visual, we determine whether the question is
relevant to the given image or not. Our approaches, based on LSTM-RNNs, VQA
model uncertainty, and caption-question similarity, are able to outperform
strong baselines on both relevance tasks. We also present human studies showing
that VQA models augmented with such question relevance reasoning are perceived
as more intelligent, reasonable, and human-like.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the integration of word embeddings as classification features
in the setting of large scale text classification. Such representations have
been used in a plethora of tasks, however their application in classification
scenarios with thousands of classes has not been extensively researched,
partially due to hardware limitations. In this work, we examine efficient
composition functions to obtain document-level from word-level embeddings and
we subsequently investigate their combination with the traditional
one-hot-encoding representations. By presenting empirical evidence on large,
multi-class, multi-label classification problems, we demonstrate the efficiency
and the performance benefits of this combination.

 <dc:description>  Multi-layered networks represent a major advance in the description of
natural complex systems, and their study has shed light on new physical
phenomena. Despite its importance, however, the role of the temporal dimension
in their structure and function has not been investigated in much detail so
far. Here we study the temporal correlations between layers exhibited by real
social multiplex networks. At a basic level, the presence of such correlations
implies a certain degree of predictability in the contact pattern, as we
quantify by an extension of the entropy and mutual information analyses
proposed for the single-layer case. At a different level, we demonstrate that
temporal correlations are a signature of a 'multitasking' behavior of network
agents, characterized by a higher level of switching between different social
activities than expected in a uncorrelated pattern. Moreover, temporal
correlations significantly affect the dynamics of coupled epidemic processes
unfolding on the network. Our work opens the way for the systematic study of
temporal multiplex networks and we anticipate it will be of interest to
researchers in a broad array of fields.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a parallel version of Galton-Watson processes for the
random generation of tree-shaped structures. Random trees are useful in many
situations (testing, binary search, simulation of physics phenomena,...) as
attests more than 49000 citations on Google scholar. Using standard analytic
combinatorics, we first give a theoretical, average-case study of the random
process in order to evaluate how parallelism can be extracted from this
process, and we deduce a parallel generation algorithm. Then we present how it
can be implemented in a task-based parallel paradigm for shared memory (here,
Intel Cilk). This implementation faces several challenges, among which
efficient, thread-safe random bit generation, memory management and algorithmic
modifications for small-grain parallelism. Finally, we evaluate the performance
of our implementation and the impact of different choices and parameters. We
obtain a significant efficiency improvement for the generation of big trees. We
also conduct empirical and theoretical studies of the average behaviour of our
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a general and simple structural design called Multiplicative
Integration (MI) to improve recurrent neural networks (RNNs). MI changes the
way in which information from difference sources flows and is integrated in the
computational building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra
parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN
models, including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour
and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our
experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a
substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models.

 <dc:title>Intriguingly Simple and Efficient Time-Dependent Routing in Road

 <dc:creator>Strasser, Ben</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the earliest arrival problem in road networks with static
time-dependent functions as arc weights. We propose and evaluate the following
simple algorithm: (1) average the travel time in k time windows, (2) compute a
shortest time-independent path within each window and mark the edges in these
paths, and (3) compute a shortest time-dependent path in the original graph
restricted to the marked edges. Our experimental evaluation shows that this
simple algorithm yields near optimal results on well-established benchmark
instances. We additionally demonstrate that the error can be further reduced by
additionally considering alternative routes at the expense of more marked
edges. Finally, we show that the achieved subgraphs are small enough to be able
to efficiently implement profile queries using a simple sampling-based
approach. A highlight of our introduced algorithms is that they do not rely on
linking and merging profile functions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates neural character-based morphological tagging for
languages with complex morphology and large tag sets. We systematically explore
a variety of neural architectures (DNN, CNN, CNNHighway, LSTM, BLSTM) to obtain
character-based word vectors combined with bidirectional LSTMs to model
across-word context in an end-to-end setting. We explore supplementary use of
word-based vectors trained on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments
for morphological tagging suggest that for &quot;simple&quot; model configurations, the
choice of the network architecture (CNN vs. CNNHighway vs. LSTM vs. BLSTM) or
the augmentation with pre-trained word embeddings can be important and clearly
impact the accuracy. Increasing the model capacity by adding depth, for
example, and carefully optimizing the neural networks can lead to substantial
improvements, and the differences in accuracy (but not training time) become
much smaller or even negligible. Overall, our best morphological taggers for
German and Czech outperform the best results reported in the literature by a
large margin.

 <dc:title>How DNA Cryptography can help whistleblowers and refugees</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The recent progress in DNA sequencing will probably revolutionize the world
of electronic. Hence, we went from DNA sequencing that only research centers
could realize, to portable, tiny and inexpensive tools. So, it is likely that
in a few years these DNA sequencers will be included in our smartphones.
  The purpose of this paper is to support this revolution, by using the DNA
cryptography, hash functions and social networks. The first application will
introduce a mutual entity authentication protocol in order to help waifs,
refugees, and victims of human trafficking to find their biological parents
online.
  The second application will also use the DNA cryptography and the social
networks to protect whistleblowers' actions. For example, this method will
allow whistleblowers to securely broadcast on social networks, their
information with one grape.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a network for volumetric segmentation that learns from
sparsely annotated volumetric images. We outline two attractive use cases of
this method: (1) In a semi-automated setup, the user annotates some slices in
the volume to be segmented. The network learns from these sparse annotations
and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume
that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this
data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed
network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by
replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation
performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during
training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network
is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex,
highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for
both use cases.

 <dc:description>  Graph Signal Processing generalizes classical signal processing to signal or
data indexed by the vertices of a weighted graph. So far, the research efforts
have been focused on static graph signals. However numerous applications
involve graph signals evolving in time, such as spreading or propagation of
waves on a network. The analysis of this type of data requires a new set of
methods that fully takes into account the time and graph dimensions. We propose
a novel class of wavelet frames named Dynamic Graph Wavelets, whose time-vertex
evolution follows a dynamic process. We demonstrate that this set of functions
can be combined with sparsity based approaches such as compressive sensing to
reveal information on the dynamic processes occurring on a graph. Experiments
on real seismological data show the efficiency of the technique, allowing to
estimate the epicenter of earthquake events recorded by a seismic network.

For any simple polygon $P$, a grid polygon exists with constant Hausdorff
distance between their boundaries and their interiors. Moreover, we show that
with a realistic input assumption we can also realize constant Fr\'echet
distance between the boundaries. We present algorithms accompanying these
constructions, heuristics to improve their output while keeping the distance

 <dc:description>  We study a revenue maximization problem in the context of social networks.
Namely, we consider a model introduced by Alon, Mansour, and Tennenholtz (EC
2013) that captures inequity aversion, i.e., prices offered to neighboring
vertices should not be significantly different. We first provide approximation
algorithms for a natural class of instances, referred to as the class of
single-value revenue functions. Our results improve on the current state of the
art, especially when the number of distinct prices is small. This applies, for
example, to settings where the seller will only consider a fixed number of
discount types or special offers. We then resolve one of the open questions
posed in Alon et al., by establishing APX-hardness for the problem.
Surprisingly, we further show that the problem is NP-complete even when the
price differences are allowed to be relatively large. Finally, we also provide
some extensions of the model of Alon et al., regarding either the allowed set
of prices, or the demand type of the clients.

 <dc:title>Instruments on large optical telescopes -- A case study</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kulkarni, S. R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the distant past, telescopes were known, first and foremost, for the sizes
of their apertures. Advances in technology are now enabling astronomers to
build extremely powerful instruments to the extent that instruments have now
achieved importance comparable or even exceeding the usual importance accorded
to the apertures of the telescopes. However, the cost of successive generations
of instruments has risen at a rate noticeably above that of the rate of
inflation. Here, given the vast sums of money now being expended on optical
telescopes and their instrumentation, I argue that astronomers must undertake
&quot;cost-benefit&quot; analysis for future planning. I use the scientific output of the
first two decades of the W. M. Keck Observatory as a laboratory for this
purpose. I find, in the absence of upgrades, that the time to reach peak paper
production for an instrument is about six years. The prime lifetime of
instruments (sans upgrades), as measured by citations returns, is about a
decade. Well thought out and timely upgrades increase and sometimes even double
the useful lifetime. I investigate how well instrument builders are rewarded. I
find acknowledgements ranging from almost 100% to as low as 60%. Next, given
the increasing cost of operating optical telescopes, the management of existing
observatories continue to seek new partnerships. This naturally raises the
question &quot;What is the cost of a single night of telescope time&quot;. I provide a
rational basis to compute this quantity. I then end the paper with some
thoughts on the future of large ground-based optical telescopes, bearing in
mind the explosion of synoptic precision photometric, astrometric and imaging
surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum, the increasing cost of
instrumentation and the rise of mega instruments.

 <dc:description>  The assessment of protein expression in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images
provides important diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information for
guiding cancer diagnosis and therapy. Manual scoring of IHC images represents a
logistical challenge, as the process is labor intensive and time consuming.
Since the last decade, computational methods have been developed to enable the
application of quantitative methods for the analysis and interpretation of
protein expression in IHC images. These methods have not yet replaced manual
scoring for the assessment of IHC in the majority of diagnostic laboratories
and in many large-scale research studies. An alternative approach is
crowdsourcing the quantification of IHC images to an undefined crowd. The aim
of this study is to quantify IHC images for labeling of ER status with two
different crowdsourcing approaches, image labeling and nuclei labeling, and
compare their performance with automated methods. Crowdsourcing-derived scores
obtained greater concordance with the pathologist interpretations for both
image labeling and nuclei labeling tasks (83% and 87%), as compared to the
pathologist concordance achieved by the automated method (81%) on 5,483 TMA
images from 1,909 breast cancer patients. This analysis shows that
crowdsourcing the scoring of protein expression in IHC images is a promising
new approach for large scale cancer molecular pathology studies.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a predictive controller for handling plug-and-play (P&amp;P)
charging requests of flexible loads in a distribution system. We define two
types of flexible loads: (i) deferrable loads that have a fixed power profile
but can be deferred in time and (ii) shapeable loads that have flexible power
profiles but fixed energy requests, such as Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs).
The proposed method uses a hierarchical control scheme based on a model
predictive control (MPC) formulation for minimizing the global system cost. The
first stage computes a reachable reference that trades off deviation from the
nominal voltage with the required generation control. The second stage uses a
price-based objective to aggregate flexible loads and provide load shaping
services, while satisfying system constraints and users' preferences at all
times. It is shown that the proposed controller is recursively feasible under
specific conditions, i.e. the flexible load demands are satisfied and bus
voltages remain within the desired limits. Finally, the proposed scheme is
illustrated on a 55 bus radial distribution network.

 <dc:description>  The uplink data arriving at the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Application Server
(AS) via M2M Aggregators (MAs) is fairly heterogeneous along several dimensions
such as maximum tolerable packet delay, payload size and arrival rate, thus
necessitating the design of Quality-of-Service (QoS) aware packet scheduler. In
this paper, we classify the M2M uplink data into multiple QoS classes and use
sigmoidal function to map the delay requirements of each class onto utility
functions. We propose a proportionally fair delay-optimal multiclass packet
scheduler at AS that maximizes a system utility metric. We note that the
average class delay under any work-conserving scheduling policy can be realized
by appropriately time-sharing between all possible preemptive priority
policies. Therefore the optimal scheduler is determined using an iterative
process to determine the optimal time-sharing between all priority scheduling
policies, such that it results in maximum system utility. The proposed
scheduler can be implemented online with reduced complexity due to the
iterative optimization process. We then extend this work to determine jointly
optimal MA-AS channel allocation and packet scheduling scheme at the MAs and
AS. We first formulate a joint optimization problem that is solved centrally at
the AS and then propose a low complexity distributed optimization problem
solved independently at MAs and AS. We show that the distributed optimization
solution converges quickly to the centralized optimization result with minimal
information exchange overhead between MAs and AS. Using Monte-Carlo
simulations, we verify the optimality of the proposed scheduler and show that
it outperforms other state-of-the-art packet schedulers such as weighted round
robin, max-weight scheduler etc. Another desirable feature of proposed
scheduler is low delay jitter for delay-sensitive traffic.

 <dc:description>  Recent experimental studies have shown that traffic management systems are
vulnerable to cyber-attacks on sensor data. This paper studies the
vulnerability of fixed-time control of signalized intersections when sensors
measuring traffic flow information are compromised and perturbed by an
adversary. The problems are formulated by considering three malicious
objectives: 1) worst-case network accumulation, which aims to destabilize the
overall network as much as possible; 2) worst-case lane accumulation, which
aims to cause worst-case accumulation on some target lanes; and 3) risk-averse
target accumulation, which aims to reach a target accumulation by making the
minimum perturbation to sensor data. The problems are solved using bilevel
programming optimization methods. Finally, a case study of a real network is
used to illustrate the results.

 <dc:description>  Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles crossing an
intersection, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and their safety-critical nature
makes them a target for malicious adversaries. This paper studies the problem
of supervisory control of autonomous intersections in the presence of sensor
attacks. Sensor attacks are performed when an adversary gains access to the
transmission channel and corrupts the measurements before they are received by
the decision-making unit. We show that the supervisory control system is
vulnerable to sensor attacks that can cause collision or deadlock among
vehicles. To improve the system resilience, we introduce a detector in the
control architecture and focus on stealthy attacks that cannot be detected but
are capable of compromising safety. We then present a resilient supervisory
control system that is safe, non-deadlocking, and maximally permissive, despite
the presence of disturbances, uncontrolled vehicles, and sensor attacks.
Finally, we demonstrate how the resilient supervisor works by considering
illustrative examples.

 <dc:description>  Virtual colonoscopy (VC) allows a physician to virtually navigate within a
reconstructed 3D colon model searching for colorectal polyps. Though VC is
widely recognized as a highly sensitive and specific test for identifying
polyps, one limitation is the reading time, which can take over 30 minutes per
patient. Large amounts of the colon are often devoid of polyps, and a way of
identifying these polyp-free segments could be of valuable use in reducing the
required reading time for the interrogating radiologist. To this end, we have
tested the ability of the collective crowd intelligence of non-expert workers
to identify polyp candidates and polyp-free regions. We presented twenty short
videos flying through a segment of a virtual colon to each worker, and the
crowd was asked to determine whether or not a possible polyp was observed
within that video segment. We evaluated our framework on Amazon Mechanical Turk
and found that the crowd was able to achieve a sensitivity of 80.0% and
specificity of 86.5% in identifying video segments which contained a clinically
proven polyp. Since each polyp appeared in multiple consecutive segments, all
polyps were in fact identified. Using the crowd results as a first pass, 80% of
the video segments could in theory be skipped by the radiologist, equating to a
significant time savings and enabling more VC examinations to be performed.

 <dc:description>  Declarative styles such as functional programming (FP) are rapidly gaining
ground on their imperative cousins, including procedural and object-oriented
programming. The shift is subtle because it is happening within the context of
multiparadigm programming languages such as JavaScript. FP is better suited to
modern processes like test-driven development (TDD), and architectures like
massively parallel, cloud-based computing. This article describes the technical
details that characterize the shift from imperative to FP and implications for
software quality management, particularly reuse and testability.

 <dc:description>  In cyber-physical systems, malicious and resourceful attackers could
penetrate the system through cyber means and cause significant physical damage.
Consequently, detection of such attacks becomes integral towards making these
systems resilient to attacks. To achieve this objective, intrusion detection
systems (IDS) that are able to detect malicious behavior can be deployed.
However, practical IDS are imperfect and sometimes they may produce false
alarms for a normal system behavior. Since alarms need to be investigated for
any potential damage, a large number of false alarms may increase the
operational costs significantly. Thus, IDS need to be configured properly, as
oversensitive IDS could detect attacks early but at the cost of a higher number
of false alarms. Similarly, IDS with low sensitivity could reduce the false
alarms while increasing the time to detect the attacks. The configuration of
IDS to strike the right balance between time to detecting attacks and the rate
of false positives is a challenging task, especially in dynamic environments,
in which the damage incurred by a successful attack is time-varying.
  In this paper, we study the problem of finding optimal detection thresholds
for anomaly-based detectors implemented in dynamical systems in the face of
strategic attacks. We formulate the problem as an attacker-defender security
game, and determine thresholds for the detector to achieve an optimal trade-off
between the detection delay and the false positive rates. In this direction,
first, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal fixed threshold that
remains fixed throughout. Second, we allow detector's threshold to change with
time to further minimize the defender's loss and provide an algorithm to
compute time-varying thresholds, which we call adaptive thresholds. Finally, we
numerically evaluate our results using a water distribution network as a
case-study.

 <dc:description>  We present a framework for efficient perceptual inference that explicitly
reasons about the segmentation of its inputs and features. Rather than being
trained for any specific segmentation, our framework learns the grouping
process in an unsupervised manner or alongside any supervised task. By
enriching the representations of a neural network, we enable it to group the
representations of different objects in an iterative manner. By allowing the
system to amortize the iterative inference of the groupings, we achieve very
fast convergence. In contrast to many other recently proposed methods for
addressing multi-object scenes, our system does not assume the inputs to be
images and can therefore directly handle other modalities. For multi-digit
classification of very cluttered images that require texture segmentation, our
method offers improved classification performance over convolutional networks
despite being fully connected. Furthermore, we observe that our system greatly
improves on the semi-supervised result of a baseline Ladder network on our
dataset, indicating that segmentation can also improve sample efficiency.

 <dc:description>  The performance of value classes is highly dependent on how they are
represented in the virtual machine. Value class instances are immutable, have
no identity, and can only refer to other value objects or primitive values and
since they should be very lightweight and fast, it is important to optimize
them carefully. In this paper we present a technique to detect and compress
common patterns of value class usage to improve memory usage and performance.
The technique identifies patterns of frequent value object references and
introduces abbreviated forms for them. This allows to store multiple
inter-referenced value objects in an inlined memory representation, reducing
the overhead stemming from meta-data and object references. Applied to a small
prototype and an implementation of the Racket language, we found improvements
in memory usage and execution time for several micro-benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Modern software systems often consist of many different components, each with
a number of options. Although unit tests may reveal faulty options for
individual components, functionally correct components may interact in
unforeseen ways to cause a fault. Covering arrays are used to test for
interactions among components systematically. A two-stage framework, providing
a number of concrete algorithms, is developed for the efficient construction of
covering arrays. %Our framework divides the construction in two stages. In the
first stage, a time and memory efficient randomized algorithm covers most of
the interactions. In the second stage, a more sophisticated search covers the
remainder in relatively few tests. In this way, the storage limitations of the
sophisticated search algorithms are avoided; hence the range of the number of
components for which the algorithm can be applied is extended, without
increasing the number of tests. Many of the framework instantiations can be
tuned to optimize a memory-quality trade-off, so that fewer tests can be
achieved using more memory. The algorithms developed outperform the currently
best known methods when the number of components ranges from 20 to 60, the
number of options for each ranges from 3 to 6, and $t$-way interactions are
covered for $t\in \{5,6\}$. In some cases a reduction in the number of tests by
more than $50\%$ is achieved.

 <dc:description>  We show that the mutual information between two symbols, as a function of the
number of symbols between the two, decays exponentially in any probabilistic
regular grammar, but can decay like a power law for a context-free grammar.
This result about formal languages is closely related to a well-known result in
classical statistical mechanics that there are no phase transitions in
dimensions fewer than two. It is also related to the emergence of power-law
correlations in turbulence and cosmological inflation through recursive
generative processes. We elucidate these physics connections and comment on
potential applications of our results to machine learning tasks like training
artificial recurrent neural networks. Along the way, we introduce a useful
quantity which we dub the rational mutual information and discuss
generalizations of our claims involving more complicated Bayesian networks.

 <dc:title>Network Analysis of Urban Traffic with Big Bus Data</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhao, Kai</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Urban traffic analysis is crucial for traffic forecasting systems, urban
planning and, more recently, various mobile and network applications. In this
paper, we analyse urban traffic with network and statistical methods. Our
analysis is based on one big bus dataset containing 45 million bus arrival
samples in Helsinki. We mainly address following questions: 1. How can we
identify the areas that cause most of the traffic in the city? 2. Why there is
a urban traffic? Is bus traffic a key cause of the urban traffic? 3. How can we
improve the urban traffic systems? To answer these questions, first, the
betweenness is used to identify the most import areas that cause most traffics.
Second, we find that bus traffic is not an important cause of urban traffic
using statistical methods. We differentiate the urban traffic and the bus
traffic in a city. We use bus delay as an identification of the urban traffic,
and the number of bus as an identification of the bus traffic. Third, we give
our solutions on how to improve urban traffic by the traffic simulation on road
networks. We show that adding more buses during the peak time and providing
better bus schedule plan in the hot areas like railway station, metro station,
shopping malls etc. will reduce the urban traffic.

 <dc:title>A Stackelberg Game Perspective on the Conflict Between Machine Learning

 <dc:description>  Data is the new oil; this refrain is repeated extensively in the age of
internet tracking, machine learning, and data analytics. Social network
analysis, cookie-based advertising, and government surveillance are all
evidence of the use of data for commercial and national interests. Public
pressure, however, is mounting for the protection of privacy. Frameworks such
as differential privacy offer machine learning algorithms methods to guarantee
limits to information disclosure, but they are seldom implemented. Recently,
however, developers have made significant efforts to undermine tracking through
obfuscation tools that hide user characteristics in a sea of noise. These
services highlight an emerging clash between tracking and data obfuscation. In
this paper, we conceptualize this conflict through a dynamic game between users
and a machine learning algorithm that uses empirical risk minimization. First,
a machine learner declares a privacy protection level, and then users respond
by choosing their own perturbation amounts. We study the interaction between
the users and the learner using a Stackelberg game. The utility functions
quantify accuracy using expected loss and privacy in terms of the bounds of
differential privacy. In equilibrium, we find selfish users tend to cause
significant utility loss to trackers by perturbing heavily, in a phenomenon
reminiscent of public good games. Trackers, however, can improve the balance by
proactively perturbing the data themselves. While other work in this area has
studied privacy markets and mechanism design for truthful reporting of user
information, we take a different viewpoint by considering both user and learner
perturbation.

 <dc:description>  Acquiring labels are often costly, whereas unlabeled data are usually easy to
obtain in modern machine learning applications. Semi-supervised learning
provides a principled machine learning framework to address such situations,
and has been applied successfully in many real-word applications and
industries. Nonetheless, most of existing semi-supervised learning methods
encounter two serious limitations when applied to modern and large-scale
datasets: computational burden and memory usage demand. To this end, we present
in this paper the Graph-based semi-supervised Kernel Machine (GKM), a method
that leverages the generalization ability of kernel-based method with the
geometrical and distributive information formulated through a spectral graph
induced from data for semi-supervised learning purpose. Our proposed GKM can be
solved directly in the primal form using the Stochastic Gradient Descent method
with the ideal convergence rate $O(\frac{1}{T})$. Besides, our formulation is
suitable for a wide spectrum of important loss functions in the literature of
machine learning (e.g., Hinge, smooth Hinge, Logistic, L1, and
{\epsilon}-insensitive) and smoothness functions (i.e., $l_p(t) = |t|^p$ with
$p\ge1$). We further show that the well-known Laplacian Support Vector Machine
is a special case of our formulation. We validate our proposed method on
several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that GKM is appropriate for the
large-scale datasets since it is optimal in memory usage and yields superior
classification accuracy whilst simultaneously achieving a significant
computation speed-up in comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines.

 <dc:title>A Delay-Optimal Packet Scheduler for M2M Uplink</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a delay-optimal packet scheduler for processing the
M2M uplink traffic at the M2M application server (AS). Due to the
delay-heterogeneity in uplink traffic, we classify it broadly into
delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive traffic. We then map the diverse delay
requirements of each class to sigmoidal functions of packet delay and formulate
a utility-maximization problem that results in a proportionally fair
delay-optimal scheduler. We note that solving this optimization problem is
equivalent to solving for the optimal fraction of time each class is served
with (preemptive) priority such that it maximizes the system utility. Using
Monte-Carlo simulations for the queuing process at AS, we verify the
correctness of the analytical result for optimal scheduler and show that it
outperforms other state-of-the-art packet schedulers such as weighted round
robin, max-weight scheduler, fair scheduler and priority scheduling. We also
note that at higher traffic arrival rate, the proposed scheduler results in a
near-minimal delay variance for the delay-sensitive traffic which is highly
desirable. This comes at the expense of somewhat higher delay variance for
delay-tolerant traffic which is usually acceptable due to its delay-tolerant
nature.

 <dc:description>  This extended abstract presents an overview on NP-hard optimization problems
with multiple interdependent components. These problems occur in many
real-world applications: industrial applications, engineering, and logistics.
The fact that these problems are composed of many sub-problems that are NP-hard
makes them even more challenging to solve using exact algorithms. This is
mainly due to the high complexity of this class of algorithms and the hardness
of the problems themselves. The main source of difficulty of these problems is
the presence of internal dependencies between sub-problems. This aspect of
interdependence of components is presented, and some outlines on solving
approaches are briefly introduced from a (meta)heuristics and evolutionary
computation perspective.

 <dc:title>Sequent Calculus Representations for Quantum Circuits</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When considering a sequent-style proof system for quantum programs, there are
certain elements of quantum mechanics that we may wish to capture, such as
phase, dynamics of unitary transformations, and measurement probabilities.
Traditional quantum logics which focus primarily on the abstract orthomodular
lattice theory and structures of Hilbert spaces have not satisfactorily
captured some of these elements. We can start from 'scratch' in an attempt to
conceptually characterize the types of proof rules which should be in a system
that represents elements necessary for quantum algorithms. This present work
attempts to do this from the perspective of the quantum circuit model of
quantum computation. A sequent calculus based on single quantum circuits is
suggested, and its ability to incorporate important conceptual and dynamic
aspects of quantum computing is discussed. In particular, preserving the
representation of phase helps illustrate the role of interference as a resource
in quantum computation. Interference also provides an intuitive basis for a
non-monotonic calculus.

 <dc:title>An Overview of Approaches to Modernize Quantum Annealing Using Local

 <dc:description>  I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state
space) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches
traditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm. The quantum
annealing algorithm is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical
numerical technique which is now obsolete. Hence, I explore strategies to use
an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization
algorithms, and additionally should be less sensitive to problem
mis-specification then the traditional quantum annealing algorithm.

 <dc:description>  What kind of object is a quantum state? Is it an object that encodes an
exponentially growing amount of information (in the size of the system) or more
akin to a probability distribution? It turns out that these questions are
sensitive to what we do with the information. For example, Holevo's bound tells
us that n qubits only encode n bits of classical information but for certain
communication complexity tasks there is an exponential separation between
quantum and classical resources. Instead of just contrasting quantum and
classical physics, we can place both within a broad landscape of physical
theories and ask how non-quantum (and non-classical) theories are different
from, or more powerful than quantum theory. For example, in communication
complexity, certain (non-quantum) theories can trivialise all communication
complexity tasks. In recent work [C. M. Lee and M. J. Hoban, Proc. Royal Soc. A
472 (2190), 2016], we showed that the immense power of the information content
of states in general (non-quantum) physical theories is not limited to
communication complexity. We showed that, in general physical theories, states
can be taken as &quot;advice&quot; for computers in these theories and this advice allows
the computers to easily solve any decision problem. Aaronson has highlighted
the close connection between quantum communication complexity and quantum
computations that take quantum advice, and our work gives further indications
that this is a very general connection. In this work, we review the results in
our previous work and discuss the intricate relationship between communication
complexity and computers taking advice for general theories.

 <dc:title>Quantum Probability as an Application of Data Compression Principles</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Randall, Allan F.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Realist, no-collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as Everett's,
face the probability problem: how to justify the norm-squared (Born) rule from
the wavefunction alone. While any basis-independent measure can only be
norm-squared (due to the Gleason-Busch Theorem) this fact conflicts with
various popular, non-wavefunction-based phenomenological measures - such as
observer, outcome or world counting - that are frequently demanded of
Everettians. These alternatives conflict, however, with the wavefunction
realism upon which Everett's approach rests, which seems to call for an
objective, basis-independent measure based only on wavefunction amplitudes. The
ability of quantum probabilities to destructively interfere with each other,
however, makes it difficult to see how probabilities can be derived solely from
amplitudes in an intuitively appealing way. I argue that the use of algorithmic
probability can solve this problem, since the objective, single-case
probability measure that wavefunction realism demands is exactly what
algorithmic information theory was designed to provide. The result is an
intuitive account of complex-valued amplitudes, as coefficients in an optimal
lossy data compression, such that changes in algorithmic information content
(entropy deltas) are associated with phenomenal transitions.

 <dc:description>  People and machines are collecting data at an unprecedented rate. Despite
this newfound abundance of data, progress has been slow in sharing it for open
science, business, and other data-intensive endeavors. Many such efforts are
stymied by privacy concerns and regulatory compliance issues. For example, many
hospitals are interested in pooling their medical records for research, but
none may disclose arbitrary patient records to researchers or other healthcare
providers. In this context we propose the Private Data Network (PDN), a
federated database for querying over the collective data of mutually
distrustful parties. In a PDN, each member database does not reveal its tuples
to its peers nor to the query writer. Instead, the user submits a query to an
honest broker that plans and coordinates its execution over multiple private
databases using secure multiparty computation (SMC). Here, each database's
query execution is oblivious, and its program counters and memory traces are
agnostic to the inputs of others. We introduce a framework for executing PDN
queries named SMCQL. This system translates SQL statements into SMC primitives
to compute query results over the union of its source databases without
revealing sensitive information about individual tuples to peer data providers
or the honest broker. Only the honest broker and the querier receive the
results of a PDN query. For fast, secure query evaluation, we explore a
heuristics-driven optimizer that minimizes the PDN's use of secure computation
and partitions its query evaluation into scalable slices.

 <dc:description>  Instance retrieval requires one to search for images that contain a
particular object within a large corpus. Recent studies show that using image
features generated by pooling convolutional layer feature maps (CFMs) of a
pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to promising performance
for this task. However, due to the global pooling strategy adopted in those
works, the generated image feature is less robust to image clutter and tends to
be contaminated by the irrelevant image patterns. In this article, we alleviate
this drawback by proposing a novel reranking algorithm using CFMs to refine the
retrieval result obtained by existing methods. Our key idea, called query
adaptive matching (QAM), is to first represent the CFMs of each image by a set
of base regions which can be freely combined into larger regions-of-interest.
Then the similarity between the query and a candidate image is measured by the
best similarity score that can be attained by comparing the query feature and
the feature pooled from a combined region. We show that the above procedure can
be cast as an optimization problem and it can be solved efficiently with an
off-the-shelf solver. Besides this general framework, we also propose two
practical ways to create the base regions. One is based on the property of the
CFM and the other one is based on a multi-scale spatial pyramid scheme. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our reranking approaches bring substantial
performance improvement and by applying them we can outperform the state of the
art on several instance retrieval benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by practical importance of social networks, economic networks,
biological networks and so on, studies on large and complex networks have
attracted a surge of attentions in the recent years. Link prediction is a
fundamental issue to understand the mechanisms by which new links are added to
the networks. We introduce the method of robust principal component analysis
(robust PCA) into link prediction, and estimate the missing entries of the
adjacency matrix. On one hand, our algorithm is based on the sparsity and low
rank property of the matrix, on the other hand, it also performs very well when
the network is dense. This is because a relatively dense real network is also
sparse in comparison to the complete graph. According to extensive experiments
on real networks from disparate fields, when the target network is connected
and sufficiently dense, whatever it is weighted or unweighted, our method is
demonstrated to be very effective and with prediction accuracy being
considerably improved comparing with many state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Mobile search has recently been shown to be the major contributor to the
growing search market. The key difference between mobile search and desktop
search is that information presentation is limited to the screen space of the
mobile device. Thus, major search engines have adopted a new type of search
result presentation, known as \textit{information cards}, in which each card
presents summarized results from one domain/vertical, for a given query, to
augment the standard blue-links search results. While it has been widely
acknowledged that information cards are particularly suited to mobile user
experience, it is also challenging to optimize such result sets. Typically,
user engagement metrics like query reformulation are based on whole ranked list
of cards for each query and most traditional learning to rank algorithms
require per-item relevance labels. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility of interpreting query reformulation into effective relevance labels
for query-card pairs. We inherit the concept of conventional learning-to-rank,
and propose pointwise, pairwise and listwise interpretations for query
reformulation. In addition, we propose a learning-to-label strategy that learns
the contribution of each card, with respect to a query, where such
contributions can be used as labels for training card ranking models. We
utilize a state-of-the-art ranking model and demonstrate the effectiveness of
proposed mechanisms on a large-scale mobile data from a major search engine,
showing that models trained from labels derived from user engagement can
significantly outperform ones trained from human judgment labels.

 <dc:description>  Over the past 30 years many researchers in the field of evolutionary
computation have put a lot of effort to introduce various approaches for
solving hard problems. Most of these problems have been inspired by major
industries so that solving them, by providing either optimal or near optimal
solution, was of major significance. Indeed, this was a very promising
trajectory as advances in these problem-solving approaches could result in
adding values to major industries. In this paper we revisit this trajectory to
find out whether the attempts that started three decades ago are still aligned
with the same goal, as complexities of real-world problems increased
significantly. We present some examples of modern real-world problems, discuss
why they might be difficult to solve, and whether there is any mismatch between
these examples and the problems that are investigated in the evolutionary
computation area.

 <dc:description>  Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer
Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has
amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response
to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a
counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be
given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over
860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by
quantifying aspects of their discourse. We find that #AllLivesMatter
facilitates opposition between #BlackLivesMatter and hashtags such as
#PoliceLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter in such a way that historically echoes
the tension between Black protesters and law enforcement. In addition, we show
that a significant portion of #AllLivesMatter use stems from hijacking by
#BlackLivesMatter advocates. Beyond simply injecting #AllLivesMatter with
#BlackLivesMatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to directly confront
the counter-protest notion of &quot;All lives matter.&quot; Our findings suggest that
Black Lives Matter movement was able to grow, exhibit diverse conversations,
and avoid derailment on social media by making discussion of counter-protest
opinions a central topic of #AllLivesMatter, rather than the movement itself.

 <dc:description>  A plethora of biometric measures have been proposed in the past. In this
paper we introduce a new potential biometric measure: the human tremor. We
present a new method for identifying the user of a handheld device using
characteristics of the hand tremor measured with a smartphone built-in inertial
sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes). The main challenge of the proposed
method is related to the fact that human normal tremor is very subtle while we
aim to address real-life scenarios. To properly address the issue, we have
relied on weighted Fourier linear combiner for retrieving only the tremor data
from the hand movement and random forest for actual recognition. We have
evaluated our method on a database with 10 000 samples from 17 persons reaching
an accuracy of 76%.

 <dc:description>  Quasiliearity is a ubiquitous and questionable assumption in the standard
study of Walrasian equilibria. Quasilinearity implies that a buyer's value for
goods purchased in a Walrasian equilibrium is always additive with goods
purchased with unspent money. It is a particularly suspect assumption in
combinatorial auctions, where buyers' complex preferences over goods would
naturally extend beyond the items obtained in the Walrasian equilibrium.
  We study Walrasian equilibria in combinatorial auctions when quasilinearity
is not assumed. We show that existence can be reduced to an Arrow-Debreu style
market with one divisible good and many indivisible goods, and that a
&quot;fractional&quot; Walrasian equilibrium always exists. We also show that standard
integral Walrasian equilibria are related to integral solutions of an induced
configuration LP associated with a fractional Walrasian equilibrium,
generalizing known results for both quasilinear and non-quasilnear settings.

 <dc:description>  Previous learning based hand pose estimation methods does not fully exploit
the prior information in hand model geometry. Instead, they usually rely a
separate model fitting step to generate valid hand poses. Such a post
processing is inconvenient and sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a model
based deep learning approach that adopts a forward kinematics based layer to
ensure the geometric validity of estimated poses. For the first time, we show
that embedding such a non-linear generative process in deep learning is
feasible for hand pose estimation. Our approach is verified on challenging
public datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  The performance of automatic speech recognition systems under noisy
environments still leaves room for improvement. Speech enhancement or feature
enhancement techniques for increasing noise robustness of these systems usually
add components to the recognition system that need careful optimization. In
this work, we propose the use of a relatively simple curriculum training
strategy called accordion annealing (ACCAN). It uses a multi-stage training
schedule where samples at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values as low as 0dB are
first added and samples at increasing higher SNR values are gradually added up
to an SNR value of 50dB. We also use a method called per-epoch noise mixing
(PEM) that generates noisy training samples online during training and thus
enables dynamically changing the SNR of our training data. Both the ACCAN and
the PEM methods are evaluated on a end-to-end speech recognition pipeline on
the Wall Street Journal corpus. ACCAN decreases the average word error rate
(WER) on the 20dB to -10dB SNR range by up to 31.4% when compared to a
conventional multi-condition training method.

 <dc:description>  We present a comprehensive study of deep bidirectional long short-term memory
(LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) based acoustic models for automatic
speech recognition (ASR). We study the effect of size and depth and train
models of up to 8 layers. We investigate the training aspect and study
different variants of optimization methods, batching, truncated
backpropagation, different regularization techniques such as dropout and $L_2$
regularization, and different gradient clipping variants.
  The major part of the experimental analysis was performed on the Quaero
corpus. Additional experiments also were performed on the Switchboard corpus.
Our best LSTM model has a relative improvement in word error rate of over 14\%
compared to our best feed-forward neural network (FFNN) baseline on the Quaero
task. On this task, we get our best result with an 8 layer bidirectional LSTM
and we show that a pretraining scheme with layer-wise construction helps for
deep LSTMs.
  Finally we compare the training calculation time of many of the presented
experiments in relation with recognition performance.
  All the experiments were done with RETURNN, the RWTH extensible training
framework for universal recurrent neural networks in combination with RASR, the
RWTH ASR toolkit.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the new measure of Public Information Complexity (PIC), as a
tool for the study of multi-party computation protocols, and of quantities such
as their communication complexity, or the amount of randomness they require in
the context of information-theoretic private computations. We are able to use
this measure directly in the natural asynchronous message-passing peer-to-peer
model and show a number of interesting properties and applications of our new
notion: the Public Information Complexity is a lower bound on the Communication
Complexity and an upper bound on the Information Complexity; the difference
between the Public Information Complexity and the Information Complexity
provides a lower bound on the amount of randomness used in a protocol; any
communication protocol can be compressed to its Public Information Cost; an
explicit calculation of the zero-error Public Information Complexity of the
k-party, n-bit Parity function, where a player outputs the bit-wise parity of
the inputs. The latter result establishes that the amount of randomness needed
for a private protocol that computes this function is Omega(n).

 <dc:description>  Whilst affective responses to various forms and genres of multimedia content
have been well researched, precious few studies have investigated the combined
impact that multimedia system parameters and human factors have on affect.
Consequently, in this paper we explore the role that two primordial dimensions
of human factors - personality and culture - in conjunction with system factors
- frame rate, resolution, and bit rate - have on user affect and enjoyment of
multimedia presentations. To this end, a two-site, cross-cultural study was
undertaken, the results of which produced three predictve models. Personality
and Culture traits were shown statistically to represent 5.6% of the variance
in positive affect, 13.6% in negative affect and 9.3% in enjoyment. The
correlation between affect and enjoyment, was significant. Predictive modeling
incorporating human factors showed about 8%, 7% and 9% improvement in
predicting positive affect, negative affect and enjoyment respectively when
compared to models trained only on system factors. Results and analysis
indicate the significant role played by human factors in influencing affect
that users experience while watching multimedia.

 <dc:description>  Dependability is an umbrella concept that subsumes many key properties about
a system, including reliability, maintainability, safety, availability,
confidentiality, and integrity. Various dependability modeling techniques have
been developed to effectively capture the failure characteristics of systems
over time. Traditionally, dependability models are analyzed using
paper-and-pencil proof methods and computer based simulation tools but their
results cannot be trusted due to their inherent inaccuracy limitations. The
recent developments in probabilistic analysis support using formal methods have
enabled the possibility of accurate and rigorous dependability analysis. Thus,
the usage of formal methods for dependability analysis is widely advocated for
safety-critical domains, such as transportation, aerospace and health. Given
the complementary strengths of mainstream formal methods, like theorem proving
and model checking, and the variety of dependability models judging the most
suitable formal technique for a given dependability model is not a
straightforward task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of
existing formal dependability analysis techniques along with their pros and
cons for handling a particular dependability model.

 <dc:description>  Zero-sum stochastic games provide a rich model for competitive decision
making. However, under general forms of state uncertainty as considered in the
Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG), such decision making problems are
still not very well understood. This paper makes a contribution to the theory
of zero-sum POSGs by characterizing structure in their value function. In
particular, we introduce a new formulation of the value function for zs-POSGs
as a function of the &quot;plan-time sufficient statistics&quot; (roughly speaking the
information distribution in the POSG), which has the potential to enable
generalization over such information distributions. We further delineate this
generalization capability by proving a structural result on the shape of value
function: it exhibits concavity and convexity with respect to appropriately
chosen marginals of the statistic space. This result is a key pre-cursor for
developing solution methods that may be able to exploit such structure.
Finally, we show how these results allow us to reduce a zs-POSG to a
&quot;centralized&quot; model with shared observations, thereby transferring results for
the latter, narrower class, to games with individual (private) observations.

 <dc:description>  Combating malware is very important for software/systems security, but to
prevent the software/systems from the advanced malware, viz. metamorphic
malware is a challenging task, as it changes the structure/code after each
infection. Therefore in this paper, we present a novel approach to detect the
advanced malware with high accuracy by analyzing the occurrence of opcodes
(features) by grouping the executables. These groups are made on the basis of
our earlier studies [1] that the difference between the sizes of any two
malware generated by popular advanced malware kits viz. PS-MPC, G2 and NGVCK
are within 5 KB. On the basis of obtained promising features, we studied the
performance of thirteen classifiers using N-fold cross-validation available in
machine learning tool WEKA. Among these thirteen classifiers we studied
in-depth top five classifiers (Random forest, LMT, NBT, J48 and FT) and obtain
more than 96.28% accuracy for the detection of unknown malware, which is better
than the maximum detection accuracy (95.9%) reported by Santos et al (2013). In
these top five classifiers, our approach obtained a detection accuracy of
97.95% by the Random forest.

 <dc:title>Inferring Logical Forms From Denotations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A core problem in learning semantic parsers from denotations is picking out
consistent logical forms--those that yield the correct denotation--from a
combinatorially large space. To control the search space, previous work relied
on restricted set of rules, which limits expressivity. In this paper, we
consider a much more expressive class of logical forms, and show how to use
dynamic programming to efficiently represent the complete set of consistent
logical forms. Expressivity also introduces many more spurious logical forms
which are consistent with the correct denotation but do not represent the
meaning of the utterance. To address this, we generate fictitious worlds and
use crowdsourced denotations on these worlds to filter out spurious logical
forms. On the WikiTableQuestions dataset, we increase the coverage of
answerable questions from 53.5% to 76%, and the additional crowdsourced
supervision lets us rule out 92.1% of spurious logical forms.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the rapid development of word embedding and neural networks has
brought new inspiration to various NLP and IR tasks. In this paper, we describe
a staged hybrid model combining Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN)
with highway layers. The highway network module is incorporated in the middle
takes the output of the bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN) module
in the first stage and provides the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module
in the last stage with the input. The experiment shows that our model
outperforms common neural network models (CNN, RNN, Bi-RNN) on a sentiment
analysis task. Besides, the analysis of how sequence length influences the RCNN
with highway layers shows that our model could learn good representation for
the long text.

 <dc:title>Grouping the executables to detect malware with high accuracy</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The metamorphic malware variants with the same malicious behavior (family),
can obfuscate themselves to look different from each other. This variation in
structure leads to a huge signature database for traditional signature matching
techniques to detect them. In order to effective and efficient detection of
malware in large amounts of executables, we need to partition these files into
groups which can identify their respective families. In addition, the grouping
criteria should be chosen such a way that, it can also be applied to unknown
files encounter on computers for classification. This paper discusses the study
of malware and benign executables in groups to detect unknown malware with high
accuracy. We studied sizes of malware generated by three popular second
generation malware (metamorphic malware) creator kits viz. G2, PS-MPC and
NGVCK, and observed that the size variation in any two generated malware from
same kit is not much. Hence, we grouped the executables on the basis of malware
sizes by using Optimal k-Means Clustering algorithm and used these obtained
groups to select promising features for training (Random forest, J48, LMT, FT
and NBT) classifiers to detect variants of malware or unknown malware. We find
that detection of malware on the basis of their respected file sizes gives
accuracy up to 99.11% from the classifiers.

Therefore, in this paper, we study the classification of unknown malware by two

approaches we select the features by taking all dataset in one group and in the

 <dc:description>  We present a natural reverse Minkowski-type inequality for lattices, which
gives upper bounds on the number of lattice points in a Euclidean ball in terms
of sublattice determinants, and conjecture its optimal form. The conjecture
exhibits a surprising wealth of connections to various areas in mathematics and
computer science, including a conjecture motivated by integer programming by
Kannan and Lov\'asz (Annals of Math. 1988), a question from additive
combinatorics asked by Green, a question on Brownian motions asked by
Saloff-Coste (Colloq. Math. 2010), a theorem by Milman and Pisier from convex
geometry (Ann. Probab. 1987), worst-case to average-case reductions in
lattice-based cryptography, and more. We present these connections, provide
evidence for the conjecture, and discuss possible approaches towards a proof.
Our main technical contribution is in proving that our conjecture implies the
$\ell_2$ case of the Kannan and Lov\'asz conjecture. The proof relies on a
novel convex relaxation for the covering radius, and a rounding procedure for
based on &quot;uncrossing&quot; lattice subspaces.

 <dc:description>  In cognitive radio networks, the channel gain between primary transceivers,
namely, primary channel gain, is crucial for a cognitive transmitter (CT) to
control the transmit power and achieve spectrum sharing. Conventionally, the
primary channel gain is estimated in the primary system and thus unavailable at
the CT. To deal with this issue, two estimators are proposed by enabling the CT
to sense primary signals. In particular, by adopting the maximum likelihood
(ML) criterion to analyze the received primary signals, a ML estimator is first
developed. After demonstrating the high computational complexity of the ML
estimator, a median based (MB) estimator with proved low complexity is then
proposed. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy of the MB estimation is
theoretically characterized. By comparing the ML estimator and the MB estimator
from the aspects of the computational complexity as well as the estimation
accuracy, both advantages and disadvantages of two estimators are revealed.
Numerical results show that the estimation errors of the ML estimator and the
MB estimator can be as small as $0.6$ dB and $0.7$ dB, respectively.

 <dc:description>  The increasing trend on wireless-connected devices makes opportunistic
networking a promising alternative to existing infrastructure-based networks.
However, on these networks there is neither guarantee about the availability of
the connections nor on the topology of the network. The development of
opportunistic applications, i.e., applications running over opportunistic
networks, is still in early stages. This is due to lack of tools to support the
process in such uncertain conditions. Indeed, many tools have been introduced
to study and characterize opportunistic networks, but none of them is focused
on helping developers to conceive opportunistic applications. In this paper, we
argue that the gap between opportunistic applications development and network
characterization can be filled with network emulation. First, this position
paper points out important challenges about the development of opportunistic
applications. Then, in order to cope with these challenges, it details a set of
requirements that an emulator should meet to allow the testing of such

 <dc:title>Think Eternally: Improved Algorithms for the Temp Secretary Problem and
  Extensions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The \emph{Temp Secretary Problem} was recently introduced by Fiat et al. It
is a generalization of the Secretary Problem, in which commitments are
temporary for a fixed duration. We present a simple online algorithm with
improved performance guarantees for cases already considered by Fiat et al.\
and give competitive ratios for new generalizations of the problem. In the
classical setting, where candidates have identical contract durations $\gamma
\ll 1$ and we are allowed to hire up to $B$ candidates simultaneously, our
algorithm is $(\frac{1}{2} - O(\sqrt{\gamma}))$-competitive. For large $B$, the
bound improves to $1 - O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{B}}\right) - O(\sqrt{\gamma})$.
  Furthermore we generalize the problem from cardinality constraints towards
general packing constraints. We achieve a competitive ratio of $1 -
O\left(\sqrt{\frac{(1+\log d + \log B)}{B}}\right) -O(\sqrt{\gamma})$, where
$d$ is the sparsity of the constraint matrix and $B$ is generalized to the
capacity ratio of linear constraints. Additionally we extend the problem
towards arbitrary hiring durations.
  Our algorithmic approach is a relaxation that aggregates all temporal
constraints into a non-temporal constraint. Then we apply a linear scaling
algorithm that, on every arrival, computes a tentative solution on the input
that is known up to this point. This tentative solution uses the non-temporal,
relaxed constraints scaled down linearly by the amount of time that has already
passed.

 <dc:title>Garbled Quantum Computation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The universal blind quantum computation protocol (UBQC) (Broadbent,
Fitzsimons, Kashefi 2009) enables an almost classical client to delegate a
quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server (in form of a garbled
quantum computation) while the security for the client is unconditional. In
this contribution we explore the possibility of extending the verifiable UBQC
(Fitzsimons, Kashefi 2012), to achieve further functionalities as was done for
classical garbled computation. First, exploring the asymmetric nature of UBQC
(client preparing only single qubits, while the server runs the entire quantum
computation), we present a &quot;Yao&quot; type protocol for secure two party quantum
computation. Similar to the classical setting (Yao 1986) our quantum Yao
protocol is secure against a specious (quantum honest-but-curious) garbler, but
in our case, against a (fully) malicious evaluator. Unlike the protocol in
(Dupuis, Nielsen, Salvail 2010), we do not require any online-quantum
communication between the garbler and the evaluator and thus no extra
cryptographic primitive. This feature will allow us to construct a simple
universal one-time compiler for any quantum computation using one-time memory,
in a similar way with the classical work of (Goldwasser, Kalai, Rothblum 2008)
while more efficiently than the previous work of (Broadbent, Gutoski, Stebila
2013).

 <dc:description>  A rectilinear polygon is a polygon whose edges are axis-aligned. Walking
counterclockwise on the boundary of such a polygon yields a sequence of left
turns and right turns. The number of left turns always equals the number of
right turns plus 4. It is known that any such sequence can be realized by a
rectilinear polygon. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding
realizations that minimize the perimeter or the area of the polygon or the area
of the bounding box of the polygon. We show that all three problems are NP-hard
in general. Then we consider the special cases of $x$-monotone and
$xy$-monotone rectilinear polygons. For these, we can optimize the three
objectives efficiently.

 <dc:description>  Zero-resource speech technology is a growing research area that aims to
develop methods for speech processing in the absence of transcriptions,
lexicons, or language modelling text. Early term discovery systems focused on
identifying isolated recurring patterns in a corpus, while more recent
full-coverage systems attempt to completely segment and cluster the audio into
word-like units---effectively performing unsupervised speech recognition. This
article presents the first attempt we are aware of to apply such a system to
large-vocabulary multi-speaker data. Our system uses a Bayesian modelling
framework with segmental word representations: each word segment is represented
as a fixed-dimensional acoustic embedding obtained by mapping the sequence of
feature frames to a single embedding vector. We compare our system on English
and Xitsonga datasets to state-of-the-art baselines, using a variety of
measures including word error rate (obtained by mapping the unsupervised output
to ground truth transcriptions). Very high word error rates are reported---in
the order of 70--80% for speaker-dependent and 80--95% for speaker-independent
systems---highlighting the difficulty of this task. Nevertheless, in terms of
cluster quality and word segmentation metrics, we show that by imposing a
consistent top-down segmentation while also using bottom-up knowledge from
detected syllable boundaries, both single-speaker and multi-speaker versions of
our system outperform a purely bottom-up single-speaker syllable-based
approach. We also show that the discovered clusters can be made less speaker-
and gender-specific by using an unsupervised autoencoder-like feature extractor
to learn better frame-level features (prior to embedding). Our system's
discovered clusters are still less pure than those of unsupervised term
discovery systems, but provide far greater coverage.

 <dc:title>An Approach for Parallel Genetic Algorithms in the Cloud using Software

 <dc:description>  Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are a powerful technique to address hard
optimisation problems. However, scalability issues might prevent them from
being applied to real-world problems. Exploiting parallel GAs in the cloud
might be an affordable approach to get time efficient solutions that benefit of
the appealing features of the cloud, such as scalability, reliability,
fault-tolerance and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, distributed computation
is very prone to cause considerable overhead for communication and making GAs
distributed in an on-demand fashion is not trivial. Aiming to keep under
control the communication overhead and support GAs developers in the
construction and deployment of parallel GAs in the cloud, in this paper we
propose an approach to distribute GAs using the global parallelisation model,
exploiting software containers and their cloud orchestration. We also devised a
conceptual workflow covering each cloud GAs distribution phase, from resources
allocation to actual deployment and execution, in a DevOps fashion.

 <dc:description>  Graph-based methods for signal processing have shown promise for the analysis
of data exhibiting irregular structure, such as those found in social,
transportation, and sensor networks. Yet, though these systems are often
dynamic, state-of-the-art methods for signal processing on graphs ignore the
dimension of time, treating successive graph signals independently or taking a
global average. To address this shortcoming, this paper considers the
statistical analysis of time-varying graph signals. We introduce a novel
definition of joint (time-vertex) stationarity, which generalizes the classical
definition of time stationarity and the more recent definition appropriate for
graphs. Joint stationarity gives rise to a scalable Wiener optimization
framework for joint denoising, semi-supervised learning, or more generally
inversing a linear operator, that is provably optimal. Experimental results on
real weather data demonstrate that taking into account graph and time
dimensions jointly can yield significant accuracy improvements in the
reconstruction effort.

 <dc:title>Some comments on the reliability of NOAA's Storm Events Database</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Storms and other severe weather events can result in fatalities, injuries,
and property damage. Therefore, preventing such outcomes to the extent possible
is a key concern, and the scientific community faces an increasing demand for
regularly updated appraisals of evolving climate conditions and extreme
weather. NOAA's Storm Events Database is undoubtedly an invaluable resource to
the general public, to the professional, and to the researcher. Due to such
importance, the primary objective of this study was to explore this database
and get clues about its reliability. A complete investigation of the damage
estimates, injuries or fatalities figures is unfeasible due to the extension of
the database. However, an exploratory data analysis with the resources of the R
statistical data analysis language found that damage reports are missing in
more than half of the records, that part of the damage values are incorrect,
and that, despite all efforts of standardizations, non-standard event type
names are still finding their way into the database. These few results are
enough to demonstrate that the database suffers from incompleteness and
inconsistencies and should not be used without taking reservations and
appropriate precautions before advancing any inferences from the data.

 <dc:description>  Bounded Model Checking is one the most successful techniques for finding bugs
in program. However, model checkers are resource hungry and are often unable to
verify programs with loops iterating over large arrays.We present a
transformation that enables bounded model checkers to verify a certain class of
array properties. Our technique transforms an array-manipulating (ANSI-C)
program to an array-free and loop-free (ANSI-C) program thereby reducing the
resource requirements of a model checker significantly. Model checking of the
transformed program using an off-the-shelf bounded model checker simulates the
loop iterations efficiently. Thus, our transformed program is a sound
abstraction of the original program and is also precise in a large number of
cases - we formally characterize the class of programs for which it is
guaranteed to be precise. We demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of
our technique on both industry code as well as academic benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Estimation of the Saupe tensor is central to the determination of molecular
structures from residual dipolar couplings (RDC) or chemical shift
anisotropies. Assuming a given template structure, the singular value
decomposition (SVD) method proposed in Losonczi et al. 1999 has been used
traditionally to estimate the Saupe tensor. Despite its simplicity, whenever
the template structure has large structural noise, the eigenvalues of the
estimated tensor have a magnitude systematically smaller than their actual
values. This leads to systematic error when calculating the eigenvalue
dependent parameters, magnitude and rhombicity. We propose here a Monte Carlo
simulation method to remove such bias. We further demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method in the setting when the eigenvalue estimates from multiple
template protein fragments are available and their average is used as an
improved eigenvalue estimator. For both synthetic and experimental RDC datasets
of ubiquitin, when using template fragments corrupted by large noise, the
magnitude of our proposed bias-reduced estimator generally reaches at least 90%
of the actual value, whereas the magnitude of SVD estimator can be shrunk below
80% of the true value.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient implementation of hypergeometric functions in
arbitrary-precision interval arithmetic. The functions ${}_0F_1$, ${}_1F_1$,
${}_2F_1$ and ${}_2F_0$ (or the Kummer $U$-function) are supported for
unrestricted complex parameters and argument, and by extension, we cover
exponential and trigonometric integrals, error functions, Fresnel integrals,
incomplete gamma and beta functions, Bessel functions, Airy functions, Legendre
functions, Jacobi polynomials, complete elliptic integrals, and other special
functions. The output can be used directly for interval computations or to
generate provably correct floating-point approximations in any format.
Performance is competitive with earlier arbitrary-precision software, and
sometimes orders of magnitude faster. We also partially cover the generalized
hypergeometric function ${}_pF_q$ and computation of high-order parameter
derivatives.

 <dc:title>Simultaneous Control and Human Feedback in the Training of a Robotic

 <dc:description>  This paper contributes a preliminary report on the advantages and
disadvantages of incorporating simultaneous human control and feedback signals
in the training of a reinforcement learning robotic agent. While robotic
human-machine interfaces have become increasingly complex in both form and
function, control remains challenging for users. This has resulted in an
increasing gap between user control approaches and the number of robotic motors
which can be controlled. One way to address this gap is to shift some autonomy
to the robot. Semi-autonomous actions of the robotic agent can then be shaped
by human feedback, simplifying user control. Most prior work on agent shaping
by humans has incorporated training with feedback, or has included indirect
control signals. By contrast, in this paper we explore how a human can provide
concurrent feedback signals and real-time myoelectric control signals to train
a robot's actor-critic reinforcement learning control system. Using both a
physical and a simulated robotic system, we compare training performance on a
simple movement task when reward is derived from the environment, when reward
is provided by the human, and combinations of these two approaches. Our results
indicate that some benefit can be gained with the inclusion of human generated
feedback.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents preliminary works on using Word Embedding (word2vec) for
query expansion in the context of Personalized Information Retrieval.
Traditionally, word embeddings are learned on a general corpus, like Wikipedia.
In this work we try to personalize the word embeddings learning, by achieving
the learning on the user's profile. The word embeddings are then in the same
context than the user interests. Our proposal is evaluated on the CLEF Social
Book Search 2016 collection. The results obtained show that some efforts should
be made in the way to apply Word Embedding in the context of Personalized
Information Retrieval.

 <dc:description>  The cyber-physical nature of the smart grid has rendered it vulnerable to a
multitude of attacks that can occur at its communication, networking, and
physical entry points. Such cyber-physical attacks can have detrimental effects
on the operation of the grid as exemplified by the recent attack which caused a
blackout of the Ukranian power grid. Thus, to properly secure the smart grid,
it is of utmost importance to: a) understand its underlying vulnerabilities and
associated threats, b) quantify their effects, and c) devise appropriate
security solutions. In this paper, the key threats targeting the smart grid are
first exposed while assessing their effects on the operation and stability of
the grid. Then, the challenges involved in understanding these attacks and
devising defense strategies against them are identified. Potential solution
approaches that can help mitigate these threats are then discussed. Last, a
number of mathematical tools that can help in analyzing and implementing
security solutions are introduced. As such, this paper will provide the first
comprehensive overview on smart grid security.

 <dc:description>  The average uncertainty associated with words is an information-theoretic
concept at the heart of quantitative and computational linguistics. The entropy
has been established as a measure of this average uncertainty - also called
average information content. We here use parallel texts of 21 languages to
establish the number of tokens at which word entropies converge to stable
values. These convergence points are then used to select texts from a massively
parallel corpus, and to estimate word entropies across more than 1000
languages. Our results help to establish quantitative language comparisons, to
understand the performance of multilingual translation systems, and to
normalize semantic similarity measures.

 <dc:description>  Word embeddings and convolutional neural networks (CNN) have attracted
extensive attention in various classification tasks for Twitter, e.g. sentiment
classification. However, the effect of the configuration used to train and
generate the word embeddings on the classification performance has not been
studied in the existing literature. In this paper, using a Twitter election
classification task that aims to detect election-related tweets, we investigate
the impact of the background dataset used to train the embedding models, the
context window size and the dimensionality of word embeddings on the
classification performance. By comparing the classification results of two word
embedding models, which are trained using different background corpora (e.g.
Wikipedia articles and Twitter microposts), we show that the background data
type should align with the Twitter classification dataset to achieve a better
performance. Moreover, by evaluating the results of word embeddings models
trained using various context window sizes and dimensionalities, we found that
large context window and dimension sizes are preferable to improve the
performance. Our experimental results also show that using word embeddings and
CNN leads to statistically significant improvements over various baselines such
as random, SVM with TF-IDF and SVM with word embeddings.

 <dc:title>Joint M-Best-Diverse Labelings as a Parametric Submodular Minimization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of jointly inferring the M-best diverse labelings for
a binary (high-order) submodular energy of a graphical model. Recently, it was
shown that this problem can be solved to a global optimum, for many practically
interesting diversity measures. It was noted that the labelings are, so-called,
nested. This nestedness property also holds for labelings of a class of
parametric submodular minimization problems, where different values of the
global parameter $\gamma$ give rise to different solutions. The popular example
of the parametric submodular minimization is the monotonic parametric max-flow
problem, which is also widely used for computing multiple labelings. As the
main contribution of this work we establish a close relationship between
diversity with submodular energies and the parametric submodular minimization.
In particular, the joint M-best diverse labelings can be obtained by running a
non-parametric submodular minimization (in the special case - max-flow) solver
for M different values of $\gamma$ in parallel, for certain diversity measures.
Importantly, the values for $\gamma$ can be computed in a closed form in
advance, prior to any optimization. These theoretical results suggest two
simple yet efficient algorithms for the joint M-best diverse problem, which
outperform competitors in terms of runtime and quality of results. In
particular, as we show in the paper, the new methods compute the exact M-best
diverse labelings faster than a popular method of Batra et al., which in some
sense only obtains approximate solutions.

 <dc:description>  Attack graphs provide compact representations of the attack paths that an
attacker can follow to compromise network resources by analysing network
vulnerabilities and topology. These representations are a powerful tool for
security risk assessment. Bayesian inference on attack graphs enables the
estimation of the risk of compromise to the system's components given their
vulnerabilities and interconnections, and accounts for multi-step attacks
spreading through the system. Whilst static analysis considers the risk posture
at rest, dynamic analysis also accounts for evidence of compromise, e.g. from
SIEM software or forensic investigation. However, in this context, exact
Bayesian inference techniques do not scale well. In this paper we show how
Loopy Belief Propagation - an approximate inference technique - can be applied
to attack graphs, and that it scales linearly in the number of nodes for both
static and dynamic analysis, making such analyses viable for larger networks.
We experiment with different topologies and network clustering on synthetic
Bayesian attack graphs with thousands of nodes to show that the algorithm's
accuracy is acceptable and converge to a stable solution. We compare sequential
and parallel versions of Loopy Belief Propagation with exact inference
techniques for both static and dynamic analysis, showing the advantages of
approximate inference techniques to scale to larger attack graphs.

 <dc:description>  Constraint-based causal discovery from limited data is a notoriously
difficult challenge due to the many borderline independence test decisions.
Several approaches to improve the reliability of the predictions by exploiting
redundancy in the independence information have been proposed recently. Though
promising, existing approaches can still be greatly improved in terms of
accuracy and scalability. We present a novel method that reduces the
combinatorial explosion of the search space by using a more coarse-grained
representation of causal information, drastically reducing computation time.
Additionally, we propose a method to score causal predictions based on their
confidence. Crucially, our implementation also allows one to easily combine
observational and interventional data and to incorporate various types of
available background knowledge. We prove soundness and asymptotic consistency
of our method and demonstrate that it can outperform the state-of-the-art on
synthetic data, achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We
illustrate its practical feasibility by applying it on a challenging protein
data set.

 <dc:title>When Does Spatial Correlation Add Value to Delayed Channel State
  Information?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vahid, Alireza</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Calderbank, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Fast fading wireless networks with delayed knowledge of the channel state
information have received significant attention in recent years. An exception
is networks where channels are spatially correlated. This paper characterizes
the capacity region of two-user erasure interference channels with delayed
knowledge of the channel state information and spatially correlated channels.
There are instances where spatial correlation eliminates any potential gain
from delayed channel state information and instances where it enables the same
performance that is possible with instantaneous knowledge of channel state. The
key is an extremal entropy inequality for spatially correlated channels that
separates the two types of instances. It is also shown that to achieve the
capacity region, each transmitter only needs to rely on the delayed knowledge
of the channels to which it is connected.

  Peer-Prediction Makes Things Worse</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In many settings, an effective way of evaluating objects of interest is to
collect evaluations from dispersed individuals and to aggregate these
evaluations together. Some examples are categorizing online content and
evaluating student assignments via peer grading. For this data science problem,
one challenge is to motivate participants to conduct such evaluations carefully
and to report them honestly, particularly when doing so is costly. Existing
approaches, notably peer-prediction mechanisms, can incentivize truth telling
in equilibrium. However, they also give rise to equilibria in which agents do
not pay the costs required to evaluate accurately, and hence fail to elicit
useful information. We show that this problem is unavoidable whenever agents
are able to coordinate using low-cost signals about the items being evaluated
(e.g., text labels or pictures). We then consider ways of circumventing this
problem by comparing agents' reports to ground truth, which is available in
practice when there exist trusted evaluators---such as teaching assistants in
the peer grading scenario---who can perform a limited number of unbiased (but
noisy) evaluations. Of course, when such ground truth is available, a simpler
approach is also possible: rewarding each agent based on agreement with ground
truth with some probability, and unconditionally rewarding the agent otherwise.
Surprisingly, we show that the simpler mechanism achieves stronger incentive
guarantees given less access to ground truth than a large set of
peer-prediction mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  Many predictive tasks, such as diagnosing a patient based on their medical
chart, are ultimately defined by the decisions of human experts. Unfortunately,
encoding experts' knowledge is often time consuming and expensive. We propose a
simple way to use fuzzy and informal knowledge from experts to guide discovery
of interpretable latent topics in text. The underlying intuition of our
approach is that latent factors should be informative about both correlations
in the data and a set of relevance variables specified by an expert.
Mathematically, this approach is a combination of the information bottleneck
and Total Correlation Explanation (CorEx). We give a preliminary evaluation of
Anchored CorEx, showing that it produces more coherent and interpretable topics
on two distinct corpora.

 <dc:description>  Situated question answering is the problem of answering questions about an
environment such as an image or diagram. This problem requires jointly
interpreting a question and an environment using background knowledge to select
the correct answer. We present Parsing to Probabilistic Programs (P3), a novel
situated question answering model that can use background knowledge and global
features of the question/environment interpretation while retaining efficient
approximate inference. Our key insight is to treat semantic parses as
probabilistic programs that execute nondeterministically and whose possible
executions represent environmental uncertainty. We evaluate our approach on a
new, publicly-released data set of 5000 science diagram questions,
outperforming several competitive classical and neural baselines.

 <dc:description>  Hyperproperties, like observational determinism or symmetry, cannot be
expressed as properties of individual computation traces, because they describe
a relation between multiple computation traces. HyperLTL is a temporal logic
that captures such relations through trace variables, which are introduced
through existential and universal trace quantifiers and can be used to refer to
multiple computations at the same time. In this paper, we study the
satisfiability problem of HyperLTL. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete
for alternation-free formulas (and, hence, no more expensive than LTL
satisfiability), EXPSPACE-complete for exists-forall-formulas, and undecidable
for forall-exists-formulas. Many practical hyperproperties can be expressed as
alternation-free formulas. Our results show that both satisfiability and
implication are decidable for such properties.

 <dc:description>  Conversational agents (&quot;bots&quot;) are beginning to be widely used in
conversational interfaces. To design a system that is capable of emulating
human-like interactions, a conversational layer that can serve as a fabric for
chat-like interaction with the agent is needed. In this paper, we introduce a
model that employs Information Retrieval by utilizing convolutional deep
structured semantic neural network-based features in the ranker to present
human-like responses in ongoing conversation with a user. In conversations,
accounting for context is critical to the retrieval model; we show that our
context-sensitive approach using a Convolutional Deep Structured Semantic Model
(cDSSM) with character trigrams significantly outperforms several conventional
baselines in terms of the relevance of responses retrieved.

 <dc:description>  There is an increasing trend that enterprises outsource their network
functions to the cloud for lower cost and ease of management. However, network
function outsourcing brings threats to the privacy of enterprises since the
cloud is able to access the traffic and rules of in-cloud network functions.
Current tools for secure network function outsourcing either incur large
performance overhead or do not support real-time updates. In this paper, we
present SICS, a secure service function chain outsourcing framework. SICS
encrypts each packet header and use a label for in-cloud rule matching, which
enables the cloud to perform its functionalities correctly with minimum header
information leakage. Evaluation results show that SICS achieves higher
throughput, faster construction and update speed, and lower resource overhead
at both enterprise and cloud sides, compared to existing solutions.

 <dc:description>  The domain name system (DNS) is an important protocol in today's Internet
operation, and is the standard naming convention between domain names, names
that are easy to read, understand, and remember by humans, to IP address of
Internet resources. The wealth of research activities on DNS in general and
security and privacy in particular suggest that all problems in this domain are
solved. Reality however is that despite the large body of literature on various
aspects of DNS, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed. In
this paper, we review the various activities in the research community on DNS
operation, security, and privacy, and outline various challenges and open
research directions that need to be tackled.

 <dc:title>Finite Sample Prediction and Recovery Bounds for Ordinal Embedding</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The goal of ordinal embedding is to represent items as points in a
low-dimensional Euclidean space given a set of constraints in the form of
distance comparisons like &quot;item $i$ is closer to item $j$ than item $k$&quot;.
Ordinal constraints like this often come from human judgments. To account for
errors and variation in judgments, we consider the noisy situation in which the
given constraints are independently corrupted by reversing the correct
constraint with some probability. This paper makes several new contributions to
this problem. First, we derive prediction error bounds for ordinal embedding
with noise by exploiting the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is at most $d+2$. These bounds characterize how well a
learned embedding predicts new comparative judgments. Second, we investigate
the special case of a known noise model and study the Maximum Likelihood
estimator. Third, knowledge of the noise model enables us to relate prediction
errors to embedding accuracy. This relationship is highly non-trivial since we
show that the linear map corresponding to distance comparisons is
non-invertible, but there exists a nonlinear map that is invertible. Fourth,
two new algorithms for ordinal embedding are proposed and evaluated in
experiments.

 <dc:description>  Google BigTable's scale-out design for distributed key-value storage inspired
a generation of NoSQL databases. Recently the NewSQL paradigm emerged in
response to analytic workloads that demand distributed computation local to
data storage. Many such analytics take the form of graph algorithms, a trend
that motivated the GraphBLAS initiative to standardize a set of matrix math
kernels for building graph algorithms. In this article we show how it is
possible to implement the GraphBLAS kernels in a BigTable database by
presenting the design of Graphulo, a library for executing graph algorithms
inside the Apache Accumulo database. We detail the Graphulo implementation of
two graph algorithms and conduct experiments comparing their performance to two
main-memory matrix math systems. Our results shed insight into the conditions
that determine when executing a graph algorithm is faster inside a database
versus an external system---in short, that memory requirements and relative I/O
are critical factors.

 <dc:description>  Companies have been increasingly seeking new mechanisms for making their
electronic marketing campaigns to become viral, thus obtaining a cascading
recommendation effect similar to word-of-mouth. We analysed a dataset of a
magazine publisher that uses email as the main marketing strategy and found out
that networks emerging from those campaigns form a very sparse graph. We show
that online social networks can be effectively used as a means to expand
recommendation networks. Starting from a set of users, called seeders, we
crawled Google's Orkut and collected about 20 million users and 80 million
relationships. Next, we extended the original recommendation network by adding
new edges using Orkut relationships that built a much denser network.
Therefore, we advocate that online social networks are much more effective than
email-based marketing campaigns

 <dc:description>  Yampolskiy and others have shown that the space of possible minds is vast,
actually infinite (Yampolskiy, 2015). A question of interest is 'Which
activities can minds perform during their lifetime?' This question is very
broad, thus in this article restricted to 'Which non-boring activities can
minds perform?' The space of potential non-boring activities has been called by
Yudkowsky 'fun space' (Yudkowsky, 2009). This paper aims to discuss the
relation between various types of minds and the part of the fun space, which is
accessible for them.

 <dc:description>  We report on a project to use a theorem prover to find proofs of the theorems
in Tarskian geometry. These theorems start with fundamental properties of
betweenness, proceed through the derivations of several famous theorems due to
Gupta and end with the derivation from Tarski's axioms of Hilbert's 1899 axioms
for geometry. They include the four challenge problems left unsolved by Quaife,
who two decades ago found some \Otter proofs in Tarskian geometry (solving
challenges issued in Wos's 1998 book). There are 212 theorems in this
collection. We were able to find \Otter proofs of all these theorems. We
developed a methodology for the automated preparation and checking of the input
files for those theorems, to ensure that no human error has corrupted the
formal development of an entire theory as embodied in two hundred input files
and proofs. We distinguish between proofs that were found completely
mechanically (without reference to the steps of a book proof) and proofs that
were constructed by some technique that involved a human knowing the steps of a
book proof. Proofs of length 40--100, roughly speaking, are difficult exercises
for a human, and proofs of 100-250 steps belong in a Ph.D. thesis or
publication. 29 of the proofs in our collection are longer than 40 steps, and
ten are longer than 90 steps. We were able to derive completely mechanically
all but 26 of the 183 theorems that have &quot;short&quot; proofs (40 or fewer deduction
steps). We found proofs of the rest, as well as the 29 &quot;hard&quot; theorems, using a
method that requires consulting the book proof at the outset. Our &quot;subformula
strategy&quot; enabled us to prove four of the 29 hard theorems completely
mechanically. These are Ph.D. level proofs, of length up to 108.

 <dc:description>  For many power-limited networks, such as wireless sensor networks and mobile
ad hoc networks, maximizing the network lifetime is the first concern in the
related designing and maintaining activities. We study the network lifetime
from the perspective of network science. In our dynamic network, nodes are
assigned a fixed amount of energy initially and consume the energy in the
delivery of packets. We divided the network traffic flow into four states: no,
slow, fast, and absolute congestion states. We derive the network lifetime by
considering the state of the traffic flow. We find that the network lifetime is
generally opposite to traffic congestion in that the more congested traffic,
the less network lifetime. We also find the impacts of factors such as packet
generation rate, communication radius, node moving speed, etc., on network
lifetime and traffic congestion.

 <dc:description>  Community Question Answering (cQA) forums have become a popular medium for
soliciting direct answers to specific questions of users from experts or other
experienced users on a given topic. However, for a given question, users
sometimes have to sift through a large number of low-quality or irrelevant
answers to find out the answer which satisfies their information need. To
alleviate this, the problem of Answer Quality Prediction (AQP) aims to predict
the quality of an answer posted in response to a forum question. Current AQP
systems either learn models using - a) various hand-crafted features (HCF) or
b) use deep learning (DL) techniques which automatically learn the required
feature representations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for AQP known as - &quot;Deep Feature
Fusion Network (DFFN)&quot; which leverages the advantages of both hand-crafted
features and deep learning based systems. Given a question-answer pair along
with its metadata, DFFN independently - a) learns deep features using a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and b) computes hand-crafted features using
various external resources and then combines them using a deep neural network
trained to predict the final answer quality. DFFN achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the standard SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016 benchmark datasets
and outperforms baseline approaches which individually employ either HCF or DL
based techniques alone.

 <dc:description>  In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality, frequently encountered in Big
Data analysis, there was a vast development in the field of linear and
nonlinear dimension reduction techniques in recent years. These techniques
(sometimes referred to as manifold learning) assume that the scattered input
data is lying on a lower dimensional manifold, thus the high dimensionality
problem can be overcome by learning the lower dimensionality behavior. However,
in real life applications, data is often very noisy. In this work, we propose a
method to approximate $\MM$ a $d$-dimensional $C^{m+1}$ smooth submanifold of
$\RR^n$ ($d &lt;&lt; n$) based upon noisy scattered data points (i.e., a data cloud).
We assume that the data points are located &quot;near&quot; the lower dimensional
manifold and suggest a non-linear moving least-squares projection on an
approximating $d$-dimensional manifold. Under some mild assumptions, the
resulting approximant is shown to be infinitely smooth and of high
approximation order (i.e., $O(h^{m+1})$, where $h$ is the fill distance and $m$
is the degree of the local polynomial approximation). The method presented here
assumes no analytic knowledge of the approximated manifold and the
approximation algorithm is linear in the large dimension $n$. Furthermore, the
approximating manifold can serve as a framework to perform operations directly
on the high dimensional data in a computationally efficient manner. This way,
the preparatory step of dimension reduction, which induces distortions to the
data, can be avoided altogether.

 <dc:description>  We present the choreography enactment pricing game, a cooperative
game-theoretic model for the study of scheduling of jobs using competitor
service providers. A choreography (a peer-to-peer service composition model)
needs a set of services to fulfill its jobs requirements. Users must choose,
for each requirement, which service providers will be used to enact the
choreography at lowest cost. Due to the lack of centralization, vendors can
form alliances to control the market. We show a novel algorithm capable of
detecting alliances among service providers, based on our study of the
bargaining set of this game.

 <dc:description>  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a trending field of research, showing
great promise in many challenging problems such as playing Atari, solving Go
and controlling robots. While DRL agents perform well in practice we are still
missing the tools to analayze their performance and visualize the temporal
abstractions that they learn. In this paper, we present a novel method that
automatically discovers an internal Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) model
in the Deep Q Network's (DQN) learned representation. We suggest a novel
visualization method that represents the SMDP model by a directed graph and
visualize it above a t-SNE map. We show how can we interpret the agent's policy
and give evidence for the hierarchical state aggregation that DQNs are learning
automatically. Our algorithm is fully automatic, does not require any domain
specific knowledge and is evaluated by a novel likelihood based evaluation
criteria.

 <dc:description>  We consider a notion of relative homology (and cohomology) for surfaces with
two types of boundaries. Using this tool, we study a generalization of Kitaev's
code based on surfaces with mixed boundaries. This construction includes both
Bravyi and Kitaev's and Freedman and Meyer's extension of Kitaev's toric code.
We argue that our generalization offers a denser storage of quantum
information. In a planar architecture, we obtain a three-fold overhead
reduction over the standard architecture consisting of a punctured square
lattice.

 <dc:description>  We study the reactive synthesis problem (RS) for specifications given in
Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL). RS is known to be undecidable in a very
general setting, but on infinite words only; and only the very restrictive BRRS
subcase is known to be decidable (see D'Souza et al. and Bouyer et al.). In
this paper, we precise the decidability border of MITL synthesis. We show RS is
undecidable on finite words too, and present a landscape of restrictions (both
on the logic and on the possible controllers) that are still undecidable. On
the positive side, we revisit BRRS and introduce an efficient on-the-fly
algorithm to solve it.

 <dc:description>  Most accurate recommender systems are black-box models, hiding the reasoning
behind their recommendations. Yet explanations have been shown to increase the
user's trust in the system in addition to providing other benefits such as
scrutability, meaning the ability to verify the validity of recommendations.
This gap between accuracy and transparency or explainability has generated an
interest in automated explanation generation methods. Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (RBM) are accurate models for CF that also lack interpretability. In
this paper, we focus on RBM based collaborative filtering recommendations, and
further assume the absence of any additional data source, such as item content
or user attributes. We thus propose a new Explainable RBM technique that
computes the top-n recommendation list from items that are explainable.
Experimental results show that our method is effective in generating accurate
and explainable recommendations.

 <dc:description>  Peer-led team learning (PLTL) is a model for teaching STEM courses where
small student groups meet periodically to collaboratively discuss coursework.
Automatic analysis of PLTL sessions would help education researchers to get
insight into how learning outcomes are impacted by individual participation,
group behavior, team dynamics, etc.. Towards this, speech and language
technology can help, and speaker diarization technology will lay the foundation
for analysis. In this study, a new corpus is established called CRSS-PLTL, that
contains speech data from 5 PLTL teams over a semester (10 sessions per team
with 5-to-8 participants in each team). In CRSS-PLTL, every participant wears a
LENA device (portable audio recorder) that provides multiple audio recordings
of the event. Our proposed solution is unsupervised and contains a new online
speaker change detection algorithm, termed G 3 algorithm in conjunction with
Hausdorff-distance based clustering to provide improved detection accuracy.
Additionally, we also exploit cross channel information to refine our
diarization hypothesis. The proposed system provides good improvements in
diarization error rate (DER) over the baseline LIUM system. We also present
higher level analysis such as the number of conversational turns taken in a
session, and speaking-time duration (participation) for each speaker.

 <dc:description>  We present a simple approach for automatically extracting the number of
subjects involved in randomised controlled trials (RCT). Our approach first
applies a set of rule-based techniques to extract candidate study sizes from
the abstracts of the articles. Supervised classification is then performed over
the candidates with support vector machines, using a small set of lexical,
structural, and contextual features. With only a small annotated training set
of 201 RCTs, we obtained an accuracy of 88\%. We believe that this system will
aid complex medical text processing tasks such as summarisation and question
answering.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, what has become known as collaborative consumption has
undergone rapid expansion through peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. In the field of
tourism, a particularly notable example is that of Airbnb. This article
analyses the spatial patterns of Airbnb in Barcelona and compares them with
hotels and sightseeing spots. New sources of data, such as Airbnb listings and
geolocated photographs are used. Analysis of bivariate spatial autocorrelation
reveals a close spatial relationship between Airbnb and hotels, with a marked
centre-periphery pattern, although Airbnb predominates around the main hotel
axis and hotels predominate in some peripheral areas of the city. Another
interesting finding is that Airbnb capitalises more on the advantages of
proximity to the main tourist attractions of the city than does the hotel
sector. Finally, it was possible to detect those parts of the city that have
seen the greatest increase in pressure from tourism related to Airbnb's recent
expansion.

 <dc:title>Energy Efficiency in Multiuser Transmission Over Parallel Frequency

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency is an important design criterion for wireless
communications. When parallel frequency channels are used for multiuser
transmission, the channel bandwidths and user power are adjusted to maximize
the sum information rate with the bandwidth budget, the transmit power budget,
and the user-specific rate requirements. The maximum sum rate is used in
measuring the energy efficiency. With fixed or flexible bandwidths of the
frequency channels, practical methods are developed to find the total transmit
power with the unique optimal resource (bandwidth and power) allocation for
maximum energy efficiency. This resource allocation ensures that, while each
user's minimum rate requirement is satisfied, all the excess resource of the
spectrum and transmit power is dedicated to the one user with the best channel
quality. Simulation results validate the optimal solutions of total transmit
power and resource allocation that support the energy-efficient multiuser
transmission.

 <dc:description>  Differential privacy is a promising formal approach to data privacy, which
provides a quantitative bound on the privacy cost of an algorithm that operates
on sensitive information. Several tools have been developed for the formal
verification of differentially private algorithms, including program logics and
type systems. However, these tools do not capture fundamental techniques that
have emerged in recent years, and cannot be used for reasoning about
cutting-edge differentially private algorithms. Existing techniques fail to
handle three broad classes of algorithms: 1) algorithms where privacy depends
accuracy guarantees, 2) algorithms that are analyzed with the advanced
composition theorem, which shows slower growth in the privacy cost, 3)
algorithms that interactively accept adaptive inputs.
  We address these limitations with a new formalism extending apRHL, a
relational program logic that has been used for proving differential privacy of
non-interactive algorithms, and incorporating aHL, a (non-relational) program
logic for accuracy properties. We illustrate our approach through a single
running example, which exemplifies the three classes of algorithms and explores
new variants of the Sparse Vector technique, a well-studied algorithm from the
privacy literature. We implement our logic in EasyCrypt, and formally verify
privacy. We also introduce a novel coupling technique called \emph{optimal
subset coupling} that may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Stability evaluation of a weight-update system of higher-order neural units
(HONUs) with polynomial aggregation of neural inputs (also known as classes of
polynomial neural networks) for adaptation of both feedforward and recurrent
HONUs by a gradient descent method is introduced. An essential core of the
approach is based on spectral radius of a weight-update system, and it allows
stability monitoring and its maintenance at every adaptation step individually.
Assuring stability of the weight-update system (at every single adaptation
step) naturally results in adaptation stability of the whole neural
architecture that adapts to target data. As an aside, the used approach
highlights the fact that the weight optimization of HONU is a linear problem,
so the proposed approach can be generally extended to any neural architecture
that is linear in its adaptable parameters.

 <dc:description>  It is well-known that malware constantly evolves so as to evade detection and
this causes the entire malware population to be non-stationary. Contrary to
this fact, prior works on machine learning based Android malware detection have
assumed that the distribution of the observed malware characteristics (i.e.,
features) do not change over time. In this work, we address the problem of
malware population drift and propose a novel online machine learning based
framework, named DroidOL to handle it and effectively detect malware. In order
to perform accurate detection, security-sensitive behaviors are captured from
apps in the form of inter-procedural control-flow sub-graph features using a
state-of-the-art graph kernel. In order to perform scalable detection and to
adapt to the drift and evolution in malware population, an online
passive-aggressive classifier is used.
  In a large-scale comparative analysis with more than 87,000 apps, DroidOL
achieves 84.29% accuracy outperforming two state-of-the-art malware techniques
by more than 20% in their typical batch learning setting and more than 3% when
they are continuously re-trained. Our experimental findings strongly indicate
that online learning based approaches are highly suitable for real-world
malware detection.

 <dc:description>  In recent years online advertising has become increasingly ubiquitous and
effective. Advertisements shown to visitors fund sites and apps that publish
digital content, manage social networks, and operate e-mail services. Given
such large variety of internet resources, determining an appropriate type of
advertising for a given platform has become critical to financial success.
Native advertisements, namely ads that are similar in look and feel to content,
have had great success in news and social feeds. However, to date there has not
been a winning formula for ads in e-mail clients. In this paper we describe a
system that leverages user purchase history determined from e-mail receipts to
deliver highly personalized product ads to Yahoo Mail users. We propose to use
a novel neural language-based algorithm specifically tailored for delivering
effective product recommendations, which was evaluated against baselines that
included showing popular products and products predicted based on
co-occurrence. We conducted rigorous offline testing using a large-scale

 <dc:description>  The maximum matching width is a width-parameter that is defined on a
branch-decomposition over the vertex set of a graph. The size of a maximum
matching in the bipartite graph is used as a cut-function. In this paper, we
characterize the graphs of maximum matching width at most 2 using the minor
obstruction set. Also, we compute the exact value of the maximum matching width
of a grid.

 <dc:description>  The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is a rapid, inexpensive, and popular
neuropsychological screening tool for cognitive conditions. The Digital Clock
Drawing Test (dCDT) uses novel software to analyze data from a digitizing
ballpoint pen that reports its position with considerable spatial and temporal
precision, making possible the analysis of both the drawing process and final
product. We developed methodology to analyze pen stroke data from these
drawings, and computed a large collection of features which were then analyzed
with a variety of machine learning techniques. The resulting scoring systems
were designed to be more accurate than the systems currently used by
clinicians, but just as interpretable and easy to use. The systems also allow
us to quantify the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. We created
automated versions of the CDT scoring systems currently used by clinicians,
allowing us to benchmark our models, which indicated that our machine learning
models substantially outperformed the existing scoring systems.

 <dc:description>  Nearly all 3D displays need calibration for correct rendering. More often
than not, the optical elements in a 3D display are misaligned from the designed
parameter setting. As a result, 3D magic does not perform well as intended. The
observed images tend to get distorted. In this paper, we propose a novel
display calibration method to fix the situation. In our method, a pattern image
is displayed on the panel and a camera takes its pictures twice at different
positions. Then, based on a quantitative model, we extract all display
parameters (i.e., pitch, slanted angle, gap or thickness, offset) from the
observed patterns in the captured images. For high accuracy and robustness, our
method analyzes the patterns mostly in frequency domain. We conduct two types
of experiments for validation; one with optical simulation for quantitative
results and the other with real-life displays for qualitative assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method is quite accurate, about a
half order of magnitude higher than prior work; is efficient, spending less
than 2 s for computation; and is robust to noise, working well in the SNR
regime as low as 6 dB.

 <dc:description>  Owing to the vulnerability of relay-assisted and device-to-device (D2D)
communications, improving wireless security from a physical layer signal
processing perspective is attracting increasing interest. Hence we address the
problem of secure transmission in a relay-assisted network, where a pair of
legitimate user equipments (UEs) communicate with the aid of a multiple-input
multiple output (MIMO) relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (eves).
Assuming imperfect knowledge of the eves' channels, we jointly optimize the
power of the source UE, the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying matrix and the
covariance of the artificial noise (AN) transmitted by the relay, in order to
maximize the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the
destination, while imposing a set of robust secrecy constraints. To tackle the
resultant nonconvex optimization problem, a globally optimal solution based on
a bi-level optimization framework is proposed, but with high complexity. Then a
low-complexity sub-optimal method relying on a new penalized
difference-of-convex (DC) algorithmic framework is proposed, which is
specifically designed for non-convex semidefinite programs (SDPs). We show how
this penalized DC framework can be invoked for solving our robust secure
relaying problem with proven convergence. Our extensive simulation results show
that both proposed solutions are capable of ensuring the secrecy of the
relay-aided transmission and significantly improve the robustness towards the
eves' channel uncertainties as compared to the non-robust counterparts. It is
also demonstrated the penalized DC-based method advocated yields a performance
close to the globally optimal solution.

 <dc:description>  When two terms occur together in a document, the probability of a close
relationship between them and the document itself is greater if they are in
nearby positions. However, ranking functions including term proximity (TP)
require larger indexes than traditional document-level indexing, which slows
down query processing. Previous studies also show that this technique is not
effective for all types of queries. Here we propose a document ranking model
which decides for which queries it would be beneficial to use a proximity-based
ranking, based on a collection of features of the query. We use a machine
learning approach in determining whether utilizing TP will be beneficial.
Experiments show that the proposed model returns improved rankings while also
reducing the overhead incurred as a result of using TP statistics.

 <dc:description>  As one of the leading platforms for creative content, Tumblr offers
advertisers a unique way of creating brand identity. Advertisers can tell their
story through images, animation, text, music, video, and more, and promote that
content by sponsoring it to appear as an advertisement in the streams of Tumblr
users. In this paper we present a framework that enabled one of the key
targeted advertising components for Tumblr, specifically gender and interest
targeting. We describe the main challenges involved in development of the
framework, which include creating the ground truth for training gender
prediction models, as well as mapping Tumblr content to an interest taxonomy.
For purposes of inferring user interests we propose a novel semi-supervised
neural language model for categorization of Tumblr content (i.e., post tags and
post keywords). The model was trained on a large-scale data set consisting of
6.8 billion user posts, with very limited amount of categorized keywords, and
was shown to have superior performance over the bag-of-words model. We
successfully deployed gender and interest targeting capability in Yahoo
production systems, delivering inference for users that cover more than 90% of
daily activities at Tumblr. Online performance results indicate advantages of
the proposed approach, where we observed 20% lift in user engagement with
sponsored posts as compared to untargeted campaigns.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a two-dimensional heterogeneous cellular network
scenario consisting of one base station (BS) and some mobile stations (MSs)
whose locations follow a Poisson point process (PPP). The MSs are equipped with
multiple radio access interfaces including a cellular access interface and at
least one short-range communication interface. We propose a nearest-neighbor
cooperation communication (NNCC) scheme by exploiting the short-range
communication between a MS and its nearest neighbor to collaborate on their
uplink transmissions. In the proposed cooperation scheme, a MS and its nearest
neighbor first exchange data by the short-range communication. Upon successful
decoding of the data from each other, they proceed to send their own data, as
well as the data received from the other to the BS respectively in orthogonal
time slots. The energy efficiency analysis for the proposed scheme is presented
based on the characteristics of the PPP and the Rayleigh fading channel.
Numerical results show that the NNCC scheme significantly improves the energy
efficiency compared to the conventional non-cooperative uplink transmissions.

 <dc:description>  The recent developments in full duplex (FD) communication promise doubling
the capacity of cellular networks using self interference cancellation (SIC)
techniques. FD small cells with device-to-device (D2D) communication links
could achieve the expected capacity of the future cellular networks (5G). In
this work, we consider joint scheduling and dynamic power algorithm (DPA) for a
single cell FD small cell network with D2D links (D2DLs). We formulate the
optimal user selection and power control as a non-linear programming (NLP)
optimization problem to get the optimal user scheduling and transmission power
in a given TTI. Our numerical results show that using DPA gives better overall
throughput performance than full power transmission algorithm (FPA). Also,
simultaneous transmissions (combination of uplink (UL), downlink (DL), and D2D
occur 80% of the time thereby increasing the spectral efficiency and network
capacity.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the energy saving of base station (BS) deployed in a
1-D multi-hop vehicular network with sleep scheduling strategy. We consider
cooperative BS scheduling strategy where BSs can switch between sleep and
active modes to reduce the average energy consumption utilizing the information
of vehicular speeds and locations. Assuming a Poisson distribution of vehicles,
we derive an appropriate probability distribution function of distance between
two adjacent cluster heads, where a cluster is a maximal set of vehicles in
which every two adjacent vehicles can communicate directly when their Euclidean
distance is less than or equal to a threshold, known as the communication range
of vehicles. Furthermore, the expected value of the sojourn time in the sleep
mode and energy saving are obtained. The numerical results show that the sleep
scheduling strategy significantly reduces the energy consumption of the base
stations.

 <dc:description>  The timed pattern matching problem is formulated by Ulus et al. and has been
actively studied since, with its evident application in monitoring real-time
systems. The problem takes as input a timed word/signal and a timed pattern
(specified either by a timed regular expression or by a timed automaton); and
it returns the set of those intervals for which the given timed word, when
restricted to the interval, matches the given pattern. We contribute a
Boyer-Moore type optimization in timed pattern matching, relying on the classic
Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm and its extension to (untimed) pattern
matching by Watson and Watson. We assess its effect through experiments; for
some problem instances our Boyer-Moore type optimization achieves speed-up by
two times, indicating its potential in real-world monitoring tasks where data
sets tend to be massive.

 <dc:description>  A Dynamic Graph Network is a graph in which each edge has an associated
travel time and a capacity (width) that limits the number of items that can
travel in parallel along that edge. Each vertex in this dynamic graph network
begins with the number of items that must be evacuated into designated sink
vertices. A $k$-sink evacuation protocol finds the location of $k$ sinks and
associated evacuation movement protocol that allows evacuating all the items to
a sink in minimum time. The associated evacuation movement must impose a
confluent flow, i.e, all items passing through a particular vertex exit that
vertex using the same edge. In this paper we address the $k$-sink evacuation
problem on a dynamic path network. We provide solutions that run in $O(n \log
n)$ time for $k=1$ and $O(k n \log^2 n)$ for $k &gt;1$ and work for arbitrary edge
capacities.

 <dc:description>  This paper tackles the problem of the semantic gap between a document and a
query within an ad-hoc information retrieval task. In this context, knowledge
bases (KBs) have already been acknowledged as valuable means since they allow
the representation of explicit relations between entities. However, they do not
necessarily represent implicit relations that could be hidden in a corpora.
This latter issue is tackled by recent works dealing with deep representation
learn ing of texts. With this in mind, we argue that embedding KBs within deep
neural architectures supporting documentquery matching would give rise to
fine-grained latent representations of both words and their semantic relations.
In this paper, we review the main approaches of neural-based document ranking
as well as those approaches for latent representation of entities and relations
via KBs. We then propose some avenues to incorporate KBs in deep neural
approaches for document ranking. More particularly, this paper advocates that
KBs can be used either to support enhanced latent representations of queries
and documents based on both distributional and relational semantics or to serve
as a semantic translator between their latent distributional representations.

 <dc:description>  We consider a decentralized optimal control problem for a linear plant
controlled by two controllers, a local controller and a remote controller. The
local controller directly observes the state of the plant and can inform the
remote controller of the plant state through a packet-drop channel. We assume
that the remote controller is able to send acknowledgments to the local
controller to signal the successful receipt of transmitted packets. The
objective of the two controllers is to cooperatively minimize a quadratic
performance cost. We provide a dynamic program for this decentralized control
problem using the common information approach. Although our problem is not a
partially nested LQG problem, we obtain explicit optimal strategies for the two
controllers. In the optimal strategies, both controllers compute a common
estimate of the plant state based on the common information. The remote
controller's action is linear in the common estimated state, and the local
controller's action is linear in both the actual state and the common estimated
state.

 <dc:description>  People often use a web search engine to find information about events of
interest, for example, sport competitions, political elections, festivals and
entertainment news. In this paper, we study a problem of detecting
event-related queries, which is the first step before selecting a suitable
time-aware retrieval model. In general, event-related information needs can be
observed in query streams through various temporal patterns of user search
behavior, e.g., spiky peaks for popular events, and periodicities for
repetitive events. However, it is also common that users search for non-popular
events, which may not exhibit temporal variations in query streams, e.g., past
events recently occurred, historical events triggered by anniversaries or
similar events, and future events anticipated to happen. To address the
challenge of detecting dynamic classes of events, we propose a novel deep
learning model to classify a given query into a predetermined set of multiple
event types. Our proposed model, a Stacked Multilayer Perceptron (S-MLP)
network, consists of multilayer perceptron used as a basic learning unit. We
assemble stacked units to further learn complex relationships between neutrons
in successive layers. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct experiments
using real-world queries and a set of manually created ground truth.
Preliminary results have shown that our proposed deep learning model
outperforms the state-of-the-art classification models significantly.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the application of a new algebraic method of edge
coloring, called complex coloring, to the scheduling problems of input queued
switches. The proposed distributed parallel scheduling algorithm possesses two
important features: optimality and rearrangeability. Optimality ensures that
the algorithm always returns a proper coloring with the minimum number of
required colors, and rearrangeability allows partially re-coloring the existing
connection patterns if the underlying graph only changes slightly. The running
time of the proposed scheduling algorithm is on the order of $O(\log^2 N)$ per
frame, and the amortized time complexity, the time to compute a matching per
timeslot, is only $O(\log N)$. The scheduling algorithm is highly robust in the
face of traffic fluctuations. Since the higher the variable density, the higher
the efficiency of the variable elimination process, complex coloring provides a
natural adaptive solution to non-uniform input traffic patterns. The proposed
scheduling algorithm for packet switching can achieve nearly 100% throughput.

 <dc:description>  Semantic segmentation tasks can be well modeled by Markov Random Field (MRF).
This paper addresses semantic segmentation by incorporating high-order
relations and mixture of label contexts into MRF. Unlike previous works that
optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm, we solve MRF by proposing a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN), which
enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass.
Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN to model unary terms and
additional layers are devised to approximate the mean field (MF) algorithm for
pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from the
recent works that required many iterations of MF during back-propagation, DPN
is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF.
Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise terms, making many existing
models as its special cases. Furthermore, pairwise terms in DPN provide a
unified framework to encode rich contextual information in high-dimensional
data, such as images and videos. Third, DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized
and speeded up, thus enabling efficient inference. DPN is thoroughly evaluated
on standard semantic image/video segmentation benchmarks, where a single DPN
model yields state-of-the-art segmentation accuracies on PASCAL VOC 2012,
Cityscapes dataset and CamVid dataset.

 <dc:description>  Parameter estimation from multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) is a
fundamental problem in many signal processing applications, e.g., spectral
analysis and direction-of- arrival estimation. Recently, this problem has been
address using prior information in form of a jointly sparse signal structure. A
prominent approach for exploiting joint sparsity considers mixed-norm
minimization in which, however, the problem size grows with the number of
measurements and the desired resolution, respectively. In this work we derive
an equivalent, compact reformulation of the $\ell_{2,1}$ mixed-norm
minimization problem which provides new insights on the relation between
different existing approaches for jointly sparse signal reconstruction. The
reformulation builds upon a compact parameterization, which models the
row-norms of the sparse signal representation as parameters of interest,
resulting in a significant reduction of the MMV problem size. Given the sparse
vector of row-norms, the jointly sparse signal can be computed from the MMVs in
closed form. For the special case of uniform linear sampling, we present an
extension of the compact formulation for gridless parameter estimation by means
of semidefinite programming. Furthermore, we derive in this case from our
compact problem formulation the exact equivalence between the $\ell_{2,1}$
mixed-norm minimization and the atomic-norm minimization. Additionally, for the
case of irregular sampling or a large number of samples, we present a low
complexity, grid-based implementation based on the coordinate descent method.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Energy beamforming (EB) is a key technique for achieving efficient
radio-frequency (RF) transmission enabled wireless energy transfer (WET). By
optimally designing the waveforms from multiple energy transmitters (ETs) over
the wireless channels, they can be constructively combined at the energy
receiver (ER) to achieve an EB gain that scales with the number of ETs.
However, the optimal design of EB waveforms requires accurate channel state
information (CSI) at the ETs, which is challenging to obtain practically,
especially in a distributed system with ETs at separate locations. In this
paper, we study practical and efficient channel training methods to achieve
optimal EB in a distributed WET system. We propose two protocols with and
without centralized coordination, respectively, where distributed ETs either
sequentially or in parallel adapt their transmit phases based on a
low-complexity energy feedback from the ER. The energy feedback only depends on
the received power level at the ER, where each feedback indicates one
particular transmit phase that results in the maximum harvested power over a
set of previously used phases. Simulation results show that the two proposed
training protocols converge very fast in practical WET systems even with a
large number of distributed ETs, while the protocol with sequential ET phase
adaptation is also analytically shown to converge to the optimal EB design with
perfect CSI by increasing the training time. Numerical results are also
provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed distributed EB and
training designs as compared to other benchmark schemes.

 <dc:description>  With the increasing popularity of online learning, intelligent tutoring
systems are regaining increased attention. In this paper, we introduce adaptive
algorithms for personalized assignment of learning tasks to student so that to
improve his performance in online learning environments. As main contribution
of this paper, we propose a a novel Skill-Based Task Selector (SBTS) algorithm
which is able to approximate a student's skill level based on his performance
and consequently suggest adequate assignments. The SBTS is inspired by the
class of multi-armed bandit algorithms. However, in contrast to standard
multi-armed bandit approaches, the SBTS aims at acquiring two criteria related
to student learning, namely: which topics should the student work on, and what
level of difficulty should the task be. The SBTS centers on innovative reward
and punishment schemes in a task and skill matrix based on the student
behaviour.
  To verify the algorithm, the complex student behaviour is modelled using a
neighbour node selection approach based on empirical estimations of a students
learning curve. The algorithm is evaluated with a practical scenario from a
basic java programming course. The SBTS is able to quickly and accurately adapt
to the composite student competency --- even with a multitude of student
models.

 <dc:description>  Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging datasets suffer from low Signal-to-Noise
Ratio, especially at high b-values. Acquiring data at high b-values contains
relevant information and is now of great interest for microstructural and
connectomics studies. High noise levels bias the measurements due to the
non-Gaussian nature of the noise, which in turn can lead to a false and biased
estimation of the diffusion parameters. Additionally, the usage of in-plane
acceleration techniques during the acquisition leads to a spatially varying
noise distribution, which depends on the parallel acceleration method
implemented on the scanner. This paper proposes a novel diffusion MRI denoising
technique that can be used on all existing data, without adding to the scanning
time. We first apply a statistical framework to convert the noise to Gaussian
distributed noise, effectively removing the bias. We then introduce a spatially
and angular adaptive denoising technique, the Non Local Spatial and Angular
Matching (NLSAM) algorithm. Each volume is first decomposed in small 4D
overlapping patches to capture the structure of the diffusion data and a
dictionary of atoms is learned on those patches. A local sparse decomposition
is then found by bounding the reconstruction error with the local noise
variance. We compare against three other state-of-the-art denoising methods and
show quantitative local and connectivity results on a synthetic phantom and on
an in-vivo high resolution dataset. Overall, our method restores perceptual
information, removes the noise bias in common diffusion metrics, restores the
extracted peaks coherence and improves reproducibility of tractography. Our
work paves the way for higher spatial resolution acquisition of diffusion MRI
datasets, which could in turn reveal new anatomical details that are not
discernible at the spatial resolution currently used by the diffusion MRI
community.

 <dc:description>  With the explosive growth of smart devices and mobile data traffic, limited
fronthaul capacity has become a notable bottleneck of green communication
access networks, such as cloud radio access networks(C-RANs). In this paper, we
proposed a joint user association and downlink beamforming scheme for green
C-RANs to minimize the network power consumption with the limited fronthaul
links. We first formulate the design problem as a mixed integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP), and then transformed the MINLP problem into a mixed
integer second-order cone program (MI-SOCP) which is a convex program when the
integer variables are fixed. By relaxing the integer variables to continuous
ones, an inflation algorithm, which can be finished within polynomial time, was
proposed to solved the problem. The simulation results are presented to
validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm compared with the the
scheme adopted by LTE-A.

 <dc:description>  Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has been redefined in this era. People want
to interact with their devices in such a way that has physical significance in
the real world, in other words, they want ergonomic input devices. In this
paper, we propose a new method of interaction with computing devices having a
consumer grade camera, that uses two colored markers (red and green) worn on
tips of the fingers to generate desired hand gestures, and for marker detection
and tracking we used template matching with kalman filter. We have implemented
all the usual system commands, i.e., cursor movement, right click, left click,
double click, going forward and backward, zoom in and out through different
hand gestures. Our system can easily recognize these gestures and give
corresponding system commands. Our system is suitable for both desktop devices
and devices where touch screen is not feasible like large screens or projected
screens.

 <dc:description>  A big challenge in algorithmic composition is to devise a model that is both
easily trainable and able to reproduce the long-range temporal dependencies
typical of music. Here we investigate how artificial neural networks can be
trained on a large corpus of melodies and turned into automated music composers
able to generate new melodies coherent with the style they have been trained
on. We employ gated recurrent unit networks that have been shown to be
particularly efficient in learning complex sequential activations with
arbitrary long time lags. Our model processes rhythm and melody in parallel
while modeling the relation between these two features. Using such an approach,
we were able to generate interesting complete melodies or suggest possible
continuations of a melody fragment that is coherent with the characteristics of
the fragment itself.

 <dc:description>  Articulated hand pose estimation plays an important role in human-computer
interaction. Despite the recent progress, the accuracy of existing methods is
still not satisfactory, partially due to the difficulty of embedded
high-dimensional and non-linear regression problem. Different from the existing
discriminative methods that regress for the hand pose with a single depth
image, we propose to first project the query depth image onto three orthogonal
planes and utilize these multi-view projections to regress for 2D heat-maps
which estimate the joint positions on each plane. These multi-view heat-maps
are then fused to produce final 3D hand pose estimation with learned pose
priors. Experiments show that the proposed method largely outperforms
state-of-the-art on a challenging dataset. Moreover, a cross-dataset experiment
also demonstrates the good generalization ability of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  The problem of object recognition in natural scenes has been recently
successfully addressed with Deep Convolutional Neuronal Networks giving a
significant break-through in recognition scores. The computational efficiency
of Deep CNNs as a function of their depth, allows for their use in real-time
applications. One of the key issues here is to reduce the number of windows
selected from images to be submitted to a Deep CNN. This is usually solved by
preliminary segmentation and selection of specific windows, having outstanding
&quot;objectiveness&quot; or other value of indicators of possible location of objects.
In this paper we propose a Deep CNN approach and the general framework for
recognition of objects in a real-time scenario and in an egocentric
perspective. Here the window of interest is built on the basis of visual
attention map computed over gaze fixations measured by a glass-worn
eye-tracker. The application of this set-up is an interactive user-friendly
environment for upper-limb amputees. Vision has to help the subject to control
his worn neuro-prosthesis in case of a small amount of remaining muscles when
the EMG control becomes unefficient. The recognition results on a specifically
recorded corpus of 151 videos with simple geometrical objects show the mAP of
64,6\% and the computational time at the generalization lower than a time of a
visual fixation on the object-of-interest.

 <dc:description>  Process mining techniques aim to extract insights in processes from event
logs. One of the challenges in process mining is identifying interesting and
meaningful event labels that contribute to a better understanding of the
process. Our application area is mining data from smart homes for elderly,
where the ultimate goal is to signal deviations from usual behavior and provide
timely recommendations in order to extend the period of independent living.
Extracting individual process models showing user behavior is an important
instrument in achieving this goal. However, the interpretation of sensor data
at an appropriate abstraction level is not straightforward. For example, a
motion sensor in a bedroom can be triggered by tossing and turning in bed or by
getting up. We try to derive the actual activity depending on the context
(time, previous events, etc.). In this paper we introduce the notion of label
refinements, which links more abstract event descriptions with their more
refined counterparts. We present a statistical evaluation method to determine
the usefulness of a label refinement for a given event log from a process
perspective. Based on data from smart homes, we show how our statistical
evaluation method for label refinements can be used in practice. Our method was
able to select two label refinements out of a set of candidate label
refinements that both had a positive effect on model precision.

 <dc:description>  We study the theoretical capacity to statistically learn local landscape
information by Evolution Strategies (ESs). Specifically, we investigate the
covariance matrix when constructed by ESs operating with the selection operator
alone. We model continuous generation of candidate solutions about quadratic
basins of attraction, with deterministic selection of the decision vectors that
minimize the objective function values. Our goal is to rigorously show that
accumulation of winning individuals carries the potential to reveal valuable
information about the search landscape, e.g., as already practically utilized
by derandomized ES variants. We first show that the statistically-constructed
covariance matrix over such winning decision vectors shares the same
eigenvectors with the Hessian matrix about the optimum. We then provide an
analytic approximation of this covariance matrix for a non-elitist multi-child
$(1,\lambda)$-strategy, which holds for a large population size $\lambda$.
Finally, we also numerically corroborate our results.

 <dc:description>  A new graph dual formalism is presented for the analysis of line outages in
electricity networks. The dual formalism is based on a consideration of the
flows around closed cycles in the network. After some exposition of the theory
is presented, a new formula for the computation of Line Outage Distribution
Factors (LODFs) is derived, which is not only computationally faster than
existing methods, but also generalizes easily for multiple line outages and
arbitrary changes to line series reactance. In addition, the dual formalism
provides new physical insight for how the effects of line outages propagate
through the network. For example, in a planar network a single line outage can
be shown to induce monotonically decreasing flow changes, which are
mathematically equivalent to an electrostatic dipole field.

 <dc:description>  We discuss replica analytic continuation using several simple models in order
to prove mathematically the validity of replica analysis, which is used in a
wide range of fields related to large scale complex systems. While replica
analysis consists of two analytical techniques, the replica trick (or replica
analytic continuation) and the thermodynamical limit (and/or order parameter
expansion), we focus our study on replica analytic continuation, which is the
mathematical basis of the replica trick. We apply replica analysis to solve a
variety of analytical models, and examine the properties of replica analytic
continuation. Based on the positive results for these models we propose that
replica analytic continuation is a robust procedure in replica analysis.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we tackle the question of discovering an effective set of
spatial filters to solve hyperspectral classification problems. Instead of
fixing a priori the filters and their parameters using expert knowledge, we let
the model find them within random draws in the (possibly infinite) space of
possible filters. We define an active set feature learner that includes in the
model only features that improve the classifier. To this end, we consider a
fast and linear classifier, multiclass logistic classification, and show that
with a good representation (the filters discovered), such a simple classifier
can reach at least state of the art performances. We apply the proposed active
set learner in four hyperspectral image classification problems, including
agricultural and urban classification at different resolutions, as well as
multimodal data. We also propose a hierarchical setting, which allows to
generate more complex banks of features that can better describe the
nonlinearities present in the data.

 <dc:description>  Markov models lie at the interface between statistical independence in a
probability distribution and graph separation properties. We review model
selection and estimation in directed and undirected Markov models with Gaussian
parametrization, emphasizing the main similarities and differences. These two
models are similar but not equivalent, although they share a common
intersection. We present the existing results from a historical perspective,
taking into account the amount of literature existing from both the artificial
intelligence and statistics research communities, where these models were
originated. We also discuss how the Gaussian assumption can be relaxed. We
finally point out the main areas of application where these Markov models are
nowadays used.

 <dc:description>  Process mining techniques focus on extracting insight in processes from event
logs. In many cases, events recorded in the event log are too fine-grained,
causing process discovery algorithms to discover incomprehensible process
models or process models that are not representative of the event log. We show
that when process discovery algorithms are only able to discover an
unrepresentative process model from a low-level event log, structure in the
process can in some cases still be discovered by first abstracting the event
log to a higher level of granularity. This gives rise to the challenge to
bridge the gap between an original low-level event log and a desired high-level
perspective on this log, such that a more structured or more comprehensible
process model can be discovered. We show that supervised learning can be
leveraged for the event abstraction task when annotations with high-level
interpretations of the low-level events are available for a subset of the
sequences (i.e., traces). We present a method to generate feature vector
representations of events based on XES extensions, and describe an approach to
abstract events in an event log with Condition Random Fields using these event
features. Furthermore, we propose a sequence-focused metric to evaluate
supervised event abstraction results that fits closely to the tasks of process
discovery and conformance checking. We conclude this paper by demonstrating the
usefulness of supervised event abstraction for obtaining more structured and/or
more comprehensible process models using both real life event data and
synthetic event data.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on the problem of explaining predictions of psychological
attributes such as attractiveness, happiness, confidence and intelligence from
face photographs using deep neural networks. Since psychological attribute
datasets typically suffer from small sample sizes, we apply transfer learning
with two base models to avoid overfitting. These models were trained on an age
and gender prediction task, respectively. Using a novel explanation method we
extract heatmaps that highlight the parts of the image most responsible for the
prediction. We further observe that the explanation method provides important
insights into the nature of features of the base model, which allow one to
assess the aptitude of the base model for a given transfer learning task.
Finally, we observe that the multiclass model is more feature rich than its
binary counterpart. The experimental evaluation is performed on the 2222 images
from the 10k US faces dataset containing psychological attribute labels as well
as on a subset of KDEF images.

 <dc:description>  As the number of samples and dimensionality of optimization problems related
to statistics an machine learning explode, block coordinate descent algorithms
have gained popularity since they reduce the original problem to several
smaller ones. Coordinates to be optimized are usually selected randomly
according to a given probability distribution. We introduce an importance
sampling strategy that helps randomized coordinate descent algorithms to focus
on blocks that are still far from convergence. The framework applies to
problems composed of the sum of two possibly non-convex terms, one being
separable and non-smooth. We have compared our algorithm to a full gradient
proximal approach as well as to a randomized block coordinate algorithm that
considers uniform sampling and cyclic block coordinate descent. Experimental
evidences show the clear benefit of using an importance sampling strategy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we tackle the problem of image search when the query is a short
textual description of the image the user is looking for. We choose to
implement the actual search process as a similarity search in a visual feature
space, by learning to translate a textual query into a visual representation.
Searching in the visual feature space has the advantage that any update to the
translation model does not require to reprocess the, typically huge, image
collection on which the search is performed. We propose Text2Vis, a neural
network that generates a visual representation, in the visual feature space of
the fc6-fc7 layers of ImageNet, from a short descriptive text. Text2Vis
optimizes two loss functions, using a stochastic loss-selection method. A
visual-focused loss is aimed at learning the actual text-to-visual feature
mapping, while a text-focused loss is aimed at modeling the higher-level
semantic concepts expressed in language and countering the overfit on
non-relevant visual components of the visual loss. We report preliminary
results on the MS-COCO dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the effect of different regularizers and their
implications in high dimensional image classification and sparse linear
unmixing. Although kernelization or sparse methods are globally accepted
solutions for processing data in high dimensions, we present here a study on
the impact of the form of regularization used and its parametrization. We
consider regularization via traditional squared (2) and sparsity-promoting (1)
norms, as well as more unconventional nonconvex regularizers (p and Log Sum
Penalty). We compare their properties and advantages on several classification
and linear unmixing tasks and provide advices on the choice of the best
regularizer for the problem at hand. Finally, we also provide a fully
functional toolbox for the community.

 <dc:description>  Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is a recently proposed technique for
explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers in terms of input
variables. In this paper, we apply LRP for the first time to natural language
processing (NLP). More precisely, we use it to explain the predictions of a
convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a topic categorization task. Our
analysis highlights which words are relevant for a specific prediction of the
CNN. We compare our technique to standard sensitivity analysis, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, using a &quot;word deleting&quot; perturbation
experiment, a PCA analysis, and various visualizations. All experiments
validate the suitability of LRP for explaining the CNN predictions, which is
also in line with results reported in recent image classification studies.

 <dc:description>  Discrete Event Simulation is a widely used technique that is used to model
and analyze complex systems in many fields of science and engineering. The
increasingly large size of simulation models poses a serious computational
challenge, since the time needed to run a simulation can be prohibitively
large. For this reason, Parallel and Distributes Simulation techniques have
been proposed to take advantage of multiple execution units which are found in
multicore processors, cluster of workstations or HPC systems. The current
generation of HPC systems includes hundreds of thousands of computing nodes and
a vast amount of ancillary components. Despite improvements in manufacturing
processes, failures of some components are frequent, and the situation will get
worse as larger systems are built. In this paper we describe FT-GAIA, a
software-based fault-tolerant extension of the GAIA/ART\`IS parallel simulation
middleware. FT-GAIA transparently replicates simulation entities and
distributes them on multiple execution nodes. This allows the simulation to
tolerate crash-failures of computing nodes; furthermore, FT-GAIA offers some
protection against byzantine failures since synchronization messages are
replicated as well, so that the receiving entity can identify and discard
corrupted messages. We provide an experimental evaluation of FT-GAIA on a
running prototype. Results show that a high degree of fault tolerance can be
achieved, at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational load of the
execution units.

 <dc:description>  Tactile information is important for gripping, stable grasp, and in-hand
manipulation, yet the complexity of tactile data prevents widespread use of
such sensors. We make use of an unsupervised learning algorithm that transforms
the complex tactile data into a compact, latent representation without the need
to record ground truth reference data. These compact representations can either
be used directly in a reinforcement learning based controller or can be used to
calibrate the tactile sensor to physical quantities with only a few datapoints.
We show the quality of our latent representation by predicting important
features and with a simple control task.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of Robust Matrix Completion (RMC)
where the goal is to recover a low-rank matrix by observing a small number of
its entries out of which a few can be arbitrarily corrupted. We propose a
simple projected gradient descent method to estimate the low-rank matrix that
alternately performs a projected gradient descent step and cleans up a few of
the corrupted entries using hard-thresholding. Our algorithm solves RMC using
nearly optimal number of observations as well as nearly optimal number of
corruptions. Our result also implies significant improvement over the existing
time complexity bounds for the low-rank matrix completion problem. Finally, an
application of our result to the robust PCA problem (low-rank+sparse matrix
separation) leads to nearly linear time (in matrix dimensions) algorithm for
the same; existing state-of-the-art methods require quadratic time. Our
empirical results corroborate our theoretical results and show that even for
moderate sized problems, our method for robust PCA is an an order of magnitude
faster than the existing methods.

 <dc:description>  Saliency maps are used to understand human attention and visual fixation.
However, while very well established for static images, there is no general
agreement on how to compute a saliency map of dynamic scenes. In this paper we
propose a mathematically rigorous approach to this prob- lem, including static
saliency maps of each video frame for the calculation of the optical flow.
Taking into account static saliency maps for calculating the optical flow
allows for overcoming the aperture problem. Our ap- proach is able to explain
human fixation behavior in situations which pose challenges to standard
approaches, such as when a fixated object disappears behind an occlusion and
reappears after several frames. In addition, we quantitatively compare our
model against alternative solutions using a large eye tracking data set.
Together, our results suggest that assessing optical flow information across a
series of saliency maps gives a highly accurate and useful account of human
overt attention in dynamic scenes.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning using multi-layer neural networks (NNs) architecture manifests
superb power in modern machine learning systems. The trained Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) are typically large. The question we would like to address is
whether it is possible to simplify the NN during training process to achieve a
reasonable performance within an acceptable computational time. We presented a
novel approach of optimising a deep neural network through regularisation of
net- work architecture. We proposed regularisers which support a simple
mechanism of dropping neurons during a network training process. The method
supports the construction of a simpler deep neural networks with compatible
performance with its simplified version. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the
proposed method with examples including sparse linear regression, deep
autoencoder and convolutional neural network. The valuations demonstrate
excellent performance.

 <dc:description>  The major sources of abundant data are constantly expanding with the
available data collection methodologies in various applications - medical,
insurance, scientific, bio-informatics and business. These data sets may be
distributed geographically, rich in size and as well as dimensions also. To
analyze these data sets to find out the hidden patterns, it is required to
down- load the data to a centralized site which is a challenging task in terms
of the limited bandwidth available and computationally also expensive. The
covariance matrix is one of the methods to estimate the relation between any
two dimensions. In this paper, we propose a communication efficient algorithm
to estimate the covariance matrix in a distributed manner. The global
covariance matrix is computed by merging the local covariance matrices using a
distributed approach. The results show that it is exactly same as centralized
method with good speed-up in terms of computation. The reason for speed-up is
because of the parallel construction of local covariances and distributing the
cross-covariances among the nodes so that the load is balanced. The results are
analyzed by considering Mfeat data set on the various partitions which address
the scalability also.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of Conjunctive Query Answering (CQA) for the
description logic $\dlssx$ ($\shdlssx$, for short) which extends the logic
$\dlss$ with Boolean operations on concrete roles and with the product of
concepts.
  The result is obtained by formalizing $\shdlssx$-knowledge bases and
$\shdlssx$-conjunctive queries in terms of formulae of the four-level
set-theoretic fragment $\flqsr$, which admits a restricted form of
quantification on variables of the first three levels and on pair terms. We
solve the CQA problem for $\shdlssx$ through a decision procedure for the
satisfiability problem of $\flqsr$. We further define a \ke\space based
procedure for the same problem, more suitable for implementation purposes, and
analyze its computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  In 2020, ~60PB of archived data will be accessible to the astronomers. But to
analyze such a paramount data will be a challenging task. This is basically due
to the computational model used to download the data from complex
geographically distributed archives to a central site and then analyzing it in
the local systems. Because the data has to be downloaded to the central site,
the network BW limitation will be a hindrance for the scientific discoveries.
Also analyzing this PB-scale on local machines in a centralized manner is
challenging. In this virtual observatory is a step towards this problem,
however, it does not provide the data mining model. Adding the distributed data
mining layer to the VO can be the solution in which the knowledge can be
downloaded by the astronomers instead the raw data and thereafter astronomers
can either reconstruct the data back from the downloaded knowledge or use the
knowledge directly for further analysis.Therefore, in this paper, we present
Distributed Load Balancing Principal Component Analysis for optimally
distributing the computation among the available nodes to minimize the
transmission cost and downloading cost for the end user. The experimental
analysis is done with Fundamental Plane(FP) data, Gadotti data and complex
Mfeat data. In terms of transmission cost, our approach performs better than
Qi. et al. and Yue.et al. The analysis shows that with the complex Mfeat data
~90% downloading cost can be reduced for the end user with the negligible loss
in accuracy.

 <dc:title>Dynamical Systems On Weighted Lattices: General Theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Maragos, Petros</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work a theory is developed for unifying large classes of nonlinear
discrete-time dynamical systems obeying a superposition of a weighted maximum
or minimum type. The state vectors and input-output signals evolve on nonlinear
spaces which we call complete weighted lattices and include as special cases
the nonlinear vector spaces of minimax algebra. Their algebraic structure has a
polygonal geometry. Some of the special cases unified include max-plus,
max-product, and probabilistic dynamical systems. We study problems of
representation in state and input-output spaces using lattice monotone
operators, state and output responses using nonlinear convolutions, solving
nonlinear matrix equations using lattice adjunctions, stability and
controllability. We outline applications in state-space modeling of nonlinear
filtering; dynamic programming (Viterbi algorithm) and shortest paths (distance
maps); fuzzy Markov chains; and tracking audio-visual salient events in
multimodal information streams using generalized hidden Markov models with
control inputs.

 <dc:description>  Social media platforms are a rich source of information these days, however,
of all the available information, only a small fraction is of users' interest.
To help users catch up with the latest topics of their interests from the large
amount of information available in social media, we present a relevant content
filtering based framework for data stream summarization. More specifically,
given the topic or event of interest, this framework can dynamically discover
and filter out relevant information from irrelevant information in the stream
of text provided by social media platforms. It then further captures the most
representative and up-to-date information to generate a sequential summary or
event story line along with the evolution of the topic or event. Our framework
does not depend on any labeled data, it instead uses the weak supervision
provided by the user, which matches the real scenarios of users searching for
information about an ongoing event. We experimented on two real events traced
by a Twitter dataset from TREC 2011. The results verified the effectiveness of
relevant content filtering and sequential summary generation of the proposed
framework. It also shows its robustness of using the most easy-to-obtain weak
supervision, i.e., trending topic or hashtag. Thus, this framework can be
easily integrated into social media platforms such as Twitter to generate
sequential summaries for the events of interest. We also make the manually
generated gold-standard sequential summaries of the two test events publicly
available for future use in the community.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a number of deep-learning based models have been proposed for the
task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). The performance of most models is
clustered around 60-70%. In this paper we propose systematic methods to analyze
the behavior of these models as a first step towards recognizing their
strengths and weaknesses, and identifying the most fruitful directions for
progress. We analyze two models, one each from two major classes of VQA models
-- with-attention and without-attention and show the similarities and
differences in the behavior of these models. We also analyze the winning entry
of the VQA Challenge 2016.
  Our behavior analysis reveals that despite recent progress, today's VQA
models are &quot;myopic&quot; (tend to fail on sufficiently novel instances), often &quot;jump
to conclusions&quot; (converge on a predicted answer after 'listening' to just half
the question), and are &quot;stubborn&quot; (do not change their answers across images).

 <dc:description>  Communities in directed networks have often been characterized as regions
with a high density of links, or as sets of nodes with certain patterns of
connection. Our approach for community detection combines the optimization of a
quality function and a spectral clustering of a deformation of the
combinatorial Laplacian, the so-called magnetic Laplacian. The eigenfunctions
of the magnetic Laplacian, that we call magnetic eigenmaps, incorporate
structural information. Hence, using the magnetic eigenmaps, dense communities
including directed cycles can be revealed as well as &quot;role&quot; communities in
networks with a running flow, usually discovered thanks to mixture models.
Furthermore, in the spirit of the Markov stability method, an approach for
studying communities at different energy levels in the network is put forward,
based on a quantum mechanical system at finite temperature.

 <dc:description>  Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks are attracting a lot of attention
primarily because of their ability to offer affordable connectivity to the
low-power devices distributed over very large geographical areas. In realizing
the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), LPWA technologies complement and
sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless
technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and
machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. This review paper presents the design
goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer
wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We
survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities
carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF,
3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA
technologies (e.g., LORa Alliance,WEIGHTLESS-SIG, and DASH7 Alliance). We
further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing
similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research
challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the
proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large
nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the
research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens
of billions of devices in the next decade.

 <dc:description>  Consider a number of workers running SGD independently on the same pool of
data and averaging the models every once in a while -- a common but not well
understood practice. We study model averaging as a variance-reducing mechanism
and describe two ways in which the frequency of averaging affects convergence.
For convex objectives, we show the benefit of frequent averaging depends on the
gradient variance envelope. For non-convex objectives, we illustrate that this
benefit depends on the presence of multiple globally optimal points. We
complement our findings with multicore experiments on both synthetic and real
data.

the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to make it suitable input to standard
machine learning classifiers. This transformation properly treats the

the 18 resulting classifiers have AUC values ranging from .765 to .885. Further
evidence that the models have generalized well from the training data is
provided by the extremely high levels of agreement between the random forest

 <dc:description>  Calcium imaging is an important technique for monitoring the activity of
thousands of neurons simultaneously. As calcium imaging datasets grow in size,
automated detection of individual neurons is becoming important. Here we apply
a supervised learning approach to this problem and show that convolutional
networks can achieve near-human accuracy and superhuman speed. Accuracy is
superior to the popular PCA/ICA method based on precision and recall relative
to ground truth annotation by a human expert. These results suggest that
convolutional networks are an efficient and flexible tool for the analysis of
large-scale calcium imaging data.

 <dc:description>  While there is overall agreement that future technology for organizing,
browsing and searching videos hinges on the development of methods for
high-level semantic understanding of video, so far no consensus has been
reached on the best way to train and assess models for this task. Casting video
understanding as a form of action or event categorization is problematic as it
is not fully clear what the semantic classes or abstractions in this domain
should be. Language has been exploited to sidestep the problem of defining
video categories, by formulating video understanding as the task of captioning
or description. However, language is highly complex, redundant and sometimes
ambiguous. Many different captions may express the same semantic concept. To
account for this ambiguity, quantitative evaluation of video description
requires sophisticated metrics, whose performance scores are typically hard to
interpret by humans.
  This paper provides four contributions to this problem. First, we formulate
Video Multiple Choice Caption (VideoMCC) as a new well-defined task with an
easy-to-interpret performance measure. Second, we describe a general
semi-automatic procedure to create benchmarks for this task. Third, we publicly
release a large-scale video benchmark created with an implementation of this
procedure and we include a human study that assesses human performance on our
dataset. Finally, we propose and test a varied collection of approaches on this
benchmark for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the new
challenges posed by video comprehension.

 <dc:description>  Szubert and Jaskowski successfully used temporal difference (TD) learning
together with n-tuple networks for playing the game 2048. However, we observed
a phenomenon that the programs based on TD learning still hardly reach large
tiles. In this paper, we propose multi-stage TD (MS-TD) learning, a kind of
hierarchical reinforcement learning method, to effectively improve the
performance for the rates of reaching large tiles, which are good metrics to
analyze the strength of 2048 programs. Our experiments showed significant
improvements over the one without using MS-TD learning. Namely, using 3-ply
expectimax search, the program with MS-TD learning reached 32768-tiles with a
rate of 18.31%, while the one with TD learning did not reach any. After further
tuned, our 2048 program reached 32768-tiles with a rate of 31.75% in 10,000
games, and one among these games even reached a 65536-tile, which is the first
ever reaching a 65536-tile to our knowledge. In addition, MS-TD learning method
can be easily applied to other 2048-like games, such as Threes. Based on MS-TD
learning, our experiments for Threes also demonstrated similar performance
improvement, where the program with MS-TD learning reached 6144-tiles with a
rate of 7.83%, while the one with TD learning only reached 0.45%.

 <dc:description>  Several significant models have been developed that enable the study of
diffusion of signals across biological, social and engineered networks. Within
these established frameworks, the inverse problem of identifying the source of
the propagated signal is challenging, owing to the numerous alternative
possibilities for signal progression through the network. In real world
networks, the challenge of determining sources is compounded as the true
propagation dynamics are typically unknown, and when they have been directly
measured, they rarely conform to the assumptions of any of the well-studied
models. In this paper we introduce a method called Network Infusion (NI) that
has been designed to circumvent these issues, making source inference practical
for large, complex real world networks. The key idea is that to infer the
source node in the network, full characterization of diffusion dynamics, in
many cases, may not be necessary. This objective is achieved by creating a
diffusion kernel that well-approximates standard diffusion models, but lends
itself to inversion, by design, via likelihood maximization or error
minimization. We apply NI for both single-source and multi-source diffusion,
for both single-snapshot and multi-snapshot observations, and for both
homogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion setups. We prove the mean-field
optimality of NI for different scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness
over several synthetic networks. Moreover, we apply NI to a real-data
application, identifying news sources in the Digg social network, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of NI compared to existing methods. Finally, we
propose an integrative source inference framework that combines NI with a
distance centrality-based method, which leads to a robust performance in cases
where the underlying dynamics are unknown.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of learning Bayesian networks in an agnostic model
where an $\epsilon$-fraction of the samples are adversarially corrupted. Our
agnostic learning model is similar to -- in fact, stronger than -- Huber's
contamination model in robust statistics. In this work, we study the fully
observable Bernoulli case where the structure of the network is given. Even in
this basic setting, previous learning algorithms either run in exponential time
or lose dimension-dependent factors in their error guarantees. We provide the
first computationally efficient agnostic learning algorithm for this problem
with dimension-independent error guarantees. Our algorithm has polynomial
sample complexity, runs in polynomial time, and achieves error that scales
nearly-linearly with the fraction of adversarially corrupted samples.

 <dc:title>Nodes Localization in 3D Wireless Sensor Networks Based on

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the recent years, there has been a huge advancement in wireless sensor
computing technology. Today, wireless sensor network (WSN) has become a key
technology for different types of smart environment. Nodes localization in WSN
has arisen as a very challenging problem in the research community. Most of the
applications for WSN are not useful without a priory known nodes positions.
Adding GPS receivers to each node is an expensive solution and inapplicable for
indoor environments. In this paper, we implemented and evaluated an algorithm
based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique for three-dimensional (3D)
nodes localization in WSN using improved heuristic method for distance
calculation. Using extensive simulations we investigated our approach regarding
various network parameters. We compared the results from the simulations with
other approaches for 3D-WSN localization and showed that our approach
outperforms other techniques in terms of accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor networks take a major part in our everyday lives by enhancing
systems for home automation, healthcare, temperature control, energy
consumption monitoring, and so forth. In this paper we focus on a system used
for temperature regulation for residential, educational, industrial, and
commercial premises, and so forth. We propose a framework for indoor
temperature regulation and optimization using wireless sensor networks based on
ZigBee platform. This paper considers architectural design of the system, as
well as implementation guidelines. The proposed system favors methods that
provide energy savings by reducing the amount of data transmissions through the
network. Furthermore, the framework explores techniques for localization, such
that the location of the nodes can be used by algorithms that regulate
temperature settings.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has been a challenging
problem in the last decade. The most explored approaches for this purpose are
based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique. The first algorithm that
introduced MDS for nodes localization in sensor networks is well known as
MDS-MAP. Since its appearance in 2003, many variations of MDS-MAP have been
proposed in the literature. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey
of the localization techniques that are based on MDS. We classify MDS-based
algorithms according to different taxonomy features and different evaluation
metrics.

 <dc:description>  With the recent development of technology, wireless sensor networks (WSN) are
becoming an important part of many applications. Knowing the exact location of
each sensor in the network is very important issue. Therefore, the localization
problem is a growing field of interest. Adding GPS receivers to each sensor
node is costly solution and inapplicable on nodes with limited resources.
Additionally, it is not suitable for indoor environments. In this paper, we
propose an algorithm for nodes localization in WNS based on multidimensional
scaling (MDS) technique. Our approach improves MDS by distance matrix
refinement. Using extensive simulations we investigated in details our approach
regarding different network topologies, various network parameters and
performance issues. The results from simulations show that our improved MDS
(IMDS) algorithm outperforms well known MDS-MAP algorithm [1] in terms of
accuracy.

 <dc:title>Fast Multi-Layer Laplacian Enhancement</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A novel, fast and practical way of enhancing images is introduced in this
paper. Our approach builds on Laplacian operators of well-known edge-aware
kernels, such as bilateral and nonlocal means, and extends these filter's
capabilities to perform more effective and fast image smoothing, sharpening and
tone manipulation. We propose an approximation of the Laplacian, which does not
require normalization of the kernel weights. Multiple Laplacians of the
affinity weights endow our method with progressive detail decomposition of the
input image from fine to coarse scale. These image components are blended by a
structure mask, which avoids noise/artifact magnification or detail loss in the
output image. Contributions of the proposed method to existing image editing
tools are: (1) Low computational and memory requirements, making it appropriate
for mobile device implementations (e.g. as a finish step in a camera pipeline),
(2) A range of filtering applications from detail enhancement to denoising with
only a few control parameters, enabling the user to apply a combination of
various (and even opposite) filtering effects.

 <dc:description>  Estimating parameters of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) from noisy and
indirect measurements often requires solving ill-posed inverse problems. These
so called parameter estimation or inverse medium problems arise in a variety of
applications such as geophysical, medical imaging, and nondestructive testing.
Their solution is computationally intense since the underlying PDEs need to be
solved numerous times until the reconstruction of the parameters is
sufficiently accurate. Typically, the computational demand grows significantly
when more measurements are available, which poses severe challenges to
inversion algorithms as measurement devices become more powerful.
  In this paper we present jInv, a flexible framework and open source software
that provides parallel algorithms for solving parameter estimation problems
with many measurements. Being written in the expressive programming language
Julia, jInv is portable, easy to understand and extend, cross-platform tested,
and well-documented. It provides novel parallelization schemes that exploit the
inherent structure of many parameter estimation problems and can be used to
solve multiphysics inversion problems as is demonstrated using numerical
experiments motivated by geophysical imaging.

 <dc:description>  An orthogonal 16-point approximate discrete cosine transform (DCT) is
introduced. The proposed transform requires neither multiplications nor
bit-shifting operations. A fast algorithm based on matrix factorization is
introduced, requiring only 44 additions---the lowest arithmetic cost in
literature. To assess the introduced transform, computational complexity,
similarity with the exact DCT, and coding performance measures are computed.
Classical and state-of-the-art 16-point low-complexity transforms were used in
a comparative analysis. In the context of image compression, the proposed
approximation was evaluated via PSNR and SSIM measurements, attaining the best
cost-benefit ratio among the competitors. For video encoding, the proposed
approximation was embedded into a HEVC reference software for direct comparison
with the original HEVC standard. Physically realized and tested using FPGA
hardware, the proposed transform showed 35% and 37% improvements of area-time
and area-time-squared VLSI metrics when compared to the best competing
transform in the literature.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a robust, efficient and affordable approach to
self-localization which does not require neither GPS nor knowledge about the
appearance of the world. Towards this goal, we utilize freely available
cartographic maps and derive a probabilistic model that exploits semantic cues
in the form of sun direction, presence of an intersection, road type, speed
limit as well as the ego-car trajectory in order to produce very reliable
localization results. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach can
localize much faster (in terms of driving time) with less computation and more
robustly than competing approaches, which ignore semantic information.

 <dc:description>  We investigate an experiential learning paradigm for acquiring an internal
model of intuitive physics. Our model is evaluated on a real-world robotic
manipulation task that requires displacing objects to target locations by
poking. The robot gathered over 400 hours of experience by executing more than
100K pokes on different objects. We propose a novel approach based on deep
neural networks for modeling the dynamics of robot's interactions directly from
images, by jointly estimating forward and inverse models of dynamics. The
inverse model objective provides supervision to construct informative visual
features, which the forward model can then predict and in turn regularize the
feature space for the inverse model. The interplay between these two objectives
creates useful, accurate models that can then be used for multi-step decision
making. This formulation has the additional benefit that it is possible to
learn forward models in an abstract feature space and thus alleviate the need
of predicting pixels. Our experiments show that this joint modeling approach
outperforms alternative methods.

 <dc:title>Generalized Preconditioning and Network Flow Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sherman, Jonah</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider approximation algorithms for the problem of finding $x$ of
minimal norm $\|x\|$ satisfying a linear system $\mathbf{A} x = \mathbf{b}$,
where the norm $\|\cdot \|$ is arbitrary and generally non-Euclidean. We show a
simple general technique for composing solvers, converting iterative solvers
with residual error $\|\mathbf{A} x - \mathbf{b}\| \leq t^{-\Omega(1)}$ into
solvers with residual error $\exp(-\Omega(t))$, at the cost of an increase in
$\|x\|$, by recursively invoking the solver on the residual problem
$\tilde{\mathbf{b}} = \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{A} x$. Convergence of the composed
solvers depends strongly on a generalization of the classical condition number
to general norms, reducing the task of designing algorithms for many such
problems to that of designing a \emph{generalized preconditioner} for
$\mathbf{A}$. The new ideas significantly generalize those introduced by the
author's earlier work on maximum flow, making them more widely applicable.
  As an application of the new technique, we present a nearly-linear time
approximation algorithm for uncapacitated minimum-cost flow on undirected
graphs. Given an undirected graph with $m$ edges labelled with costs, and $n$
vertices labelled with demands, the algorithm takes
$\epsilon^{-2}m^{1+o(1)}$-time and outputs a flow routing the demands with
total cost at most $(1+\epsilon)$ times larger than minimal, along with a dual
solution proving near-optimality. The generalized preconditioner is obtained by
embedding the cost metric into $\ell_1$, and then considering a simple
hierarchical routing scheme in $\ell_1$ where demands initially supported on a
dense lattice are pulled from a sparser lattice by randomly rounding unaligned
coordinates to their aligned neighbors. Analysis of the generalized condition
number for the preconditioner follows that of the classical multigrid algorithm
for lattice Laplacian systems.

 <dc:description>  We apply deep recurrent neural networks, which are capable of learning
complex sequential information, to classify supernovae\footnote{Code available
at
\href{https://github.com/adammoss/supernovae}{https://github.com/adammoss/supernovae}}.
The observational time and filter fluxes are used as inputs to the network, but
since the inputs are agnostic additional data such as host galaxy information
can also be included. Using the Supernovae Photometric Classification Challenge
(SPCC) data, we find that deep networks are capable of learning about light
curves, however the performance of the network is highly sensitive to the
amount of training data. For a training size of 50\% of the representational
SPCC dataset (around $10^4$ supernovae) we obtain a type-Ia vs. non-type-Ia
classification accuracy of 94.7\%, an area under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic curve AUC of 0.986 and a SPCC figure-of-merit $F_1=0.64$. When
using only the data for the early-epoch challenge defined by the SPCC we
achieve a classification accuracy of 93.1\%, AUC of 0.977 and $F_1=0.58$,
results almost as good as with the whole light-curve. By employing
bidirectional neural networks we can acquire impressive classification results
between supernovae types -I,~-II and~-III at an accuracy of 90.4\% and AUC of
0.974. We also apply a pre-trained model to obtain classification probabilities
as a function of time, and show it can give early indications of supernovae
type. Our method is competitive with existing algorithms and has applications
for future large-scale photometric surveys.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic behaviors of resistive random access memory (RRAM) play an
important role in the design of cross-point memory arrays. A Monte Carlo
compact model of oxide RRAM is developed and calibrated with experiments on
various device stack configurations. With Monte Carlo SPICE simulations, we
show that an increase in array size and interconnect wire resistance will
statistically deteriorate write functionality. Write failure probability (WFP)
has an exponential dependency on device uniformity and supply voltage (VDD),
and the array bias scheme is a key knob. Lowering array VDD leads to higher
effective energy consumption (EEC) due to the increase in WFP when the
variation statistics are included in the analysis. Random-access simulations
indicate that data sparsity statistically benefits write functionality and
energy consumption. Finally, we show that a pseudo-sub-array topology with
uniformly distributed pre-forming cells in the pristine high resistance state
is able to reduce both WFP and EEC, enabling higher net capacity for memory
circuits due to improved variation tolerance.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks, and in particular long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks, are a remarkably effective tool for sequence modeling that learn a
dense black-box hidden representation of their sequential input. Researchers
interested in better understanding these models have studied the changes in
hidden state representations over time and noticed some interpretable patterns
but also significant noise. In this work, we present LSTMVIS, a visual analysis
tool for recurrent neural networks with a focus on understanding these hidden
state dynamics. The tool allows users to select a hypothesis input range to
focus on local state changes, to match these states changes to similar patterns
in a large data set, and to align these results with structural annotations
from their domain. We show several use cases of the tool for analyzing specific
hidden state properties on dataset containing nesting, phrase structure, and
chord progressions, and demonstrate how the tool can be used to isolate
patterns for further statistical analysis. We characterize the domain, the
different stakeholders, and their goals and tasks.

 <dc:description>  Online Social Networks (OSNs) have come to play an increasingly important
role in our social lives, and their inherent privacy problems have become a
major concern for users. Can we assist consumers in their privacy
decision-making practices, for example by predicting their preferences and
giving them personalized advice? To this end, we introduce PPM: a Privacy
Prediction Model, rooted in psychological principles, which can be used to give
users personalized advice regarding their privacy decision-making practices.
Using this model, we study psychological variables that are known to affect
users' disclosure behavior: the trustworthiness of the requester/information
audience, the sharing tendency of the receiver/information holder, the
sensitivity of the requested/shared information, the appropriateness of the
request/sharing activities, as well as several more traditional contextual
factors.

 <dc:description>  Efficient solutions to NP-complete problems would significantly benefit both
science and industry. However, such problems are intractable on digital
computers based on the von Neumann architecture, thus creating the need for
alternative solutions to tackle such problems. Recently, a deterministic,
continuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) was proposed (Nat.Phys. {\bf 7}(12),
966 (2011)) to solve a representative NP-complete problem, Boolean
Satisfiability (SAT). This solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on
even the hardest benchmark $k$-SAT ($k \geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost
through exponentially driven auxiliary variables. This paper presents a novel
analog hardware SAT solver, AC-SAT, implementing the CTDS via incorporating
novel, analog circuit design ideas. AC-SAT is intended to be used as a
co-processor and is programmable for handling different problem specifications.
It is especially effective for solving hard $k$-SAT problem instances that are
challenging for algorithms running on digital machines. Furthermore, with its
modular design, AC-SAT can readily be extended to solve larger size problems,
while the size of the circuit grows linearly with the product of the number of
variables and number of clauses. The circuit is designed and simulated based on
a 32nm CMOS technology. SPICE simulation results show speedup factors of
$\sim$10$^4$ on even the hardest 3-SAT problems, when compared with a
state-of-the-art SAT solver on digital computers. As an example, for hard
problems with $N=50$ variables and $M=212$ clauses, solutions are found within
from a few $ns$ to a few hundred $ns$.

 <dc:description>  We present NN-grams, a novel, hybrid language model integrating n-grams and
neural networks (NN) for speech recognition. The model takes as input both word
histories as well as n-gram counts. Thus, it combines the memorization capacity
and scalability of an n-gram model with the generalization ability of neural
networks. We report experiments where the model is trained on 26B words.
NN-grams are efficient at run-time since they do not include an output soft-max
layer. The model is trained using noise contrastive estimation (NCE), an
approach that transforms the estimation problem of neural networks into one of
binary classification between data samples and noise samples. We present
results with noise samples derived from either an n-gram distribution or from
speech recognition lattices. NN-grams outperforms an n-gram model on an Italian
speech recognition dictation task.

 <dc:description>  This work provides a comprehensive scaling law and performance analysis for
multi-user massive MIMO relay networks, where the relay is equipped with
massive antennas and uses MRC/MRT for low-complexity processing. CSI error is
considered. First, a sum-rate lower bound is derived which manifests the effect
of system parameters including the numbers of relay antennas and users, the CSI
quality, and the transmit powers of the sources and the relay. Via a general
scaling model on the system parameters with respect to the relay antenna
number, the asymptotic scaling law of the SINR as a function of the parameter
scalings is obtained, which shows quantitatively the tradeoff between the
network parameters and their effect on the network performance. In addition, a
sufficient condition on the parameter scalings for the SINR to be
asymptotically deterministic is given, which covers existing studies on such
analysis as special cases. Then, the scenario where the SINR increases linearly
with the relay antenna number is studied. The sufficient and necessary
condition on the parameter scaling for this scenario is proved. It is shown
that in this case, the interference power is not asymptotically deterministic,
then its distribution is derived, based on which the outage probability and
average bit error rate of the relay network are analysed.

work has been produced on how to procedurally generate game levels. Recently,
Machine Learning techniques have been applied to video game level generation
towards the purpose of automatically generating levels that have the properties
of the training corpus. Towards that end we have made available a corpora of
video game levels in an easy to parse format ideal for different machine

 <dc:description>  Permisionless decentralized ledgers (&quot;blockchains&quot;) such as the one
underlying the cryptocurrency Bitcoin allow anonymous participants to maintain
the ledger, while avoiding control or &quot;censorship&quot; by any single entity. In
contrast, permissioned decentralized ledgers exploit real-world trust and
accountability, allowing only explicitly authorized parties to maintain the
ledger. Permissioned ledgers support more flexible governance and a wider
choice of consensus mechanisms. Both kinds of decentralized ledgers may be
susceptible to manipulation by participants who favor some transactions over
others. The real-world accountability underlying permissioned ledgers provides
an opportunity to impose fairness constraints that can be enforced by
penalizing violators after-the- fact. To date, however, this opportunity has
not been fully exploited, unnecessarily leaving participants latitude to
manipulate outcomes undetectably. This paper draws attention to this issue, and
proposes design principles to make such manipulation more difficult, as well as
specific mechanisms to make it easier to detect when violations occur.

 <dc:title>Improved log-Sobolev inequalities, hypercontractivity and uncertainty

 <dc:description>  We develop a new class of log-Sobolev inequalities (LSIs) that provide a
non-linear comparison between the entropy and the Dirichlet form. For the
hypercube, these LSIs imply a new version of the hypercontractivity for
functions of small support. As a consequence, we derive a sharp form of the
uncertainty principle for the hypercube: a function whose energy is
concentrated on a set of small size, and whose Fourier energy is concentrated
on a small Hamming ball must be zero. The tradeoff we derive is asymptotically
optimal. We observe that for the Euclidean space, an analogous (asymptotically
optimal) tradeoff follows from the sharp form of Young's inequality due to
Beckner. As an application, we show how uncertainty principle implies a new
estimate of the metric properties of linear maps
$\mathbb{F}_2^k\to\mathbb{F}_2^n$.

 <dc:description>  Temporal common sense has applications in AI tasks such as QA, multi-document
summarization, and human-AI communication. We propose the task of sequencing --
given a jumbled set of aligned image-caption pairs that belong to a story, the
task is to sort them such that the output sequence forms a coherent story. We
present multiple approaches, via unary (position) and pairwise (order)
predictions, and their ensemble-based combinations, achieving strong results on
this task. We use both text-based and image-based features, which depict
complementary improvements. Using qualitative examples, we demonstrate that our
models have learnt interesting aspects of temporal common sense.

 <dc:description>  While textual reviews have become prominent in many recommendation-based
systems, automated frameworks to provide relevant visual cues against text
reviews where pictures are not available is a new form of task confronted by
data mining and machine learning researchers. Suggestions of pictures that are
relevant to the content of a review could significantly benefit the users by
increasing the effectiveness of a review. We propose a deep learning-based
framework to automatically: (1) tag the images available in a review dataset,
(2) generate a caption for each image that does not have one, and (3) enhance
each review by recommending relevant images that might not be uploaded by the
corresponding reviewer. We evaluate the proposed framework using the Yelp
Challenge Dataset. While a subset of the images in this particular dataset are
correctly captioned, the majority of the pictures do not have any associated
text. Moreover, there is no mapping between reviews and images. Each image has
a corresponding business-tag where the picture was taken, though. The overall
data setting and unavailability of crucial pieces required for a mapping make
the problem of recommending images for reviews a major challenge. Qualitative
and quantitative evaluations indicate that our proposed framework provides high
quality enhancements through automatic captioning, tagging, and recommendation
for mapping reviews and images.

 <dc:description>  Traditional teaching, usually based on lectures and tutorials fosters the
idea of instruction-driven learning model where students are passive listeners.
Besides this approach, Project Based Learning (PBL) as a different learning
paradigm is standing behind constructivism learning theory, where learning from
real-world situations is put on the first place. The purpose of this paper is
to present our approach in learning embedded systems at our University. It is
based on combination of traditional (face-to-face) learning and PBL. Our PBL
represents an interdisciplinary project based on wireless sensor monitoring of
real-world environment (greenhouse). The students use UML that was shown as an
excellent tool for developing such a projects. From the student perspective, we
found that this high level of interdisciplinary is very valuable from the point
of view of facing the students with real-life problems.

 <dc:description>  With the recent development of technology, wireless sensor networks are
becoming an important part of many applications such as health and medical
applications, military applications, agriculture monitoring, home and office
applications, environmental monitoring, etc. Knowing the location of a sensor
is important, but GPS receivers and ophisticated sensors are too expensive and
require processing power. Therefore, the localization wireless sensor network
problem is a growing field of interest. The aim of this paper is to give a
comparison of wireless sensor network localization methods, and therefore,
multidimensional scaling and semidefinite programming are chosen for this
research. Multidimensional scaling is a simple mathematical technique
widely-discussed that solves the wireless sensor networks localization problem.
In contrast, semidefinite programming is a relatively new field of optimization
with a growing use, although being more complex. In this paper, using extensive
simulations, a detailed overview of these two approaches is given, regarding
different network topologies, various network parameters and performance
issues. The performances of both techniques are highly satisfactory and
estimation errors are minimal

 <dc:description>  Nodes localization in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) has arisen as a very
challenging problem in the research community. Most of the applications for WSN
are not useful without a priori known nodes positions. One solution to the
problem is by adding GPS receivers to each node. Since this is an expensive
approach and inapplicable for indoor environments, we need to find an
alternative intelligent mechanism for determining nodes location. In this
paper, we propose our cluster-based approach of multidimensional scaling (MDS)
technique. Our initial experiments show that our algorithm outperforms
MDS-MAP[8], particularly for irregular topologies in terms of accuracy.

 <dc:title>Convex Decomposition And Efficient Shape Representation Using Deformable

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Decomposition of shapes into (approximate) convex parts is essential for
applications such as part-based shape representation, shape matching, and
collision detection. In this paper, we propose a novel convex decomposition
using a parametric implicit shape model called Disjunctive Normal Shape Model
(DNSM). The DNSM is formed as a union of polytopes which themselves are formed
by intersections of halfspaces. The key idea is by deforming the polytopes,
which naturally remain convex during the evolution, the polytopes capture
convex parts without the need to compute convexity. The major contributions of
this paper include a robust convex decomposition which also results in an
efficient part-based shape representation, and a novel shape convexity measure.
The experimental results show the potential of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Level set methods are widely used for image segmentation because of their
capability to handle topological changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
parametric level set method called Disjunctive Normal Level Set (DNLS), and
apply it to both two phase (single object) and multiphase (multi-object) image
segmentations. The DNLS is formed by union of polytopes which themselves are
formed by intersections of half-spaces. The proposed level set framework has
the following major advantages compared to other level set methods available in
the literature. First, segmentation using DNLS converges much faster. Second,
the DNLS level set function remains regular throughout its evolution. Third,
the proposed multiphase version of the DNLS is less sensitive to
initialization, and its computational cost and memory requirement remains
almost constant as the number of objects to be simultaneously segmented grows.
The experimental results show the potential of the proposed method.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider one problem that was largely left open by Rudolf Carnap in his
work on inductive logic, the problem of analogical inference. After discussing
some previous attempts to solve this problem, we propose a new solution that is
based on the ideas of Bruno de Finetti on probabilistic symmetries. We explain
how our new inductive logic can be developed within the Carnapian paradigm of
inductive logic-deriving an inductive rule from a set of simple postulates
about the observational process-and discuss some of its properties.

 <dc:description>  Extensive work has been conducted both in game theory and logic to model
strategic interaction. An important question is whether we can use these
theories to design agents for interacting with people? On the one hand, they
provide a formal design specification for agent strategies. On the other hand,
people do not necessarily adhere to playing in accordance with these
strategies, and their behavior is affected by a multitude of social and
psychological factors. In this paper we will consider the question of whether
strategies implied by theories of strategic behavior can be used by automated
agents that interact proficiently with people. We will focus on automated
agents that we built that need to interact with people in two negotiation
settings: bargaining and deliberation. For bargaining we will study game-theory
based equilibrium agents and for argumentation we will discuss logic-based
argumentation theory. We will also consider security games and persuasion games
and will discuss the benefits of using equilibrium based agents.

 <dc:description>  Distributed knowledge is the sum of the knowledge in a group; what someone
who is able to discern between two possible worlds whenever any member of the
group can discern between them, would know. Sometimes distributed knowledge is
referred to as the potential knowledge of a group, or the joint knowledge they
could obtain if they had unlimited means of communication. In epistemic logic,
the formula D_G{\phi} is intended to express the fact that group G has
distributed knowledge of {\phi}, that there is enough information in the group
to infer {\phi}. But this is not the same as reasoning about what happens if
the members of the group share their information. In this paper we introduce an
operator R_G, such that R_G{\phi} means that {\phi} is true after G have shared
all their information with each other - after G's distributed knowledge has
been resolved. The R_G operators are called resolution operators. Semantically,
we say that an expression R_G{\phi} is true iff {\phi} is true in what van
Benthem [11, p. 249] calls (G's) communication core; the model update obtained
by removing links to states for members of G that are not linked by all members
of G. We study logics with different combinations of resolution operators and
operators for common and distributed knowledge. Of particular interest is the
relationship between distributed and common knowledge. The main results are
sound and complete axiomatizations.

 <dc:description>  Gossip protocols aim at arriving, by means of point-to-point or group
communications, at a situation in which all the agents know each other's
secrets. We consider distributed gossip protocols which are expressed by means
of epistemic logic. We provide an operational semantics of such protocols and
set up an appropriate framework to argue about their correctness. Then we
analyze specific protocols for complete graphs and for directed rings.

 <dc:description>  We study natural strategic games on directed graphs, which capture the idea
of coordination in the absence of globally common strategies. We show that
these games do not need to have a pure Nash equilibrium and that the problem of
determining their existence is NP-complete. The same holds for strong
equilibria. We also exhibit some classes of games for which strong equilibria
exist and prove that a strong equilibrium can then be found in linear time.

Bayesian games with intentions, generalizing both Bayesian games and
psychological games, and prove that Nash equilibria in psychological games

 <dc:description>  The impossibility theorem of Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini has been thought to
demonstrate that standard state-space models cannot be used to represent
unawareness. We first show that Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini do not establish
this claim. We then distinguish three notions of awareness, and argue that
although one of them may not be adequately modeled using standard state spaces,
there is no reason to think that standard state spaces cannot provide models of
the other two notions. In fact, standard space models of these forms of
awareness are attractively simple. They allow us to prove completeness and
decidability results with ease, to carry over standard techniques from decision
theory, and to add propositional quantifiers straightforwardly.

 <dc:title>Do players reason by forward induction in dynamic perfect information

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We conducted an experiment where participants played a perfect-information
game against a computer, which was programmed to deviate often from its
backward induction strategy right at the beginning of the game. Participants
knew that in each game, the computer was nevertheless optimizing against some
belief about the participant's future strategy.
  It turned out that in the aggregate, participants were likely to respond in a
way which is optimal with respect to their best-rationalization extensive form
rationalizability conjecture - namely the conjecture that the computer is after
a larger prize than the one it has foregone, even when this necessarily meant
that the computer has attributed future irrationality to the participant when
the computer made the first move in the game. Thus, it appeared that
participants applied forward induction. However, there exist alternative
explanations for the choices of most participants; for example, choices could
be based on the extent of risk aversion that participants attributed to the
computer in the remainder of the game, rather than to the sunk outside option
that the computer has already foregone at the beginning of the game. For this
reason, the results of the experiment do not yet provide conclusive evidence
for Forward Induction reasoning on the part of the participants.

 <dc:description>  The semantics for counterfactuals due to David Lewis has been challenged on
the basis of unlikely, or impossible, events. Such events may skew a given
similarity order in favour of those possible worlds which exhibit them. By
updating the relational structure of a model according to a ceteris paribus
clause one forces out, in a natural manner, those possible worlds which do not
satisfy the requirements of the clause. We develop a ceteris paribus logic for
counterfactual reasoning capable of performing such actions, and offer several
alternative (relaxed) interpretations of ceteris paribus. We apply this
framework in a way which allows us to reason counterfactually without having
our similarity order skewed by unlikely events. This continues the
investigation of formal ceteris paribus reasoning, which has previously been
applied to preferences, logics of game forms, and questions in decision-making,
among other areas.

 <dc:title>An Axiomatic Approach to Routing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Information delivery in a network of agents is a key issue for large, complex
systems that need to do so in a predictable, efficient manner. The delivery of
information in such multi-agent systems is typically implemented through
routing protocols that determine how information flows through the network.
Different routing protocols exist each with its own benefits, but it is
generally unclear which properties can be successfully combined within a given
algorithm. We approach this problem from the axiomatic point of view, i.e., we
try to establish what are the properties we would seek to see in such a system,
and examine the different properties which uniquely define common routing
algorithms used today.
  We examine several desirable properties, such as robustness, which ensures
adding nodes and edges does not change the routing in a radical, unpredictable
ways; and properties that depend on the operating environment, such as an
&quot;economic model&quot;, where nodes choose their paths based on the cost they are
charged to pass information to the next node. We proceed to fully characterize
minimal spanning tree, shortest path, and weakest link routing algorithms,
showing a tight set of axioms for each.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider decision-making and game scenarios in which an agent is limited
by his/her computational ability to foresee all the available moves towards the
future - that is, we study scenarios with short sight. We focus on how short
sight affects the logical properties of decision making in multi-agent
settings. We start with single-agent sequential decision making (SSDM)
processes, modeling them by a new structure of &quot;preference-sight trees&quot;. Using
this model, we first explore the relation between a new natural solution
concept of Sight-Compatible Backward Induction (SCBI) and the histories
produced by classical Backward Induction (BI). In particular, we find necessary
and sufficient conditions for the two analyses to be equivalent. Next, we study
whether larger sight always contributes to better outcomes. Then we develop a
simple logical special-purpose language to formally express some key properties
of our preference-sight models. Lastly, we show how short-sight SSDM scenarios
call for substantial enrichments of existing fixed-point logics that have been
developed for the classical BI solution concept. We also discuss changes in
earlier modal logics expressing &quot;surface reasoning&quot; about best actions in the
presence of short sight. Our analysis may point the way to logical and
computational analysis of more realistic game models.

 <dc:title>Relating Knowledge and Coordinated Action: The Knowledge of

 <dc:description>  The Knowledge of Preconditions principle (KoP) is proposed as a widely
applicable connection between knowledge and action in multi-agent systems.
Roughly speaking, it asserts that if some condition is a necessary condition
for performing a given action A, then knowing that this condition holds is also
a necessary condition for performing A. Since the specifications of tasks often
involve necessary conditions for actions, the KoP principle shows that such
specifications induce knowledge preconditions for the actions. Distributed
protocols or multi-agent plans that satisfy the specifications must ensure that
this knowledge be attained, and that it is detected by the agents as a
condition for action. The knowledge of preconditions principle is formalised in
the runs and systems framework, and is proven to hold in a wide class of
settings. Well-known connections between knowledge and coordinated action are
extended and shown to derive directly from the KoP principle: a &quot;common
knowledge of preconditions&quot; principle is established showing that common
knowledge is a necessary condition for performing simultaneous actions, and a
&quot;nested knowledge of preconditions&quot; principle is proven, showing that
coordinating actions to be performed in linear temporal order requires a
corresponding form of nested knowledge.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a computational-level model of theory of mind
(ToM) based on dynamic epistemic logic (DEL), and we analyze its computational
complexity. The model is a special case of DEL model checking. We provide a
parameterized complexity analysis, considering several aspects of DEL (e.g.,
number of agents, size of preconditions, etc.) as parameters. We show that
model checking for DEL is PSPACE-hard, also when restricted to single-pointed
models and S5 relations, thereby solving an open problem in the literature. Our
approach is aimed at formalizing current intractability claims in the cognitive
science literature regarding computational models of ToM.

 <dc:description>  We propose a multi-agent logic of knowledge, public and arbitrary
announcements, that is interpreted on topological spaces in the style of subset
space semantics. The arbitrary announcement modality functions similarly to the
effort modality in subset space logics, however, it comes with intuitive and
semantic differences. We provide axiomatizations for three logics based on this
setting, and demonstrate their completeness.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a lightweight dynamic epistemic logical framework
for automated planning under initial uncertainty. We reduce plan verification
and conformant planning to model checking problems of our logic. We show that
the model checking problem of the iteration-free fragment is PSPACE-complete.
By using two non-standard (but equivalent) semantics, we give novel model
checking algorithms to the full language and the iteration-free language.

 <dc:title>The optimality of coarse categories in decision-making and information
  storage</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mandler, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An agent who lacks preferences and instead makes decisions using criteria
that are costly to create should select efficient sets of criteria, where the
cost of making a given number of choice distinctions is minimized. Under mild
conditions, efficiency requires that binary criteria with only two categories
per criterion are chosen. When applied to the problem of determining the
optimal number of digits in an information storage device, this result implies
that binary digits (bits) are the efficient solution, even when the marginal
cost of using additional digits declines rapidly to 0. This short paper pays
particular attention to the symmetry conditions entailed when sets of criteria
are efficient.

 <dc:description>  One-bit compressive sensing has extended the scope of sparse recovery by
showing that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed even when their
linear measurements are subject to the extreme quantization scenario of binary
samples---only the sign of each linear measurement is maintained. Existing
results in one-bit compressive sensing rely on the assumption that the signals
of interest are sparse in some fixed orthonormal basis. However, in most
practical applications, signals are sparse with respect to an overcomplete
dictionary, rather than a basis. There has already been a surge of activity to
obtain recovery guarantees under such a generalized sparsity model in the
classical compressive sensing setting. Here, we extend the one-bit framework to
this important model, providing a unified theory of one-bit compressive sensing
under dictionary sparsity. Specifically, we analyze several different
algorithms---based on convex programming and on hard thresholding---and show
that, under natural assumptions on the sensing matrix (satisfied by Gaussian
matrices), these algorithms can efficiently recover analysis-dictionary-sparse
signals in the one-bit model.

 <dc:title>Translucent Players: Explaining Cooperative Behavior in Social Dilemmas</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the last few decades, numerous experiments have shown that humans do not
always behave so as to maximize their material payoff. Cooperative behavior
when non-cooperation is a dominant strategy (with respect to the material
payoffs) is particularly puzzling. Here we propose a novel approach to explain
cooperation, assuming what Halpern and Pass call translucent players.
Typically, players are assumed to be opaque, in the sense that a deviation by
one player in a normal-form game does not affect the strategies used by other
players. But a player may believe that if he switches from one strategy to
another, the fact that he chooses to switch may be visible to the other
players. For example, if he chooses to defect in Prisoner's Dilemma, the other
player may sense his guilt. We show that by assuming translucent players, we
can recover many of the regularities observed in human behavior in well-studied
games such as Prisoner's Dilemma, Traveler's Dilemma, Bertrand Competition, and
the Public Goods game.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose coupled generative adversarial network (CoGAN) for learning a
joint distribution of multi-domain images. In contrast to the existing
approaches, which require tuples of corresponding images in different domains
in the training set, CoGAN can learn a joint distribution without any tuple of
corresponding images. It can learn a joint distribution with just samples drawn
from the marginal distributions. This is achieved by enforcing a weight-sharing
constraint that limits the network capacity and favors a joint distribution
solution over a product of marginal distributions one. We apply CoGAN to
several joint distribution learning tasks, including learning a joint
distribution of color and depth images, and learning a joint distribution of
face images with different attributes. For each task it successfully learns the
joint distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. We also
demonstrate its applications to domain adaptation and image transformation.

 <dc:description>  Archival information systems in government agency is one of the most used
applications for daily acitivities. One feature in application management
information document is searching. This feature serves to search for documents
from a collection of available information based on keywords entered by the
user. But some researches on a search engine (searching) concluded that the
average user error in the search is quite high due to several factors.
Therefore, we need a development on this feature as search suggestion. This
study discusses the application of the method of approximate string matching
algorithm using levenshtein distance. Levensthein distance algorithm is capable
of calculating the minimum distance conversion of a string into another string
to the optimum. Archiving information system using Levensthein Algorithm String
is an application that will be built to address these problems, this
application will help, especially in the administration to enter or save a
document, locate and make a report that will be seen by government agencies.

 <dc:description>  In text classification, dictionaries can be used to define
human-comprehensible features. We propose an improvement to dictionary features
called smoothed dictionary features. These features recognize document contexts
instead of n-grams. We describe a principled methodology to solicit dictionary
features from a teacher, and present results showing that models built using
these human-comprehensible features are competitive with models trained with
Bag of Words features.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of using sentence compression techniques to
facilitate query-focused multi-document summarization. We present a
sentence-compression-based framework for the task, and design a series of
learning-based compression models built on parse trees. An innovative beam
search decoder is proposed to efficiently find highly probable compressions.
Under this framework, we show how to integrate various indicative metrics such
as linguistic motivation and query relevance into the compression process by
deriving a novel formulation of a compression scoring function. Our best model
achieves statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
systems on several metrics (e.g. 8.0% and 5.4% improvements in ROUGE-2
respectively) for the DUC 2006 and 2007 summarization task.

 <dc:description>  Large networks are becoming a widely used abstraction for studying complex
systems in a broad set of disciplines, ranging from social network analysis to
molecular biology and neuroscience. Despite an increasing need to analyze and
manipulate large networks, only a limited number of tools are available for
this task.
  Here, we describe Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP), a
general-purpose, high-performance system that provides easy to use, high-level
operations for analysis and manipulation of large networks. We present SNAP
functionality, describe its implementational details, and give performance
benchmarks. SNAP has been developed for single big-memory machines and it
balances the trade-off between maximum performance, compact in-memory graph
representation, and the ability to handle dynamic graphs where nodes and edges
are being added or removed over time. SNAP can process massive networks with
hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges. SNAP offers over 140
different graph algorithms that can efficiently manipulate large graphs,
calculate structural properties, generate regular and random graphs, and handle
attributes and meta-data on nodes and edges. Besides being able to handle large
graphs, an additional strength of SNAP is that networks and their attributes
are fully dynamic, they can be modified during the computation at low cost.
SNAP is provided as an open source library in C++ as well as a module in
Python.
  We also describe the Stanford Large Network Dataset, a set of social and
information real-world networks and datasets, which we make publicly available.
The collection is a complementary resource to our SNAP software and is widely
used for development and benchmarking of graph analytics algorithms.

 <dc:title>Do the Young Live in a &quot;Smaller World&quot; Than the Old? Age-Specific

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of &quot;age-specific small worlds&quot;
using data from a large-scale mobile communication network approximating
interaction patterns at societal scale. Rather than asking whether two random
individuals are separated by a small number of links, we ask whether
individuals in specific age groups live in a small world in relation to
individuals from other age groups. Our analysis shows that there is systematic
variation in this age-relative small world effect. Young people live in the
&quot;smallest world,&quot; being separated from other young people and their parent's
generation via a smaller number of intermediaries than older individuals. The
oldest people live in the &quot;least small world,&quot; being separated from their same
age peers and their younger counterparts by a larger number of intermediaries.
Variation in the small world effect is specific to age as a node attribute
(being absent in the case of gender) and is consistently observed under several
data robustness checks. The discovery of age-specific small worlds is
consistent with well-known social mechanisms affecting the way age interacts
with network connectivity and the relative prevalence of kin ties and non-kin
ties observed in this network. This social pattern has significant implications
for our understanding of generation-specific dynamics of information cascades,
diffusion phenomena, and the spread of fads and fashions.

 <dc:description>  Static type errors are a common stumbling block for newcomers to typed
functional languages. We present a dynamic approach to explaining type errors
by generating counterexample witness inputs that illustrate how an ill-typed
program goes wrong. First, given an ill-typed function, we symbolically execute
the body to dynamically synthesize witness values that can make the program go
wrong. We prove that our procedure synthesizes general witnesses in that if a
witness is found, then for all inhabited input types, there exist values that
can make the function go wrong. Second, we show how to extend the above
procedure to produce a reduction graph that can be used to interactively
visualize and debug witness executions. Third, we evaluate the coverage of our
approach on two data sets comprising over 4,500 ill-typed student programs. Our
technique is able to generate witnesses for 88% of the programs, and our
reduction graph yields small counterexamples for 81% of the witnesses. Finally,
we evaluate the utility of our witnesses in helping students understand and fix
type errors, and find that students presented with our witnesses consistently
show a greater understanding of type errors than those presented with a
standard error message.

 <dc:description>  The goal of minimizing misclassification error on a training set is often
just one of several real-world goals that might be defined on different
datasets. For example, one may require a classifier to also make positive
predictions at some specified rate for some subpopulation (fairness), or to
achieve a specified empirical recall. Other real-world goals include reducing
churn with respect to a previously deployed model, or stabilizing online
training. In this paper we propose handling multiple goals on multiple datasets
by training with dataset constraints, using the ramp penalty to accurately
quantify costs, and present an efficient algorithm to approximately optimize
the resulting non-convex constrained optimization problem. Experiments on both
benchmark and real-world industry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

 <dc:title>On (Secure) Information flow for Multiple-Unicast Sessions: Analysis

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a class of wireline networks, derived from the
well-known butterfly network, over which two independent unicast sessions take
place simultaneously. The main objectives are to understand when network coding
type of operations are beneficial with and without security considerations and
to derive the ultimate gains that cooperation among sources and sinks can
bring. Towards these goals, the capacity region of the butterfly network with
arbitrary edge capacities is first derived. It is then shown that no rate can
be guaranteed over this network under security considerations, when an
eavesdropper wiretaps any of the links. Three variants of the butterfly
network, such as the case of co-located sources, are analyzed as well and their
secure and non-secure capacity regions are characterized. By using the
butterfly network and its variants as building blocks, these results can be
used to design high-throughput achieving transmission schemes for general
multiple-unicast networks.

 <dc:description>  We study the dynamics of a one dimensional quantum spin chain evolving from
unentangled or entangled initial state. At a given instant of time a quantum
dynamical process (ex. measurement) is performed on a single spin at one end of
the chain, decohering the system. Through the further unitary evolution, a
signal propagates in the spin chain, which can be detected from a measurement
on a different spin at later times. From the dynamical unitary evolution of the
decohered state from the epoch time, it is possible to detect the occurrence of
the dynamical process. The propagation of the signal for the dynamical process,
and the speed of the signal are investigated for various spin models, viz.
using the Ising, Heisenberg, and the transverse-XY dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Recent work in Information Retrieval (IR) using Deep Learning models has
yielded state of the art results on a variety of IR tasks. Deep neural networks
(DNN) are capable of learning ideal representations of data during the training
process, removing the need for independently extracting features. However, the
structures of these DNNs are often tailored to perform on specific datasets. In
addition, IR tasks deal with text at varying levels of granularity from single
factoids to documents containing thousands of words. In this paper, we examine
the role of the granularity on the performance of common state of the art DNN
structures in IR.

 <dc:description>  Although several RDF knowledge bases are available through the LOD
initiative, the ontology schema of such linked datasets is not very rich. In
particular, they lack object properties. The problem of finding new object
properties (and their instances) between any two given classes has not been
investigated in detail in the context of Linked Data. In this paper, we present
DART (Detecting Arbitrary Relations for enriching T-Boxes of Linked Data) - an
unsupervised solution to enrich the LOD cloud with new object properties
between two given classes. DART exploits contextual similarity to identify text
patterns from the web corpus that can potentially represent relations between
individuals. These text patterns are then clustered by means of paraphrase
detection to capture the object properties between the two given LOD classes.
DART also performs fully automated mapping of the discovered relations to the
properties in the linked dataset. This serves many purposes such as
identification of completely new relations, elimination of irrelevant
relations, and generation of prospective property axioms. We have empirically
evaluated our approach on several pairs of classes and found that the system
can indeed be used for enriching the linked datasets with new object properties
and their instances. We compared DART with newOntExt system which is an
offshoot of the NELL (Never-Ending Language Learning) effort. Our experiments
reveal that DART gives better results than newOntExt with respect to both the
correctness, as well as the number of relations.

 <dc:description>  Pruning of redundant or irrelevant instances of data is a key to every
successful solution for pattern recognition. In this paper, we present a novel
ranking-selection framework for low-length but highly correlated instances.
Instead of working in the low-dimensional instance space, we learn a supervised
projection to high-dimensional space spanned by the number of classes in the
dataset under study. Imposing higher distinctions via exposing the notion of
labels to the instances, lets to deploy one versus all ranking for each
individual classes and selecting quality instances via adaptive thresholding of
the overall scores. To prove the efficiency of our paradigm, we employ it for
the purpose of texture understanding which is a hard recognition challenge due
to high similarity of texture pixels and low dimensionality of their color
features. Our experiments show considerable improvements in recognition
performance over other local descriptors on several publicly available
datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with prediction of anopheles number, the main vector of
malaria risk, using environmental and climate variables. The variables
selection is based on an automatic machine learning method using regression
trees, and random forests combined with stratified two levels cross validation.
The minimum threshold of variables importance is accessed using the quadratic
distance of variables importance while the optimal subset of selected variables
is used to perform predictions. Finally the results revealed to be
qualitatively better, at the selection, the prediction , and the CPU time point
of view than those obtained by GLM-Lasso method.

 <dc:description>  The main constraint of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in enabling wireless
image communication is the high energy requirement, which may exceed even the
future capabilities of battery technologies. In this paper we have shown that
this bottleneck can be overcome by developing local in-network image processing
algorithm that offers optimal energy consumption. Our algorithm is very
suitable for intruder detection applications. Each node is responsible for
processing the image captured by the video sensor, which consists of NxN
blocks. If an intruder is detected in the monitoring region, the node will
transmit the image for further processing. Otherwise, the node takes no action.
Results provided from our experiments show that our algorithm is better than
the traditional moving object detection techniques by a factor of (N/2) in
terms of energy savings.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses EFSM for SDL and transforms EFSM into a novel control
model of discrete event systems. We firstly propose a control model of discrete
event systems, where the event set is made up of several conflicting pairs and
control is implemented to select one event of the pair. Then we transform EFSM
for SDL to the control model to clarify the control mechanism functioning in
SDL flow graphs. This work views the EFSM for SDL in the perspective of
supervisory control theory, and this contributes to the field of software
cybernetics, which explores the theoretically justified interplay of software
and the control.

 <dc:description>  The Novelli-Pak-Stoyanovskii algorithm is a sorting algorithm for Young
tableaux of a fixed shape that was originally devised to give a bijective proof
of the hook-length formula. We obtain new asymptotic results on the average
case and worst case complexity of this algorithm as the underlying shape tends
to a fixed limit curve. Furthermore, using the summation package Sigma we prove
an exact formula for the average case complexity when the underlying shape
consists of only two rows. We thereby answer questions posed by Krattenthaler
and M\&quot;uller.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This study describes a binaural machine hearing system that is capable of
performing auditory stream segregation in scenarios where multiple sound
sources are present. The process of stream segregation refers to the capability
of human listeners to group acoustic signals into sets of distinct auditory
streams, corresponding to individual sound sources. The proposed computational
framework mimics this ability via a probabilistic clustering scheme for joint
localization and segregation. This scheme is based on mixtures of von Mises
distributions to model the angular positions of the sound sources surrounding
the listener. The distribution parameters are estimated using block-wise
processing of auditory cues extracted from binaural signals. Additionally, the
proposed system can conduct rotational head movements to improve localization
and stream segregation performance. Evaluation of the system is conducted in
scenarios containing multiple simultaneously active speech and non-speech
sounds placed at different positions relative to the listener.

 <dc:title>Evaluation method of word embedding by roots and affixes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Peng, KeBin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Word embedding has been shown to be remarkably effective in a lot of Natural
Language Processing tasks. However, existing models still have a couple of
limitations in interpreting the dimensions of word vector. In this paper, we
provide a new approach---roots and affixes model(RAAM)---to interpret it from
the intrinsic structures of natural language. Also it can be used as an
evaluation measure of the quality of word embedding. We introduce the
information entropy into our model and divide the dimensions into two
categories, just like roots and affixes in lexical semantics. Then considering
each category as a whole rather than individually. We experimented with English
Wikipedia corpus. Our result show that there is a negative linear relation
between the two attributes and a high positive correlation between our model
and downstream semantic evaluation tasks.

 <dc:description>  Folksonomy is a non-hierarchical document categorizing system, that treats
every category in a flat manner, dan every category is entered freely by anyone
who submitted a document in these categories. Categorization is done
automatically at the time a document is submitted, by entering the list of
categories that best fit the document. del.icio.us (http://del.icio.us) site is
one of the most popular social bookmarking sites that uses folksonomy.
  Usage of folksonomy, although very easy, also has its weaknesses, such as use
of different tags for the same concept, use of the same tag for different
concepts, no quality control, etc. We try to provide a solution for some of
these problems by analyzing Web documents' contents and categorizing them
automatically using multinomial naive Bayes algorithm.
  Bayes classifier works by using a set of evidences and a set of classes. By
training the system using sample data, we can determine the probability of an
evidence given a particular class. Bayes classifier also uses prior probability
of a class, which can be calculated from sample data. From these analysis, when
given a new document which is formed by a set of evidences (words), the
probabilities of each class given that document (posterior probabilities) can
be determined.
  This system is implemented using PHP 5, Apache, and MySQL. The conclusion
from building this system is that the Bayes method can be used to automatically
categorize documents and also as an assistive tool for manual categorization.

  Folksonomy merupakan metode kategorisasi dokumen yang tidak hierarkis,

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a networked control system (NCS) in which an
dynamic plant system is connected to a controller via a temporally correlated
wireless fading channel. We focus on communication power design at the sensor
to minimize a weighted average state estimation error at the remote controller
subject to an average transmit power constraint of the sensor. The power
control optimization problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost
Markov decision process (MDP). We propose a novel continuous-time perturbation
approach and derive an asymptotically optimal closed-form value function for
the MDP. Under this approximation, we propose a low complexity dynamic power
control solution which has an event- driven control structure. We also
establish technical conditions for asymptotic optimality, and sufficient
conditions for NCS stability under the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a framework is proposed to simplify solving the infinite
horizon average cost problem for the weakly coupled multi-dimensional systems.
Specifically, to address the computational complexity issue, we first introduce
a virtual continuous time system (VCTS) and obtain the associated fluid value
function. The relationship between the VCTS and the original discrete time
system is further established. To facilitate the low complexity distributed
implementation and address the coupling challenge, we model the weakly coupled
system as a perturbation of a decoupled base system and study the decoupled
base system. The fluid value function of the VCTS is approximated by the sum of
the per-flow fluid value functions and the approximation error is established
using perturbation analysis. Finally, we obtain a low complexity distributed
solution based on the per-flow fluid value function approximation. We apply the
framework to solve a delay-optimal control problem for the K-pair interference
networks and obtain a distributed power control algorithm. The proposed
algorithm is compared with various baseline schemes through simulations and it
is shown that significant delay performance gain can be achieved.

 <dc:description>  In this paper a framework for Automatic Query Expansion (AQE) is proposed
using distributed neural language model word2vec. Using semantic and contextual
relation in a distributed and unsupervised framework, word2vec learns a low
dimensional embedding for each vocabulary entry. Using such a framework, we
devise a query expansion technique, where related terms to a query are obtained
by K-nearest neighbor approach. We explore the performance of the AQE methods,
with and without feedback query expansion, and a variant of simple K-nearest
neighbor in the proposed framework. Experiments on standard TREC ad-hoc data
(Disk 4, 5 with query sets 301-450, 601-700) and web data (WT10G data with
query set 451-550) shows significant improvement over standard term-overlapping
based retrieval methods. However the proposed method fails to achieve
comparable performance with statistical co-occurrence based feedback method
such as RM3. We have also found that the word2vec based query expansion methods
perform similarly with and without any feedback information.

 <dc:description>  Time-to-Live data in the IP header offers two interesting characteristics:
First, different IP stacks pick different start TTL values. Second, each
traversed router should decrement the TTL value. The combination of both offers
host and route fingerprinting options. We present the first work to investigate
Internet-wide TTL behavior at carrier scale and evaluate its fit to detect
anomalies, predominantly spoofed source IP addresses. Using purpose-built
software, we capture 2 weeks of raw TTL data at a 40 Gbit/s Internet uplink.
For further insight, we actively measure observed hosts and conduct large-scale
hitlist-based measurements, which yields three complementary data sets for IPv4
and IPv6. A majority (69% IPv4; 81% IPv6) of passively observed multi-packet
hosts exhibit one stable TTL value. Active measurements on unstable hosts yield
a stable anchor TTL value for more than 85% of responsive hosts. We develop a
structure to further classify unstable hosts taking, for example, temporal
stability into account. Correlation of TTL values with BGP data is clear, yet
unpredictive. The results indicate that carrier-grade TTL anomaly detection can
yield significant insights in the following categories: First, the method can
flag anomalies based on TTL observations (yet likely at a difficult false
positive/false negative trade-off). Second, the method can establish trust that
a packet originates from its acclaimed source.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology paradigm where millions of sensors
monitor, and help inform or manage, physical, envi- ronmental and human systems
in real-time. The inherent closed-loop re- sponsiveness and decision making of
IoT applications makes them ideal candidates for using low latency and scalable
stream processing plat- forms. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) are
becoming es- sential components of any IoT stack, but the efficacy and
performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for IoT data
streams and applications. Here, we develop a benchmark suite and per- formance
metrics to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes
13 common IoT tasks classified across various func- tional categories and
forming micro-benchmarks, and two IoT applica- tions for statistical
summarization and predictive analytics that leverage various dataflow
compositional features of DSPS. These are coupled with stream workloads sourced
from real IoT observations from smart cities. We validate the IoT benchmark for
the popular Apache Storm DSPS, and present empirical results.

 <dc:description>  Transiently Powered Computers (TPCs) are novel devices that are battery-less
and operate using only ambient energy. Therefore TPCs are prone to frequent
power interruptions, and such the need for developing TPC-centric algorithms is
a necessity. We advocate that only through a common experimental environment,
accessible to everyone, a proper comparison of newly developed algorithms for
TPCs can be realized. Moreover, only through access to various TPC
testbeds---distributed geographically throughout the world---a proper
applications testing and validation are possible. We enlist properties and
features that any TPC testbed should have, calling for more coordinated action
in this domain of TPC research. Finally, we present (to the best of our
knowledge) world's first Internet-accessible testbed for TPCs.

 <dc:description>  Internet usage has shifted from host-centric end-to-end communication to a
content-centric approach mainly used for content delivery. Information Centric
Networking (ICN) was proposed as a promising novel content delivery
architecture. ICN includes in-network caching features at every node which has
a major impact on content retrieval. For instance, the ICN efficiency depends
drastically on the management of the caching resources. The management of
caching resources is achieved with caching strategies. Caching strategies
decide what, where and when content is stored in the network. In this paper, we
revisit the recent technical contributions on caching strategies, we compare
them and discuss opportunities and challenges for improving content delivery in
the upcoming years.

 <dc:title>Is the Bellman residual a bad proxy?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper aims at theoretically and empirically comparing two standard
optimization criteria for Reinforcement Learning: i) maximization of the mean
value and ii) minimization of the Bellman residual. For that purpose, we place
ourselves in the framework of policy search algorithms, that are usually
designed to maximize the mean value, and derive a method that minimizes the
residual $\|T_* v_\pi - v_\pi\|_{1,\nu}$ over policies. A theoretical analysis
shows how good this proxy is to policy optimization, and notably that it is
better than its value-based counterpart. We also propose experiments on
randomly generated generic Markov decision processes, specifically designed for
studying the influence of the involved concentrability coefficient. They show
that the Bellman residual is generally a bad proxy to policy optimization and
that directly maximizing the mean value is much better, despite the current
lack of deep theoretical analysis. This might seem obvious, as directly
addressing the problem of interest is usually better, but given the prevalence
of (projected) Bellman residual minimization in value-based reinforcement
learning, we believe that this question is worth to be considered.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the nonlinear elliptic curl-curl equation with
uncertainties in the material law. It is frequently employed in the numerical
evaluation of magnetostatic fields, where the uncertainty is ascribed to the
so-called B-H curve. A truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve approximation of the
stochastic B-H curve is presented and analyzed with regard to monotonicity
constraints. A stochastic non-linear curl-curl formulation is introduced and
numerically approximated by a finite element and collocation method in the
deterministic and stochastic variable, respectively. The stochastic regularity
is analyzed by a higher order sensitivity analysis. It is shown that, unlike to
linear and several nonlinear elliptic problems, the solution is not analytic
with respect to the random variables and an algebraic decay of the stochastic
error is obtained. Numerical results for both the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion
and the stochastic curl-curl equation are given for illustration.

 <dc:description>  A standard model for Recommender Systems is the Matrix Completion setting:
given partially known matrix of ratings given by users (rows) to items
(columns), infer the unknown ratings. In the last decades, few attempts where
done to handle that objective with Neural Networks, but recently an
architecture based on Autoencoders proved to be a promising approach. In
current paper, we enhanced that architecture (i) by using a loss function
adapted to input data with missing values, and (ii) by incorporating side
information. The experiments demonstrate that while side information only
slightly improve the test error averaged on all users/items, it has more impact
on cold users/items.

a first step towards answering this question. Given a query, we train a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on existing relevant information to that query.
We then use the RNN to &quot;deep learn&quot; a single, synthetic, and we assume,
relevant document for that query. We design a crowdsourcing experiment to
assess how relevant the &quot;deep learned&quot; document is, compared to existing
relevant documents. Users are shown a query and four wordclouds (of three
existing relevant documents and our deep learned synthetic document). The
synthetic document is ranked on average most relevant of all.

 <dc:description>  We conduct a comparative analysis of various model selection criteria for
community detection. While the exhaustive comparison requires the test of all
possible combinations of the frameworks, algorithms, and model selection
criteria, we mainly focus on the statistical inference using the stochastic
block model and its implementation by the EM algorithm with belief propagation.
For the model selection criteria, we consider the ones that have been commonly
used in the literature and the ones that are directly related to the algorithm
that we consider. As we evaluate the tendency of overfit and underfit for each
criterion compared to the others, we also analyze how the model-parameter
learning in the EM algorithm affects the performance of model assessment. In
addition, we propose that the alluvial diagram is a suitable tool to visualize
the result of inference and can be useful to determine the number of clusters.

vector and a confidence vector, and then model the probability of the like
vector, weighted by the confidence vector. The training objective of implicit
CF-NADE is to maximize a weighted negative log-likelihood. We test the
performance of implicit CF-NADE on a dataset collected from a popular digital
TV streaming service. More specifically, in the experiments, we describe how to
convert watch counts into implicit relative rating, and feed into implicit
CF-NADE. Then we compare the performance of implicit CF-NADE model with the
popular implicit matrix factorization approach. Experimental results show that
implicit CF-NADE significantly outperforms the baseline.

 <dc:description>  Isomorphic (sparse) collective communication is a form of collective
communication in which all involved processes communicate in small, identically
structured neighborhoods of other processes. Isomorphic neighborhoods are
defined via an embedding of the processes in a regularly structured topology,
e.g., $d$-dimensional torus, which may correspond to the physical communication
network of the underlying system. Isomorphic collective communication is useful
for implementing stencil and other regular, sparse distributed computations,
where the assumption that all processes behave (almost) symmetrically is
justified.
  In this paper, we show how efficient message-combining communication
schedules for isomorphic, sparse collective communication can easily and
efficiently be computed by purely local computations. We give schemes for
\emph{isomorphic \alltoall} and \emph{\allgather} communication that reduce the
number of communication rounds and thereby the communication latency from $s$
to at most $Nd$, for neighborhoods consisting of $s$ processes with the (small)
factor $N$ depending on the structure of the neighborhood and the capabilities
of the communication system. Using these schedules, we give \emph{zero-copy
implementations} of the isomorphic collectives using MPI and its derived
datatypes to eliminate explicit, process-local copy operations. By benchmarking
the collective communication algorithms against straightforward implementations
and against the corresponding MPI neighborhood collectives, we document
significant latency improvements of our implementations for block sizes of up
to a few kilobytes. We discuss further optimizations for computing even better
schedules, some of which have been implemented and benchmarked.

 <dc:description>  Interprocedural analysis by means of partial tabulation of summary functions
may not terminate when the same procedure is analyzed for infinitely many
abstract calling contexts or when the abstract domain has infinite strictly
ascending chains. As a remedy, we present a novel local solver for general
abstract equation systems, be they monotonic or not, and prove that this solver
fails to terminate only when infinitely many variables are encountered. We
clarify in which sense the computed results are sound. Moreover, we show that
interprocedural analysis performed by this novel local solver, is guaranteed to
terminate for all non-recursive programs --- irrespective of whether the
complete lattice is infinite or has infinite strictly ascending or descending
chains.

 <dc:description>  Acoustic event detection for content analysis in most cases relies on lots of
labeled data. However, manually annotating data is a time-consuming task, which
thus makes few annotated resources available so far. Unlike audio event
detection, automatic audio tagging, a multi-label acoustic event classification
task, only relies on weakly labeled data. This is highly desirable to some
practical applications using audio analysis. In this paper we propose to use a
fully deep neural network (DNN) framework to handle the multi-label
classification task in a regression way. Considering that only chunk-level
rather than frame-level labels are available, the whole or almost whole frames
of the chunk were fed into the DNN to perform a multi-label regression for the
expected tags. The fully DNN, which is regarded as an encoding function, can
well map the audio features sequence to a multi-tag vector. A deep pyramid
structure was also designed to extract more robust high-level features related
to the target tags. Further improved methods were adopted, such as the Dropout
and background noise aware training, to enhance its generalization capability
for new audio recordings in mismatched environments. Compared with the
conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and support vector machine (SVM)
methods, the proposed fully DNN-based method could well utilize the long-term
temporal information with the whole chunk as the input. The results show that
our approach obtained a 15% relative improvement compared with the official
GMM-based method of DCASE 2016 challenge.

 <dc:description>  Bio-inspired hardware holds the promise of low-energy, intelligent and highly
adaptable computing systems. Applications span from automatic classification
for big data management, through unmanned vehicle control, to control for
bio-medical prosthesis. However, one of the major challenges of fabricating
bio-inspired hardware is building ultra-high density networks out of complex
processing units interlinked by tunable connections. Nanometer-scale devices
exploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this
context. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions are well suited for this
purpose because of their multiple tunable functionalities. One such
functionality, non-volatile memory, can provide massive embedded memory in
unconventional circuits, thus escaping the von-Neumann bottleneck arising when
memory and processors are located separately. Other features of spintronic
devices that could be beneficial for bio-inspired computing include tunable
fast non-linear dynamics, controlled stochasticity, and the ability of single
devices to change functions in different operating conditions. Large networks
of interacting spintronic nano-devices can have their interactions tuned to
induce complex dynamics such as synchronization, chaos, soliton diffusion,
phase transitions, criticality, and convergence to multiple metastable states.
A number of groups have recently proposed bio-inspired architectures that
include one or several types of spintronic nanodevices. In this article we show
how spintronics can be used for bio-inspired computing. We review the different
approaches that have been proposed, the recent advances in this direction, and
the challenges towards fully integrated spintronics-CMOS (Complementary metal -
oxide - semiconductor) bio-inspired hardware.

 <dc:description>  The abundance of user-generated data in social media has incentivized the
development of methods to infer the latent attributes of users, which are
crucially useful for personalization, advertising and recommendation. However,
the current user profiling approaches have limited success, due to the lack of
a principled way to integrate different types of social relationships of a
user, and the reliance on scarcely-available labeled data in building a
prediction model. In this paper, we present a novel solution termed Collective
Semi-Supervised Learning (CSL), which provides a principled means to integrate
different types of social relationship and unlabeled data under a unified
computational framework. The joint learning from multiple relationships and
unlabeled data yields a computationally sound and accurate approach to model
user attributes in social media. Extensive experiments using Twitter data have
demonstrated the efficacy of our CSL approach in inferring user attributes such
as account type and marital status. We also show how CSL can be used to
determine important user features, and to make inference on a larger user
population.

 <dc:description>  Random Edge is the most natural randomized pivot rule for the simplex
algorithm. Considerable progress has been made recently towards fully
understanding its behavior. Back in 2001, Welzl introduced the concepts of
\emph{reachmaps} and \emph{niceness} of Unique Sink Orientations (USO), in an
effort to better understand the behavior of Random Edge. In this paper, we
initiate the systematic study of these concepts. We settle the questions that
were asked by Welzl about the niceness of (acyclic) USO. Niceness implies
natural upper bounds for Random Edge and we provide evidence that these are
tight or almost tight in many interesting cases. Moreover, we show that Random
Edge is polynomial on at least $n^{\Omega(2^n)}$ many (possibly cyclic) USO. As
a bonus, we describe a derandomization of Random Edge which achieves the same
asymptotic upper bounds with respect to niceness and discuss some algorithmic
properties of the reachmap.

 <dc:title>A Game-Theoretic Approach to Word Sense Disambiguation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new model for word sense disambiguation formulated in
terms of evolutionary game theory, where each word to be disambiguated is
represented as a node on a graph whose edges represent word relations and
senses are represented as classes. The words simultaneously update their class
membership preferences according to the senses that neighboring words are
likely to choose. We use distributional information to weigh the influence that
each word has on the decisions of the others and semantic similarity
information to measure the strength of compatibility among the choices. With
this information we can formulate the word sense disambiguation problem as a
constraint satisfaction problem and solve it using tools derived from game
theory, maintaining the textual coherence. The model is based on two ideas:
similar words should be assigned to similar classes and the meaning of a word
does not depend on all the words in a text but just on some of them. The paper
provides an in-depth motivation of the idea of modeling the word sense
disambiguation problem in terms of game theory, which is illustrated by an
example. The conclusion presents an extensive analysis on the combination of
similarity measures to use in the framework and a comparison with
state-of-the-art systems. The results show that our model outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms and can be applied to different tasks and in
different scenarios.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of receiver modeling in molecular
communication systems. We consider the diffusive molecular communication
channel between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a
fluid environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter
nano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order
degradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can
participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor
proteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario,
we assume that the entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor
molecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected
received signal at the receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated
receptors on the surface of the receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we
consider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the
uniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only
partially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be
accurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario
after appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant. The accuracy
of the derived analytical results is verified by Brownian motion particle-based
simulations of the considered environment, where we also show the impact of the
effect of receptor occupancy on the derived analytical results.

The utilization of sequential patterns has boosted performance on several kinds
of recommendation tasks. Inspired by natural language processing (NLP)
techniques, we propose a novel neural network (NN) based next-song recommender,
CNN-rec, in this paper. Then, we compare the proposed system with several NN

Verification results indicate the proposed system outperforms classic systems

 <dc:description>  Lossless Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs) are commonly used as a design
prototype for artificial reverberation algorithms. The lossless property is
dependent on the feedback matrix, which connects the output of a set of delays
to their inputs, and the lengths of the delays. Both, unitary and triangular
feedback matrices are known to constitute lossless FDNs, however, the most
general class of lossless feedback matrices has not been identified. In this
contribution, it is shown that the FDN is lossless for any set of delays, if
all irreducible components of the feedback matrix are diagonally similar to a
unitary matrix. The necessity of the generalized class of feedback matrices is
demonstrated by examples of FDN designs proposed in literature.

 <dc:title>Riccati observers for position and velocity bias estimation from either

 <dc:creator>Hamel, Tarek</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Samson, Claude</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper revisits the problems of estimating the position of an object
moving in $n$ ($\geq 2$)-dimensional Euclidean space using velocity
measurements and either direction or range measurements of one or multiple
source points. The proposed solutions exploit the Continuous Riccati Equation
(CRE) to calculate observer gains yielding global exponential stability of zero
estimation errors, even in the case where the measured velocity is biased by an
unknown constant perturbation. These results are obtained under persistent
excitation (p.e.) conditions depending on the number of source points and body
motion that ensure both uniform observability and good conditioning of the CRE
solutions. With respect to prior contributions on these subjects some of the
proposed solutions are entirely novel while others are adapted from existing
ones with the preoccupation of stating simpler and more explicit conditions
under which uniform exponential stability is achieved. A complementary
contribution, related to the delicate tuning of the observers gains, is the
derivation of a lower-bound of the exponential rate of convergence specified as
a function of the amount of persistent excitation. Simulation results
illustrate the performance of the proposed observers.

 <dc:title>Issues in evaluating semantic spaces using word analogies</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Linzen, Tal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The offset method for solving word analogies has become a standard evaluation
tool for vector-space semantic models: it is considered desirable for a space
to represent semantic relations as consistent vector offsets. We show that the
method's reliance on cosine similarity conflates offset consistency with
largely irrelevant neighborhood structure, and propose simple baselines that
should be used to improve the utility of the method in vector space evaluation.

 <dc:description>  Over the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) saw a tremendous
surge in performance. However, understanding what a network has learned still
proves to be a challenging task. To remedy this unsatisfactory situation, a
number of groups have recently proposed different methods to visualize the
learned models. In this work we suggest a general taxonomy to classify and
compare these methods, subdividing the literature into three main categories
and providing researchers with a terminology to base their works on.
Furthermore, we introduce the FeatureVis library for MatConvNet: an extendable,
easy to use open source library for visualizing CNNs. It contains
implementations from each of the three main classes of visualization methods
and serves as a useful tool for an enhanced understanding of the features
learned by intermediate layers, as well as for the analysis of why a network
might fail for certain examples.

 <dc:description>  Encryption schemes based on the rank metric lead to small public key sizes of
order of few thousands bytes which represents a very attractive feature
compared to Hamming metric-based encryption schemes where public key sizes are
of order of hundreds of thousands bytes even with additional structures like
the cyclicity. The main tool for building public key encryption schemes in rank
metric is the McEliece encryption setting used with the family of Gabidulin
codes. Since the original scheme proposed in 1991 by Gabidulin, Paramonov and
Tretjakov, many systems have been proposed based on different masking
techniques for Gabidulin codes. Nevertheless, over the years all these systems
were attacked essentially by the use of an attack proposed by Overbeck.
  In 2005 Faure and Loidreau designed a rank-metric encryption scheme which was
not in the McEliece setting. The scheme is very efficient, with small public
keys of size a few kiloBytes and with security closely related to the
linearized polynomial reconstruction problem which corresponds to the decoding
problem of Gabidulin codes. The structure of the scheme differs considerably
from the classical McEliece setting and until our work, the scheme had never
been attacked. We show in this article that this scheme like other schemes
based on Gabidulin codes, is also vulnerable to a polynomial-time attack that
recovers the private key by applying Overbeck's attack on an appropriate public
code. As an example we break concrete proposed $80$ bits security parameters in
a few seconds.

 <dc:title>Sampling-based Gradient Regularization for Capturing Long-Term

 <dc:description>  Vanishing (and exploding) gradients effect is a common problem for recurrent
neural networks with nonlinear activation functions which use backpropagation
method for calculation of derivatives. Deep feedforward neural networks with
many hidden layers also suffer from this effect. In this paper we propose a
novel universal technique that makes the norm of the gradient stay in the
suitable range. We construct a way to estimate a contribution of each training
example to the norm of the long-term components of the target function s
gradient. Using this subroutine we can construct mini-batches for the
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training that leads to high performance and
accuracy of the trained network even for very complex tasks. We provide a
straightforward mathematical estimation of minibatch s impact on for the
gradient norm and prove its correctness theoretically. To check our framework
experimentally we use some special synthetic benchmarks for testing RNNs on
ability to capture long-term dependencies. Our network can detect links between
events in the (temporal) sequence at the range approx. 100 and longer.

 <dc:title>How to estimate epidemic risk from incomplete contact diaries data?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Social interactions shape the patterns of spreading processes in a
population. Techniques such as diaries or proximity sensors allow to collect
data about encounters and to build networks of contacts between individuals.
The contact networks obtained from these different techniques are however
quantitatively different. Here, we first show how these discrepancies affect
the prediction of the epidemic risk when these data are fed to numerical models
of epidemic spread: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and
overestimation of contact durations in contact diaries with respect to sensor
data determine indeed important differences in the outcomes of the
corresponding simulations {with for instance an enhanced sensitivity to initial
conditions}. Most importantly, we investigate if and how information gathered
from contact diaries can be used in such simulations in order to yield an
accurate description of the epidemic risk, assuming that data from sensors
represent the ground truth. The contact networks built from contact sensors and
diaries present indeed several structural similarities: this suggests the
possibility to construct, using only the contact diary network information, a
surrogate contact network such that simulations using this surrogate network
give the same estimation of the epidemic risk as simulations using the contact
sensor network. We present and {compare} several methods to build such
surrogate data, and show that it is indeed possible to obtain a good agreement
between the outcomes of simulations using surrogate and sensor data, as long as
the contact diary information is complemented by publicly available data
describing the heterogeneity of the durations of human contacts.

 <dc:description>  Recent captioning models are limited in their ability to scale and describe
concepts unseen in paired image-text corpora. We propose the Novel Object
Captioner (NOC), a deep visual semantic captioning model that can describe a
large number of object categories not present in existing image-caption
datasets. Our model takes advantage of external sources -- labeled images from
object recognition datasets, and semantic knowledge extracted from unannotated
text. We propose minimizing a joint objective which can learn from these
diverse data sources and leverage distributional semantic embeddings, enabling
the model to generalize and describe novel objects outside of image-caption
datasets. We demonstrate that our model exploits semantic information to
generate captions for hundreds of object categories in the ImageNet object
recognition dataset that are not observed in MSCOCO image-caption training
data, as well as many categories that are observed very rarely. Both automatic
evaluations and human judgements show that our model considerably outperforms
prior work in being able to describe many more categories of objects.

 <dc:description>  Advances in computing power, natural language processing, and digitization of
text now make it possible to study a culture's evolution through its texts
using a &quot;big data&quot; lens. Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a
shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional
trajectories and forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by
classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,327 stories from
Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core emotional
arcs which form the essential building blocks of complex emotional
trajectories. We strengthen our findings by separately applying Matrix
decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of
these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in
publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater
success, as measured by downloads.

 <dc:description>  The dynamical processes taking place on a network depend on its topology.
Influencing the growth process of a network therefore has important
implications on such dynamical processes. We formulate the problem of
influencing the growth of a network as a stochastic optimal control problem in
which a structural cost function penalizes undesired topologies. We approximate
this control problem with a restricted class of control problems that can be
solved using probabilistic inference methods. To deal with the increasing
problem dimensionality, we introduce an adaptive importance sampling method for
approximating the optimal control. We illustrate this methodology in the
context of formation of information cascades, considering the task of
influencing the structure of a growing conversation thread, as in Internet
forums. Using a realistic model of growing trees, we show that our approach can
yield conversation threads with better structural properties than the ones
observed without control.

architecture for sequence labeling which takes into account the previous
context words with preserved order information and pays special attention to
the current word with its surrounding context. Moreover, it combines the

95.61% on the ATIS benchmark dataset without using any additional linguistic
knowledge and resources.

 <dc:description>  Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) are an important source of information for
studying land occupation and its evolution. Indeed, the very large volumes of
digital data stored, usually are not ready to a direct analysis. In order to
both reduce the dimensionality and information extraction, time series data
mining generally gives rise to change of time series representation. In an
objective of information intelligibility extracted from the representation
change, we may use symbolic representations of time series. Many high level
representations of time series have been proposed for data mining, including
Fourier transforms, wavelets, piecewise polynomial models, etc. Many
researchers have also considered symbolic representations of time series,
noting that such representations would potentiality allow researchers to avail
of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and
bioinformatics communities. We present in this work, one of the main symbolic
representation methods &quot;SAX&quot;(Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) and we
experience this method to symbolize and reduce the dimensionality of a
Satellite Image Times Series acquired over a period of 5 years by
characterizing the evolution of a vegetation index (NDVI).

 <dc:description>  Mobile peer-to-peer networks are quite prevalent and popular now days due to
advent of business scenarios where all the services are going mobile like
whether it's to find good restaurants, healthy diet books making friends,
job-hunting, real state info or cab-sharing etc. As the mobile users are
increasing day by day, peer-to-peer networks getting bigger and complex. In
contrast to client server system in peer-to-peer network resource sharing is
done on the basis of mutual consent and agreed policies with no central
authority and controlling entity. Incentive schemes for P2P networks are
devised to encourage the participation and to adhere the policies agreed. P2P
services based only on altruistic behaviour of users are facing serious
challenges like Free riding or The tragedy of commons. Free riders are the
users who consume the bandwidth of the system (perform downloading) but don't
show altruistic behaviour (deny uploading) and act as a parasite for the P2P

by the researchers. In this paper we will survey the different incentive
schemes, their architectures keeping eye on how they handle the challenges of
modern P2P network.

 <dc:description>  There is an urgent need for compact, fast, and power-efficient hardware
implementations of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. Here we propose a
power-efficient approach for real-time inference, in which deep neural networks
(DNNs) are implemented through low-power analog circuits. Although analog
implementations can be extremely compact, they have been largely supplanted by
digital designs, partly because of device mismatch effects due to fabrication.
We propose a framework that exploits the power of Deep Learning to compensate
for this mismatch by incorporating the measured variations of the devices as
constraints in the DNN training process. This eliminates the use of mismatch
minimization strategies such as the use of very large transistors, and allows
circuit complexity and power-consumption to be reduced to a minimum. Our
results, based on large-scale simulations as well as a prototype VLSI chip
implementation indicate at least a 3-fold improvement of processing efficiency
over current digital implementations.

 <dc:description>  Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely
used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs.
Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product
feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization
requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep
neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through
low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep
neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant
items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper,
we present Wide &amp; Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep
neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization
for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google
Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over
one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide &amp; Deep significantly
increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We
have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method for reducing the number of variables in quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization problems, using a quantum annealer (or any
sampler) to fix the value of a large portion of the variables to values that
have a high probability of being optimal. The resulting problems are usually
much easier for the quantum annealer to solve, due to their being smaller and
consisting of disconnected components. This approach significantly increases
the success rate and number of observations of the best known energy value in
samples obtained from the quantum annealer, when compared with calling the
quantum annealer without using it, even when using fewer annealing cycles. Use
of the method results in a considerable improvement in success metrics even for
problems with high-precision couplers and biases, which are more challenging
for the quantum annealer to solve. The results are further enhanced by applying
the method iteratively and combining it with classical pre-processing. We
present results for both Chimera graph-structured problems and embedded
problems from a real-world application.

 <dc:description>  The importance of graph search algorithm choice to the directed relation
graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method is studied by comparing basic and
modified depth-first search, basic and R-value-based breadth-first search
(RBFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm. By using each algorithm with DRGEP to produce
skeletal mechanisms from a detailed mechanism for n-heptane with
randomly-shuffled species order, it is demonstrated that only Dijkstra's
algorithm and RBFS produce results independent of species order. In addition,
each algorithm is used with DRGEP to generate skeletal mechanisms for n-heptane
covering a comprehensive range of autoignition conditions for pressure,
temperature, and equivalence ratio. Dijkstra's algorithm combined with a
coefficient scaling approach is demonstrated to produce the most compact
skeletal mechanism with a similar performance compared to larger skeletal
mechanisms resulting from the other algorithms. The computational efficiency of
each algorithm is also compared by applying the DRGEP method with each search
algorithm on the large detailed mechanism for n-alkanes covering n-octane to
n-hexadecane with 2115 species and 8157 reactions. Dijkstra's algorithm
implemented with a binary heap priority queue is demonstrated as the most
efficient method, with a CPU cost two orders of magnitude less than the other
search algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Archival information systems in government agency is one of the most used
applications for daily acitivities. One feature in application management
information document is searching. This feature serves to search for documents
from a collection of available information based on keywords entered by the
user. But some researches on a search engine (searching) concluded that the
average user error in the search is quite high due to several factors.
Therefore, we need a development on this feature as search suggestion. This
study discusses the application of the method of approximate string matching
algorithm using levenshtein distance. Levensthein distance algorithm is capable
of calculating the minimum distance conversion of a string into another string
to the optimum. Archiving information system using Levensthein Algorithm String
is an application that will be built to address these problems, this
application will help, especially in the administration to enter or save a
document, locate and make a report that will be seen by government agencies.

 <dc:description>  Since its introduction, Word2Vec and its variants are widely used to learn
semantics-preserving representations of words or entities in an embedding
space, which can be used to produce state-of-art results for various Natural
Language Processing tasks. Existing implementations aim to learn efficiently by
running multiple threads in parallel while operating on a single model in
shared memory, ignoring incidental memory update collisions. We show that these
collisions can degrade the efficiency of parallel learning, and propose a
straightforward caching strategy that improves the efficiency by a factor of 4.

 <dc:description>  In 1990, Alon and Kleitman proposed an argument for the sum-free subset
problem: every set of n nonzero elements of a finite Abelian group contains a
sum-free subset A of size |A|&gt;\frac{2}{7}n. In this note, we show that the
argument confused two different randomness. It applies only to the finite
Abelian group G = (Z/pZ)^s where p is a prime. For the general case, the
problem remains open.

 <dc:title>Modeling and Inferring Human Intents and Latent Functional Objects for

 <dc:description>  This paper is about detecting functional objects and inferring human
intentions in surveillance videos of public spaces. People in the videos are
expected to intentionally take shortest paths toward functional objects subject
to obstacles, where people can satisfy certain needs (e.g., a vending machine
can quench thirst), by following one of three possible intent behaviors: reach
a single functional object and stop, or sequentially visit several functional
objects, or initially start moving toward one goal but then change the intent
to move toward another. Since detecting functional objects in low-resolution
surveillance videos is typically unreliable, we call them &quot;dark matter&quot;
characterized by the functionality to attract people. We formulate the
Agent-based Lagrangian Mechanics wherein human trajectories are
probabilistically modeled as motions of agents in many layers of &quot;dark-energy&quot;
fields, where each agent can select a particular force field to affect its
motions, and thus define the minimum-energy Dijkstra path toward the
corresponding source &quot;dark matter&quot;. For evaluation, we compiled and annotated a
new dataset. The results demonstrate our effectiveness in predicting human
intent behaviors and trajectories, and localizing functional objects, as well
as discovering distinct functional classes of objects by clustering human
motion behavior in the vicinity of functional objects.

 <dc:description>  Venue recommendation aims to assist users by making personalised suggestions
of venues to visit, building upon data available from location-based social
networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare. A particular challenge for this task is
context-aware venue recommendation (CAVR), which additionally takes the
surrounding context of the user (e.g. the user's location and the time of day)
into account in order to provide more relevant venue suggestions. To address
the challenges of CAVR, we describe two approaches that exploit word embedding
techniques to infer the vector-space representations of venues, users' existing
preferences, and users' contextual preferences. Our evaluation upon the test
collection of the TREC 2015 Contextual Suggestion track demonstrates that we
can significantly enhance the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art venue
recommendation approach, as well as produce context-aware recommendations that
are at least as effective as the top TREC 2015 systems.

 <dc:description>  We present a token-level decision summarization framework that utilizes the
latent topic structures of utterances to identify &quot;summary-worthy&quot; words.
Concretely, a series of unsupervised topic models is explored and experimental
results show that fine-grained topic models, which discover topics at the
utterance-level rather than the document-level, can better identify the gist of
the decision-making process. Moreover, our proposed token-level summarization
approach, which is able to remove redundancies within utterances, outperforms
existing utterance ranking based summarization methods. Finally, context
information is also investigated to add additional relevant information to the
summary.

 <dc:description>  Accurate automatic organ segmentation is an important yet challenging problem
for medical image analysis. The pancreas is an abdominal organ with very high
anatomical variability. This inhibits traditional segmentation methods from
achieving high accuracies, especially compared to other organs such as the
liver, heart or kidneys. In this paper, we present a holistic learning approach
that integrates semantic mid-level cues of deeply-learned organ interior and
boundary maps via robust spatial aggregation using random forest. Our method
generates boundary preserving pixel-wise class labels for pancreas
segmentation. Quantitative evaluation is performed on CT scans of 82 patients
in 4-fold cross-validation. We achieve a (mean $\pm$ std. dev.) Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 78.01% $\pm$ 8.2% in testing which significantly outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art approach of 71.8% $\pm$ 10.7% under the same
evaluation criterion.

 <dc:description>  Many practical perception systems exist within larger processes that include
interactions with users or additional components capable of evaluating the
quality of predicted solutions. In these contexts, it is beneficial to provide
these oracle mechanisms with multiple highly likely hypotheses rather than a
single prediction. In this work, we pose the task of producing multiple outputs
as a learning problem over an ensemble of deep networks -- introducing a novel
stochastic gradient descent based approach to minimize the loss with respect to
an oracle. Our method is simple to implement, agnostic to both architecture and
loss function, and parameter-free. Our approach achieves lower oracle error
compared to existing methods on a wide range of tasks and deep architectures.
We also show qualitatively that the diverse solutions produced often provide
interpretable representations of task ambiguity.

 <dc:description>  Proactive decision support (PDS) helps in improving the decision making
experience of human decision makers in human-in-the-loop planning environments.
Here both the quality of the decisions and the ease of making them are
enhanced. In this regard, we propose a PDS framework, named RADAR, based on the
research in Automated Planning in AI, that aids the human decision maker with
her plan to achieve her goals by providing alerts on: whether such a plan can
succeed at all, whether there exist any resource constraints that may foil her
plan, etc. This is achieved by generating and analyzing the landmarks that must
be accomplished by any successful plan on the way to achieving the goals. Note
that, this approach also supports naturalistic decision making which is being
acknowledged as a necessary element in proactive decision support, since it
only aids the human decision maker through suggestions and alerts rather than
enforcing fixed plans or decisions. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed
framework through search-and-rescue examples in a fire-fighting domain.

 <dc:description>  We examine information structure design, also called &quot;persuasion&quot; or
&quot;signaling&quot;, in the presence of a constraint on the amount of communication. We
focus on the fundamental setting of bilateral trade, which in its simplest form
involves a seller with a single item to price, a buyer whose value for the item
is drawn from a common prior distribution over $n$ different possible values,
and a take-it-or-leave-it-offer protocol. A mediator with access to the buyer's
type may partially reveal such information to the seller in order to further
some objective such as the social welfare or the seller's revenue.
  In the setting of maximizing welfare under bilateral trade, we show that
$O(\log(n) \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ signals suffice for a $1-\epsilon$
approximation to the optimal welfare, and this bound is tight. As our main
result, we exhibit an efficient algorithm for computing a $\frac{M-1}{M} \cdot
(1-1/e)$-approximation to the welfare-maximizing scheme with at most M signals.
  For the revenue objective, we show that $\Omega(n)$ signals are needed for a
constant factor approximation to the revenue of a fully informed seller. From a
computational perspective, however, the problem gets easier: we show that a
simple dynamic program computes the signaling scheme with M signals maximizing
the seller's revenue.
  Observing that the signaling problem in bilateral trade is a special case of
the fundamental Bayesian Persuasion model of Kamenica and Gentzkow, we also
examine the question of communication-constrained signaling more generally. In
this model there is a sender (the mediator), a receiver (the seller) looking to
take an action (setting the price), and a state of nature (the buyer's type)
drawn from a common prior. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the
optimal sender's utility to within any constant factor in the presence of
communication constraints.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a novel unsupervised framework for focused meeting summarization
that views the problem as an instance of relation extraction. We adapt an
existing in-domain relation learner (Chen et al., 2011) by exploiting a set of
task-specific constraints and features. We evaluate the approach on a decision
summarization task and show that it outperforms unsupervised utterance-level
extractive summarization baselines as well as an existing generic
relation-extraction-based summarization method. Moreover, our approach produces
summaries competitive with those generated by supervised methods in terms of
the standard ROUGE score.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the design of static output feedback control of
discrete-time nonlinear systems satisfying a local Lipschitz continuity
condition with time-varying uncertainties. The controller has also a guaranteed
disturbance attenuation level (Hinfty performance). Thanks to the linearity of
the proposed LMIs in both the admissible Lipschitz constant of the system and
the disturbance attenuation level, they can be simultaneously optimized through
convex multiobjective optimization. The optimization over Lipschitz constant
adds an extra important and new feature to the controller, robustness against
nonlinear uncertainty. The resulting controller is robust against both
nonlinear additive uncertainty and time-varying parametric uncertainties.
Explicit norm-wise and element-wise bounds on the tolerable nonlinear
uncertainty are derived.

 <dc:description>  The systematic modelling of dynamic spatial systems is a key requirement in a
wide range of application areas such as commonsense cognitive robotics,
computer-aided architecture design, and dynamic geographic information systems.
We present ASPMT(QS), a novel approach and fully-implemented prototype for
non-monotonic spatial reasoning -a crucial requirement within dynamic spatial
systems- based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT).
  ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and
a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT) instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. We
formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame
axioms. Spatial reasoning is performed by encoding spatial relations as systems
of polynomial constraints, and solving via SMT with the theory of real
nonlinear arithmetic. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with
other contemporary spatial reasoning systems both within and outside the
context of logic programming. ASPMT(QS) is currently the only existing system
that is capable of reasoning about indirect spatial effects (i.e., addressing
the ramification problem), and integrating geometric and qualitative spatial
information within a non-monotonic spatial reasoning context.

 <dc:title>Tight Algorithms for Vertex Cover with Hard Capacities on Multigraphs

 <dc:creator>Wong, Sam Chiu-wai</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we give a f-approximation algorithm for the minimum unweighted
Vertex Cover problem with Hard Capacity constraints (VCHC) on f-hypergraphs.
This problem generalizes standard vertex cover for which the best known
approximation ratio is also f and cannot be improved assuming the unique game
conjecture. Our result is therefore essentially the best possible. This
improves over the previous 2.155 (for f=2) and 2f-approximation algorithms by
Cheung, Goemans and Wong (CGW).
  At the heart of our approach is to apply iterative rounding to the problem
with ideas coming from several previous works. We also give a faster
implementation of the method based on certain iteratively rounding the solution
to certain CGW-style covering LPs.
  We note that independent of this work, Kao [#kao2017iterative] also recently
obtained the same result.

 <dc:title>Matroid Online Bipartite Matching and Vertex Cover</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Yajun</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wong, Sam Chiu-wai</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Adwords and Online Bipartite Matching problems have enjoyed a renewed
attention over the past decade due to their connection to Internet advertising.
Our community has contributed, among other things, new models (notably
stochastic) and extensions to the classical formulations to address the issues
that arise from practical needs. In this paper, we propose a new generalization
based on matroids and show that many of the previous results extend to this
more general setting. Because of the rich structures and expressive power of
matroids, our new setting is potentially of interest both in theory and in
practice.
  In the classical version of the problem, the offline side of a bipartite
graph is known initially while vertices from the online side arrive one at a
time along with their incident edges. The objective is to maintain a decent
approximate matching from which no edge can be removed. Our generalization,
called Matroid Online Bipartite Matching, additionally requires that the set of
matched offline vertices be independent in a given matroid. In particular, the
case of partition matroids corresponds to the natural scenario where each
advertiser manages multiple ads with a fixed total budget.
  Our algorithms attain the same performance as the classical version of the
problems considered, which are often provably the best possible. We present
$1-1/e$-competitive algorithms for Matroid Online Bipartite Matching under the
small bid assumption, as well as a $1-1/e$-competitive algorithm for Matroid
Online Bipartite Matching in the random arrival model. A key technical
ingredient of our results is a carefully designed primal-dual waterfilling
procedure that accommodates for matroid constraints. This is inspired by the
extension of our recent charging scheme for Online Bipartite Vertex Cover.

 <dc:title>Fully Dynamic Spanners with Worst-Case Update Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bodwin, Greg</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Krinninger, Sebastian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An $\alpha$-spanner of a graph $ G $ is a subgraph $ H $ such that $ H $
preserves all distances of $ G $ within a factor of $ \alpha $. In this paper,
we give fully dynamic algorithms for maintaining a spanner $ H $ of a graph $ G
$ undergoing edge insertions and deletions with worst-case guarantees on the
running time after each update. In particular, our algorithms maintain: (1) a
$3$-spanner with $ \tilde O (n^{1+1/2}) $ edges with worst-case update time $
\tilde O (n^{3/4}) $, or (2) a $5$-spanner with $ \tilde O (n^{1+1/3}) $ edges
with worst-case update time $ \tilde O (n^{5/9}) $. These size/stretch
tradeoffs are best possible (up to logarithmic factors). They can be extended
to the weighted setting at very minor cost. Our algorithms are randomized and
correct with high probability against an oblivious adversary. We also further
extend our techniques to construct a $5$-spanner with suboptimal size/stretch
tradeoff, but improved worst-case update time.
  To the best of our knowledge, these are the first dynamic spanner algorithms
with sublinear worst-case update time guarantees. Since it is known how to
maintain a spanner using small amortized but large worst-case update time
[Baswana et al. SODA'08], obtaining algorithms with strong worst-case bounds,
as presented in this paper, seems to be the next natural step for this problem.

 <dc:description>  A major difficulty in applying word vector embeddings in IR is in devising an
effective and efficient strategy for obtaining representations of compound
units of text, such as whole documents, (in comparison to the atomic words),
for the purpose of indexing and scoring documents. Instead of striving for a
suitable method for obtaining a single vector representation of a large
document of text, we rather aim for developing a similarity metric that makes
use of the similarities between the individual embedded word vectors in a
document and a query. More specifically, we represent a document and a query as
sets of word vectors, and use a standard notion of similarity measure between
these sets, computed as a function of the similarities between each constituent
word pair from these sets. We then make use of this similarity measure in
combination with standard IR based similarities for document ranking. The
results of our initial experimental investigations shows that our proposed
method improves MAP by up to $5.77\%$, in comparison to standard text-based
language model similarity, on the TREC ad-hoc dataset.

 <dc:description>  In a given scene, humans can often easily predict a set of immediate future
events that might happen. However, generalized pixel-level anticipation in
computer vision systems is difficult because machine learning struggles with
the ambiguity inherent in predicting the future. In this paper, we focus on
predicting the dense trajectory of pixels in a scene, specifically what will
move in the scene, where it will travel, and how it will deform over the course
of one second. We propose a conditional variational autoencoder as a solution
to this problem. In this framework, direct inference from the image shapes the
distribution of possible trajectories, while latent variables encode any
necessary information that is not available in the image. We show that our
method is able to successfully predict events in a wide variety of scenes and
can produce multiple different predictions when the future is ambiguous. Our
algorithm is trained on thousands of diverse, realistic videos and requires
absolutely no human labeling. In addition to non-semantic action prediction, we
find that our method learns a representation that is applicable to semantic
vision tasks.

 <dc:description>  To design peer-to-peer (P2P) software systems is a challenging task, because
of their highly decentralized nature, which may cause unexpected emergent
global behaviors. The last fifteen years have seen many P2P applications to
come out and win favor with millions of users. From success histories of
applications like BitTorrent, Skype, MyP2P we have learnt a number of useful
design patterns. Thus, in this article we present a P2P pattern language
(shortly, P2P-PL) which encompasses all the aspects that a fully effective and
efficient P2P software system should provide, namely consistency of stored
data, redundancy, load balancing, coping with asymmetric bandwidth,
decentralized security. The patterns of the proposed P2P-PL are described in
detail, and a composition strategy for designing robust, effective and
efficient P2P software systems is proposed.

 <dc:description>  We show that every interval in the homomorphism order of finite undirected
graphs is either universal or a gap. Together with density and universality
this &quot;fractal&quot; property contributes to the spectacular properties of the
homomorphism order.
  We first show the fractal property by using Sparse Incomparability Lemma and
then by more involved elementary argument.

 <dc:description>  Time-Sensitive Distributed Systems (TSDS), such as applications using
autonomous drones, achieve goals under possible environment interference (\eg,
winds). Moreover, goals are often specified using explicit time constraints
which must be satisfied by the system \emph{perpetually}. For example, drones
carrying out the surveillance of some area must always have \emph{recent
pictures}, \ie, at most $M$ time units old, of some strategic locations. This
paper proposes a Multiset Rewriting language with explicit time for specifying
and analysing TSDSes. We introduce two properties, \emph{realizability} (some
trace is good) and \emph{survivability} (where, in addition, all admissible
traces are good). A good trace is an infinite trace in which goals are
perpetually satisfied. We propose a class of systems called \emph{progressive
timed systems} (PTS), where intuitively only a finite number of actions can be
carried out in a bounded time period. We prove that for this class of systems
both the realizability and the survivability problems are PSPACE-complete.
Furthermore, if we impose a bound on time (as in bounded model-checking), we
show that for PTS, realizability becomes NP-complete, while survivability is in
the $\Delta_2^p$ class of the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate
that the rewriting logic system Maude can be used to automate time bounded
verification of PTS.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of corpus-level entity typing, i.e.,
inferring from a large corpus that an entity is a member of a class such as
&quot;food&quot; or &quot;artist&quot;. The application of entity typing we are interested in is
knowledge base completion, specifically, to learn which classes an entity is a
member of. We propose FIGMENT to tackle this problem. FIGMENT is
embedding-based and combines (i) a global model that scores based on aggregated
contextual information of an entity and (ii) a context model that first scores
the individual occurrences of an entity and then aggregates the scores. In our
evaluation, FIGMENT strongly outperforms an approach to entity typing that
relies on relations obtained by an open information extraction system.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new methodology for intrinsic evaluation of word
representations. Specifically, we identify four fundamental criteria based on
the characteristics of natural language that pose difficulties to NLP systems;
and develop tests that directly show whether or not representations contain the
subspaces necessary to satisfy these criteria. Current intrinsic evaluations
are mostly based on the overall similarity or full-space similarity of words
and thus view vector representations as points. We show the limits of these
point-based intrinsic evaluations. We apply our evaluation methodology to the
comparison of a count vector model and several neural network models and
demonstrate important properties of these models.

 <dc:description>  SmallCells are deployed in order to enhance the network performance by
bringing the network closer to the user. However, as the number of low power
nodes grows increasingly, the overall energy consumption of the SmallCells base
stations cannot be ignored. A relevant amount of energy could be saved through
several techniques, especially power control mechanisms. In this paper, we are
concerned with energy aware self organizing networks that guarantee a
satisfactory performance. We consider satisfaction equilibria, mainly the
efficient satisfaction equilibrium (ESE), to ensure a target quality of service
(QoS) and save energy. First, we identify conditions of existence and
uniqueness of ESE under a stationary channel assumption. We fully characterize
the ESE and prove that, whenever it exists, it is a solution of a linear
system. Moreover, we define satisfactory Pareto optimality and show that, at
the ESE, no player can increase its QoS without degrading the overall
performance. Under a fast fading channel assumption, as the robust satisfaction
equilibrium solution is very restrictive, we propose an alternative solution
namely the long term satisfaction equilibrium, and describe how to reach this
solution efficiently. Finally, in order to find satisfactory solution per all
users, we propose fully distributed strategic learning schemes based on
Banach-Picard, Mann and Bush Mosteller algorithms, and show through simulations
their qualitative properties. fully distributed strategic learning schemes

 <dc:description>  We present in this paper an efficient approach for acoustic scene
classification by exploring the structure of class labels. Given a set of class
labels, a category taxonomy is automatically learned by collectively optimizing
a clustering of the labels into multiple meta-classes in a tree structure. An
acoustic scene instance is then embedded into a low-dimensional feature
representation which consists of the likelihoods that it belongs to the
meta-classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on two different datasets
for the acoustic scene classification task, including the DCASE 2013 and LITIS
Rouen datasets.

 <dc:title>Optimal redundancy in computations from random oracles</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Barmpalias, George</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lewis-Pye, Andrew</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A classic result in algorithmic information theory is that every infinite
binary sequence is computable from a Martin-Loef random infinite binary
sequence. Proved independently by Kucera and Gacs, this result answered a
question by Charles Bennett and has seen numerous applications in the last 30
years. The optimal redundancy in such a coding process has, however, remained
unknown. If the computation of the first n bits of a sequence requires n + g(n)
bits of the random oracle, then g is the redundancy of the computation. Kucera
implicitly achieved redundancy n log n while Gacs used a more elaborate
block-coding procedure which achieved redundancy sqrt(n) log n. Different
approaches to coding such as the one by Merkle and Mihailovic have not improved
this redundancy bound. In this paper we devise a new coding method that
achieves optimal logarithmic redundancy. Our redundancy bound is exponentially
smaller than the previously best known bound and is known to be the best
possible. It follows that redundancy r log n in computation from a random
oracle is possible for every stream, if and only if r &gt; 1.

 <dc:description>  Visontai conjectured in 2013 that the joint distribution of ascent and
distinct nonzero value numbers on the set of subexcedant sequences is the same
as that of descent and inverse descent numbers on the set of permutations. This
conjecture has been proved by Aas in 2014, and the generating function of the
corresponding bistatistics is the double Eulerian polynomial. Among the
techniques used by Aas are the M\&quot;obius inversion formula and isomorphism of
labeled rooted trees. In this paper we define a permutation code (that is, a
bijection between permutations and subexcedant sequences) and show the more
general result that two $5$-tuples of set-valued statistics on the set of
permutations and on the set of subexcedant sequences, respectively, are
equidistributed. In particular, these results give a bijective proof of
Visontai's conjecture.

 <dc:title>Going viral: Optimizing Discount Allocation in Social Networks for
  Influence Maximization</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the discount allocation problem in social
networks. It has been reported that 40\% of consumers will share an email offer
with their friend and 28\% of consumers will share deals via social media
platforms. What does this mean for a business? Essentially discounts should not
just be treated as short term solutions to attract individual customer,
instead, allocating discounts to a small fraction of users (called seed users)
may trigger a large cascade in a social network. This motivates us to study the
influence maximization discount allocation problem: given a social network and
budget, we need to decide to which initial set users should offer the
discounts, and how much should the discounts be worth. Our goal is to maximize
the number of customers who finally adopt the target product. We investigate
this problem under both non-adaptive and adaptive settings. In the first
setting, we have to commit the set of seed users and corresponding discounts
all at once in advance. In the latter case, the decision process is performed
in a sequential manner, and each seed user that is picked provides the feedback
on the discount, or, in other words, reveals whether or not she will adopt the
discount. We propose a simple greedy policy with an approximation ratio of
$\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1/e)$ in non-adaptive setting. For the significantly more
complex adaptive setting, we propose an adaptive greedy policy with bounded
approximation ratio in terms of expected utility.

 <dc:title>Finding the Topic of a Set of Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vaca-Castano, Gonzalo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce the problem of determining the topic that a set of
images is describing, where every topic is represented as a set of words.
Different from other problems like tag assignment or similar, a) we assume
multiple images are used as input instead of single image, b) Input images are
typically not visually related, c) Input images are not necessarily
semantically close, and d) Output word space is unconstrained. In our proposed
solution, visual information of each query image is used to retrieve similar
images with text labels (tags) from an image database. We consider a scenario
where the tags are very noisy and diverse, given that they were obtained by
implicit crowd-sourcing in a database of 1 million images and over seventy
seven thousand tags. The words or tags associated to each query are processed
jointly in a word selection algorithm using random walks that allows to refine
the search topic, rejecting words that are not part of the topic and produce a
set of words that fairly describe the topic. Experiments on a dataset of 300
topics, with up to twenty images per topic, show that our algorithm performs
better than the proposed baseline for any number of query images. We also
present a new Conditional Random Field (CRF) word mapping algorithm that
preserves the semantic similarity of the mapped words, increasing the
performance of the results over the baseline.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the number of devices has grown increasingly and it is hoped that,
between 2015 and 2016, 20 billion devices will be connected to the Internet and
this market will move around 91.5 billion dollars. The Internet of Things (IoT)
is composed of small sensors and actuators embedded in objects with Internet
access and will play a key role in solving many challenges faced in today's
society. However, the real capacity of IoT concepts is constrained as the
current sensor networks usually do not exchange information with other sources.
In this paper, we propose the Visual Search for Internet of Things (ViSIoT)
platform to help technical and non-technical users to discover and use sensors
as a service for different application purposes. As a proof of concept, a real
case study is used to generate weather condition reports to support rheumatism
patients. This case study was executed in a working prototype and a performance
evaluation is presented.

 <dc:description>  A large number of cloud middleware platforms and tools are deployed to
support a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics tasks. It is a
common practice that such cloud platforms are only used by its owners to
achieve their primary and predefined objectives, where raw and processed data
are only consumed by them. However, allowing third parties to access processed
data to achieve their own objectives significantly increases integration,
cooperation, and can also lead to innovative use of the data. Multicloud,
privacy-aware environments facilitate such data access, allowing different
parties to share processed data to reduce computation resource consumption
collectively. However, there are interoperability issues in such environments
that involve heterogeneous data and analytics-as-a-service providers. There is
a lack of both - architectural blueprints that can support such diverse,
multi-cloud environments, and corresponding empirical studies that show
feasibility of such architectures. In this paper, we have outlined an
innovative hierarchical data processing architecture that utilises semantics at
all the levels of IoT stack in multicloud environments. We demonstrate the
feasibility of such architecture by building a system based on this
architecture using OpenIoT as a middleware, and Google Cloud and Microsoft
Azure as cloud environments. The evaluation shows that the system is scalable
and has no significant limitations or overheads.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposed xml entities based architectural implementation to
improve integration between multiple third party vendor software systems with
incompatible xml schema. The xml entity architecture implementation showed that
the lines of code change required for mapping the schema between in house
software and three other vendor schema, decreased by 5.2%, indicating an
improvement in quality. The schema mapping development time decreased by 3.8%
and overall release time decreased by 5.3%, indicating an improvement in
productivity. The proposed technique proved that using xml entities and XSLT
transforms is more efficient in terms of coding effort and deployment
complexity when compared to mapping the schema using object oriented scripting
language such as C#.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) offers a novel alternative formulation of
translation that is potentially simpler than statistical approaches. However to
reach competitive performance, NMT models need to be exceedingly large. In this
paper we consider applying knowledge distillation approaches (Bucila et al.,
2006; Hinton et al., 2015) that have proven successful for reducing the size of
neural models in other domains to the problem of NMT. We demonstrate that
standard knowledge distillation applied to word-level prediction can be
effective for NMT, and also introduce two novel sequence-level versions of
knowledge distillation that further improve performance, and somewhat
surprisingly, seem to eliminate the need for beam search (even when applied on
the original teacher model). Our best student model runs 10 times faster than
its state-of-the-art teacher with little loss in performance. It is also
significantly better than a baseline model trained without knowledge
distillation: by 4.2/1.7 BLEU with greedy decoding/beam search. Applying weight
pruning on top of knowledge distillation results in a student model that has 13
times fewer parameters than the original teacher model, with a decrease of 0.4
BLEU.

 <dc:title>Word sense disambiguation via bipartite representation of complex

 <dc:description>  In recent years, concepts and methods of complex networks have been employed
to tackle the word sense disambiguation (WSD) task by representing words as
nodes, which are connected if they are semantically similar. Despite the
increasingly number of studies carried out with such models, most of them use
networks just to represent the data, while the pattern recognition performed on
the attribute space is performed using traditional learning techniques. In
other words, the structural relationship between words have not been explicitly
used in the pattern recognition process. In addition, only a few investigations
have probed the suitability of representations based on bipartite networks and
graphs (bigraphs) for the problem, as many approaches consider all possible
links between words. In this context, we assess the relevance of a bipartite
network model representing both feature words (i.e. the words characterizing
the context) and target (ambiguous) words to solve ambiguities in written
texts. Here, we focus on the semantical relationships between these two type of
words, disregarding the relationships between feature words. In special, the
proposed method not only serves to represent texts as graphs, but also
constructs a structure on which the discrimination of senses is accomplished.
Our results revealed that the proposed learning algorithm in such bipartite
networks provides excellent results mostly when topical features are employed
to characterize the context. Surprisingly, our method even outperformed the
support vector machine algorithm in particular cases, with the advantage of
being robust even if a small training dataset is available. Taken together, the
results obtained here show that the proposed representation/classification
method might be useful to improve the semantical characterization of written
texts.

 <dc:description>  Sequence labeling for extraction of medical events and their attributes from
unstructured text in Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes is a key step towards
semantic understanding of EHRs. It has important applications in health
informatics including pharmacovigilance and drug surveillance. The state of the
art supervised machine learning models in this domain are based on Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) with features calculated from fixed context windows. In
this application, we explored various recurrent neural network frameworks and
show that they significantly outperformed the CRF models.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of summarizing decisions in spoken meetings:
our goal is to produce a concise {\it decision abstract} for each meeting
decision. We explore and compare token-level and dialogue act-level automatic
summarization methods using both unsupervised and supervised learning
frameworks. In the supervised summarization setting, and given true clusterings
of decision-related utterances, we find that token-level summaries that employ
discourse context can approach an upper bound for decision abstracts derived
directly from dialogue acts. In the unsupervised summarization setting,we find
that summaries based on unsupervised partitioning of decision-related
utterances perform comparably to those based on partitions generated using
supervised techniques (0.22 ROUGE-F1 using LDA-based topic models vs. 0.23
using SVMs).

 <dc:description>  Training statistical dialog models in spoken dialog systems (SDS) requires
large amounts of annotated data. The lack of scalable methods for data mining
and annotation poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art statistical
dialog managers. This paper presents an approach that directly leverage
billions of web search and browse sessions to overcome this hurdle. The key
insight is that task completion through web search and browse sessions is (a)
predictable and (b) generalizes to spoken dialog task completion. The new
method automatically mines behavioral search and browse patterns from web logs
and translates them into spoken dialog models. We experiment with naturally
occurring spoken dialogs and large scale web logs. Our session-based models
outperform the state-of-the-art method for entity extraction task in SDS. We
also achieve better performance for both entity and relation extraction on web
search queries when compared with nontrivial baselines.

 <dc:description>  Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is a non-invasive tool for
watching the microstructure of fibrous nerve and muscle tissue. From dMRI, it
is possible to estimate 2-rank diffusion tensors imaging (DTI) fields, that are
widely used in clinical applications: tissue segmentation, fiber tractography,
brain atlas construction, brain conductivity models, among others. Due to
hardware limitations of MRI scanners, DTI has the difficult compromise between
spatial resolution and signal noise ratio (SNR) during acquisition. For this
reason, the data are often acquired with very low resolution. To enhance DTI
data resolution, interpolation provides an interesting software solution. The
aim of this work is to develop a methodology for DTI interpolation that enhance
the spatial resolution of DTI fields. We assume that a DTI field follows a
recently introduced stochastic process known as a generalized Wishart process
(GWP), which we use as a prior over the diffusion tensor field. For posterior
inference, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We perform experiments in
toy and real data. Results of GWP outperform other methods in the literature,
when compared in different validation protocols.

 <dc:description>  Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an emerging medical technique
used for describing water diffusion in an organic tissue. Typically, rank-2
tensors quantify this diffusion. From this quantification, it is possible to
calculate relevant scalar measures (i.e. fractional anisotropy and mean
diffusivity) employed in clinical diagnosis of neurological diseases.
Nonetheless, 2nd-order tensors fail to represent complex tissue structures like
crossing fibers. To overcome this limitation, several researchers proposed a
diffusion representation with higher order tensors (HOT), specifically 4th and
6th orders. However, the current acquisition protocols of dMRI data allow
images with a spatial resolution between 1 $mm^3$ and 2 $mm^3$. This voxel size
is much smaller than tissue structures. Therefore, several clinical procedures
derived from dMRI may be inaccurate. Interpolation has been used to enhance
resolution of dMRI in a tensorial space. Most interpolation methods are valid
only for rank-2 tensors and a generalization for HOT data is missing. In this
work, we propose a novel stochastic process called Tucker decomposition process
(TDP) for performing HOT data interpolation. Our model is based on the Tucker
decomposition and Gaussian processes as parameters of the TDP. We test the TDP
in 2nd, 4th and 6th rank HOT fields. For rank-2 tensors, we compare against
direct interpolation, log-Euclidean approach and Generalized Wishart processes.
For rank-4 and rank-6 tensors we compare against direct interpolation. Results
obtained show that TDP interpolates accurately the HOT fields and generalizes
to any rank.

 <dc:description>  Coexistence of Wi-Fi and LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) technologies has drawn
significant concern in industry. In this paper, we investigate the Wi-Fi
performance in the presence of duty cycle based LTE-U transmission on the same
channel. More specifically, one LTE-U cell and one Wi-Fi basic service set
(BSS) coexist by allowing LTE-U devices transmit their signals only in
predetermined duty cycles. Wi-Fi stations, on the other hand, simply contend
the shared channel using the distributed coordination function (DCF) protocol
without cooperation with the LTE-U system or prior knowledge about the duty
cycle period or duty cycle of LTE-U transmission. We define the fairness of the
above scheme as the difference between Wi-Fi performance loss ratio
(considering a defined reference performance) and the LTE-U duty cycle (or
function of LTE-U duty cycle). Depending on the interference to noise ratio
(INR) being above or below -62dbm, we classify the LTE-U interference as strong
or weak and establish mathematical models accordingly. The average throughput
and average service time of Wi-Fi are both formulated as functions of Wi-Fi and
LTE-U system parameters using probability theory. Lastly, we use the Monte
Carlo analysis to demonstrate the fairness of Wi-Fi and LTE-U air time sharing.

 <dc:description>  We prove the Ramsey property of classes of ordered structures with closures
and given local properties. This generalises earlier results: the
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\&quot;odl Theorem, the Ramsey property of partial orders and
metric spaces as well as the author's Ramsey lift of bowtie-free graphs. We use
this framework to give new examples of Ramsey classes. Among others, we show
(and characterise) the Ramsey property of convexly ordered $S$-metric spaces
and prove the Ramsey Theorem for Finite Models (i.e. structures with both
functions and relations) thus providing the ultimate generalisation of
Structural the Ramsey Theorem. We also show the Ramsey Theorem for structures
with linear ordering on relations (&quot;totally ordered structures&quot;). All of these
results are natural, easy to state, yet proofs involve most of the theory
developed here.
  We characterise classes of structures defined by forbidden homomorphisms
having a Ramsey lift and extend this to special cases of classes with closures.
We apply this to prove the Ramsey property of many Cherlin-Shelah-Shi classes.
  In several instances our results are the best possible and confirm the
meta-conjecture that Ramsey classes are &quot;close&quot; to lifted universal classes.

 <dc:description>  The features of non-stationary multi-component signals are often difficult to
be extracted for expert systems. In this paper, a new method for feature
extraction that is based on maximization of local Gaussian correlation function
of wavelet coefficients and signal is presented. The effect of empirical mode
decomposition (EMD) to decompose multi-component signals to intrinsic mode
functions (IMFs), before using of local Gaussian correlation is discussed. The
experimental vibration signals from two gearbox systems are used to show the
efficiency of the presented method. Linear support vector machine (SVM) is
utilized to classify feature sets extracted with the presented method. The
obtained results show that the features extracted in this method have excellent
ability to classify faults without any additional feature selection; it is also
shown that EMD can improve or degrade features according to the utilized
feature reduction method.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing fast adoption in the society,
from industrial to home applications. The number of deployed sensors and
connected devices to the Internet is changing our perspective and the way we
understand the world. The development and generation of IoT applications is
just starting and they will modify our physical and virtual lives, from how we
control remotely appliances at home to how we deal with insurance companies in
order to start insurance schemes via smart cards. This massive deployment of
IoT devices represents a tremendous economic impact and at the same time offers
multiple opportunities. However, the potential of IoT is underexploited and day
by day this gap between devices and useful applications is getting bigger.
Additionally, the physical and cyber worlds are largely disconnected, requiring
a lot of manual efforts to integrate, find, and use information in a meaningful
way.
  To build a connection between the physical and the virtual, we need a
knowledge framework that allow bilateral understandings, devices producing
data, information systems managing the data and applications transforming
information into meaningful knowledge. The first column in this series in the
previous issue of this magazine titled &quot;Internet of Things to Smart IoT Through
Semantic, Cognitive, and Perceptual Computing,&quot; reviews IoT growth and
potential that have energized research and technology development, centered on
aspects of Artificial Intelligence to build future intelligent system. This
column steps back and demonstrates the benefits of using semantic web
technologies to get meaningful knowledge from sensor data to design smart
systems.

 <dc:description>  Layered software architecture contains several intra-layer and inter-layer
dependencies. Each layer depends on shared components making it difficult to
release a code change, bug fix or feature without exhaustive testing and having
to build the entire software code base. This paper proposed self-contained,
cross-cutting pipeline architecture (SCPA) that is independent of existing
layers. We chose 2 open source projects and 3 internal intern projects that
used n-tier architecture and applied the SCPA to release subsequent feature
additions and any bug fixes. The SCPA decreased the release time by 42.99%. The
lines of delivered code (LOC), increased by 22.58%. The number of defects found
in existing functionality decreased by 85.54%. The SCPA also provided ability
to roll back or switch off the new feature quickly. SCPA proved a suitable
architecture for agile software development and continuous deployment.

 <dc:title>Faster coreset construction for projective clustering via low rank

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present randomized coreset construction for projective
clustering that involves computing a set of $k$ closest $j$-dimensional linear
(affine) subspaces of a given set of $n$ vectors in $d$ dimensions. Let $A \in
R^{n\times d}$ be an input matrix, then an earlier deterministic coreset
construction of Feldman \textit{et al.} relied on computing the SVD of $A$. The
best known algorithms for SVD require $nd\min\{n, d\}$ time, which may not be
feasible for large values of $n$ and $d$.
  We present a coreset construction by projecting the matrix $A$ on some
orthonormal vectors that closely approximate the right singular vectors of $A$.
As a consequence, when the values of $k$ and $j$ are small, we are able to
achieve a significantly faster algorithm, as compared to Feldman \textit{et
al.}, while maintaining almost the same approximation. We also benefit in terms
of space as well as exploit the sparsity of the input dataset. Another
advantage of our approach is that it can be constructed in a streaming setting
quite efficiently.

 <dc:description>  Biomedical information extraction (BioIE) is important to many applications,
including clinical decision support, integrative biology, and
pharmacovigilance, and therefore it has been an active research. Unlike
existing reviews covering a holistic view on BioIE, this review focuses on
mainly recent advances in learning based approaches, by systematically
summarizing them into different aspects of methodological development. In
addition, we dive into open information extraction and deep learning, two
emerging and influential techniques and envision next generation of BioIE.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Vector space models have become popular in distributional semantics, despite
the challenges they face in capturing various semantic phenomena. We propose a
novel probabilistic framework which draws on both formal semantics and recent
advances in machine learning. In particular, we separate predicates from the
entities they refer to, allowing us to perform Bayesian inference based on
logical forms. We describe an implementation of this framework using a
combination of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and feedforward neural networks.
Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by training it on a
parsed corpus and evaluating it on established similarity datasets.

 <dc:description>  Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in computational vision and
medical imaging. Designing a generic, automated method that works for various
objects and imaging modalities is a formidable task. Instead of proposing a new
specific segmentation algorithm, we present a general design principle on how
to integrate user interactions from the perspective of feedback control theory.
Impulsive control and Lyapunov stability analysis are employed to design and
analyze an interactive segmentation system. Then stabilization conditions are
derived to guide algorithm design. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of
proposed method are demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the recovery of a sparse weight vector
(parameters vector) from a set of noisy linear combinations. However, only
partial information about the matrix representing the linear combinations is
available. Assuming a low-rank structure for the matrix, one natural solution
would be to first apply a matrix completion on the data, and then to solve the
resulting compressed sensing problem. In big data applications such as massive
MIMO and medical data, the matrix completion step imposes a huge computational
burden. Here, we propose to reduce the computational cost of the completion
task by ignoring the columns corresponding to zero elements in the sparse
vector. To this end, we employ a technique to initially approximate the support
of the sparse vector. We further propose to unify the partial matrix completion
and sparse vector recovery into an augmented four-step problem. Simulation
results reveal that the augmented approach achieves the best performance, while
both proposed methods outperform the natural two-step technique with
substantially less computational requirements.

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate some lower bounds for parameterized problems via parameterized

such a lower bound for all fpt-approximations of the parameterized clique
problem and for a parameterized halting problem, which recently turned out to
link problems of computational complexity, descriptive complexity, and proof
theory. To show the first lower bound, we prove a strong ${\rm AC}^0$ version
of the planted clique conjecture: ${\rm AC}^0$-circuits asymptotically almost
surely can not distinguish between a random graph and this graph with a
randomly planted clique of any size $\le n^\xi$ (where $0 \le \xi &lt; 1$).

 <dc:title>Constant factor Approximation Algorithms for Uniform Hard Capacitated
  Facility Location Problems: Natural LP is not too bad</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Grover, Sapna</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we give first constant factor approximation for capacitated
knapsack median problem (CKM) for hard uniform capacities, violating the budget
only by an additive factor of $f_{max}$ where $f_{max}$ is the maximum cost of
a facility opened by the optimal and violating capacities by $(2+\epsilon)$
factor. Natural LP for the problem is known to have an unbounded integrality
gap when any one of the two constraints is allowed to be violated by a factor
less than $2$. Thus, we present a result which is very close to the best
achievable from the natural LP. To the best of our knowledge, the problem has
not been studied earlier.
  For capacitated facility location problem with uniform capacities, a constant
factor approximation algorithm is presented violating the capacities a little
($1 + \epsilon$). Though constant factor results are known for the problem
without violating the capacities, the result is interesting as it is obtained
by rounding the solution to the natural LP, which is known to have an unbounded
integrality gap without violating the capacities. Thus, we achieve the best
possible from the natural LP for the problem. The result shows that natural LP
is not too bad.
  Finally, we raise some issues with the proofs of the results presented
in~\cite{capkmByrkaFRS2013} for capacitated $k$-facility location problem
(C$k$FLP).~\cite{capkmByrkaFRS2013} presents $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ approximation
violating the capacities by a factor of $(2 + \epsilon)$ using dependent
rounding. We first fix these issues using our techniques. Also, it can be
argued that (deterministic) pipage rounding cannot be used to open the
facilities instead of dependent rounding. Our techniques for CKM provide a
constant factor approximation for CkFLP violating the capacities by $(2 +
\epsilon)$.

 <dc:description>  We study a new search problem on the plane involving a robot and an immobile
treasure, initially placed at distance $1$ from each other. The length $\beta$
of an arc (a fence) within the perimeter of the corresponding circle, as well
as the promise that the treasure is outside the fence, is given as part of the
input. The goal is to device movement trajectories so that the robot locates
the treasure in minimum time. Notably, although the presence of the fence
limits searching uncertainty, the location of the fence is unknown, and in the
worst case analysis is determined adversarially. Nevertheless, the robot has
the ability to move in the interior of the circle. In particular the robot can
attempt a number of chord-jump moves if it happens to be within the fence or if
an endpoint of the fence is discovered.
  The optimal solution to our question can be obtained as a solution to a
complicated optimization problem, which involves trigonometric functions, and
trigonometric equations that do not admit closed form solutions. For the 1-Jump
Algorithm, we fully describe the optimal trajectory, and provide an analysis of
the associated cost as a function of $\beta$. Our analysis indicates that the
optimal k-Jump Algorithm requires that the robot has enough memory and
computation power to compute the optimal chord-jumps. Motivated by this, we
give an abstract performance analysis for every k-Jump Algorithm. Subsequently,
we present a highly efficient Halving Heuristic k-Jump Algorithm that can
effectively approximate the optimal k-Jump Algorithm, with very limited memory
and computation requirements.

 <dc:description>  We introduce and study the bounded word problem and the precise word problem
for groups given by means of generators and defining relations. For example,
for every finitely presented group, the bounded word problem is in NP, i.e., it
can be solved in nondeterministic polynomial time, and the precise word problem
is in PSPACE. The main technical result of the paper states that, for certain
finite presentations of groups, which include the Baumslag-Solitar one-relator
groups and free products of cyclic groups, the bounded word problem and the
precise word problem can be solved in polylogarithmic space. As consequences of
developed techniques that can be described as calculus of brackets, we obtain
polylogarithmic space bounds for the computational complexity of the diagram
problem for free groups, for the width problem for elements of free groups, and
for computation of the area defined by polygonal singular closed curves in the
plane. We also obtain polynomial time bounds for these problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a new family of approximate Riemann solvers for the
numerical approximation of solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws. They are
approximate, also referred to as incomplete, in the sense that the solvers
avoid computing the characteristic decomposition of the flux Jacobian. Instead,
they require only an estimate of the globally fastest wave speeds in both
directions. Thus, this family of solvers is particularly efficient for large
systems of conservation laws, i.e. with many different propagation speeds, and
when no explicit expression for the eigensystem is available. Even though only
fastest wave speeds are needed as input values, the new family of Riemann
solvers reproduces all waves with less dissipation than HLL, which has the same
prerequisites, requiring only one additional flux evaluation.

 <dc:description>  Many machine learning problems such as speech recognition, gesture
recognition, and handwriting recognition are concerned with simultaneous
segmentation and labeling of sequence data. Latent-dynamic conditional random
field (LDCRF) is a well-known discriminative method that has been successfully
used for this task. However, LDCRF can only be trained with pre-segmented data
sequences in which the label of each frame is available apriori. In the realm
of neural networks, the invention of connectionist temporal classification
(CTC) made it possible to train recurrent neural networks on unsegmented
sequences with great success. In this paper, we use CTC to train an LDCRF model
on unsegmented sequences. Experimental results on two gesture recognition tasks
show that the proposed method outperforms LDCRFs, hidden Markov models, and
conditional random fields.

 <dc:description>  A promising approach to autonomous driving is machine learning. In such
systems, training datasets are created that capture the sensory input to a
vehicle as well as the desired response. A disadvantage of using a learned
navigation system is that the learning process itself may require a huge number
of training examples and a large amount of computing. To avoid the need to
collect a large training set of driving examples, we describe a system that
takes advantage of the huge number of training examples provided by ImageNet,
but is able to adapt quickly using a small training set for the specific
driving environment.

 <dc:description>  An important class of problems involves training deep neural networks with
sparse prediction targets of very high dimension D. These occur naturally in
e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as
predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g.
200,000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional
output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500)
incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does
updating the $D \times d$ output weight matrix and computing the gradient
needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of
large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is
not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as
hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this
work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss
functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the
exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for
backpropagation, all in $O(d^{2})$ per example instead of $O(Dd)$, remarkably
without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields
a speedup of up to $D/4d$ i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for
that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time
in this kind of network architecture.

 <dc:description>  Recent studies have shown that information disclosed on social network sites
(such as Facebook) can be used to predict personal characteristics with
surprisingly high accuracy. In this paper we examine a method to give online
users transparency into why certain inferences are made about them by
statistical models, and control to inhibit those inferences by hiding
(&quot;cloaking&quot;) certain personal information from inference. We use this method to
examine whether such transparency and control would be a reasonable goal by
assessing how difficult it would be for users to actually inhibit inferences.
Applying the method to data from a large collection of real users on Facebook,
we show that a user must cloak only a small portion of her Facebook Likes in
order to inhibit inferences about their personal characteristics. However, we
also show that in response a firm could change its modeling of users to make
cloaking more difficult.

 <dc:description>  We provide an overview of the recent trends towards digitalization and large
scale data analytics in healthcare. It is expected that these trends are
instrumental in the dramatic changes in the way healthcare will be organized in
the future. We discuss the recent political initiatives designed to shift care
delivery processes from paper to electronic, with the goals of more effective
treatments with better outcomes; cost pressure is a major driver of innovation.
We describe newly developed networks of healthcare providers, research
organizations and commercial vendors to jointly analyze data for the
development of decision support systems. We address the trend towards
continuous healthcare where health is monitored by wearable and stationary
devices; a related development is that patients increasingly assume
responsibility for their own health data. Finally we discuss recent initiatives
towards a personalized medicine, based on advances in molecular medicine, data
management, and data analytics.

 <dc:description>  We consider an assignment problem that has aspects of fair division as well
as social choice. In particular, we investigate the problem of assigning a
small subset from a set of indivisible items to multiple players so that the
chosen subset is \emph{agreeable} to all players, i.e., every player weakly
prefers the chosen subset to any subset of its complement. For an arbitrary
number of players, we derive tight upper bounds on the size for which a subset
of that size that is agreeable to all players always exists when preferences
are monotonic. We then present polynomial-time algorithms that find an
agreeable subset of approximately half of the items when there are two or three
players and preferences are responsive. Our results translate to a
2-approximation on the individual welfare of every player when preferences are
subadditive.

 <dc:description>  Non-intrusive inspection systems based on X-ray radiography techniques are
routinely used at transport hubs to ensure the conformity of cargo content with
the supplied shipping manifest. As trade volumes increase and regulations
become more stringent, manual inspection by trained operators is less and less
viable due to low throughput. Machine vision techniques can assist operators in
their task by automating parts of the inspection workflow. Since cars are
routinely involved in trafficking, export fraud, and tax evasion schemes, they
represent an attractive target for automated detection and flagging for
subsequent inspection by operators. In this contribution, we describe a method
for the detection of cars in X-ray cargo images based on trained-from-scratch
Convolutional Neural Networks. By introducing an oversampling scheme that
suitably addresses the low number of car images available for training, we
achieved 100% car image classification rate for a false positive rate of
1-in-454. Cars that were partially or completely obscured by other goods, a
modus operandi frequently adopted by criminals, were correctly detected. We
believe that this level of performance suggests that the method is suitable for
deployment in the field. It is expected that the generic object detection
workflow described can be extended to other object classes given the
availability of suitable training data.

 <dc:description>  When individuals interact with each other and meaningfully contribute toward
a common goal, it results in a collaboration, as can be seen in many walks of
life such as scientific research, motion picture production, or team sports.
The artifacts resulting from a collaboration (e.g. papers, movies) are best
captured using a hypergraph model, whereas the relation of who has collaborated
with whom is best captured via an abstract simplicial complex (SC). In this
paper, we propose a generative algorithm GeneSCs for SCs modeling fundamental
collaboration relations, primarily based on preferential attachment. The
proposed network growth process favors attachment that is preferential not to
an individual's degree, i.e., how many people has he/she collaborated with, but
to his/her facet degree, i.e., how many maximal groups or facets has he/she
collaborated within. Unlike graphs, in SCs, both facet degrees (of nodes) and
facet sizes are important to capture connectivity properties. Based on our
observation that several real-world facet size distributions have significant
deviation from power law-mainly due to the fact that larger facets tend to
subsume smaller ones-we adopt a data-driven approach. We seed GeneSCs with a
facet size distribution informed by collaboration network data and randomly
grow the SC facet-by-facet to generate a final SC whose facet degree
distribution matches real data. We prove that the facet degree distribution
yielded by GeneSCs is power law distributed for large SCs and show that it is
in agreement with real world co-authorship data. Finally, based on our
intuition of collaboration formation in domains such as collaborative
scientific experiments and movie production, we propose two variants of GeneSCs
based on clamped and hybrid preferential attachment schemes, and show that they
perform well in these domains.

 <dc:title>Matrix Balancing in Lp Norms: A New Analysis of Osborne's Iteration</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study an iterative matrix conditioning algorithm due to Osborne (1960).
The goal of the algorithm is to convert a square matrix into a balanced matrix
where every row and corresponding column have the same norm. The original
algorithm was proposed for balancing rows and columns in the $L_2$ norm, and it
works by iterating over balancing a row-column pair in fixed round-robin order.
Variants of the algorithm for other norms have been heavily studied and are
implemented as standard preconditioners in many numerical linear algebra
packages. Recently, Schulman and Sinclair (2015), in a first result of its kind
for any norm, analyzed the rate of convergence of a variant of Osborne's
algorithm that uses the $L_{\infty}$ norm and a different order of choosing
row-column pairs. In this paper we study matrix balancing in the $L_1$ norm and
other $L_p$ norms. We show the following results for any matrix $A =
(a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^n$, resolving in particular a main open problem mentioned by
Schulman and Sinclair.
  1) We analyze the iteration for the $L_1$ norm under a greedy order of
balancing. We show that it converges to an $\epsilon$-balanced matrix in $K =
O(\min\{\epsilon^{-2}\log w,\epsilon^{-1}n^{3/2}\log(w/\epsilon)\})$ iterations
that cost a total of $O(m + Kn\log n)$ arithmetic operations over $O(n\log
w)$-bit numbers. Here $m$ is the number of non-zero entries of $A$, and $w =
\sum_{i,j} |a_{ij}|/a_{\min}$ with $a_{\min} = \min\{|a_{ij}|:\ a_{ij}\neq
0\}$.
  2) We show that the original round-robin implementation converges to an
$\epsilon$-balanced matrix in $O(\epsilon^{-2}n^2\log w)$ iterations totalling
$O(\epsilon^{-2}mn\log w)$ arithmetic operations over $O(n\log w)$-bit numbers.
  3) We demonstrate a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ on the
convergence rate of any implementation of the iteration.

 <dc:description>  With the rise of social media, people can now form relationships and
communities easily regardless of location, race, ethnicity, or gender. However,
the power of social media simultaneously enables harmful online behavior such
as harassment and bullying. Cyberbullying is a serious social problem, making
it an important topic in social network analysis. Machine learning methods can
potentially help provide better understanding of this phenomenon, but they must
address several key challenges: the rapidly changing vocabulary involved in
cyber- bullying, the role of social network structure, and the scale of the
data. In this study, we propose a model that simultaneously discovers
instigators and victims of bullying as well as new bullying vocabulary by
starting with a corpus of social interactions and a seed dictionary of bullying
indicators. We formulate an objective function based on participant-vocabulary
consistency. We evaluate this approach on Twitter and Ask.fm data sets and show
that the proposed method can detect new bullying vocabulary as well as victims
and bullies.

 <dc:title>Sampling and Reconstruction of Sparse Signals on Circulant Graphs - An
  Introduction to Graph-FRI</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kotzagiannidis, Madeleine S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Dragotti, Pier Luigi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the objective of employing graphs toward a more generalized theory of
signal processing, we present a novel sampling framework for (wavelet-)sparse
signals defined on circulant graphs which extends basic properties of Finite
Rate of Innovation (FRI) theory to the graph domain, and can be applied to
arbitrary graphs via suitable approximation schemes. At its core, the
introduced Graph-FRI-framework states that any K-sparse signal on the vertices
of a circulant graph can be perfectly reconstructed from its
dimensionality-reduced representation in the graph spectral domain, the Graph
Fourier Transform (GFT), of minimum size 2K. By leveraging the recently
developed theory of e-splines and e-spline wavelets on graphs, one can
decompose this graph spectral transformation into the multiresolution low-pass
filtering operation with a graph e-spline filter, and subsequent transformation
to the spectral graph domain; this allows to infer a distinct sampling pattern,
and, ultimately, the structure of an associated coarsened graph, which
preserves essential properties of the original, including circularity and,
where applicable, the graph generating set.

 <dc:description>  We investigate new graph classes of bounded mim-width, strictly extending
interval graphs and permutation graphs. The graphs $K_t \boxminus K_t$ and $K_t
\boxminus S_t$ are graphs obtained from the disjoint union of two cliques of
size $t$, and one clique of size $t$ and one independent set of size $t$
respectively, by adding a perfect matching. We prove that : (1) interval graphs
are $(K_3\boxminus S_3)$-free chordal graphs; and $(K_t\boxminus S_t)$-free
chordal graphs have mim-width at most $t-1$, (2) permutation graphs are
$(K_3\boxminus K_3)$-free co-comparability graphs; and $(K_t\boxminus
K_t)$-free co-comparability graphs have mim-width at most $t-1$, (3) chordal
graphs and co-comparability graphs have unbounded mim-width in general. We
obtain several algorithmic consequences; for instance, while Minimum Dominating
Set is NP-complete on chordal graphs, it can be solved in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}(t)}$ on $(K_t\boxminus S_t)$-free chordal graphs. The third
statement strengthens a result of Belmonte and Vatshelle stating that either
those classes do not have constant mim-width or a decomposition with constant
mim-width cannot be computed in polynomial time unless $P=NP$. We generalize
these ideas to bigger graph classes. We introduce a new width parameter
sim-width, of stronger modelling power than mim-width, by making a small change
in the definition of mim-width. We prove that chordal graphs and
co-comparability graphs have sim-width at most 1. We investigate a way to bound
mim-width for graphs of bounded sim-width by excluding $K_t\boxminus K_t$ and
$K_t\boxminus S_t$ as induced minors or induced subgraphs, and give algorithmic
consequences. Lastly, we show that circle graphs have unbounded sim-width, and
thus also unbounded mim-width.

 <dc:description>  Causal precedence between biochemical interactions is crucial in the
biomedical domain, because it transforms collections of individual
interactions, e.g., bindings and phosphorylations, into the causal mechanisms
needed to inform meaningful search and inference. Here, we analyze causal
precedence in the biomedical domain as distinct from open-domain, temporal
precedence. First, we describe a novel, hand-annotated text corpus of causal
precedence in the biomedical domain. Second, we use this corpus to investigate
a battery of models of precedence, covering rule-based, feature-based, and
latent representation models. The highest-performing individual model achieved
a micro F1 of 43 points, approaching the best performers on the simpler
temporal-only precedence tasks. Feature-based and latent representation models
each outperform the rule-based models, but their performance is complementary
to one another. We apply a sieve-based architecture to capitalize on this lack
of overlap, achieving a micro F1 score of 46 points.

 <dc:description>  The design of unknown-input decoupled observers and filters requires the
assumption of an existence condition in the literature. This paper addresses an
unknown input filtering problem where the existence condition is not satisfied.
Instead of designing a traditional unknown input decoupled filter, a
Double-Model Adaptive Estimation approach is extended to solve the unknown
input filtering problem. It is proved that the state and the unknown inputs can
be estimated and decoupled using the extended Double-Model Adaptive Estimation
approach without satisfying the existence condition. Numerical examples are
presented in which the performance of the proposed approach is compared to
methods from literature.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This paper has been accepted by Automatica. It considers unknown
  input estimation or fault and disturbances estimation. Existing approaches
  considers the case where the effects of fault and disturbance can be
  decoupled. In our paper, we consider the case where the effects of fault and
  disturbance are coupled. This approach can be easily extended to nonlinear
  systems</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  In response to failures of central planning, the Chinese government has
experimented not only with free-market trade zones, but with allowing
non-profit foundations to operate in a decentralized fashion. A network study
shows how these foundations have connected together by sharing board members,
in a structural parallel to what is seen in corporations in the United States
and Europe. This board interlocking leads to the emergence of an elite group
with privileged network positions. While the presence of government officials
on non-profit boards is widespread, government officials are much less common
in a subgroup of foundations that control just over half of all revenue in the
network. This subgroup, associated with business elites, not only enjoys higher
levels of within-elite links, but even preferentially excludes government
officials from the NGOs with higher degree. The emergence of this structurally
autonomous sphere is associated with major political and social events in the
state-society relationship. Cluster analysis reveals multiple internal
components within this sphere that share similar levels of network influence.
Rather than a core-periphery structure centered around government officials,
the Chinese non-profit world appears to be a multipolar one of distinct elite
groups, many of which achieve high levels of independence from direct
government control.

 <dc:description>  Top-$N$ recommender systems have been extensively studied. However, the
sparsity of user-item activities has not been well resolved. While many hybrid
systems were proposed to address the cold-start problem, the profile
information has not been sufficiently leveraged. Furthermore, the heterogeneity
of profiles between users and items intensifies the challenge. In this paper,
we propose a content-based top-$N$ recommender system by learning the global
term weights in profiles. To achieve this, we bring in PathSim, which could
well measures the node similarity with heterogeneous relations (between users
and items). Starting from the original TF-IDF value, the global term weights
gradually converge, and eventually reflect both profile and activity
information. To facilitate training, the derivative is reformulated into matrix
form, which could easily be paralleled. We conduct extensive experiments, which
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

 <dc:title>Can Turing machine be curious about its Turing test results? Three
  informal lectures on physics of intelligence</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ushveridze, Alex</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  What is the nature of curiosity? Is there any scientific way to understand
the origin of this mysterious force that drives the behavior of even the
stupidest naturally intelligent systems and is completely absent in their
smartest artificial analogs? Can we build AI systems that could be curious
about something, systems that would have an intrinsic motivation to learn? Is
such a motivation quantifiable? Is it implementable? I will discuss this
problem from the standpoint of physics. The relationship between physics and
intelligence is a consequence of the fact that correctly predicted information
is nothing but an energy resource, and the process of thinking can be viewed as
a process of accumulating and spending this resource through the acts of
perception and, respectively, decision making. The natural motivation of any
autonomous system to keep this accumulation/spending balance as high as
possible allows one to treat the problem of describing the dynamics of thinking
processes as a resource optimization problem. Here I will propose and discuss a
simple theoretical model of such an autonomous system which I call the
Autonomous Turing Machine (ATM). The potential attractiveness of ATM lies in
the fact that it is the model of a self-propelled AI for which the only
available energy resource is the information itself. For ATM, the problem of
optimal thinking, learning, and decision-making becomes conceptually simple and
mathematically well tractable. This circumstance makes the ATM an ideal
playground for studying the dynamics of intelligent behavior and allows one to
quantify many seemingly unquantifiable features of genuine intelligence.

with a fragment of fairness assumptions and then extend the algorithm to handle
arbitrary %fairness assumptions ones. Notably, by making use of some syntactic
transformations, our algorithm avoids to construct corresponding B\&quot;uchi

practice. We implement our algorithm in NuSMV and consider a large selection of
formulas. Our experiments show that in many cases our approach exceeds the
automata-theoretic approach up to several orders of magnitude, in both time and

recommendation task. The models showed promising improvements over traditional
recommendation approaches. In this work, we further study RNN-based models for
session-based recommendations. We propose the application of two techniques to
improve model performance, namely, data augmentation, and a method to account
for shifts in the input data distribution. We also empirically study the use of
generalised distillation, and a novel alternative model that directly predicts
item embeddings. Experiments on the RecSys Challenge 2015 dataset demonstrate
relative improvements of 12.8% and 14.8% over previously reported results on
the Recall@20 and Mean Reciprocal Rank@20 metrics respectively.

 <dc:description>  We solve a sum rate maximization problem of full-duplex (FD) multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Since additional
self-interference (SI) in the uplink channel and co-channel interference (CCI)
in the downlink channel are coupled in FD communication, the downlink and
uplink multiuser beamforming vectors are required to be jointly designed.
However, the joint optimization problem is non-convex and hard to solve due to
the coupled effect. To properly address the coupled design issue, we
reformulate the problem into an equivalent uplink channel problem, using the
uplink and downlink channel duality known as MAC-BC duality. Then, using
minorization maximization (MM) algorithm based on an affine approximation, we
obtain a solution for the reformulated problem. In addition, without any
approximation and thus performance degradation, we develop an alternating
algorithm based on iterative water-filling (IWF) to solve the non-convex
problem. The proposed algorithms warrant fast convergence and low computational
complexity.

 <dc:description>  To appear in the proceedings of LPAR 21.
  Solving complex problems can involve non-trivial combinations of distinct
knowledge bases and problem solvers. The Algebra of Modular Systems is a
knowledge representation framework that provides a method for formally
specifying such systems in purely semantic terms. Formally, an expression of
the algebra defines a class of structures. Many expressive formalism used in
practice solve the model expansion task, where a structure is given on the
input and an expansion of this structure in the defined class of structures is
searched (this practice overcomes the common undecidability problem for
expressive logics). In this paper, we construct a solver for the model
expansion task for a complex modular systems from an expression in the algebra
and black-box propagators or solvers for the primitive modules. To this end, we
define a general notion of propagators equipped with an explanation mechanism,
an extension of the alge- bra to propagators, and a lazy conflict-driven
learning algorithm. The result is a framework for seamlessly combining solving

 <dc:description>  People's behavior on online social networks, which store geo-tagged
information showing where people were or are at the moment, can provide
information about their offline life as well. In this paper we present one
possible research direction that can be taken using Flickr dataset of publicly
available geo-tagged media objects (e.g., photographs, videos). Namely, our
focus is on investigating attractiveness of countries or smaller large-scale
composite regions (e.g., US states) for foreign visitors where attractiveness
is defined as the absolute number of media objects taken in a certain state or
country by its foreign visitors compared to its population size. We also
consider it together with attractiveness of the destination for the
international migration, measured through publicly available dataset provided
by United Nations. By having those two datasets, we are able to look at
attractiveness from two different perspectives: short-term and long-term one.
As our previous study showed that city attractiveness for Spanish cities
follows a superlinear trend, here we want to see if the same law is also
applicable to country/state (i.e., composite regions) attractiveness. Finally,
we provide one possible explanation for the obtained results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a concrete algorithm for phase retrieval, which we
refer to as Gauss-Newton algorithm. In short, this algorithm starts with a good
initial estimation, which is obtained by a modified spectral method, and then
update the iteration point by a Gauss-Newton iteration step. We prove that a
re-sampled version of this algorithm quadratically converges to the solution
for the real case with the number of random measurements being nearly minimal.
Numerical experiments also show that Gauss-Newton method has better performance
over the other algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In an age of exponentially increasing data generation, performing inference
tasks by utilizing the available information in its entirety is not always an
affordable option. The present paper puts forth approaches to render tracking
of large-scale dynamic processes via a Kalman filter affordable, by processing
a reduced number of data. Three distinct methods are introduced for reducing
the number of data involved in the correction step of the filter. Towards this
goal, the first two methods employ random projections and innovation-based
censoring to effect dimensionality reduction and measurement selection
respectively. The third method achieves reduced complexity by leveraging
sequential processing of observations and selecting a few informative updates
based on an information-theoretic metric. Simulations on synthetic data,
compare the proposed methods with competing alternatives, and corroborate their
efficacy in terms of estimation accuracy over complexity reduction. Finally,
monitoring large networks is considered as an application domain, with the
proposed methods tested on Kronecker graphs to evaluate their efficiency in
tracking traffic matrices and time-varying link costs.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge bases of real-world facts about entities and their relationships
are useful resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks.
However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be
able to perform link prediction or knowledge base completion, i.e., predict
whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This
paper combines insights from several previous link prediction models into a new
embedding model STransE that represents each entity as a low-dimensional
vector, and each relation by two matrices and a translation vector. STransE is
a simple combination of the SE and TransE models, but it obtains better link
prediction performance on two benchmark datasets than previous embedding
models. Thus, STransE can serve as a new baseline for the more complex models
in the link prediction task.

 <dc:description>  Given an $n*n$ sparse symmetric matrix with $m$ nonzero entries, performing
Gaussian elimination may turn some zeroes into nonzero values. To maintain the
matrix sparse, we would like to minimize the number $k$ of these changes, hence
called the minimum fill-in problem. Agrawal et al.~[FOCS'90] developed the
first approximation algorithm, based on early heuristics by George [SIAM J
Numer Anal 10] and by Lipton et al.~[SIAM J Numer Anal 16]. The objective
function they used is $m+k$, the number of nonzero elements after elimination.
An approximation algorithm using $k$ as the objective function was presented by
Natanzon et al.~[STOC'98]. These two versions are incomparable in terms of
approximation.
  Parameterized algorithms for the problem was first studied by Kaplan et
al.~[FOCS'94]. Fomin &amp; Villanger [SODA'12] recently gave an algorithm running
in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)}+n^{O(1)}$.
  Hardness results of this problem are surprisingly scarce, and the few known
ones are either weak or have to use nonstandard complexity conjectures. The
only inapproximability result by Wu et al.~[IJCAI'15] applies to only the
objective function $m+k$, and is grounded on the Small Set Expansion
Conjecture. The only nontrivial parameterized lower bounds, by Bliznets et
al.~[SODA'16], include a very weak one based on ETH, and a strong one based on
hardness of subexponential-time approximation of the minimum bisection problem
on regular graphs. For both versions of the problem, we exclude the existence
of PTASs, assuming P$\ne$NP, and the existence of $2^{O(n^{1-\delta})}$-time
approximation schemes for any positive $\delta$, assuming ETH. It also implies
a $2^{O(k^{1/2-\delta})} n^{O(1)}$ parameterized lower bound. Behind these
results is a new reduction from vertex cover, which might be of its own
interest: All previous reductions for similar problems are from some kind of
graph layout problems.

 <dc:title>Compiler-Assisted Workload Consolidation For Efficient Dynamic
  Parallelism on GPU</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  GPUs have been widely used to accelerate computations exhibiting simple
patterns of parallelism - such as flat or two-level parallelism - and a degree
of parallelism that can be statically determined based on the size of the input
dataset. However, the effective use of GPUs for algorithms exhibiting complex
patterns of parallelism, possibly known only at runtime, is still an open
problem. Recently, Nvidia has introduced Dynamic Parallelism (DP) in its GPUs.
By making it possible to launch kernels directly from GPU threads, this feature
enables nested parallelism at runtime. However, the effective use of DP must
still be understood: a naive use of this feature may suffer from significant
runtime overhead and lead to GPU underutilization, resulting in poor
performance. In this work, we target this problem. First, we demonstrate how a
naive use of DP can result in poor performance. Second, we propose three
workload consolidation schemes to improve performance and hardware utilization
of DP-based codes, and we implement these code transformations in a
directive-based compiler. Finally, we evaluate our framework on two categories
of applications: algorithms including irregular loops and algorithms exhibiting
parallel recursion. Our experiments show that our approach significantly
reduces runtime overhead and improves GPU utilization, leading to speedup
factors from 90x to 3300x over basic DP-based solutions and speedups from 2x to
6x over flat implementations.

 <dc:description>  The accelerated growth of mobile trajectories in location-based services
brings valuable data resources to understand users' moving behaviors. Apart
from recording the trajectory data, another major characteristic of these
location-based services is that they also allow the users to connect whomever
they like. A combination of social networking and location-based services is
called as location-based social networks (LBSN). As shown in previous works,
locations that are frequently visited by socially-related persons tend to be
correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections
and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. In order to better analyze and mine
LBSN data, we present a novel neural network model which can joint model both
social networks and mobile trajectories. In specific, our model consists of two
components: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile
trajectories. We first adopt a network embedding method for the construction of
social networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key
of our model lies in the component of generating mobile trajectories. We have
considered four factors that influence the generation process of mobile
trajectories, namely user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term
sequential contexts and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last
two contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential
relatedness in mobile trajectories at different levels, i.e., short term or
long term. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network
representations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate
the effectiveness of our model. Especially, the improvement over baselines is
more significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse.

 <dc:title>Efficient Dynamic Pinning of Parallelized Applications by Distributed
  Reinforcement Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chasparis, Georgios C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rossbory, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a resource allocation framework specifically tailored
for addressing the problem of dynamic placement (or pinning) of parallelized
applications to processing units. Under the proposed setup each thread of the
parallelized application constitutes an independent decision maker (or agent),
which (based on its own prior performance measurements and its own prior
CPU-affinities) decides on which processing unit to run next. Decisions are
updated recursively for each thread by a resource manager/scheduler which runs
in parallel to the application's threads and periodically records their
performances and assigns to them new CPU affinities. For updating the
CPU-affinities, the scheduler uses a distributed reinforcement-learning
algorithm, each branch of which is responsible for assigning a new placement
strategy to each thread. According to this algorithm, prior allocations are
going to be reinforced in the future proportionally to their prior performance.
The proposed resource allocation framework is flexible enough to address
alternative optimization criteria, such as maximum average processing speed and
minimum speed variance among threads. We demonstrate analytically that
convergence to locally-optimal placements is achieved asymptotically. Finally,
we validate these results through experiments in Linux platforms.

 <dc:description>  Information foraging connects optimal foraging theory in ecology with how
humans search for information. The theory suggests that, following an
information scent, the information seeker must optimize the tradeoff between
exploration by repeated steps in the search space vs. exploitation, using the
resources encountered. We conjecture that this tradeoff characterizes how a
user deals with uncertainty and its two aspects, risk and ambiguity in economic
theory. Risk is related to the perceived quality of the actually visited patch
of information, and can be reduced by exploiting and understanding the patch to
a better extent. Ambiguity, on the other hand, is the opportunity cost of
having higher quality patches elsewhere in the search space. The aforementioned
tradeoff depends on many attributes, including traits of the user: at the two
extreme ends of the spectrum, analytic and wholistic searchers employ entirely
different strategies. The former type focuses on exploitation first,
interspersed with bouts of exploration, whereas the latter type prefers to
explore the search space first and consume later. Based on an eye-tracking
study of experts' interactions with novel search interfaces in the biomedical
domain, we demonstrate that perceived risk shifts the balance between
exploration and exploitation in either type of users, tilting it against vs. in
favour of ambiguity minimization. Since the pattern of behaviour in information
foraging is quintessentially sequential, risk and ambiguity minimization cannot
happen simultaneously, leading to a fundamental limit on how good such a
tradeoff can be. This in turn connects information seeking with the emergent
field of quantum decision theory.

 <dc:description>  We propose an informative path planning (IPP) algorithm for active
classification using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), focusing on weed
detection in precision agriculture. We model the presence of weeds on farmland
using an occupancy grid and generate plans according to information-theoretic
objectives, enabling the UAV to gather data efficiently. We use a combination
of global viewpoint selection and evolutionary optimization to refine the UAV's
trajectory in continuous space while satisfying dynamic constraints. We
validate our approach in simulation by comparing against standard &quot;lawnmower&quot;
coverage, and study the effects of varying objectives and optimization
strategies. We plan to evaluate our algorithm on a real platform in the
immediate future.

 <dc:title>Supervised learning based on temporal coding in spiking neural networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mostafa, Hesham</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Gradient descent training techniques are remarkably successful in training
analog-valued artificial neural networks (ANNs). Such training techniques,
however, do not transfer easily to spiking networks due to the spike generation
hard non-linearity and the discrete nature of spike communication. We show that
in a feedforward spiking network that uses a temporal coding scheme where
information is encoded in spike times instead of spike rates, the network
input-output relation is differentiable almost everywhere. Moreover, this
relation is piece-wise linear after a transformation of variables. Methods for
training ANNs thus carry directly to the training of such spiking networks as
we show when training on the permutation invariant MNIST task. In contrast to
rate-based spiking networks that are often used to approximate the behavior of
ANNs, the networks we present spike much more sparsely and their behavior can
not be directly approximated by conventional ANNs. Our results highlight a new
approach for controlling the behavior of spiking networks with realistic
temporal dynamics, opening up the potential for using these networks to process

 <dc:description>  People are observed to assortatively connect on a set of traits. This
phenomenon, termed assortative mixing or sometimes homophily, can be quantified
through assortativity coefficient in social networks. Uncovering the exact
causes of strong assortative mixing found in social networks has been a
research challenge. Among the main suggested causes from sociology are the
tendency of similar individuals to connect (often itself referred as homophily)
and the social influence among already connected individuals. An important
question to researchers and in practice can be tackled, as we present here:
understanding the exact mechanisms of interplay between these tendencies and
the underlying social network structure. Namely, in addition to the mentioned
assortativity coefficient, there are several other static and temporal network
properties and substructures that can be linked to the tendencies of homophily
and social influence in the social network and we herein investigate those.
Concretely, we tackle a computer-mediated \textit{communication network} (based
on Twitter mentions) and a particular type of assortative mixing that can be
inferred from the semantic features of communication content that we term
\textit{semantic homophily}. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the
first to offer an in-depth analysis on semantic homophily in a communication
network and the interplay between them. We quantify diverse levels of semantic
homophily, identify the semantic aspects that are the drivers of observed
homophily, show insights in its temporal evolution and finally, we present its
intricate interplay with the communication network on Twitter. By analyzing
these mechanisms we increase understanding on what are the semantic aspects
that shape and how they shape the human computer-mediated communication.

 <dc:description>  In this work we consider a flow network for which the goal is to solve a
practical optimal regulation problem in the presence of input saturation. Based
on Lyapunov arguments we propose distributed controllers which guarantee global
convergence to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the desired optimal steady
state while fulfilling the constraints. As a case study we apply our
distributed controller to a district heating network.

 <dc:description>  The goal of this paper is to prove that several variants of deciding whether
a poset can be (weakly) embedded into a small Boolean lattice, or to a few
consecutive levels of a Boolean lattice, are NP-complete, answering a question
of Griggs and of Patkos. As an equivalent reformulation of one of these
problems, we also derive that it is NP-complete to decide whether a given graph
can be embedded to the two middle levels of some hypercube.

 <dc:title>Wireless Coded Caching: A Topological Perspective</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Jingjing</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Elia, Petros</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We explore the performance of coded caching in a SISO BC setting where some
users have higher link capacities than others. Focusing on a binary and fixed
topological model where strong links have a fixed normalized capacity 1, and
where weak links have reduced normalized capacity $\tau&lt;1$, we identify --- as
a function of the cache size and $\tau$ --- the optimal throughput performance,
within a factor of at most 8. The transmission scheme that achieves this
performance, employs a simple form of interference enhancement, and exploits
the property that weak links attenuate interference, thus allowing for
multicasting rates to remain high even when involving weak users. This approach
ameliorates the negative effects of uneven topology in multicasting, now
allowing all users to achieve the optimal performance associated to $\tau=1$,
even if $\tau$ is approximately as low as $\tau\geq 1-(1-w)^g$ where $g$ is the
coded-caching gain, and where $w$ is the fraction of users that are weak. This
leads to the interesting conclusion that for coded multicasting, the weak users
need not bring down the performance of all users, but on the contrary to a
certain extent, the strong users can lift the performance of the weak users
without any penalties on their own performance. Furthermore for smaller ranges
of $\tau$, we also see that achieving the near-optimal performance comes with
the advantage that the strong users do not suffer any additional delays
compared to the case where $\tau = 1$.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for the visualization of directed networks relying on
the eigenfunctions of the magnetic Laplacian, called here Magnetic Eigenmaps.
The magnetic Laplacian is a complex deformation of the well-known combinatorial
Laplacian. Features such as density of links and directionality patterns are
revealed by plotting the phases of the first magnetic eigenvectors. An
interpretation of the magnetic eigenvectors is given in connection with the
angular synchronization problem. Illustrations of our method are given for both
artificial and real networks.

 <dc:description>  Existing corpora for intrinsic evaluation are not targeted towards tasks in

whether a representation of informal words fulfills the promise of eliding
explicit text normalization as a preprocessing step. One possible evaluation
metric for such domains is the proximity of spelling variants. We propose how
such a metric might be computed and how a spelling variant dataset can be

 <dc:description>  Longest common extension queries (LCE queries) and runs are ubiquitous in
algorithmic stringology. Linear-time algorithms computing runs and
preprocessing for constant-time LCE queries have been known for over a decade.
However, these algorithms assume a linearly-sortable integer alphabet. A recent
breakthrough paper by Bannai et.\ al.\ (SODA 2015) showed a link between the
two notions: all the runs in a string can be computed via a linear number of
LCE queries. The first to consider these problems over a general ordered
alphabet was Kosolobov (\emph{Inf.\ Process.\ Lett.}, 2016), who presented an
$O(n (\log n)^{2/3})$-time algorithm for answering $O(n)$ LCE queries. This
result was improved by Gawrychowski et.\ al.\ (accepted to CPM 2016) to $O(n
\log \log n)$ time. In this work we note a special \emph{non-crossing} property
of LCE queries asked in the runs computation. We show that any $n$ such
non-crossing queries can be answered on-line in $O(n \alpha(n))$ time, which
yields an $O(n \alpha(n))$-time algorithm for computing runs.

 <dc:title>Coordinated Broadcast-based Request-Reply and Group Management for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  As the domain of cyber-physical systems continues to grow, an increasing
number of tightly-coupled distributed applications will be implemented on top
of wireless networking technologies. Some of these applications, including
collaborative robotic teams, work in a coordinated fashion, whereby a
distinguished node takes control decisions and sends commands to other nodes,
which in turn perform the requested action/operation and send back a
reply/acknowledgment. The implementation of such interactions via reliable
point-to-point flows may lead to a significant performance degradation due to
collisions, especially when the system operates close to the capacity of the
communication channel. We propose a coordinated protocol which exploits the
broadcast nature of the wireless medium in order to support this
application-level interaction with a minimal number of message transmissions
and predictable latency. The protocol also comes with group management
functionality, allowing new processes to join and existing processes to leave
the group in a controlled way. We evaluate a prototype implementation over
WiFi, using a simulated setup as well as a physical testbed. Our results show
that the proposed protocol can achieve significantly better performance
compared to point-to- point approaches, and remains fully predictable and
dependable even when operating close to the wireless channel capacity.

 <dc:description>  We study weakest precondition reasoning about the (co)variance of outcomes
and the variance of run-times of probabilistic programs with conditioning. For
outcomes, we show that approximating (co)variances is computationally more
difficult than approximating expected values. In particular, we prove that
computing both lower and upper bounds for (co)variances is
$\Sigma^{0}_{2}$-complete. As a consequence, neither lower nor upper bounds are
computably enumerable. We therefore present invariant-based techniques that do
enable enumeration of both upper and lower bounds, once appropriate invariants
are found. Finally, we extend this approach to reasoning about run-time
variances.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an out-of-sample extension framework for a global
manifold learning algorithm (Isomap) that uses temporal information in
out-of-sample points in order to make the embedding more robust to noise and
artifacts. Given a set of noise-free training data and its embedding, the
proposed framework extends the embedding for a noisy time series. This is
achieved by adding a spatio-temporal compactness term to the optimization
objective of the embedding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
method for out-of-sample extension of manifold embeddings that leverages timing
information available for the extension set. Experimental results demonstrate
that our out-of-sample extension algorithm renders a more robust and accurate
embedding of sequentially ordered image data in the presence of various noise
and artifacts when compared to other timing-aware embeddings. Additionally, we
show that an out-of-sample extension framework based on the proposed algorithm
outperforms the state of the art in eye-gaze estimation.

to be more comprehensible to the radiologist reviewing screening breast MRI

uses a rule-extraction algorithm to present lesion classification results in an

 <dc:description>  Analyzing the achievable rate of molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD)
inherits intricacies due to its nature: MCvD channel has memory, and the heavy
tail of the signal causes inter symbol interference (ISI). Therefore, using
Shannon's channel capacity formulation for memoryless channel is not
appropriate for the MCvD channel. Instead, a more general achievable rate
formulation and system model must be considered to make this analysis
accurately. In this letter, we propose an effective ISI-aware MCvD modeling
technique in 3-D medium and properly analyze the achievable rate.

 <dc:description>  In this work we study the statistical model of source localization based on
Range Difference measurements. We investigate the case of planar localization
of a source using a minimal configuration of three non aligned receivers. Our
analysis is based on a previous work of the same authors concerning the
localization in a noiseless scenario. As the set of feasible measurements is a
semialgebraic variety, this investigation makes use of techniques from
Algebraic Statistics and Information Geometry.

 <dc:title>Depth Estimation from Single Image using Sparse Representations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Oktar, Yigit</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Monocular depth estimation is an interesting and challenging problem as there
is no analytic mapping known between an intensity image and its depth map.
Recently there has been a lot of data accumulated through depth-sensing
cameras, in parallel to that researchers started to tackle this task using
various learning algorithms. In this paper, a deep sparse coding method is
proposed for monocular depth estimation along with an approach for
deterministic dictionary initialization.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a filtering algorithm for simultaneously estimating
the mode, input and state of hidden mode switched linear stochastic systems
with unknown inputs. Using a multiple-model approach with a bank of linear
input and state filters for each mode, our algorithm relies on the ability to
find the most probable model as a mode estimate, which we show is possible with
input and state filters by identifying a key property, that a particular
residual signal we call generalized innovation is a Gaussian white noise. We
also provide an asymptotic analysis for the proposed algorithm and provide
sufficient conditions for asymptotically achieving convergence to the true
model (consistency), or to the 'closest' model according to an
information-theoretic measure (convergence). A simulation example of
intention-aware vehicles at an intersection is given to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  To better understand the flows of ideas or information through social and
biological systems, researchers develop maps that reveal important patterns in
network flows. In practice, network flow models have implied memoryless
first-order Markov chains, but recently researchers have introduced
higher-order Markov chain models with memory to capture patterns in multi-step
pathways. Higher-order models are particularly important for effectively
revealing actual, overlapping community structure, but higher-order Markov
chain models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: their vast parameter
spaces require exponentially increasing data to avoid overfitting and therefore
make mapping inefficient already for moderate-sized systems. To overcome this
problem, we introduce an efficient cross-validated mapping approach based on
network flows modeled by sparse Markov chains. To illustrate our approach, we
present a map of citation flows in science with research fields that overlap in
multidisciplinary journals. Compared with currently used categories in science
of science studies, the research fields form better units of analysis because
the map more effectively captures how ideas flow through science.

 <dc:description>  A true lie is a lie that becomes true when announced. In a logic of
announcements, where the announcing agent is not modelled, a true lie is a
formula (that is false and) that becomes true when announced. We investigate
true lies and other types of interaction between announced formulas, their
preconditions and their postconditions, in the setting of Gerbrandy's logic of
believed announcements, wherein agents may have or obtain incorrect beliefs.
Our results are on the satisfiability and validity of instantiations of these
semantically defined categories, on iterated announcements, including
arbitrarily often iterated announcements, and on syntactic characterization. We
close with results for iterated announcements in the logic of knowledge
(instead of belief), and for lying as private announcements (instead of public
announcements) to different agents. Detailed examples illustrate our lying
concepts.

 <dc:description>  We consider incorporating topic information into the sequence-to-sequence
framework to generate informative and interesting responses for chatbots. To
this end, we propose a topic aware sequence-to-sequence (TA-Seq2Seq) model. The
model utilizes topics to simulate prior knowledge of human that guides them to
form informative and interesting responses in conversation, and leverages the
topic information in generation by a joint attention mechanism and a biased
generation probability. The joint attention mechanism summarizes the hidden
vectors of an input message as context vectors by message attention,
synthesizes topic vectors by topic attention from the topic words of the
message obtained from a pre-trained LDA model, and let these vectors jointly
affect the generation of words in decoding. To increase the possibility of
topic words appearing in responses, the model modifies the generation
probability of topic words by adding an extra probability item to bias the
overall distribution. Empirical study on both automatic evaluation metrics and
human annotations shows that TA-Seq2Seq can generate more informative and
interesting responses, and significantly outperform the-state-of-the-art
response generation models.

 <dc:description>  This paper is devoted to the problem of finding characterizations for Cayley
automatic groups. The concept of Cayley automatic groups was recently
introduced by Kharlampovich, Khoussainov and Miasnikov. We address this problem
by introducing three numerical characteristics of Turing transducers: growth
functions, Folner functions and average length growth functions. These three
numerical characteristics are the analogs of growth functions, Folner functions
and drifts of simple random walks for Cayley graphs of groups. We study these
numerical characteristics for Turing transducers obtained from automatic
presentations of labeled directed graphs.

 <dc:description>  Methods based on representation learning currently hold the state-of-the-art
in many natural language processing and knowledge base inference tasks. Yet, a
major challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge into
such models. A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations
by propositionalization of first-order logic rules. However,
propositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few entities and
rules. In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating
implication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base
construction. We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean
space and encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on
implication rules mined from WordNet. Surprisingly, we find that the strong
restriction of the entity-tuple embedding space does not hurt the
expressiveness of the model and even acts as a regularizer that improves
generalization. By incorporating few commonsense rules, we achieve an increase
of 2 percentage points mean average precision over a matrix factorization
baseline, while observing a negligible increase in runtime.

 <dc:description>  A function $f: \mathbb{Z}_+^E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ is DR-submodular if
it satisfies $f(\bx + \chi_i) -f (\bx) \ge f(\by + \chi_i) - f(\by)$ for all
$\bx\le \by, i\in E$. Recently, the problem of maximizing a DR-submodular
function $f: \mathbb{Z}_+^E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ subject to a budget
constraint $\|\bx\|_1 \leq B$ as well as additional constraints has received
significant attention \cite{SKIK14,SY15,MYK15,SY16}.
  In this note, we give a generic reduction from the DR-submodular setting to
the submodular setting. The running time of the reduction and the size of the
resulting submodular instance depends only \emph{logarithmically} on $B$. Using
this reduction, one can translate the results for unconstrained and constrained
submodular maximization to the DR-submodular setting for many types of
constraints in a unified manner.

 <dc:description>  Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) was designed to provide reliable
wireless communication for intelligent transportation system applications.
Sharing information among cars and between cars and the infrastructure,
pedestrians, or &quot;the cloud&quot; has great potential to improve safety, mobility and
fuel economy. DSRC is being considered by the US Department of Transportation
to be required for ground vehicles. In the past, their performance has been
assessed thoroughly in the labs and limited field testing, but not on a large
fleet. In this paper, we present the analysis of DSRC performance using data
from the world's largest connected vehicle test program - Safety Pilot Model
Deployment lead by the University of Michigan. We first investigate their
maximum and effective range, and then study the effect of environmental
factors, such as trees/foliage, weather, buildings, vehicle travel direction,
and road elevation. The results can be used to guide future DSRC equipment
placement and installation, and can be used to develop DSRC communication
models for numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  Memristive nanodevices offer new frontiers for computing systems that unite
arithmetic and memory operations on-chip. Here, we explore the integration of
electrochemical metallization cell (ECM) nanodevices with tunable filamentary
switching in nanoscale learning systems. Such devices offer a natural
transition between short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP).
In this work, we show that this property can be exploited to efficiently solve
noisy classification tasks. A single crossbar learning scheme is first
introduced and evaluated. Perfect classification is possible only for simple
input patterns, within critical timing parameters, and when device variability
is weak. To overcome these limitations, a dual-crossbar learning system partly
inspired by the extreme learning machine (ELM) approach is then introduced.
This approach outperforms a conventional ELM-inspired system when the first
layer is imprinted before training and testing, and especially so when
variability in device timing evolution is considered: variability is therefore
transformed from an issue to a feature. In attempting to classify the MNIST
database under the same conditions, conventional ELM obtains 84%
classification, the imprinted, uniform device system obtains 88%
classification, and the imprinted, variable device system reaches 92%
classification. We discuss benefits and drawbacks of both systems in terms of
energy, complexity, area imprint, and speed. All these results highlight that
tuning and exploiting intrinsic device timing parameters may be of central
interest to future bio-inspired approximate computing systems.

 <dc:description>  We consider the full-duplex (FD) two-way amplify-and-forward relay system
with imperfect cancelation of loopback self-interference (SI) and investigate
joint design of relay and receive beamforming for minimizing the mean square
error under a relay transmit power constraint. Due to loopback channel
estimation error and limitation of analog-to-digital converter, the loopback SI
cannot be completely canceled. Multiple antennas at the relay can help loopback
SI suppression but beamforming is required to balance between the residual SI
suppression and the desired signal transmission. Moreover, the relay
beamforming matrix should be updated every time slot because the residual SI in
the previous time slot is amplified by the current beamforming matrix and added
to the received signals from the two sources in the current time slot. We
derive the optimally balanced relay beamforming and receive beamforming
matrices in closed form based on minimum mean square error, taking into account
the propagation of the residual loopback SI from the first to the current time
slot. We also propose beamforming design using only the channels of the m

results, we also identify when FD is beneficial and propose selection between
FD and half-duplex according to signal-to-noise ratio and interference-to-noise
ratio.

 <dc:title>Mitigating Data Exfiltration in Storage-as-a-Service Clouds</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Existing processes and methods for incident handling are geared towards
infrastructures and operational models that will be increasingly outdated by
cloud computing. Research has shown that to adapt incident handling to cloud
computing environments, cloud customers must establish clarity about their
requirements on Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) for successful handling of
incidents and contract CSPs accordingly. Secondly, CSPs must strive to support
these requirements and mirror them in their Service Level Agreements. Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS) have been used widely to detect malicious behaviors in
network communication and hosts. Facing new application scenarios in Cloud
Computing, the IDS approaches yield several problems since the operator of the
IDS should be the user, not the administrator of the Cloud infrastructure.
Cloud providers need to enable possibilities to deploy and configure IDS for
the user - which poses its own challenges. Current research and commercial
solutions primarily focus on protecting against Denial of Service attacks and
attacks against the Cloud's virtual infrastructure. To counter these
challenges, we propose a capability that aims to both detect and prevent the
potential of data exfiltration by using a novel deception-based methodology. We
also introduce a method of increasing the data protection level based on
various threat conditions.

 <dc:description>  Visual question answering (VQA) is an interesting learning setting for
evaluating the abilities and shortcomings of current systems for image
understanding. Many of the recently proposed VQA systems include attention or
memory mechanisms designed to support &quot;reasoning&quot;. For multiple-choice VQA,
nearly all of these systems train a multi-class classifier on image and
question features to predict an answer. This paper questions the value of these
common practices and develops a simple alternative model based on binary
classification. Instead of treating answers as competing choices, our model
receives the answer as input and predicts whether or not an
image-question-answer triplet is correct. We evaluate our model on the Visual7W
Telling and the VQA Real Multiple Choice tasks, and find that even simple
versions of our model perform competitively. Our best model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Visual7W Telling task and compares
surprisingly well with the most complex systems proposed for the VQA Real
Multiple Choice task. We explore variants of the model and study its
transferability between both datasets. We also present an error analysis of our
model that suggests a key problem of current VQA systems lies in the lack of
visual grounding of concepts that occur in the questions and answers. Overall,
our results suggest that the performance of current VQA systems is not
significantly better than that of systems designed to exploit dataset biases.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we investigate the so-called antenna domain formation problem,
as the optimal assignment of users to antenna domains, in cloud radio access
networks. We focus on theoretical aspects of the problem, namely, the finding
of lower bounds, on the interference leakage in the network. We formulate the
antenna domain formation problem as an integer optimization problem, and
propose an iterative algorithm for obtaining a solution. Motivated by the lack
of optimality guarantees on such solutions, we opt to find lower bounds on the
problem, and the resulting interference leakage in the network. We thus derive
the corresponding Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, formulate the dual problem, and
show that the former offers a tighter bound than the latter. We highlight the
fact that the bounds in question consist of linear problems with an exponential
number of variables, and adapt known methods aimed at solving them. In addition
to shedding light on the tightness of the bounds in question, our numerical
results show sum-rate gains of at least 200% (over a simple benchmark), in the
medium SNR region.

 <dc:description>  Solid-state memory is an essential component of the digital age. With
advancements in healthcare technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the
demand for ultra-dense, ultra-low-power memory is increasing. In this review,
we present a comprehensive perspective on the most notable approaches to the
fabrication of physically flexible memory devices. With the future goal of
replacing traditional mechanical hard disks with solid-state storage devices, a
fully flexible electronic system will need two basic devices: transistors and
nonvolatile memory. Transistors are used for logic operations and gating memory
arrays, while nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices are required for storing
information in the main memory and cache storage. Since the highest density of
transistors and storage structures is manifested in memories, the focus of this
review is flexible NVM. Flexible NVM components are discussed in terms of their
functionality, performance metrics, and reliability aspects, all of which are
critical components for NVM technology to be part of mainstream consumer
electronics, IoT, and advanced healthcare devices. Finally, flexible NVMs are
benchmarked and future prospects are provided.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Subarrays for Hybrid Precoding in Wideband mmWave MIMO Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Park, Sungwoo</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Hybrid analog/digital precoding architectures can address the trade-off
between achievable spectral efficiency and power consumption in large-scale
MIMO systems. This makes it a promising candidate for millimeter wave systems,
which require deploying large antenna arrays at both the transmitter and
receiver to guarantee sufficient received signal power. Most prior work on
hybrid precoding focused on narrowband channels and assumed fully-connected
hybrid architectures. MmWave systems, though, are expected to be wideband with
frequency selectivity. In this paper, a closed-form solution for
fully-connected OFDM-based hybrid analog/digital precoding is developed for
frequency selective mmWave systems. This solution is then extended to
partially-connected but fixed architectures in which each RF chain is connected
to a specific subset of the antennas. The derived solutions give insights into
how the hybrid subarray structures should be designed. Based on them, a novel
technique that dynamically constructs the hybrid subarrays based on the
long-term channel characteristics is developed. Simulation results show that
the proposed hybrid precoding solutions achieve spectral efficiencies close to
that obtained with fully-digital architectures in wideband mmWave channels.
Further, the results indicate that the developed dynamic subarray solution
outperforms the fixed hybrid subarray structures in various system and channel
conditions.

 <dc:description>  We tackle the blog recommendation problem in Tumblr for mobile users in this
paper. Blog recommendation is challenging since most mobile users would suffer
from the cold start when there are only a limited number of blogs followed by
the user. Specifically to address this problem in the mobile domain, we take
into account mobile apps, which typically provide rich information from the
users. Based on the assumption that the user interests can be reflected from
their app usage patterns, we propose to exploit the app usage data for
improving blog recommendation. Building on the state-of-the-art recommendation
framework, Factorization Machines (FM), we implement app-based FM that
integrates app usage data with the user-blog follow relations. In this approach
the blog recommendation is generated not only based on the blogs that the user
followed before, but also the apps that the user has often used. We demonstrate
in a series of experiments that app-based FM can outperform other alternative
approaches to a significant extent. Our experimental results also show that
exploiting app usage information is particularly effective for improving blog
recommendation quality for cold start users.

 <dc:description>  The Internet is smoothly migrating from an Internet of people towards an
Internet of Things (IoT). By 2020, it is expected to have 50 billion things
connected to the Internet. However, such a migration induces a strong level of
complexity when handling interoperability between the heterogeneous Inter- net
things, e.g., RFIDs (Radio Frequency Identification), mobile handheld devices,
and wireless sensors. In this context, a couple of standards have been already
set, e.g., IPv6, 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks),
and M2M (Machine to Machine communications). In this paper, we focus on the
integration of wireless sensor networks into IoT, and shed further light on the
subtleties of such integration. We present a real-world test bed deployment
where wireless sensors are used to control electrical appliances in a smart
building. Encountered problems are highlighted and suitable solutions are
presented.

 <dc:description>  The electricity grid is crucial to our lives. House- holds and institutions
count on it. In recent years, the sources of energy have become less and less
available and they are driving the price of electricity higher and higher. It
has been estimated that 40% of power is spent in residential and institutional
buildings. Most of this power is absorbed by space cooling and heating. In
modern buildings, the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system
is centralised and operated by a department usually called the central plant.
The central plant produces chilled water and steam that is then consumed by the
building AHUs (Air Handling Units) to maintain the buildings at a comfortable
temperature. However, the heating and cooling model does not take into account
human occupancy. The AHU within the building distributes air according to the
design parameters of the building ignoring the occupancy. As a matter of fact,
there is a potential for optimization lowering consumption to utilize energy
efficiently and also to be able to adapt to the changing cost of energy in a
micro-grid environment. This system makes it possible to reduce the consumption
when needed minimizing impact on the consumer. In this study, we will show,
through a set of studies conducted at the University of Houston, that there is
a potential for energy conservation and efficiency in both the buildings and
the central plant. We also present a strategy that can be undertaken to meet
this goal. This strategy, airflow monitoring and control, is tested in a
software simulation and the results are presented. This system enables the user
to control and monitor the temperature in the individual rooms according the
locals needs.

 <dc:title>The kernel method for lattice paths below a line of rational slope</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We analyse some enumerative and asymptotic properties of lattice paths below
a line of rational slope. We illustrate our approach with Dyck paths under a
line of slope $2/5$. This answers Knuth's problem #4 from his &quot;Flajolet
lecture&quot; during the conference &quot;Analysis of Algorithms&quot; (AofA'2014) in Paris in
June 2014. Our approach extends the work of Banderier and Flajolet for
asymptotics and enumeration of directed lattice paths to the case of generating
functions involving several dominant singularities, and has applications to a
full class of problems involving some &quot;periodicities&quot;. A key ingredient in the
proof is the generalization of an old trick by Knuth himself (for enumerating
permutations sortable by a stack), promoted by Flajolet and others as the
&quot;kernel method&quot;. All the corresponding generating functions are algebraic, and
they offer some new combinatorial identities, which can also be tackled in the
A=B spirit of Wilf-Zeilberger-Petkovsek. We show how to obtain similar results
for any rational slope. An interesting case is e.g. Dyck paths below the slope
$2/3$ (this corresponds to the so-called Duchon's club model), for which we
solve a conjecture related to the asymptotics of the area below such lattice
paths. Our work also gives access to lattice paths below an irrational slope
(e.g. Dyck paths below $y=x/\sqrt{2}$), a problem that we study in a companion
article.

 <dc:description>  We propose the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), a high-performing neural

transformation of a stochastic regularizer which randomly applies the identity
or zero map, combining the intuitions of dropout and zoneout while respecting

nonlinearities. We perform an empirical evaluation of the GELU nonlinearity
against the ReLU and ELU activations and find performance improvements across

 <dc:description>  The problem of accurately predicting relative reading difficulty across a set
of sentences arises in a number of important natural language applications,
such as finding and curating effective usage examples for intelligent language
tutoring systems. Yet while significant research has explored document- and
passage-level reading difficulty, the special challenges involved in assessing
aspects of readability for single sentences have received much less attention,
particularly when considering the role of surrounding passages. We introduce
and evaluate a novel approach for estimating the relative reading difficulty of
a set of sentences, with and without surrounding context. Using different sets
of lexical and grammatical features, we explore models for predicting pairwise
relative difficulty using logistic regression, and examine rankings generated
by aggregating pairwise difficulty labels using a Bayesian rating system to
form a final ranking. We also compare rankings derived for sentences assessed
with and without context, and find that contextual features can help predict
differences in relative difficulty judgments across these two conditions.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing together give us the ability to
sense, collect, process, and analyse data so we can use them to better
understand behaviours, habits, preferences and life patterns of users and lead
them to consume resources more efficiently. In such knowledge discovery
activities, privacy becomes a significant challenge due to the extremely
personal nature of the knowledge that can be derived from the data and the
potential risks involved. Therefore, understanding the privacy expectations and
preferences of stakeholders is an important task in the IoT domain. In this
paper, we review how privacy knowledge has been modelled and used in the past
in different domains. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate
past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their
applicability towards the IoT. Finally, we discuss major research challenges
and opportunities.

 <dc:description>  In the ordinary version of the pursuit-evasion game &quot;cops and robbers&quot;, a
team of cops and a robber occupy vertices of a graph and alternately move along
the graph's edges, with perfect information about each other. If a cop lands on
the robber, the cops win; if the robber can evade the cops indefinitely, he
wins. In the variant &quot;lazy cops and robbers&quot;, the cops may only choose one
member of their squad to make a move when it's their turn. The minimum number
of cops (respectively lazy cops) required to catch the robber is called the
&quot;cop number&quot; (resp. &quot;lazy cop number&quot;) of G and is denoted $c(G)$ (resp.
$c_L(G)$). Previous work by Beveridge at al. has shown that the Petersen graph
is the unique graph on ten vertices with $c(G)=3$, and all graphs on nine or
fewer vertices have $c(G)\leq 2$. (This was a self-contained mathematical proof
of a result found by computational search by Baird and Bonato.) In this
article, we prove a similar result for lazy cops, namely that the 3x3 rooks
graph ($K_3\square K_3$) is the unique graph on nine vertices which requires
three lazy cops, and a graph on eight or fewer vertices requires at most two
lazy cops.

 <dc:description>  For past several decades, research efforts in population modelling has proven
its efficacy in understanding the basic information about residential and
commercial areas, as well as for the purposes of planning, development and
improvement of the community as an eco-system. More or less, such efforts
assume static nature of population distribution, in turn limited by the current
ability to capture the dynamics of population change at a finer resolution of
space and time. Fast forward today, more and more people are becoming mobile,
traveling across borders impacting the nuts and bolts of our urban fabric.
Unfortunately, our current efforts are being surpassed by the need to capture
such transient population. It is becoming imperative to identify and define
them, as well as measure their dynamics and interconnectedness. In this work,
we intend to research urban population mobility patterns, gauge their transient
nature, and extend our knowledge of their visited locations. We plan to achieve
this by designing and developing novel methods and using VGI data that models
and characterizes transient population dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Word2vec is a popular family of algorithms for unsupervised training of dense
vector representations of words on large text corpuses. The resulting vectors
have been shown to capture semantic relationships among their corresponding
words, and have shown promise in reducing a number of natural language
processing (NLP) tasks to mathematical operations on these vectors. While
heretofore applications of word2vec have centered around vocabularies with a
few million words, wherein the vocabulary is the set of words for which vectors
are simultaneously trained, novel applications are emerging in areas outside of
NLP with vocabularies comprising several 100 million words. Existing word2vec
training systems are impractical for training such large vocabularies as they
either require that the vectors of all vocabulary words be stored in the memory
of a single server or suffer unacceptable training latency due to massive
network data transfer. In this paper, we present a novel distributed, parallel
training system that enables unprecedented practical training of vectors for
vocabularies with several 100 million words on a shared cluster of commodity
servers, using far less network traffic than the existing solutions. We
evaluate the proposed system on a benchmark dataset, showing that the quality
of vectors does not degrade relative to non-distributed training. Finally, for
several quarters, the system has been deployed for the purpose of matching
queries to ads in Gemini, the sponsored search advertising platform at Yahoo,
resulting in significant improvement of business metrics.

 <dc:description>  In the problem of matrix compressed sensing we aim to recover a low-rank
matrix from few of its element-wise linear projections. In this contribution we
analyze the asymptotic performance of a Bayes-optimal inference procedure for a
model where the matrix to be recovered is a product of random matrices. The
results that we obtain using the replica method describe the state evolution of
the recently introduced P-BiG-AMP algorithm. We show the existence of different
types of phase transitions, their implications for the solvability of the
problem, and we compare the results of the theoretical analysis to the
performance reached by P-BiG-AMP. Remarkably the asymptotic replica equations
for matrix compressed sensing are the same as those for a related but formally
different problem of matrix factorization.

 <dc:title>Symmetric and antisymmetric properties of solutions to kernel-based
  machine learning problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gnecco, Giorgio</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A particularly interesting instance of supervised learning with kernels is
when each training example is associated with two objects, as in pairwise
classification (Brunner et al., 2012), and in supervised learning of preference
relations (Herbrich et al., 1998). In these cases, one may want to embed
additional prior knowledge into the optimization problem associated with the
training of the learning machine, modeled, respectively, by the symmetry of its
optimal solution with respect to an exchange of order between the two objects,
and by its antisymmetry. Extending the approach proposed in (Brunner et al.,
2012) (where the only symmetric case was considered), we show, focusing on
support vector binary classification, how such embedding is possible through
the choice of a suitable pairwise kernel, which takes as inputs the individual
feature vectors and also the group feature vectors associated with the two
objects. We also prove that the symmetry/antisymmetry constraints still hold
when considering the sequence of suboptimal solutions generated by one version
of the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm, and we present
numerical results supporting the theoretical findings. We conclude discussing
extensions of the main results to support vector regression, to transductive
support vector machines, and to several kinds of graph kernels, including
diffusion kernels.

 <dc:description>  Information engines can use structured environments as a resource to generate
work by randomizing ordered inputs and leveraging the increased Shannon entropy
to transfer energy from a thermal reservoir to a work reservoir. We give a
broadly applicable expression for the work production of an information engine,
generally modeled as a memoryful channel that communicates inputs to outputs as
it interacts with an evolving environment. The expression establishes that an
information engine must have more than one memory state in order to leverage
input environment correlations. To emphasize this functioning, we designed an
information engine powered solely by temporal correlations and not by
statistical biases, as employed by previous engines. Key to this is the
engine's ability to synchronize---the engine automatically returns to a desired
dynamical phase when thrown into an unwanted, dissipative phase by corruptions
in the input---that is, by unanticipated environmental fluctuations. This
self-correcting mechanism is robust up to a critical level of corruption,
beyond which the system fails to act as an engine. We give explicit analytical
expressions for both work and critical corruption level and summarize engine
performance via a thermodynamic-function phase diagram over engine control
parameters. The results reveal a new thermodynamic mechanism based on
nonergodicity that underlies error correction as it operates to support
resilient engineered and biological systems.

 <dc:title>Determining the full weight distribution of any irreducible cyclic code
  over any finite field of dimension two</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vega, Gerardo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In coding theory, a very interesting problem (but at the same time, a very
difficult one) is to determine the weight distribution of a given code. This
problem is even more interesting for cyclic codes, and this is so, mainly
because they possess a rich algebraic structure, which can be utilized in a
variety of ways. For example, in Engineering Telecommunications, this structure
is commonly employed to design very efficient coding and decoding algorithms.
In this note, we are going to use a characterization of all semiprimitive
two-weight irreducible cyclic codes over any finite field, recently presented
in [8], in order to determine the full weight distribution of any irreducible
cyclic code over any finite field of dimension two. In fact, the relevance of
our results is that by means of them we can actually directly determine the
full weight distribution of any irreducible cyclic code, of dimension one or
two, just by knowing its length.

The dataset consists of questions generated through crowdsourcing and sentence
length answers that are drawn from the ten most prevalent topics in the English
Wikipedia. We introduce a corpus annotation scheme that enhances the generation
of large, diverse, and challenging datasets by explicitly aiming to reduce word
co-occurrences between the question and answers. Our annotation scheme is
composed of a series of crowdsourcing tasks with a view to more effectively
utilize crowdsourcing in the creation of question answering datasets in various
domains. Several systems are compared on the tasks of answer sentence selection
and answer triggering, providing strong baseline results for future work to
improve upon.

 <dc:description>  Although viral spreading processes taking place in networks are commonly
analyzed using Markovian models in which both the transmission and the recovery
times follow exponential distributions, empirical studies show that, in most
real scenarios, the distribution of these times are far from exponential. To
overcome this limitation, we first introduce a generalized spreading model that
allows transmission and recovery times to follow arbitrary distributions within
a given accuracy. In this context, we derive conditions for the generalized
spreading model to converge exponentially fast towards the infection-free
equilibrium with a given rate (in other words, to eradicate the viral spread)
without relying on mean-field approximations. Based on our results, we
illustrate how the particular shape of the transmission/recovery distribution
heavily influences the convergence rate. Therefore, modeling non-exponential
transmission/recovery times observed in realistic spreading processes via
exponential distributions can induce significant errors in the stability
analysis of the spreading dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Social networks enable users to freely communicate with each other and share
their recent news, ongoing activities or views about different topics. As a
result, they can be seen as a potentially viable source of information to
understand the current emerging topics/events. The ability to model emerging
topics is a substantial step to monitor and summarize the information
originating from social sources. Applying traditional methods for event
detection which are often proposed for processing large, formal and structured
documents, are less effective, due to the short length, noisiness and

 <dc:description>  Understanding human mobility is important for the development of intelligent
mobile service robots as it can provide prior knowledge and predictions of
human distribution for robot-assisted activities. In this paper, we propose a
probabilistic method to model human motion behaviors which is determined by
both internal and external factors in an indoor environment. While the internal
factors are represented by the individual preferences, aims and interests, the
external factors are indicated by the stimulation of the environment. We model
the randomness of human macro-level movement, e.g., the probability of visiting
a specific place and staying time, under the Bayesian framework, considering
the influence of both internal and external variables. We use two case studies
in a shopping mall and in a college student dorm building to show the
effectiveness of our proposed probabilistic human mobility model. Real
surveillance camera data are used to validate the proposed model together with
survey data in the case study of student dorm.

 <dc:description>  Relational logistic regression (RLR) is a representation of conditional
probability in terms of weighted formulae for modelling multi-relational data.
In this paper, we develop a learning algorithm for RLR models. Learning an RLR
model from data consists of two steps: 1- learning the set of formulae to be
used in the model (a.k.a. structure learning) and learning the weight of each
formula (a.k.a. parameter learning). For structure learning, we deploy Schmidt
and Murphy's hierarchical assumption: first we learn a model with simple
formulae, then more complex formulae are added iteratively only if all their
sub-formulae have proven effective in previous learned models. For parameter
learning, we convert the problem into a non-relational learning problem and use
an off-the-shelf logistic regression learning algorithm from Weka, an
open-source machine learning tool, to learn the weights. We also indicate how
hidden features about the individuals can be incorporated into RLR to boost the
learning performance. We compare our learning algorithm to other structure and
parameter learning algorithms in the literature, and compare the performance of
RLR models to standard logistic regression and RDN-Boost on a modified version
of the MovieLens data-set.

make up the graph, with the rankings to be evaluated against those of human
judges. While the Microsoft Academic Graph provided metadata about many aspects
of each scholarly document, we focused more narrowly on citation data and used
this contest as an opportunity to test the Article Level Eigenfactor (ALEF), a
novel citation-based ranking algorithm, and evaluate its performance against
competing algorithms that drew upon multiple facets of the data from a large,

 <dc:title>E-Embargoes: Discouraging the Deployment of Traffic Manipulating Boxes
  With Economic Incentives</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schuchard, Max</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An increasing number of systems have been proposed or deployed to the transit
core of the Internet with the goal of observing and manipulating traffic in
flight, systems we term Traffic Manipulating Boxes. Examples of these include:
decoy routing systems, surveillance infrastructure like the NSA's alleged
QUANTUM project, and traffic shaping middleboxes. In this work, we examine a
new approach that a routing capable adversary might take to resisting these
systems: the use of economic pressure to incentivize ISPs to remove them.
Rather than directly attacking the availability of these systems, our attack
inflicts economic losses, in the form of reduced transit revenue, on ISPs that
deploy them, while at the same time incentivizing ISPs that do not.
  We alter and expand upon previous routing around decoys attack of Schuchard
et al., by adjusting the priority given to avoiding TMBs. This reduces or
eliminates the key costs faced by routing capable adversary while maintaining
the effectiveness of the attack. Additionally, we show that since the flow of
traffic on the Internet is directly related to the flow of cash between ISPs, a
routing capable adversary is actually a powerful economic adversary. Our
findings show that by preferentially using routes which are free of TMBs, some
routing capable adversaries can inflict in excess of a billion dollars in
annual revenue losses.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a simple but effective density-based outlier detection
approach with the local kernel density estimation (KDE). A Relative
Density-based Outlier Score (RDOS) is introduced to measure the local
outlierness of objects, in which the density distribution at the location of an
object is estimated with a local KDE method based on extended nearest neighbors
of the object. Instead of using only $k$ nearest neighbors, we further consider
reverse nearest neighbors and shared nearest neighbors of an object for density
distribution estimation. Some theoretical properties of the proposed RDOS
including its expected value and false alarm probability are derived. A
comprehensive experimental study on both synthetic and real-life data sets
demonstrates that our approach is more effective than state-of-the-art outlier
detection methods.

 <dc:title>A H-ARQ scheme for polar codes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of supporting H-ARQ with polar codes. For supporting
H-ARQ, we propose to create redundancy versions based on different, but
equivalent, subsets of a polar code. The equivalent subsets are created from an
initial subset of a polar code using an inherent symmetry in polar code
construction. A greedy construction is used to create the initial subset of a
polar code. We demonstrate performance of proposed constructions via
simulations for binary input AWGN channel. We demonstrate that a (4096, 1024)
polar code can be divided into two disjoint (2048, 1024) subset polar codes,
which when decoded individually are within 0.2 dB (at $1 \%$ BLER) of a (2048,
1024) polar code, and achieve performance of a (4096, 1024) polar code when
decoded jointly.

 <dc:title>Reconstruction Error Bounds for Compressed Sensing under Poisson Noise
  using the Square Root of the Jensen-Shannon Divergence</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Reconstruction error bounds in compressed sensing under Gaussian or uniform
bounded noise do not translate easily to the case of Poisson noise. Reasons for
this include the signal dependent nature of Poisson noise, and also the fact
that the negative log likelihood (NLL) in case of a Poisson distribution (which
is related to the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence (GKLD)) is not a
metric and does not obey the triangle inequality. There exist prior theoretical
results in the form of provable error bounds for computationally tractable
estimators for compressed sensing problems under Poisson noise. However, these
results do not apply to realistic compressive systems, which must obey some
crucial constraints such as non-negativity and flux preservation. On the other
hand, there exist provable error bounds for such realistic systems in the
published literature, but they are for estimators that are computationally
intractable. In this paper, we develop error bounds for a computationally
tractable estimator which also applies to realistic compressive systems obeying
the required constraints. Our technique replaces the GKLD, with an information
theoretic metric - namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence
(JSD), which is related to an approximate, symmetrized version of the Poisson
NLL. We show that this allows for simple proofs of the error bounds. We propose
and prove interesting statistical properties of the square root of JSD and
exploit other known ones. Numerical experiments are performed showing the use
of the technique in signal and image reconstruction from compressed
measurements under Poisson noise. Our technique applies to sparse/ compressible
signals in any orthonormal basis, works with high probability for any randomly
generated non-negative and flux-preserving sensing matrix and is proposes an
estimator whose parameters are purely statistically motivated.

 <dc:description>  We develop a classification algorithm for estimating posterior distributions
from positive-unlabeled data, that is robust to noise in the positive labels
and effective for high-dimensional data. In recent years, several algorithms
have been proposed to learn from positive-unlabeled data; however, many of
these contributions remain theoretical, performing poorly on real
high-dimensional data that is typically contaminated with noise. We build on
this previous work to develop two practical classification algorithms that
explicitly model the noise in the positive labels and utilize univariate
transforms built on discriminative classifiers. We prove that these univariate
transforms preserve the class prior, enabling estimation in the univariate
space and avoiding kernel density estimation for high-dimensional data. The
theoretical development and both parametric and nonparametric algorithms
proposed here constitutes an important step towards wide-spread use of robust
classification algorithms for positive-unlabeled data.

 <dc:title>Complex Systems and a Computational Social Science Perspective on the

 <dc:creator>Almaatouq, Abdullah</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantitative Finance - General Finance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Labor market institutions are central for modern economies, and their polices
can directly affect unemployment rates and economic growth. At the individual
level, unemployment often has a detrimental impact on people's well-being and
health. At the national level, high employment is one of the central goals of
any economic policy, due to its close association with national prosperity. The
main goal of this thesis is to highlight the need for frameworks that take into
account the complex structure of labor market interactions. In particular, we
explore the benefits of leveraging tools from computational social science,
network science, and data-driven theories to measure the flow of opportunities
and information in the context of the labor market. First, we investigate our
key hypothesis, which is that opportunity/information flow through weak ties,
and this is a key determinant of the length of unemployment. We then extend the
idea of opportunity/information flow to clusters of other economic activities,
where we expect the flow within clusters of related activities to be higher
than within isolated activities. This captures the intuition that within
related activities there are more &quot;capitals&quot; involved and that such activities
require similar &quot;capabilities.&quot; Therefore, more extensive clusters of economic
activities should generate greater growth through exploiting the greater flow
of opportunities and information. We quantify the opportunity/information flow
using a complexity measure of two economic activities (i.e. jobs and exports).

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an alternating back-propagation algorithm for learning
the generator network model. The model is a non-linear generalization of factor
analysis. In this model, the mapping from the continuous latent factors to the
observed signal is parametrized by a convolutional neural network. The
alternating back-propagation algorithm iterates the following two steps: (1)
Inferential back-propagation, which infers the latent factors by Langevin
dynamics or gradient descent. (2) Learning back-propagation, which updates the
parameters given the inferred latent factors by gradient descent. The gradient
computations in both steps are powered by back-propagation, and they share most
of their code in common. We show that the alternating back-propagation
algorithm can learn realistic generator models of natural images, video
sequences, and sounds. Moreover, it can also be used to learn from incomplete
or indirect training data.

 <dc:description>  Fine-grained object classification is a challenging task due to the subtle
inter-class difference and large intra-class variation. Recently, visual
attention models have been applied to automatically localize the discriminative
regions of an image for better capturing critical difference and demonstrated
promising performance. However, without consideration of the diversity in
attention process, most of existing attention models perform poorly in
classifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we propose a diversified
visual attention network (DVAN) to address the problems of fine-grained object
classification, which substan- tially relieves the dependency on
strongly-supervised information for learning to localize discriminative regions
compared with attentionless models. More importantly, DVAN explicitly pursues
the diversity of attention and is able to gather discriminative information to
the maximal extent. Multiple attention canvases are generated to extract
convolutional features for attention. An LSTM recurrent unit is employed to
learn the attentiveness and discrimination of attention canvases. The proposed
DVAN has the ability to attend the object from coarse to fine granularity, and
a dynamic internal representation for classification is built up by
incrementally combining the information from different locations and scales of
the image. Extensive experiments con- ducted on CUB-2011, Stanford Dogs and
Stanford Cars datasets have demonstrated that the proposed diversified visual
attention networks achieve competitive performance compared to the state-
of-the-art approaches, without using any prior knowledge, user interaction or
external resource in training or testing.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we address the problem of channel estimation and precoding /
combining for the so-called hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO architecture.
Our proposed channel estimation scheme exploits channel reciprocity in TDD MIMO
systems, by using echoing, thereby allowing us to implement Krylov subspace
methods in a fully distributed way. The latter results in estimating the right
(resp. left) singular subspace of the channel at the transmitter (resp.
receiver). Moreover, we also tackle the problem of subspace decomposition
whereby the estimated right (resp. left) singular subspaces are approximated by
a cascade of analog and digital precoder (resp. combiner), using an iterative
method. Finally we compare our scheme with an equivalent fully digital case and
conclude that a relatively similar performance can be achieved, however, with a
drastically reduced number of RF chains - 4 ~ 8 times less (i.e., massive
savings in cost and power consumption).

 <dc:description>  We study here the problem of Antenna Domain Formation (ADF) in cloud RAN
systems, whereby multiple remote radio-heads (RRHs) are each to be assigned to
a set of antenna domains (ADs), such that the total interference between the
ADs is minimized. We formulate the corresponding optimization problem, by
introducing the concept of \emph{interference coupling coefficients} among
pairs of radio-heads. We then propose a low-overhead algorithm that allows the
problem to be solved in a distributed fashion, among the aggregation nodes
(ANs), and establish basic convergence results. Moreover, we also propose a
simple relaxation to the problem, thus enabling us to characterize its maximum
performance. We follow a layered coordination structure: after the ADs are
formed, radio-heads are clustered to perform coordinated beamforming using the
well known Weighted-MMSE algorithm. Finally, our simulations show that using
the proposed ADF mechanism would significantly increase the sum-rate of the
system (with respect to random assignment of radio-heads).

 <dc:description>  MIMO systems in the lower part of the millimetre-wave spectrum band (i.e.,
below 28 GHz) do not exhibit enough directivity and selectively, as their
counterparts in higher bands of the spectrum (i.e., above 60 GHz), and thus
still suffer from the detrimental effect of interference, on the system
sum-rate. As such systems exhibit large numbers of antennas and short coherence
times for the channel, traditional methods of distributed coordination are
ill-suited, and the resulting communication overhead would offset the gains of
coordination. In this work, we propose algorithms for tackling the sum-rate
maximization problem, that are designed to address the above limitations. We
derive a lower bound on the sum-rate, a so-called DLT bound (i.e., a difference
of log and trace), shed light on its tightness, and highlight its decoupled
nature at both the transmitters and receivers. Moreover, we derive the solution
to each of the subproblems, that we dub non-homogeneous waterfilling (a
variation on the MIMO waterfilling solution), and underline an inherent
desirable feature: its ability to turn-off streams exhibiting low-SINR, and
contribute to greatly speeding up the convergence of the proposed algorithm. We
then show the convergence of the resulting algorithm, max-DLT, to a stationary
point of the DLT bound. Finally, we rely on extensive simulations of various
network configurations, to establish the fast-converging nature of our proposed
schemes, and thus their suitability for addressing the short coherence
interval, as well as the increased system dimensions, arising when managing
interference in lower bands of the millimeter wave spectrum. Moreover, our
results also suggest that interference management still brings about
significant performance gains, especially in dense deployments.

 <dc:description>  The doctors (or expert consultants) are the critical resources on which the
success of critical medical cases are heavily dependent. With the emerging
technologies (such as video conferencing, smartphone, etc.) this is no longer a
dream but a true fact, that for critical medical cases in a hospital, expert
consultants from around the world could be hired, who may be present physically
or virtually. Earlier, this interesting situation of taking the expert
consultancies from outside the hospital had been studied, but under monetary
perspective. In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge,
we investigate the situation, where the Below Income Group (BIG) people of the
society may be served efficiently through the expert consultancy by the
renowned doctors from outside of the hospital under zero budget. This will help
us saving many lives which will fulfil the present day need of biomedical
research. We proposes two mechanisms: Random pick-assign mechanism (RanPAM) and
Truthful optimal allocation mechanism (TOAM) to allocate the doctor to the
patient. With theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the TOAM is
strategy-proof, and exhibits a unique core property. The mechanisms are also
validated with exhaustive experiments.

 <dc:description>  We consider space efficient implementations of some classical applications of
DFS including the problem of testing biconnectivity and $2$-edge connectivity,
finding cut vertices and cut edges, computing chain decomposition and
$st$-numbering of a given undirected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
Classical algorithms for them typically use DFS and some $\Omega (\lg n)$
bits\footnote{We use $\lg$ to denote logarithm to the base $2$.} of information
at each vertex. Building on a recent $O(n)$-bits implementation of DFS due to
Elmasry et al. (STACS 2015) we provide $O(n)$-bit implementations for all these
applications of DFS. Our algorithms take $O(m \lg^c n \lg\lg n)$ time for some
small constant $c$ (where $c \leq 2$). Central to our implementation is a
succinct representation of the DFS tree and a space efficient partitioning of
the DFS tree into connected subtrees, which maybe of independent interest for
designing other space efficient graph algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This work focuses on the performance of multi-terminal wireless industrial
networks, where the transmissions of all terminals are required to be scheduled
within a tight deadline. The transmissions thus share a fixed amount of
resources, i.e., symbols, while facing short blocklengths due to the
low-latency requirement. We investigate two distinct relaying strategies,
namely best relay selection among the participating terminals and best antenna
selection at the access point of the network. In both schemes, we incorporate
the cost of acquiring instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) at the
access point within the transmission deadline. An error probability model is
developed under the finite blocklength regime to provide accurate performance
results. As a reference, this model is compared to the corresponding infinite
bocklength error model. Both analytical models are validated by simulation. We
show that the average Packet Error Rate (PER) over all terminals is convex in
the target error probability at each single link. Moreover, we find that: (i)
The reliability behavior is different for the two strategies, while the
limiting factors are both finite blocklengths and overhead of acquiring CSI.
(ii) With the same order of diversity, best antenna selection is more reliable
than best relay selection. (iii) The average PER is increasing in the number of
participating terminals unless the terminals also act as relay candidates. In
particular, if each participating terminal is a candidate for best relay
selection, the PER is convex in the number of terminals.

optimization to maximize the achievable sum-rate of a simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with a full-duplex (FD)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. In

difference of convex (DC) programming and one-dimensional searching to achieve
the joint optimal solution. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of aligning two RDF databases, an essential
problem in understanding the evolution of ontologies. Our approaches address
three fundamental challenges: 1) the use of &quot;blank&quot; (null) names, 2) ontology
changes in which different names are used to identify the same entity, and 3)
small changes in the data values as well as small changes in the graph
structure of the RDF database. We propose approaches inspired by the classical
notion of graph bisimulation and extend them to capture the natural metrics of
edit distance on the data values and the graph structure. We evaluate our
methods on three evolving curated data sets. Overall, our results show that the
proposed methods perform well and are scalable.

 <dc:description>  The goal of unsupervised representation learning is to extract a new
representation of data, such that solving many different tasks becomes easier.
Existing methods typically focus on vectorized data and offer little support
for relational data, which additionally describe relationships among instances.
In this work we introduce an approach for relational unsupervised
representation learning. Viewing a relational dataset as a hypergraph, new
features are obtained by clustering vertices and hyperedges. To find a
representation suited for many relational learning tasks, a wide range of
similarities between relational objects is considered, e.g. feature and
structural similarities. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach and
show that models learned on such latent representations perform better, have
lower complexity, and outperform the existing approaches on classification
tasks.

 <dc:description>  Telecommunication networks make extensive use of power amplifiers to broaden
the coverage from transmitter to receiver. Achieving high power efficiency is
challenging and comes at a price: the wanted linear performance is degraded due
to nonlinear effects. To compensate for these nonlinear disturbances, existing
techniques compute the pre-inverse of the power amplifier by estimation of a
nonlinear model. However, the extraction of this nonlinear model is involved
and requires advanced system identification techniques.
  We used the plant inversion iterative learning control algorithm to
investigate whether the nonlinear modeling step can be simplified. This paper
introduces the iterative learning control framework for the pre-inverse
estimation and predistortion of power amplifiers. The iterative learning
control algorithm is used to obtain a high quality predistorted input for the
power amplifier under study without requiring a nonlinear model of the power
amplifier. In a second step a nonlinear pre-inverse model of the amplifier is
obtained. Both the nonlinear and memory effects of a power amplifier can be
compensated by this approach. The convergence of the iterative approach, and
the predistortion results are illustrated on a simulation of a Motorola LDMOS
transistor based power amplifier and a measurement example using the Chalmers
RF WebLab measurement setup.

 <dc:title>Iterative Partial Rounding for Vertex Cover with Hard Capacities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kao, Mong-Jen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We provide a simple and novel algorithmic design technique, for which we call
iterative partial rounding, that gives a tight rounding-based approximation for
vertex cover with hard capacities (VC-HC). In particular, we obtain an
$f$-approximation for VC-HC on hypergraphs, improving over a previous results
of Cheung et al (SODA 2014) to the tight extent. This also closes the gap of
approximation since it was posted by Chuzhoy and Naor in (FOCS 2002). We
believe that our rounding technique is of independence interests when hard
constraints are considered.
  Our main technical tool for establishing the approximation guarantee is a
separation lemma that certifies the existence of a strong partition for
solutions that are basic feasible in an extended version of the natural LP.

 <dc:description>  Model checking and automated theorem proving are two pillars of formal
methods. This paper investigates model checking from an automated theorem
proving perspective, aiming at combining the expressiveness of automated
theorem proving and the complete automaticity of model checking. The focus of
this paper is on the verification of temporal logic properties of Kripke
models. The main contributions of this paper are: first the definition of an
extended computation tree logic that allows polyadic predicate symbols, then a
proof system for this logic, taking Kripke models as parameters, then, the
design of a proof-search algorithm for this calculus and a new automated
theorem prover to implement it. The verification process is completely
automatic, and produces either a counterexample when the property does not
hold, or a certificate when it does. The experimental result compares well to
existing state-of-the-art tools on some benchmarks, including an application to
air traffic control and the design choices that lead to this efficiency are
discussed.

 <dc:title>A Benes Based NoC Switching Architecture for Mixed Criticality Embedded

 <dc:description>  Multi-core, Mixed Criticality Embedded (MCE) real-time systems require high
timing precision and predictability to guarantee there will be no interference
between tasks. These guarantees are necessary in application areas such as
avionics and automotive, where task interference or missed deadlines could be
catastrophic, and safety requirements are strict. In modern multi-core systems,
the interconnect becomes a potential point of uncertainty, introducing major
challenges in proving behaviour is always within specified constraints,
limiting the means of growing system performance to add more tasks, or provide
more computational resources to existing tasks.
  We present MCENoC, a Network-on-Chip (NoC) switching architecture that
provides innovations to overcome this with predictable, formally verifiable
timing behaviour that is consistent across the whole NoC. We show how the
fundamental properties of Benes networks benefit MCE applications and meet our
architecture requirements. Using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA), formal
properties are defined that aid the refinement of the specification of the
design as well as enabling the implementation to be exhaustively formally
verified. We demonstrate the performance of the design in terms of size,
throughput and predictability, and discuss the application level considerations
needed to exploit this architecture.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of learning distributed representations for documents
in data streams. The documents are represented as low-dimensional vectors and
are jointly learned with distributed vector representations of word tokens
using a hierarchical framework with two embedded neural language models. In
particular, we exploit the context of documents in streams and use one of the
language models to model the document sequences, and the other to model word
sequences within them. The models learn continuous vector representations for
both word tokens and documents such that semantically similar documents and
words are close in a common vector space. We discuss extensions to our model,
which can be applied to personalized recommendation and social relationship
mining by adding further user layers to the hierarchy, thus learning
user-specific vectors to represent individual preferences. We validated the
learned representations on a public movie rating data set from MovieLens, as
well as on a large-scale Yahoo News data comprising three months of user
activity logs collected on Yahoo servers. The results indicate that the
proposed model can learn useful representations of both documents and word
tokens, outperforming the current state-of-the-art by a large margin.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for scalable image coding based on
the concept of epitome. An epitome can be seen as a factorized representation
of an image. Focusing on spatial scalability, the enhancement layer of the
proposed scheme contains only the epitome of the input image. The pixels of the
enhancement layer not contained in the epitome are then restored using two
approaches inspired from local learning-based super-resolution methods. In the
first method, a locally linear embedding model is learned on base layer patches
and then applied to the corresponding epitome patches to reconstruct the
enhancement layer. The second approach learns linear mappings between pairs of
co-located base layer and epitome patches. Experiments have shown that
significant improvement of the rate-distortion performances can be achieved
compared to an SHVC reference.

 <dc:description>  Class imbalance presents a major hurdle in the application of data mining
methods. A common practice to deal with it is to create ensembles of
classifiers that learn from resampled balanced data. For example, bagged
decision trees combined with random undersampling (RUS) or the synthetic
minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). However, most of the resampling
methods entail asymmetric changes to the examples of different classes, which
in turn can introduce its own biases in the model. Furthermore, those methods
require a performance measure to be specified a priori before learning. An
alternative is to use a so-called threshold-moving method that a posteriori
changes the decision threshold of a model to counteract the imbalance, thus has
a potential to adapt to the performance measure of interest. Surprisingly,
little attention has been paid to the potential of combining bagging ensemble
with threshold-moving. In this paper, we present probability thresholding
bagging (PT-bagging), a versatile plug-in method that fills this gap. Contrary
to usual rebalancing practice, our method preserves the natural class
distribution of the data resulting in well calibrated posterior probabilities.
We also extend the proposed method to handle multiclass data. The method is
validated on binary and multiclass benchmark data sets. We perform analyses
that provide insights into the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  We consider the model of parametrized asynchronous shared-memory pushdown
systems, as introduced in [Hague'11]. In a series of recent papers it has been
shown that reachability in this model is PSPACE-complete [Esparza, Ganty,
Majumdar'13] and that liveness is decidable in NEXPTIME [Durand-Gasselin,
Esparza, Ganty, Majumdar'15]. We show here that the liveness problem is
PSPACE-complete. We also introduce the universal reachability problem. We show
that it is decidable, and coNEXPTIME-complete. Finally, using these results, we
prove that the verifying regular properties of traces of executions, satisfying
some stuttering condition, is also decidable in NEXPTIME for this model.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of learning a Nash equilibrium in
$\gamma$-discounted multiplayer general-sum Markov Games (MG). A key component
of this model is the possibility for the players to either collaborate or team
apart to increase their rewards. Building an artificial player for general-sum
MGs implies to learn more complex strategies which are impossible to obtain by
using techniques developed for two-player zero-sum MGs. In this paper, we
introduce a new definition of $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps
the strategy's quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm
of two Bellman-like residuals implies the convergence to such an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical
estimate of the $L_p$ norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for
general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally, we introduce a neural
network architecture named NashNetwork that successfully learns a Nash
equilibrium in a generic multiplayer general-sum turn-based MG.

 <dc:description>  Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer is currently the smallest sequencing device
available. While being able to produce very long reads (reads of up to 100~kbp
were reported), it is prone to high sequencing error rates of up to 30%. Since
most of these errors are insertions or deletions, it is very difficult to adapt
popular seed-based algorithms designed for aligning data sets with much lower
error rates.
  Base calling of MinION reads is typically done using hidden Markov models. In
this paper, we propose to represent each sequencing read by an ensemble of
sequences sampled from such a probabilistic model. This approach can improve
the sensitivity and false positive rate of seeding an alignment compared to
using a single representative base call sequence for each read.

the art models in DST, on the other hand, most state-of-the-art models are only
turn-based and require dataset-specific preprocessing (e.g. DSTC2-specific) in
order to achieve such results. We implemented two architectures which can be
used in incremental settings and require almost no preprocessing. We compare
their performance to the benchmarks on DSTC2 and discuss their properties. With
only trivial preprocessing, the performance of our models is close to the
state-of- the-art results.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Watermarking: Active Defense of Networked Cyber-Physical Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The coming decades may see the large scale deployment of networked
cyber-physical systems to address global needs in areas such as energy, water,
healthcare, and transportation. However, as recent events have shown, such
systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Being safety critical, their
disruption or misbehavior can cause economic losses or injuries and loss of
life. It is therefore important to secure such networked cyber-physical systems
against attacks. In the absence of credible security guarantees, there will be
resistance to the proliferation of cyber-physical systems, which are much
needed to meet global needs in critical infrastructures and services.
  This paper addresses the problem of secure control of networked
cyber-physical systems. This problem is different from the problem of securing
the communication network, since cyber-physical systems at their very essence
need sensors and actuators that interface with the physical plant, and
malicious agents may tamper with sensors or actuators, as recent attacks have
shown.
  We consider physical plants that are being controlled by multiple actuators
and sensors communicating over a network, where some sensors could be
&quot;malicious,&quot; meaning that they may not report the measurements that they
observe. We address a general technique by which the actuators can detect the
actions of malicious sensors in the system, and disable closed-loop control
based on their information. This technique, called &quot;watermarking,&quot; employs the
technique of actuators injecting private excitation into the system which will
reveal malicious tampering with signals. We show how such an active defense can
be used to secure networked systems of sensors and actuators.

 <dc:title>Monotonicity-preserving finite element schemes based on differentiable
  nonlinear stabilization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Badia, Santiago</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bonilla, Jes&#xfa;s</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a nonlinear stabilization technique for scalar
conservation laws with implicit time stepping. The method relies on an
artificial diffusion method, based on a graph-Laplacian operator. It is
nonlinear, since it depends on a shock detector. The same shock detector is
used to gradually lump the mass matrix. The resulting method is LED, positivity
preserving, linearity preserving, and also satisfies a global DMP. Lipschitz
continuity has also been proved. However, the resulting scheme is highly
nonlinear, leading to very poor nonlinear convergence rates. We propose a
smooth version of the scheme, which leads to twice differentiable nonlinear
stabilization schemes. It allows one to straightforwardly use Newton's method
and obtain quadratic convergence. In the numerical experiments, steady and
transient linear transport, and transient Burgers' equation have been
considered in 2D. Using the Newton method with a smooth version of the scheme
we can reduce 10 to 20 times the number of iterations of Anderson acceleration
with the original non-smooth scheme. In any case, these properties are only
true for the converged solution, but not for iterates. In this sense, we have
also proposed the concept of projected nonlinear solvers, where a projection
step is performed at the end of every nonlinear iteration onto a FE space of
admissible solutions. The space of admissible solutions is the one that
satisfies the desired monotonic properties (maximum principle or positivity).

 <dc:description>  Large-scale antenna (LSA) or massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
has gained a lot of attention due to its potential to significantly improve
system throughput. As a natural evolution from traditional MIMO-orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), LSA has been combined with OFDM to deal
with frequency selectivity of wireless channels in most existing works. As an
alternative approach, single-carrier (SC) has also been proposed for LSA
systems due to its low implementation complexity. In this article, a
comprehensive comparison between LSA-OFDM and LSA-SC is presented, which is of
interest to the waveform design for the next generation wireless systems.

 <dc:title>A Dissipative Systems Theory for FDTD with Application to Stability
  Analysis and Subgridding</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper establishes a far-reaching connection between the
Finite-Difference Time-Domain method (FDTD) and the theory of dissipative
systems. The FDTD equations for a rectangular region are written as a dynamical
system having the magnetic and electric fields on the boundary as inputs and
outputs. Suitable expressions for the energy stored in the region and the
energy absorbed from the boundaries are introduced, and used to show that the
FDTD system is dissipative under a generalized Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
condition. Based on the concept of dissipation, a powerful theoretical
framework to investigate the stability of FDTD methods is devised. The new
method makes FDTD stability proofs simpler, more intuitive, and modular.
Stability conditions can indeed be given on the individual components (e.g.
boundary conditions, meshes, embedded models) instead of the whole coupled
setup. As an example of application, we derive a new subgridding method with
material traverse, arbitrary grid refinement, and guaranteed stability. The
method is easy to implement and has a straightforward stability proof.
Numerical results confirm its stability, low reflections, and ability to handle
material traverse.

 <dc:title>Complexity Bounds of Constant-Space Quantum Computation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We realize constant-space quantum computation by measure-many two-way quantum
finite automata and evaluate their language recognition power by analyzing
patterns of their exotic behaviors and by exploring their structural
properties. In particular, we show that, when the automata halt &quot;in finite
steps&quot; along all computation paths, they must terminate in worst-case liner
time. In the bounded-error probability case, the acceptance of the automata
depends only on the computation paths that terminate within exponentially many
steps even if not all computation paths may terminate. We also present a
classical simulation of those automata on two-way multi-head probabilistic
finite automata with cut points. Moreover, we discuss how the recognition power
of the automata varies as the automata's acceptance criteria change to error
free, one-sided error, bounded error, and unbounded error by comparing the
complexity of their computational powers. We further note that, with the use of
arbitrary complex transition amplitudes, two-way unbounded-error quantum finite
automata and two-way bounded-error 2-head quantum finite automata can recognize
certain non-recursive languages, whereas two-way error-free quantum finite
automata recognize only recursive languages.

 <dc:description>  We investigate distributed memory parallel sorting algorithms that scale to
the largest available machines and are robust with respect to input size and
distribution of the input elements. The main outcome is that four sorting
algorithms cover the entire range of possible input sizes. For three algorithms
we devise new low overhead mechanisms to make them robust with respect to
duplicate keys and skewed input distributions. One of these, designed for
medium sized inputs, is a new variant of quicksort with fast high-quality pivot
selection.
  At the same time asymptotic analysis provides performance guarantees and
guides the selection and configuration of the algorithms. We validate these
hypotheses using extensive experiments on 7 algorithms, 10 input distributions,
up to 262144 cores, and varying input sizes over 9 orders of magnitude. For
difficult input distributions, our algorithms are the only ones that work at
all. For all but the largest input sizes, we are the first to perform
experiments on such large machines at all and our algorithms significantly
outperform the ones one would conventionally have considered.

 <dc:description>  Many naturally occurring networks have a power-law degree distribution as
well as a non-zero degree correlation. Despite this, most studies analyzing the
robustness to random node-deletion and vulnerability to targeted node-deletion
have concentrated only on power-law degree distribution and ignored degree
correlation. This study looks specifically at the effect degree-correlation has
on robustness and vulnerability in scale-free networks. Our results confirm
Newman's finding that positive degree-correlation increases robustness and
decreases vulnerability. However, we found that networks with positive
degree-correlation are more vulnerable to random node-deletion than to targeted
deletion methods that utilize knowledge of initial node-degree only. Targeted
deletion sufficiently alters the topology of the network to render this method
less effective than uniform random methods unless changes in topology are
accounted for. This result indicates the importance of degree correlation in
certain network applications.

 <dc:description>  One of the most basic functions of language is to refer to objects in a
shared scene. Modeling reference with continuous representations is challenging
because it requires individuation, i.e., tracking and distinguishing an
arbitrary number of referents. We introduce a neural network model that, given
a definite description and a set of objects represented by natural images,
points to the intended object if the expression has a unique referent, or
indicates a failure, if it does not. The model, directly trained on reference
acts, is competitive with a pipeline manually engineered to perform the same
task, both when referents are purely visual, and when they are characterized by
a combination of visual and linguistic properties.

 <dc:title>Theta-RBM: Unfactored Gated Restricted Boltzmann Machine for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Learning invariant representations is a critical task in computer vision. In
this paper, we propose the Theta-Restricted Boltzmann Machine ({\theta}-RBM in
short), which builds upon the original RBM formulation and injects the notion
of rotation-invariance during the learning procedure. In contrast to previous
approaches, we do not transform the training set with all possible rotations.
Instead, we rotate the gradient filters when they are computed during the
Contrastive Divergence algorithm. We formulate our model as an unfactored gated
Boltzmann machine, where another input layer is used to modulate the input
visible layer to drive the optimisation procedure. Among our contributions is a
mathematical proof that demonstrates that {\theta}-RBM is able to learn
rotation-invariant features according to a recently proposed invariance
measure. Our method reaches an invariance score of ~90% on mnist-rot dataset,
which is the highest result compared with the baseline methods and the current
state of the art in transformation-invariant feature learning in RBM. Using an
SVM classifier, we also showed that our network learns discriminative features
as well, obtaining ~10% of testing error.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a dual estimation methodology is developed for both
time-varying parameters and states of a nonlinear stochastic system based on
the Particle Filtering (PF) scheme. Our developed methodology is based on a
concurrent implementation of state and parameter estimation filters as opposed
to using a single filter for simultaneously estimating the augmented states and
parameters. The convergence and stability of our proposed dual estimation
strategy are shown formally to be guaranteed under certain conditions. The
ability of our developed dual estimation method is testified to handle
simultaneously and efficiently the states and time-varying parameters of a
nonlinear system in a context of health monitoring which employs a unified
approach to fault detection, isolation and identification is a single
algorithm. The performance capabilities of our proposed fault diagnosis
methodology is demonstrated and evaluated by its application to a gas turbine
engine through accomplishing state and parameter estimation under simultaneous
and concurrent component fault scenarios. Extensive simulation results are
provided to substantiate and justify the superiority of our proposed fault
diagnosis methodology when compared with another well-known alternative
diagnostic technique that is available in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Data quantization learns encoding results of data with certain requirements,
and provides a broad perspective of many real-world applications to data
handling. Nevertheless, the results of encoder is usually limited to
multivariate inputs with the random mapping, and side information of binary
codes are hardly to mostly depict the original data patterns as possible. In
the literature, cosine based random quantization has attracted much attentions
due to its intrinsic bounded results. Nevertheless, it usually suffers from the
uncertain outputs, and information of original data fails to be fully preserved
in the reduced codes. In this work, a novel binary embedding method, termed
adaptive training quantization (ATQ), is proposed to learn the ideal transform
of random encoder, where the limitation of cosine random mapping is tackled. As
an adaptive learning idea, the reduced mapping is adaptively calculated with
idea of data group, while the bias of random transform is to be improved to
hold most matching information. Experimental results show that the proposed
method is able to obtain outstanding performance compared with other random
quantization methods.

decisions based on user-level predictors) which &quot;significantly affect&quot; users.
The law will also effectively create a &quot;right to explanation,&quot; whereby a user
can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them.
We argue that while this law will pose large challenges for industry, it
highlights opportunities for computer scientists to take the lead in designing
algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination and enable
explanation.

 <dc:title>Undecidable Cases of Model Checking Probabilistic Temporal-Epistemic
  Logic (Extended Abstract)</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate the decidability of model-checking logics of time, knowledge
and probability, with respect to two epistemic semantics: the clock and
synchronous perfect recall semantics in partially observed discrete-time Markov
chains. Decidability results are known for certain restricted logics with
respect to these semantics, subject to a variety of restrictions that are
either unexplained or involve a longstanding unsolved mathematical problem. We
show that mild generalizations of the known decidable cases suffice to render
the model checking problem definitively undecidable. In particular, for a
synchronous perfect recall, a generalization from temporal operators with
finite reach to operators with infinite reach renders model checking
undecidable. The case of the clock semantics is closely related to a monadic
second order logic of time and probability that is known to be decidable,
except on a set of measure zero. We show that two distinct extensions of this
logic make model checking undecidable. One of these involves polynomial
combinations of probability terms, the other involves monadic second order
quantification into the scope of probability operators. These results explain
some of the restrictions in previous work.

 <dc:title>Better Unrelated Machine Scheduling for Weighted Completion Time via
  Random Offsets from Non-Uniform Distributions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Im, Sungjin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Li, Shi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the classic scheduling problem of minimizing total
weighted completion time on unrelated machines when jobs have release times,
i.e, $R | r_{ij} | \sum_j w_j C_j$ using the three-field notation. For this
problem, a 2-approximation is known based on a novel convex programming (J. ACM
2001 by Skutella). It has been a long standing open problem if one can improve
upon this 2-approximation (Open Problem 8 in J. of Sched. 1999 by Schuurman and
Woeginger). We answer this question in the affirmative by giving a
1.8786-approximation. We achieve this via a surprisingly simple linear
programming, but a novel rounding algorithm and analysis. A key ingredient of
our algorithm is the use of random offsets sampled from non-uniform
distributions.
  We also consider the preemptive version of the problem, i.e, $R | r_{ij},pmtn
| \sum_j w_j C_j$. We again use the idea of sampling offsets from non-uniform
distributions to give the first better than 2-approximation for this problem.
This improvement also requires use of a configuration LP with variables for
each job's complete schedules along with more careful analysis. For both
non-preemptive and preemptive versions, we break the approximation barrier of 2
for the first time.

 <dc:description>  The input data features set for many data driven tasks is high-dimensional
while the intrinsic dimension of the data is low. Data analysis methods aim to
uncover the underlying low dimensional structure imposed by the low dimensional
hidden parameters by utilizing distance metrics that consider the set of
attributes as a single monolithic set. However, the transformation of the low
dimensional phenomena into the measured high dimensional observations might
distort the distance metric, This distortion can effect the desired estimated
low dimensional geometric structure. In this paper, we suggest to utilize the
redundancy in the attribute domain by partitioning the attributes into multiple
subsets we call views. The proposed methods utilize the agreement also called
consensus between different views to extract valuable geometric information
that unifies multiple views about the intrinsic relationships among several
different observations. This unification enhances the information that a single
view or a simple concatenations of views provides.

 <dc:description>  Speech recognition, especially name recognition, is widely used in phone
services such as company directory dialers, stock quote providers or location
finders. It is usually challenging due to pronunciation variations. This paper
proposes an efficient and robust data-driven technique which automatically
learns acceptable word pronunciations and updates the pronunciation dictionary
to build a better lexicon without affecting recognition of other words similar
to the target word. It generalizes well on datasets with various sizes, and
reduces the error rate on a database with 13000+ human names by 42%, compared
to a baseline with regular dictionaries already covering canonical
pronunciations of 97%+ words in names, plus a well-trained
spelling-to-pronunciation (STP) engine.

 <dc:title>The Capacity of Symmetric Private Information Retrieval</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Private information retrieval (PIR) is the problem of retrieving as
efficiently as possible, one out of $K$ messages from $N$ non-communicating
replicated databases (each holds all $K$ messages) while keeping the identity
of the desired message index a secret from each individual database. Symmetric
PIR (SPIR) is a generalization of PIR to include the requirement that beyond
the desired message, the user learns nothing about the other $K-1$ messages.
The information theoretic capacity of SPIR (equivalently, the reciprocal of
minimum download cost) is the maximum number of bits of desired information
that can be privately retrieved per bit of downloaded information. We show that
the capacity of SPIR is $1-1/N$ regardless of the number of messages $K$, if
the databases have access to common randomness (not available to the user) that
is independent of the messages, in the amount that is at least $1/(N-1)$ bits
per desired message bit, and zero otherwise. Extensions to the capacity region
of SPIR and the capacity of finite length SPIR are provided.

 <dc:description>  The Internet not only has changed the dynamics of our collective attention,
but also through the transactional log of online activities, provides us with
the opportunity to study attention dynamics at scale. In this paper, we
particularly study attention to aircraft incidents and accidents using
Wikipedia transactional data in two different language editions, English and
Spanish. We study both the editorial activities on and the viewership of the
articles about airline crashes. We analyse how the level of attention is
influenced by different parameters such as number of deaths, airline region,
and event locale and date. We find evidence that the attention given by
Wikipedia editors to pre-Wikipedia aircraft incidents and accidents depends on
the region of the airline for both English and Spanish editions. North American
airline companies receive more prompt coverage in English Wikipedia. We also
observe that the attention given by Wikipedia visitors is influenced by the
airline region but only for events with high number of deaths. Finally we show
that the rate and time span of the decay of attention is independent of the
number of deaths and a fast decay within about a week seems to be universal. We
discuss the implications of these findings in the context of attention bias.

 <dc:description>  We consider sequential or active ranking of a set of n items based on noisy
pairwise comparisons. Items are ranked according to the probability that a
given item beats a randomly chosen item, and ranking refers to partitioning the
items into sets of pre-specified sizes according to their scores. This notion
of ranking includes as special cases the identification of the top-k items and
the total ordering of the items. We first analyze a sequential ranking
algorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and uses these counts to
decide whether to stop, or to compare another pair of items, chosen based on
confidence intervals specified by the data collected up to that point. We prove
that this algorithm succeeds in recovering the ranking using a number of
comparisons that is optimal up to logarithmic factors. This guarantee does not
require any structural properties of the underlying pairwise probability
matrix, unlike a significant body of past work on pairwise ranking based on
parametric models such as the Thurstone or Bradley-Terry-Luce models. It has
been a long-standing open question as to whether or not imposing these
parametric assumptions allows for improved ranking algorithms. For stochastic
comparison models, in which the pairwise probabilities are bounded away from
zero, our second contribution is to resolve this issue by proving a lower bound
for parametric models. This shows, perhaps surprisingly, that these popular
parametric modeling choices offer at most logarithmic gains for stochastic
comparisons.

 <dc:title>Technical Report: Towards a Universal Code Formatter through Machine

 <dc:description>  There are many declarative frameworks that allow us to implement code
formatters relatively easily for any specific language, but constructing them
is cumbersome. The first problem is that &quot;everybody&quot; wants to format their code
differently, leading to either many formatter variants or a ridiculous number
of configuration options. Second, the size of each implementation scales with a
language's grammar size, leading to hundreds of rules.
  In this paper, we solve the formatter construction problem using a novel
approach, one that automatically derives formatters for any given language
without intervention from a language expert. We introduce a code formatter
called CodeBuff that uses machine learning to abstract formatting rules from a
representative corpus, using a carefully designed feature set. Our experiments
on Java, SQL, and ANTLR grammars show that CodeBuff is efficient, has excellent
accuracy, and is grammar invariant for a given language. It also generalizes to
a 4th language tested during manuscript preparation.

 <dc:description>  The study of data-parallel domain re-organization and thread-mapping
techniques are relevant topics as they can increase the efficiency of GPU
computations when working on spatial discrete domains with non-box-shaped
geometry. In this work we study the potential benefits of applying a succint
data re-organization of a tetrahedral data-parallel domain of size
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ combined with an efficient block-space GPU map of the form
$g:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^3$. Results from the analysis suggest that
in theory the combination of these two optimizations produce significant
performance improvement as block-based data re-organization allows a coalesced
one-to-one correspondence at local thread-space while $g(\lambda)$ produces an
efficient block-space spatial correspondence between groups of data and groups
of threads, reducing the number of unnecessary threads from $O(n^3)$ to
$O(n^2\rho^3)$ where $\rho$ is the linear block-size and typically $\rho^3 \ll
n$. From the analysis, we obtained that a block based succint data
re-organization can provide up to $2\times$ improved performance over a linear
data organization while the map can be up to $6\times$ more efficient than a
bounding box approach. The results from this work can serve as a useful guide
for a more efficient GPU computation on tetrahedral domains found in spin
lattice, finite element and special n-body problems, among others.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of non-Bayesian learning over multi-agent
networks, where agents repeatedly collect partially informative observations
about an unknown state of the world, and try to collaboratively learn the true
state. We focus on the impact of the adversarial agents on the performance of
consensus-based non-Bayesian learning, where non-faulty agents combine local
learning updates with consensus primitives. In particular, we consider the
scenario where an unknown subset of agents suffer Byzantine faults -- agents
suffering Byzantine faults behave arbitrarily. Two different learning rules are
proposed.

 <dc:description>  Efficient retrieval of information is of key importance when using Big Data
systems. In large scale-out data architectures, data are distributed and
replicated across several machines. Queries/tasks to such data architectures,
are sent to a router which determines the machines containing the requested
data. Ideally, to reduce the overall cost of analytics, the smallest set of
machines required to satisfy the query should be returned by the router.
Mathematically, this can be modeled as the set cover problem, which is NP-hard,
thus making the routing process a balance between optimality and performance.
Even though an efficient greedy approximation algorithm for routing a single
query exists, there is currently no better method for processing multiple
queries than running the greedy set cover algorithm repeatedly for each query.
This method is impractical for Big Data systems and the state-of-the-art
techniques route a query to all machines and choose as a cover the machines
that respond fastest. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique to
speedup the routing of a large number of real-time queries while minimizing the
number of machines that each query touches (query span). We demonstrate that by
analyzing the correlation between known queries and performing query
clustering, we can reduce the set cover computation time, thereby significantly
speeding up routing of unknown queries. Experiments show that our incremental
set cover-based routing is 2.5 times faster and can return on average 50% fewer
machines per query when compared to repeated greedy set cover and baseline
routing techniques.
