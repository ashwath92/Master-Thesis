 <dc:title>Refactoring Delta-Oriented Product Lines to achieve Monotonicity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Delta-oriented programming (DOP) is a flexible transformational approach to
implement software product lines. In delta-oriented product lines, variants are
generated by applying operations contained in delta modules to a (possibly
empty) base program. These operations can add, remove or modify named elements
in a program (e.g., classes, methods and fields in a Java program). This paper
presents algorithms for refactoring a delta-oriented product line into
monotonic form, i.e., either to contain add and modify operations only
(monotonic increasing) or to contain remove and modify operations only
(monotonic decreasing). Because of their simpler structure, monotonic
delta-oriented product lines are easier to analyze. The algorithms are
formalized by means of a core calculus for DOP of product lines of Java
programs and their correctness and complexity are given.

 <dc:title>Conflict Detection for Edits on Extended Feature Models using Symbolic

 <dc:description>  Feature models are used to specify variability of user-configurable systems
as appearing, e.g., in software product lines. Software product lines are
supposed to be long-living and, therefore, have to continuously evolve over
time to meet ever-changing requirements. Evolution imposes changes to feature
models in terms of edit operations. Ensuring consistency of concurrent edits
requires appropriate conflict detection techniques. However, recent approaches
fail to handle crucial subtleties of extended feature models, namely
constraints mixing feature-tree patterns with first-order logic formulas over
non-Boolean feature attributes with potentially infinite value domains. In this
paper, we propose a novel conflict detection approach based on symbolic graph
transformation to facilitate concurrent edits on extended feature models. We
describe extended feature models formally with symbolic graphs and edit
operations with symbolic graph transformation rules combining graph patterns
with first-order logic formulas. The approach is implemented by combining
eMoflon with an SMT solver, and evaluated with respect to applicability.

 <dc:title>Incremental Consistency Checking in Delta-oriented UML-Models for
  Automation Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kowal, Matthias</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Schaefer, Ina</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Automation systems exist in many variants and may evolve over time in order
to deal with different environment contexts or to fulfill changing customer
requirements. This induces an increased complexity during design-time as well
as tedious maintenance efforts. We already proposed a multi-perspective
modeling approach to improve the development of such systems. It operates on
different levels of abstraction by using well-known UML-models with activity,
composite structure and state chart models. Each perspective was enriched with
delta modeling to manage variability and evolution. As an extension, we now
focus on the development of an efficient consistency checking method at several
levels to ensure valid variants of the automation system. Consistency checking
must be provided for each perspective in isolation, in-between the perspectives
as well as after the application of a delta.

 <dc:title>Analysis of Feature Models Using Alloy: A Survey</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Feature Models (FMs) are a mechanism to model variability among a family of
closely related software products, i.e. a software product line (SPL). Analysis
of FMs using formal methods can reveal defects in the specification such as
inconsistencies that cause the product line to have no valid products. A
popular framework used in research for FM analysis is Alloy, a light-weight
formal modeling notation equipped with an efficient model finder. Several works
in the literature have proposed different strategies to encode and analyze FMs
using Alloy. However, there is little discussion on the relative merits of each
proposal, making it difficult to select the most suitable encoding for a
specific analysis need. In this paper, we describe and compare those strategies
according to various criteria such as the expressivity of the FM notation or
the efficiency of the analysis. This survey is the first comparative study of
research targeted towards using Alloy for FM analysis. This review aims to
identify all the best practices on the use of Alloy, as a part of a framework
for the automated extraction and analysis of rich FMs from natural language
requirement specifications.

 <dc:title>Towards a Feature mu-Calculus Targeting SPL Verification</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Willemse, Tim A. C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The modal mu-calculus mu-L is a well-known fixpoint logic to express and
model check properties interpreted over labeled transition systems. In this
paper, we propose two variants of the mu-calculus, mu-Lf and mu-Lf', for
feature transition systems. For this, we explicitly incorporate feature
expressions into the logics, allowing operators to select transitions and
behavior restricted to specific products and subfamilies. We provide semantics
for mu-Lf and mu-Lf' and relate the two new mu-calculi and mu-L to each other.
Next, we focus on the analysis of SPL behavior and show how our formalism can
be applied for product-based verification with mu-Lf as well as family-based
verification with mu-Lf'. We illustrate by means of a toy example how
properties can be model checked, exploiting an embedding of mu-Lf' into the
mu-calculus with data.

 <dc:description>  We study generalizations of the &quot;Prophet Inequality&quot; and &quot;Secretary Problem&quot;,
where the algorithm is restricted to an arbitrary downward-closed set system.
For {0,1}-values, we give O(log n)-competitive algorithms for both problems.
This is close to the \Omega(log n / loglog n) lower bound due to Babaioff,
Immorlica, and Kleinberg. For general values, our results translate to O(log n
log r)-competitive algorithms, where r is the cardinality of the largest
feasible set. This resolves (up to the O(log r loglog n) factors) an open
question posed to us by Bobby Kleinberg.

 <dc:title>A General World Model with Poiesis: Poppers Three Worlds updated with
  Software</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hehl, Walter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the famous Three Worlds of Karl Popper as template, the paper rigorously
introduces the concept of software to define the counterpart of the physical
subworld. Digesting the scientific-technical view of biology and neurology on a
high level, results in an updated Three Worlds scheme consistent with an
information technical view. Chance and mathematics complete the world model.
Some simple examples illustrate the move from Poppers view of the world with
physics, psyche and World 3, to a new extended model with physics, extended
software (which we call Poiesis), and Geist (the notion which embodies spirit,
mind and soul).

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification is critical in surveillance applications. Current
approaches rely on appearance based features extracted from a single or
multiple shots of the target and candidate matches. These approaches are at a
disadvantage when trying to distinguish between candidates dressed in similar
colors or when targets change their clothing. In this paper we propose a
dynamics-based feature to overcome this limitation. The main idea is to capture
soft biometrics from gait and motion patterns by gathering dense short
trajectories (tracklets) which are Fisher vector encoded. To illustrate the
merits of the proposed features we introduce three new &quot;appearance-impaired&quot;
datasets. Our experiments on the original and the appearance impaired datasets
demonstrate the benefits of incorporating dynamics-based information with
appearance-based information to re-identification algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Grouping problems aim to partition a set of items into multiple mutually
disjoint subsets according to some specific criterion and constraints. Grouping
problems cover a large class of important combinatorial optimization problems
that are generally computationally difficult. In this paper, we propose a
general solution approach for grouping problems, i.e., reinforcement learning
based local search (RLS), which combines reinforcement learning techniques with
descent-based local search. The viability of the proposed approach is verified
on a well-known representative grouping problem (graph coloring) where a very
simple descent-based coloring algorithm is applied. Experimental studies on
popular DIMACS and COLOR02 benchmark graphs indicate that RLS achieves
competitive performances compared to a number of well-known coloring
algorithms.

 <dc:title>The New Frontier in RAN Heterogeneity: Multi-tier Drone-Cells</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In cellular networks, the locations of the radio access network (RAN)
elements are determined mainly based on the long-term traffic behaviour.
However, when the random and hard-to-predict spatio-temporal distribution of
the traffic (load,demand) does not fully match the fixed locations of the RAN
elements (supply), some performance degradation becomes inevitable. The concept
of multi-tier cells (heterogeneous networks, HetNets) has been introduced in 4G
networks to alleviate this mismatch. However, as the traffic distribution
deviates more and more from the long-term average, even the HetNet architecture
will have difficulty in coping up with the erratic supply-demand mismatch,
unless the RAN is grossly over-engineered (which is a financially non-viable
solution). In this article, we study the opportunistic utilization of
low-altitude unmanned aerial platforms equipped with base stations (BSs), i.e.,
drone-BSs, in 5G networks. In particular, we envisage a multi-tier drone-cell
network complementing the terrestrial HetNets. The variety of equipment, and
non-rigid placement options allow utilizing multitier drone-cell networks to
serve diversified demands. Hence, drone-cells bring the supply to where the
demand is, which sets new frontiers for the heterogeneity in 5G networks. We
investigate the advancements promised by drone-cells, and discuss the
challenges associated with their operation and management. We propose a
drone-cell management framework (DMF) benefiting from the synergy among
software defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and
cloud-computing. We demonstrate DMF mechanisms via a case study, and
numerically show that it can reduce the cost of utilizing drone-cells in
multitenancy cellular networks.

 <dc:description>  The sixth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a celebration
of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on programs as we write
them today. Modern programming languages, and in particular functional
languages, support the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where would Haskell
be without monads? Functional reactive programming without arrows?
Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The list goes on. This workshop is a
forum for researchers who seek to reflect mathematical phenomena in data and
control.
  The sixth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming was
held on 8th April 2016 as a part of ETAPS 2016 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
There were five contributed talks and one invited talk.

 <dc:title>Large-Scale Electron Microscopy Image Segmentation in Spark</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The emerging field of connectomics aims to unlock the mysteries of the brain
by understanding the connectivity between neurons. To map this connectivity, we
acquire thousands of electron microscopy (EM) images with nanometer-scale
resolution. After aligning these images, the resulting dataset has the
potential to reveal the shapes of neurons and the synaptic connections between
them. However, imaging the brain of even a tiny organism like the fruit fly
yields terabytes of data. It can take years of manual effort to examine such
image volumes and trace their neuronal connections. One solution is to apply
image segmentation algorithms to help automate the tracing tasks. In this
paper, we propose a novel strategy to apply such segmentation on very large
datasets that exceed the capacity of a single machine. Our solution is robust
to potential segmentation errors which could otherwise severely compromise the
quality of the overall segmentation, for example those due to poor classifier
generalizability or anomalies in the image dataset. We implement our algorithms
in a Spark application which minimizes disk I/O, and apply them to a few large
EM datasets, revealing both their effectiveness and scalability. We hope this
work will encourage external contributions to EM segmentation by providing 1) a
flexible plugin architecture that deploys easily on different cluster
environments and 2) an in-memory representation of segmentation that could be
conducive to new advances.

 <dc:description>  A massive current research effort focuses on combining pre-existing
'Intranets' of Things into one Internet of Things. However, this unification is
not a panacea; it will expose new attack surfaces and vectors, just as it
enables new applications. We therefore urgently need a model of security in the
Internet of Things. In this regard, we note that IoT descends directly from
pre-existing research (in embedded Internet and pervasive intelligence), so
there exist several bodies of related work: security in RFID, sensor networks,
cyber-physical systems, and so on. In this paper, we survey the existing
literature on RFID and WSN security, as a step to compiling all known attacks
and defenses relevant to the Internet of Things.

 <dc:description>  Origin-Destination Matrix (ODM) estimation is a classical problem in
transport engineering aiming to recover flows from every Origin to every
Destination from measured traffic counts and a priori model information. In
addition to traffic counts, the present contribution takes advantage of probe
trajectories, whose capture is made possible by new measurement technologies.
It extends the concept of ODM to that of Link dependent ODM (LODM), keeping the
information about the flow distribution on links and containing inherently the
ODM assignment. Further, an original formulation of LODM estimation, from
traffic counts and probe trajectories is presented as an optimisation problem,
where the functional to be minimized consists of five convex functions, each
modelling a constraint or property of the transport problem: consistency with
traffic counts, consistency with sampled probe trajectories, consistency with
traffic conservation (Kirchhoff's law), similarity of flows having close
origins and destinations, positivity of traffic flows. A primal-dual algorithm
is devised to minimize the designed functional, as the corresponding objective
functions are not necessarily differentiable. A case study, on a simulated
network and traffic, validates the feasibility of the procedure and details its
benefits for the estimation of an LODM matching real-network constraints and
observations.

 <dc:title>Revisiting Summarization Evaluation for Scientific Articles</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Evaluation of text summarization approaches have been mostly based on metrics
that measure similarities of system generated summaries with a set of human
written gold-standard summaries. The most widely used metric in summarization
evaluation has been the ROUGE family. ROUGE solely relies on lexical overlaps
between the terms and phrases in the sentences; therefore, in cases of
terminology variations and paraphrasing, ROUGE is not as effective. Scientific
article summarization is one such case that is different from general domain
summarization (e.g. newswire data). We provide an extensive analysis of ROUGE's
effectiveness as an evaluation metric for scientific summarization; we show
that, contrary to the common belief, ROUGE is not much reliable in evaluating
scientific summaries. We furthermore show how different variants of ROUGE
result in very different correlations with the manual Pyramid scores. Finally,
we propose an alternative metric for summarization evaluation which is based on
the content relevance between a system generated summary and the corresponding
human written summaries. We call our metric SERA (Summarization Evaluation by
Relevance Analysis). Unlike ROUGE, SERA consistently achieves high correlations
with manual scores which shows its effectiveness in evaluation of scientific
article summarization.

 <dc:title>Structure from Motion on a Sphere</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ventura, Jonathan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe a special case of structure from motion where the camera rotates
on a sphere. The camera's optical axis lies perpendicular to the sphere's
surface. In this case, the camera's pose is minimally represented by three
rotation parameters. From analysis of the epipolar geometry we derive a novel
and efficient solution for the essential matrix relating two images, requiring
only three point correspondences in the minimal case. We apply this solver in a
structure-from-motion pipeline that aggregates pairwise relations by rotation
averaging followed by bundle adjustment with an inverse depth parameterization.
Our methods enable scene modeling with an outward-facing camera and object
scanning with an inward-facing camera.

 <dc:description>  Our paper contributes to the literature recommending approaches to make
online reviews more credible and representative. We analyze data from four
diverse major online retailers and find that verified customers who are
prompted (by an email) to write a review, submit, on average, up to 0.5 star
higher ratings than self-motivated web reviewers. Moreover, these
email-prompted reviews remain stable over time, whereas web reviews exhibit a
downward trend. This finding provides support for the existence of social
influence and selection biases during the submission of a web review, when
social signals are being displayed. In contrast, no information about the
current state of the reviews is displayed in the email promptings. Moreover, we
find that when a retailer decides to start sending email promptings, the
existing population of web reviewers is unaffected both in their volume as well
as the characteristics of their submitted reviews. We explore how our combined
findings can suggest ways to mitigate various biases that govern online review
submissions and help practitioners provide more credible, representative and
higher ratings to their customers.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the modeling of opinion dynamics over time
dependent large scale networks. A kinetic description of the agents'
distribution over the evolving network is considered which combines an opinion
update based on binary interactions between agents with a dynamic creation and
removal process of new connections. The number of connections of each agent
influences the spreading of opinions in the network but also the way
connections are created is influenced by the agents' opinion. The evolution of
the network of connections is studied by showing that its asymptotic behavior
is consistent both with Poisson distributions and truncated power-laws. In
order to study the large time behavior of the opinion dynamics a mean field
description is derived which allows to compute exact stationary solutions in
some simplified situations. Numerical methods which are capable to describe
correctly the large time behavior of the system are also introduced and
discussed. Finally, several numerical examples showing the influence of the
agents' number of connections in the opinion dynamics are reported.

 <dc:description>  The problem of recovering complex signals from low quality sensing devices is
analyzed via a combination of tools from signal processing and harmonic
analysis. By using the rich structure offered by the recent development in
fusion frames, we introduce a framework for splitting the complex information
into local pieces. Each piece of information is measured by potentially very
low quality sensors, modeled by linear matrices and recovered via compressed
sensing -- when necessary. Finally, by a fusion process within the fusion
frames, we are able to recover accurately the original high-dimensional signal.
  Using our new method, we show, and illustrate on simple numerical examples,
that it is possible, and sometimes necessary, to split a signal via local
projections for accurate, stable, and robust estimation. In particular, we show
that by increasing the size of the fusion frame, we encourage a certain
robustness to noise. While the computational complexity remains relatively low,
we achieve stronger recovery performance compared to usual single-device
compressed sensing systems.

for various tasks, a systematic comparison of the possible approaches is
lacking in the literature. We perform an extensive evaluation of four popular
approaches of inducing cross-lingual embeddings, each requiring a different
form of supervision, on four typographically different language pairs. Our
evaluation setup spans four different tasks, including intrinsic evaluation on
mono-lingual and cross-lingual similarity, and extrinsic evaluation on
downstream semantic and syntactic applications. We show that models which
require expensive cross-lingual knowledge almost always perform better, but
cheaply supervised models often prove competitive on certain tasks.

 <dc:title>Leaving Some Stones Unturned: Dynamic Feature Prioritization for

 <dc:creator>Su, Yu-Chuan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Grauman, Kristen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Current approaches for activity recognition often ignore constraints on
computational resources: 1) they rely on extensive feature computation to
obtain rich descriptors on all frames, and 2) they assume batch-mode access to
the entire test video at once. We propose a new active approach to activity
recognition that prioritizes &quot;what to compute when&quot; in order to make timely
predictions. The main idea is to learn a policy that dynamically schedules the
sequence of features to compute on selected frames of a given test video. In
contrast to traditional static feature selection, our approach continually
re-prioritizes computation based on the accumulated history of observations and
accounts for the transience of those observations in ongoing video. We develop
variants to handle both the batch and streaming settings. On two challenging
datasets, our method provides significantly better accuracy than alternative
techniques for a wide range of computational budgets.

 <dc:description>  Model compression and knowledge distillation have been successfully applied
for cross-architecture and cross-domain transfer learning. However, a key
requirement is that training examples are in correspondence across the domains.
We show that in many scenarios of practical importance such aligned data can be
synthetically generated using computer graphics pipelines allowing domain
adaptation through distillation. We apply this technique to learn models for
recognizing low-resolution images using labeled high-resolution images,
non-localized objects using labeled localized objects, line-drawings using
labeled color images, etc. Experiments on various fine-grained recognition
datasets demonstrate that the technique improves recognition performance on the
low-quality data and beats strong baselines for domain adaptation. Finally, we
present insights into workings of the technique through visualizations and
relating it to existing literature.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an approach to solve the nonconvex optimization problem that
arises when designing the transmit covariance matrices in multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast networks implementing
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The MIMO SWIPT
problem is formulated as a general multi-objective optimization problem, in
which data rates and harvested powers are optimized simultaneously. Two
different approaches are applied to reformulate the (nonconvex) multi-objective
problem. In the first approach, the transmitter can control the specific amount
of power to be harvested by power transfer whereas in the second approach the
transmitter can only control the proportion of power to be harvested among the
different harvesting users. The computational complexity will also be
different, with higher computational resources required in the first approach.
In order to solve the resulting formulations, we propose to use the
majorization-minimization (MM) approach. The idea behind this approach is to
obtain a convex function that approximates the nonconvex objective and, then,
solve a series of convex subproblems that will converge to a locally optimal
solution of the general nonconvex multi-objective problem. The solution
obtained from the MM approach is compared to the classical
block-diagonalization (BD) strategy, typically used to solve the nonconvex
multiuser MIMO network by forcing no interference among users. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach improves over the BD approach both the
system sum rate and the power harvested by users. Additionally, the
computational times needed for convergence of the proposed methods are much
lower than the ones required for classical gradient-based approaches.

large dynamic networks, computing and maintaining a set of spanning trees is
not efficient, as the network-topology may change frequently. In this paper we
design a class of dynamic algorithms which makes packet-by-packet schedul- ing
and routing decisions and thus obviates the need for maintaining any global
topological structures, such as span- ning trees. Our algorithms may be
conveniently understood as a non-trivial generalization of the familiar
back-pressure algorithm which makes unicast packet routing and schedul- ing
decisions, based on queue-length information, without maintaining end-to-end
paths. However, in the broadcast problem, it is hard to define queuing
structures due to ab- sence of a work-conservation principle which results from
packet duplications. We design and prove the optimality of a virtual-queue
based algorithm, where a virtual-queue is de- fined for subsets of vertices. We
then propose a multi-class broadcast policy which combines the above scheduling
algo- rithm with a class-based in-order packet delivery constraint, resulting
in significant reduction in complexity. Finally, we evaluate performance of the
proposed algorithms via exten- sive numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve
robust 3D reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network
architecture that we call the 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Neural Network
(3D-R2N2). The network learns a mapping from images of objects to their
underlying 3D shapes from a large collection of synthetic data. Our network
takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and
outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid.
Unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image
annotations or object class labels for training or testing. Our extensive
experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework i) outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and ii) enables
the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM
methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).

 <dc:title>Explicit constructions of high-rate MDS array codes with optimal repair

 <dc:description>  Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are optimal error-correcting codes in
the sense that they provide the maximum failure-tolerance for a given number of
parity nodes. Suppose that an MDS code with $k$ information nodes and $r=n-k$
parity nodes is used to encode data in a distributed storage system. It is
known that if $h$ out of the $n$ nodes are inaccessible and $d$ surviving
(helper) nodes are used to recover the lost data, then we need to download at
least $h/(d+h-k)$ fraction of the data stored in each of the helper nodes
(Dimakis et. al., 2010 and Cadambe et al., 2013). If this lower bound is
achieved for the repair of any $h$ erased nodes from any $d$ helper nodes, we
say that the MDS code has the $(h,d)$-optimal repair property.
  We study high-rate MDS array codes with the optimal repair property. Explicit
constructions of such codes in the literature are only available for the cases
where there are at most 3 parity nodes, and these existing constructions can
only optimally repair a single node failure by accessing all the surviving
nodes.
  In this paper, given any $r$ and $n$, we present two explicit constructions
of MDS array codes with the $(h,d)$-optimal repair property for all $h\le r$
and $k\le d\le n-h$ simultaneously. Codes in the first family can be
constructed over any base field $F$ as long as $|F|\ge sn,$ where
$s=\text{lcm}(1,2,\dots,r).$ The encoding, decoding, repair of failed nodes,
and update procedures of these codes all have low complexity. Codes in the
second family have the optimal access property and can be constructed over any
base field $F$ as long as $|F|\ge n+1.$ Moreover, both code families have the
optimal error resilience capability when repairing failed nodes. We also
construct several other related families of MDS codes with the optimal repair
property.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate stability of a class of analytic neural
networks with the synaptic feedback via event-triggered rules. This model is
general and include Hopfield neural network as a special case. These
event-trigger rules can efficiently reduces loads of computation and
information transmission at synapses of the neurons. The synaptic feedback of
each neuron keeps a constant value based on the outputs of the other neurons at
its latest triggering time but changes at its next triggering time, which is
determined by certain criterion. It is proved that every trajectory of the
analytic neural network converges to certain equilibrium under this
event-triggered rule for all initial values except a set of zero measure. The
main technique of the proof is the Lojasiewicz inequality to prove the
finiteness of trajectory length. The realization of this event-triggered rule
is verified by the exclusion of Zeno behaviors. Numerical examples are provided
to illustrate the efficiency of the theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  We study the stability of networks of multi-agent systems with local pinning
strategies and two types of time delays, namely the transmission delay in the
network and the pinning delay of the controllers. Sufficient conditions for
stability are derived under specific scenarios by computing or estimating the
dominant eigenvalue of the characteristic equation. In addition, controlling
the network by pinning a single node is studied. Moreover, perturbation methods
are employed to derive conditions in the limit of small and large pinning
strengths.Numerical algorithms are proposed to verify stability, and simulation
examples are presented to confirm the efficiency of analytic results.

 <dc:description>  Modern NLP models rely heavily on engineered features, which often combine
word and contextual information into complex lexical features. Such combination
results in large numbers of features, which can lead to over-fitting. We
present a new model that represents complex lexical features---comprised of
parts for words, contextual information and labels---in a tensor that captures
conjunction information among these parts. We apply low-rank tensor
approximations to the corresponding parameter tensors to reduce the parameter
space and improve prediction speed. Furthermore, we investigate two methods for
handling features that include $n$-grams of mixed lengths. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art results on tasks in relation extraction, PP-attachment, and
preposition disambiguation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we discuss the outer-synchronization of the asymmetrically
connected recurrent time-varying neural networks. By both centralized and
decentralized discretization data sampling principles, we derive several
sufficient conditions based on diverse vector norms that guarantee that any two
trajectories from different initial values of the identical neural network
system converge together. The lower bounds of the common time intervals between
data samples in centralized and decentralized principles are proved to be
positive, which guarantees exclusion of Zeno behavior. A numerical example is
provided to illustrate the efficiency of the theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the application of fact-level image understanding, we present an
automatic method for data collection of structured visual facts from images
with captions. Example structured facts include attributed objects (e.g.,
&lt;flower, red&gt;), actions (e.g., &lt;baby, smile&gt;), interactions (e.g., &lt;man,
walking, dog&gt;), and positional information (e.g., &lt;vase, on, table&gt;). The
collected annotations are in the form of fact-image pairs (e.g.,&lt;man, walking,
dog&gt; and an image region containing this fact). With a language approach, the
proposed method is able to collect hundreds of thousands of visual fact
annotations with accuracy of 83% according to human judgment. Our method
automatically collected more than 380,000 visual fact annotations and more than
110,000 unique visual facts from images with captions and localized them in
images in less than one day of processing time on standard CPU platforms.

 <dc:description>  We investigate critical behaviors of a social contagion model on weighted
networks. An edge-weight compartmental approach is applied to analyze the
weighted social contagion on strongly heterogenous networks with skewed degree
and weight distributions. We find that degree heterogeneity can not only alter
the nature of contagion transition from discontinuous to continuous but also
can enhance or hamper the size of adoption, depending on the unit transmission
probability. We also show that, the heterogeneity of weight distribution always
hinder social contagions, and does not alter the transition type.

 <dc:title>Overlay Text Extraction From TV News Broadcast</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The text data present in overlaid bands convey brief descriptions of news
events in broadcast videos. The process of text extraction becomes challenging
as overlay text is presented in widely varying formats and often with animation
effects. We note that existing edge density based methods are well suited for
our application on account of their simplicity and speed of operation. However,
these methods are sensitive to thresholds and have high false positive rates.
In this paper, we present a contrast enhancement based preprocessing stage for
overlay text detection and a parameter free edge density based scheme for
efficient text band detection. The second contribution of this paper is a novel
approach for multiple text region tracking with a formal identification of all
possible detection failure cases. The tracking stage enables us to establish
the temporal presence of text bands and their linking over time. The third
contribution is the adoption of Tesseract OCR for the specific task of overlay
text recognition using web news articles. The proposed approach is tested and
found superior on news videos acquired from three Indian English television
news channels along with benchmark datasets.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article, we are concerned with tracking an object of interest in
video stream. We propose an algorithm that is robust against occlusion, the
presence of confusing colors, abrupt changes in the object feature space and
changes in object size. We develop the algorithm within a Bayesian modeling
framework. The state space model is used for capturing the temporal correlation
in the sequence of frame images by modeling the underlying dynamics of the
tracking system. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) strategy is proposed for
fusing multi-clue information in the observations. Any number of object
features are allowed to be involved in the proposed framework. Every feature
represents one source of information to be fused and is associated with an
observation model. The state inference is performed by employing the particle
filter methods. In comparison with related approaches, the BMA based tracker is
shown to have robustness, expressivity, and comprehensibility.

 <dc:title>State Space Model based Trust Evaluation over Wireless Sensor Networks:
  An Iterative Particle Filter Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a state space modeling approach for trust evaluation
in wireless sensor networks. In our state space trust model (SSTM), each sensor
node is associated with a trust metric, which measures to what extent the data
transmitted from this node would better be trusted by the server node. Given
the SSTM, we translate the trust evaluation problem to be a nonlinear state
filtering problem. To estimate the state based on the SSTM, a component-wise
iterative state inference procedure is proposed to work in tandem with the
particle filter, and thus the resulting algorithm is termed as iterative
particle filter (IPF). The computational complexity of the IPF algorithm is
theoretically linearly related with the dimension of the state. This property
is desirable especially for high dimensional trust evaluation and state
filtering problems. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by
both simulations and real data analysis.

 <dc:description>  In this work, connected cubic planar bipartite graphs and related binary
self-dual codes are studied. Binary self-dual codes of length 16 are obtained
by face-vertex incidence matrices of these graphs. By considering their lifts
to the ring R_2 new extremal binary self-dual codes of lengths 64 are
constructed as Gray images. More precisely, we construct 15 new codes of length
64. Moreover, 10 new codes of length 66 were obtained by applying a building-up
construction to the binary codes. Codes with these weight enumerators are
constructed for the first time in the literature. The results are tabulated.

 <dc:description>  Discovering communities in complex networks helps to understand the behaviour
of the network. Some works in this promising research area exist, but
communities uncovering in time-dependent and/or multiplex networks has not
deeply investigated yet. In this paper, we propose a communities detection
approach for multislice networks based on modularity optimization. We first
present a method to reduce the network size that still preserves modularity.
Then we introduce an algorithm that approximates modularity optimization (as
usually adopted) for multislice networks, thus finding communities. The network
size reduction allows us to maintain acceptable performances without affecting
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  With the growth of communication over computer networks, how to maintain the
confidentiality and security of transmitted information have become some of the
important issues. In order to transfer data securely to the destination without
unwanted disclosure or damage, nature inspired hide and seek tricks such as,
cryptography and Steganography are heavily in use. Just like the Chameleon and
many other bio-species those change their body color and hide themselves in the
background in order to protect them from external attacks, Cryptography and
Steganography are techniques those are used to encrypt and hide the secret data
inside other media to ensure data security. This paper discusses the concept of
a simple spatial domain LSB Steganography that encrypts the secrets using
Fibonacci- Lucas transformation, before hiding, for better security.

 <dc:title>A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Cardiac Segmentation in
  Short-Axis MRI</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tran, Phi Vu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Automated cardiac segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging datasets is an
essential step in the timely diagnosis and management of cardiac pathologies.
We propose to tackle the problem of automated left and right ventricle
segmentation through the application of a deep fully convolutional neural
network architecture. Our model is efficiently trained end-to-end in a single
learning stage from whole-image inputs and ground truths to make inference at
every pixel. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a fully
convolutional neural network architecture for pixel-wise labeling in cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our model is
robust to outperform previous fully automated methods across multiple
evaluation measures on a range of cardiac datasets. Moreover, our model is fast
and can leverage commodity compute resources such as the graphics processing
unit to enable state-of-the-art cardiac segmentation at massive scales. The
models and code are available at

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a strategy for a group of deaf and dumb robots, carrying
clocks from different countries, to meet at a geographical location which is
not fixed in advanced. The robots act independently. They can observe others,
compute some locations and walk towards those locations. They can only get a
snapshot of the locations of other robots but can not detect whether they are
static or in motion. The robots are forgetful; once they have completed their
motion they forget their previous locations and observations. Again they decide
new destinations to move to. Eventually all the robots compute the same
destination and meet there. There exists no global positioning system. As they
stand, they agree on up and down directions. However, as they do not have any
compass, the other directions are not agreed upon. They also do not agree on
the clockwise direction. For determining a strategy, we imagine the robots to
be points on a three dimensional plane where all the robots are mutually
visible to each other always. The strategy we propose has to be obeyed by all
the robots independently with respect to their own clock and compass. Initially
the robots start from distinct locations. Some dead robots may be present in
the system or some may die any time before or after the get together. However,
the live robots are not aware of the presence of these dead robots.

 <dc:description>  Instruction-Level Redundancy (ILR) is a well-known approach to tolerate
transient CPU faults. It replicates instructions in a program and inserts
periodic checks to detect and correct CPU faults using majority voting, which
essentially requires three copies of each instruction and leads to high
performance overheads. As SIMD technology can operate simultaneously on several
copies of the data, it appears to be a good candidate for decreasing these
overheads. To verify this hypothesis, we propose Elzar, a compiler framework
that transforms unmodified multithreaded applications to support triple modular
redundancy using Intel AVX extensions for vectorization. Our experience with
several benchmark suites and real-world case-studies yields mixed results:
while SIMD may be beneficial for some workloads, e.g., CPU-intensive ones with
many floating-point operations, it exhibits higher overhead than ILR in many
applications we tested. We study the sources of overheads and discuss possible
improvements to Intel AVX that would lead to better performance.

 <dc:description>  This work, concerning paraphrase identification task, on one hand contributes
to expanding deep learning embeddings to include continuous and discontinuous

 <dc:title>Towards an accurate solution of wireless network design problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The optimal design of wireless networks has been widely studied in the
literature and many optimization models have been proposed over the years.
However, most models directly include the signal-to-interference ratios
representing service coverage conditions. This leads to mixed-integer linear
programs with constraint matrices containing tiny coefficients that vary widely
in their order of magnitude. These formulations are known to be challenging
even for state-of-the-art solvers: the standard numerical precision supported
by these solvers is usually not sufficient to reliably guarantee feasible
solutions. Service coverage errors are thus commonly present. Though these
numerical issues are known and become evident even for small-sized instances,
just a very limited number of papers has tried to tackle them, by mainly
investigating alternative non-compact formulations in which the sources of
numerical instabilities are eliminated. In this work, we explore a new approach
by investigating how recent advances in exact solution algorithms for linear
and mixed-integer programs over the rational numbers can be applied to analyze
and tackle the numerical difficulties arising in wireless network design
models.

 <dc:title>On the Dual of the Coulter-Matthews Bent Functions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For any bent function, it is very interesting to determine its dual function
because the dual function is also bent in certain cases. For $k$ odd and
$\gcd(n, k)=1$, it is known that the Coulter-Matthews bent function
$f(x)=Tr(ax^{\frac{3^k+1}{2}})$ is weakly regular bent over $\mathbb{F}_{3^n}$,
where $a\in\mathbb{F}_{3^n}^{*}$, and
$Tr(\cdot):\mathbb{F}_{3^n}\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_3$ is the trace function. In
this paper, we investigate the dual function of $f(x)$, and dig out an
universal formula. In particular, for two cases, we determine the formula
explicitly: for the case of $n=3t+1$ and $k=2t+1$ with $t\geq 2$, the dual
function is given by
$$Tr\left(-\frac{x^{3^{2t+1}+3^{t+1}+2}}{a^{3^{2t+1}+3^{t+1}+1}}-\frac{x^{3^{2t}+1}}{a^{-3^{2t}+3^{t}+1}}+\frac{x^{2}}{a^{-3^{2t+1}+3^{t+1}+1}}\right);$$
and for the case of $n=3t+2$ and $k=2t+1$ with $t\geq 2$, the dual function is
given by
$$Tr\left(-\frac{x^{3^{2t+2}+1}}{a^{3^{2t+2}-3^{t+1}+3}}-\frac{x^{2\cdot3^{2t+1}+3^{t+1}+1}}{a^{3^{2t+2}+3^{t+1}+1}}+\frac{x^2}{a^{-3^{2t+2}+3^{t+1}+3}}\right).$$
As a byproduct, we find two new classes of ternary bent functions with only
three terms. Moreover, we also prove that in certain cases $f(x)$ is regular
bent.

 <dc:title>A Decomposition Approach to Solve The Quay Crane Scheduling Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this work we propose a decomposition approach to solve the quay crane
scheduling problem. This is an important maritime transportation problem faced
in container terminals where quay cranes are used to handle cargo. The
objective is to determine a sequence of loading and unloading operations for
each crane in order to minimize the completion time. We solve a mixed integer
programming formulation for the quay crane scheduling problem, decomposing it
into a vehicle routing problem and a corresponding scheduling problem. The
routing sub-problem is solved by minimizing the longest crane completion time
without taking crane interference into account. This solution provides a lower
bound for the makespan of the whole problem and is sent to the scheduling
sub-problem, where a completion time for each task and the makespan are
determined. This scheme resembles Benders' decomposition and, in particular,
the scheme underlying combinatorial Benders' cuts. We evaluate the proposed
approach by solving instances from the literature and comparing the results
with other available methods.

 <dc:description>  Color image segmentation is a crucial step in many computer vision and
pattern recognition applications. This article introduces an adaptive and
unsupervised clustering approach based on Voronoi regions, which can be applied
to solve the color image segmentation problem. The proposed method performs
region splitting and merging within Voronoi regions of the Dirichlet
Tessellated image (also called a Voronoi diagram) , which improves the
efficiency and the accuracy of the number of clusters and cluster centroids
estimation process. Furthermore, the proposed method uses cluster centroid
proximity to merge proximal clusters in order to find the final number of
clusters and cluster centroids. In contrast to the existing adaptive
unsupervised cluster-based image segmentation algorithms, the proposed method
uses K-means clustering algorithm in place of the Fuzzy C-means algorithm to
find the final segmented image. The proposed method was evaluated on three
different unsupervised image segmentation evaluation benchmarks and its results
were compared with two other adaptive unsupervised cluster-based image
segmentation algorithms. The experimental results reported in this article
confirm that the proposed method outperforms the existing algorithms in terms
of the quality of image segmentation results. Also, the proposed method results
in the lowest average execution time per image compared to the existing methods
reported in this article.

 <dc:description>  The decision variable selection policy used by the most competitive CDCL
(Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) SAT solvers is either VSIDS (Variable State
Independent Decaying Sum) or its variants such as exponential version EVSIDS.
The common characteristic of VSIDS and its variants is to make use of
statistical information in the solving process, but ignore structure
information of the problem. For this reason, this paper modifies the decision
variable selection policy, and presents a SAT solving technique based on BCD
(Blocked Clause Decomposition). Its basic idea is that a part of decision
variables are selected by VSIDS heuristic, while another part of decision
variables are selected by blocked sets that are obtained by BCD. Compared with
the existing BCD-based technique, our technique is simple, and need not to
reencode CNF formulas. SAT solvers for certified UNSAT track can apply also our
BCD-based technique. Our experiments on application benchmarks demonstrate that
the new variables selection policy based on BCD can increase the performance of
SAT solvers such as abcdSAT. The solver with BCD solved an instance from the
SAT Race 2015 that was not solved by any solver so far. This shows that in some
cases, the heuristic based on structure information is more efficient than that
based on statistical information.

 <dc:title>Decomposing Linearly Constrained Nonconvex Problems by a Proximal Primal
  Dual Approach: Algorithms, Convergence, and Applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hong, Mingyi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new decomposition approach named the proximal
primal dual algorithm (Prox-PDA) for smooth nonconvex linearly constrained
optimization problems. The proposed approach is primal-dual based, where the
primal step minimizes certain approximation of the augmented Lagrangian of the
problem, and the dual step performs an approximate dual ascent. The
approximation used in the primal step is able to decompose the variable blocks,
making it possible to obtain simple subproblems by leveraging the problem
structures. Theoretically, we show that whenever the penalty parameter in the
augmented Lagrangian is larger than a given threshold, the Prox-PDA converges
to the set of stationary solutions, globally and in a sublinear manner (i.e.,
certain measure of stationarity decreases in the rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/r)$,
where $r$ is the iteration counter). Interestingly, when applying a variant of
the Prox-PDA to the problem of distributed nonconvex optimization (over a
connected undirected graph), the resulting algorithm coincides with the popular
EXTRA algorithm [Shi et al 2014], which is only known to work in convex cases.
Our analysis implies that EXTRA and its variants converge globally sublinearly
to stationary solutions of certain nonconvex distributed optimization problem.
There are many possible extensions of the Prox-PDA, and we present one
particular extension to certain nonconvex distributed matrix factorization
problem.

 <dc:description>  There is considerable uncertainty about what properties, capabilities and
motivations future AGIs will have. In some plausible scenarios, AGIs may pose
security risks arising from accidents and defects. In order to mitigate these
risks, prudent early AGI research teams will perform significant testing on
their creations before use. Unfortunately, if an AGI has human-level or greater
intelligence, testing itself may not be safe; some natural AGI goal systems
create emergent incentives for AGIs to tamper with their test environments,
make copies of themselves on the internet, or convince developers and operators
to do dangerous things. In this paper, we survey the AGI containment problem -
the question of how to build a container in which tests can be conducted safely
and reliably, even on AGIs with unknown motivations and capabilities that could
be dangerous. We identify requirements for AGI containers, available
mechanisms, and weaknesses that need to be addressed.

 <dc:description>  Analysis of static bending, free vibration and buckling behaviours of
functionally graded microplates is investigated in this study. The main idea is
to use the isogeometric analysis in associated with novel four-variable refined
plate theory and quasi-3D theory. More importantly, the modified couple stress
theory with only one material length scale parameter is employed to effectively
capture the size-dependent effects within the microplates. Meanwhile, the
quasi-3D theory which is constructed from a novel seventh-order shear
deformation refined plate theory with four unknowns is able to consider both
shear deformations and thickness stretching effect without requiring shear
correction factors. The NURBS-based isogeometric analysis is integrated to
exactly describe the geometry and approximately calculate the unknown fields
with higher-order derivative and continuity requirements. The convergence and
verification show the validity and efficiency of this proposed computational
approach in comparison with those existing in the literature. It is further
applied to study the static bending, free vibration and buckling responses of
rectangular and circular functionally graded microplates with various types of
boundary conditions. A number of investigations are also conducted to
illustrate the effects of the material length scale, material index, and
length-to-thickness ratios on the responses of the microplates.

 <dc:description>  In this research, feedforward ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model is
developed and validated for predicting the pH at 10 different locations of the
distribution system of drinking water of Hyderabad city. The developed model is
MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) with back propagation algorithm.The data for the
training and testing of the model are collected through an experimental
analysis on weekly basis in a routine examination for maintaining the quality
of drinking water in the city. 17 parameters are taken into consideration
including pH. These all parameters are taken as input variables for the model
and then pH is predicted for 03 phases;raw water of river Indus,treated water
in the treatment plants and then treated water in the distribution system of
drinking water. The training and testing results of this model reveal that MLP
neural networks are exceedingly extrapolative for predicting the pH of river
water, untreated and treated water at all locations of the distribution system
of drinking water of Hyderabad city. The optimum input and output weights are
generated with minimum MSE (Mean Square Error) &lt; 5%.Experimental, predicted and
tested values of pH are plotted and the effectiveness of the model is
determined by calculating the coefficient of correlation (R2=0.999) of trained
and tested results.

 <dc:description>  In the recent years it can be observed increasing popularity of parallel
processing using multi-core processors, local clusters, GPU and others.
Moreover, currently one of the main requirements the IT users is the reduction
of maintaining cost of the computer infrastructure. It causes that the
performance evaluation of the parallel applications becomes one of the most
important problem. Then obtained results allows efficient use of available
resources. In traditional methods of performance evaluation the results are
based on wall-clock time measurements. This approach requires consecutive
application executions and includes a time-consuming data analysis. In the
paper an alternative approach is proposed. The decomposition of parallel
application execution time onto computation time and overheads related to
parallel execution is use to calculate the granularity of application and then
determine its efficiency. Finally the application scalability can be evaluates.

 <dc:description>  MPC (Model Predictive Control) techniques, with constraints, are applied to a
nonlinear vehicle model for the development of an ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control)
system for transitional manoeuvres. The dynamic model of the vehicle is
developed in the continuous-time domain and captures the real dynamics of the
sub-vehicle models for steady-state and transient operations. A parametric
study for the MPC method is conducted to analyse the response of the ACC
vehicle for critical manoeuvres. The simulation results show the significant
sensitivity of the response of the vehicle model with ACC to controller
parameter and comparisons are made with a previous study. Furthermore, the
approach adopted in this work is believed to reflect the control actions taken
by a real vehicle.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the design of AQM (Active
Queue Management) controllers. The purpose of these controllers is to manage
the network congestion under varying loads, link delays and bandwidth. In this
paper, a new AQM controller is proposed which is trained by using the SVM
(Support Vector Machine) with the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernal. The
proposed controller is called the support vector based AQM (SAM) controller.
The performance of the proposed controller has been compared with three
conventional AQM controllers, namely the Random Early Detection, Blue and
Proportional Plus Integral Controller. The preliminary simulation studies show
that the performance of the proposed controller is comparable to the
conventional controllers. However, the proposed controller is more efficient in
controlling the queue size than the conventional controllers.

 <dc:description>  In most digital communication systems, bandwidth limited channel along with
multipath propagation causes ISI (Inter Symbol Interference) to occur. This
phenomenon causes distortion of the given transmitted symbol due to other
transmitted symbols. With the help of equalization ISI can be reduced. This
paper presents a solution to the ISI problem by performing blind equalization
using ANN (Artificial Neural Networks). The simulated network is a multilayer
feedforward Perceptron ANN, which has been trained by utilizing the error
back-propagation algorithm. The weights of the network are updated in
accordance with training of the network. This paper presents a very effective
method for blind channel equalization, being more efficient than the
pre-existing algorithms. The obtained results show a visible reduction in the

 <dc:description>  We present a model for pragmatically describing scenes, in which contrastive
behavior results from a combination of inference-driven pragmatics and learned
semantics. Like previous learned approaches to language generation, our model
uses a simple feature-driven architecture (here a pair of neural &quot;listener&quot; and
&quot;speaker&quot; models) to ground language in the world. Like inference-driven
approaches to pragmatics, our model actively reasons about listener behavior
when selecting utterances. For training, our approach requires only ordinary
captions, annotated _without_ demonstration of the pragmatic behavior the model
ultimately exhibits. In human evaluations on a referring expression game, our
approach succeeds 81% of the time, compared to a 69% success rate using
existing techniques.

 <dc:title>An Empirical Study of Irregular AG Block Turbo Codes over Fading

 <dc:creator>Alzubi, Omar A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This study will present the design, construction and implementation of
Algebraic Geometric Irregular Block Turbo Codes (AGIBTCs). Furthermore, we will
evaluate its performance over fast fading channels using different modulation
schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM). The idea behind the design of AGIBTC is
to overcome the high system complexity of Algebraic Geometric Block Turbo Codes
(AGBTCs) while maintaining a high Bit-Error Rate (BER) performance. This design
is inspired by the idea of unequal protection of information symbols which is
the core of IBTCs. Our experiments conducted over the worst case of fading
channels which is the fast fading channels; and this is done in order to show
the magnitude of gain in BER or the reduction in system complexity that can be
achieved by this design. Our experiments shows that despite a very slight
negative gain over BPSK and QPSK modulation schemes the system complexity is
significantly reduced. However, when applying higher modulation schemes a gain
in both BER and system complexity are achieved.

CBSCM, it has capability of capturing channel variations along time or
frequency and along space simultaneously. It has a simplified analytical
expression, still being able to simulate underlying physical phenomena which
otherwise need a complex geometry based stochastic channel model (GBSCM). The
channel model is verified with reported measurement data of channel for massive
MIMO. Spatial determinism in channel, the basic cause of unfavorable
propagation, is modeled into controlling parameters of channel model. Channel
model uses only three controlling parameters; one parameter describes variation
in channel along resource block (along time or frequency) and remaining two
parameters describe spatial variation in channel. Modeling of simultaneous
variation along time and space belongs to a very common scenario where mobility
of mobile terminal and angular power distribution at base station receiver, are
key parameters. Additionally, simulation results reveal the hidden advantages
of spatial determinism in channel for multiuser massive MIMO.

 <dc:title>Continuity bounds for information characteristics of quantum channels

 <dc:subject>Mathematical Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show how to use properties of the quantum conditional mutual information
to obtain continuity bounds for information characteristics of quantum channels
depending on their input dimension.
  First we prove tight estimates for variation of the output Holevo quantity
with respect to simultaneous variations of a channel and of an input ensemble.
  Then we obtain tight continuity bounds for output conditional mutual
information for a single channel and for $n$ copies of a channel.
  As a result tight and close-to-tight continuity bounds for basic capacities
of quantum channels depending on the input dimension are obtained. They
complement the Leung-Smith continuity bounds depending on the output dimension.

 <dc:description>  AsicBoost is a method to speed up Bitcoin mining by a factor of approximately
20%. The performance gain is achieved through a high-level optimization of the
Bitcoin mining algorithm which allows for drastic reduction in gate count on
the mining chip. AsicBoost is applicable to all types of mining hardware and
chip designs. This paper presents the idea behind the method and describes the
information flow in implementations of AsicBoost.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of throughput-optimal broadcast- ing in time-varying
wireless networks, whose underlying topology is restricted to Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAG). Previous broadcast algorithms route packets along spanning trees.
In large networks with time-varying connectivities, these trees are difficult
to compute and maintain. In this paper we propose a new online
throughput-optimal broadcast algorithm which makes packet-by-packet scheduling
and routing decisions, obviating the need for maintaining any global
topological structures, such as spanning-trees. Our algorithm relies on
system-state information for making transmission decisions and hence, may be
thought of as a generalization of the well-known back-pressure algorithm which
makes point-to-point unicast transmission decisions based on queue-length
information, without requiring knowledge of end-to-end paths. Technically, the
back-pressure algorithm is derived by stochastically stabilizing the
network-queues. However, because of packet-duplications associated with
broadcast, the work-conservation principle is violated and queuing processes
are difficult to define in the broadcast problem. To address this fundamental
issue, we identify certain state-variables which behave like virtual queues in
the broadcast setting. By stochastically stabilizing these virtual queues, we
devise a throughput-optimal broadcast policy. We also derive new
characterizations of the broadcast-capacity of time-varying wireless DAGs and
derive an efficient algorithm to compute the capacity exactly under certain
assumptions of interference model, and a poly-time approximation algorithm for
computing the capacity under less restrictive assumptions.

 <dc:title>Elevated Multiplexing and Signal Space Partitioning in the 2 User MIMO
  IC with Partial CSIT</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yuan, Bofeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Jafar, Syed A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The $2$ user MIMO interference channel with arbitrary antenna configurations
is studied under arbitrary levels of partial CSIT for each of the channels, to
find the degrees of freedom (DoF) achievable by either user while the other
user achieves his full interference-free DoF. The goal is to gain new insights
due to the inclusion of MIMO (multiple antennas at both transmitters and
receivers) into the signal space partitioning schemes associated with partial
CSIT. An interesting idea that emerges from this study is &quot;elevated
multiplexing&quot; where the signals are split into streams and transmitted from
separate antennas at elevated power levels, which allows these signals to be
jointly decoded at one receiver which has fewer spatial dimensions with lower
interference floors, while another receiver is simultaneously able to
separately decode these signals with a higher interference floor but across a
greater number of spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find that there is a DoF
benefit from increasing the number of antennas at a transmitter even if that
transmitter already has more antennas than its desired receiver and has no
CSIT.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, statistical Quality of Service provisioning in next generation
heterogeneous mobile cellular networks is investigated. To this aim, any active
entity of the cellular network is regarded as a queuing system, whose
statistical QoS requirements depend on the specific application. In this
context, by quantifying the performance in terms of effective capacity, we
introduce a lower bound for the system performance that facilitates an
efficient analysis. We exploit this analytical framework to give insights about
the possible improvement of the statistical QoS experienced by the users if the
current heterogeneous cellular network architecture migrates from a Half Duplex
to a Full Duplex mode of operation. Numerical results and analysis are
provided, where the network is modeled as a Mat\'ern point processes with a
hard core distance. The results demonstrate the accuracy and computational
efficiency of the proposed scheme, especially in large scale wireless systems.

 <dc:description>  In this study, we propose a variation of the RAdNet for vehicular
environments (RAdNet-VE). The proposed scheme extends the message header,
mechanism for registering interest, and message forwarding mechanism of RAdNet.
To obtain results, we performed simulation experiments involving two use
scenarios and communication protocols developed from the Veins framework. Based
on results obtained from these experiments, we compare the performance of
RAdNet-VE against that of RAdNet, a basic content-centric network (CCN) using
reactive data routing, (CCN$_R$), and a basic CCN using proactive data routing,
CCN$_P$. These CCNs provide non-cacheable data services. Moreover, the
communication radio standards adopted in the scenarios 1 and 2 were
respectively IEEE 802.11n and IEEE 802.11p. The results shown that the
performance of the RAdNet-VE was superior to than those of RAdNet, CCN$_R$ and
CCN$_P$. In this sense, RAdNet-VE protocol (RVEP) presented low communication
latencies among nodes of just 20.4ms (scenario 1) and 2.87 ms (scenario 2). Our
protocol also presented high data delivery rates, i.e, 83.05\% (scenario 1) and
88.05\% (scenario 2). Based on these and other results presented in this study,
we argue that RAdNet-VE is a feasible alternative to CCNs as
information-centric network (ICN) model for VANET, because the RVEP satisfies
all of the necessary communication requirements.

 <dc:title>Preferential Attachment Model with Degree Bound and its Application to

 <dc:description>  Preferential attachment models have been widely studied in complex networks,
because they can explain the formation of many networks like social networks,
citation networks, power grids, and biological networks, to name a few.
Motivated by the application of key predistribution in wireless sensor networks
(WSN), we initiate the study of preferential attachment with degree bound.
  Our paper has two important contributions to two different areas. The first
is a contribution in the study of complex networks. We propose preferential
attachment model with degree bound for the first time. In the normal
preferential attachment model, the degree distribution follows a power law,
with many nodes of low degree and a few nodes of high degree. In our scheme,
the nodes can have a maximum degree $d_{\max}$, where $d_{\max}$ is an integer
chosen according to the application. The second is in the security of wireless
sensor networks. We propose a new key predistribution scheme based on the above
model. The important features of this model are that the network is fully
connected, it has fewer keys, has larger size of the giant component and lower
average path length compared with traditional key predistribution schemes and
comparable resilience to random node attacks.
  We argue that in many networks like key predistribution and Internet of
Things, having nodes of very high degree will be a bottle-neck in
communication. Thus, studying preferential attachment model with degree bound
will open up new directions in the study of complex networks, and will have
many applications in real world scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Studying cyber-physical system (CPS) for a given network protocol and
processor schedules is a challenging task. This investigation illustrates the
role of TrueTime a MATLAB package for simulating CPS encapsulating information
on processor schedules, and network protocols. Properties of CPS such as
temporal behaviors, performance and stability can be studied using the TrueTime
tool. Furthermore, these simulations can be used to benchmark design and
propose design alternatives. The procedure to use the toolbox for simulations
and instantiate various blocks to study CPS is illustrated in the paper.
Finally, an illustrative example has been presented of CPS simulation with
wireless network. Our example demonstrates that TrueTime is a useful tool for
studying CPS performance, timing behavior, schedulability analysis, and
studying suitable network protocols.

 <dc:description>  Almost all of the current top-performing object detection networks employ
region proposals to guide the search for object instances. State-of-the-art
region proposal methods usually need several thousand proposals to get high
recall, thus hurting the detection efficiency. Although the latest Region
Proposal Network method gets promising detection accuracy with several hundred
proposals, it still struggles in small-size object detection and precise
localization (e.g., large IoU thresholds), mainly due to the coarseness of its
feature maps. In this paper, we present a deep hierarchical network, namely
HyperNet, for handling region proposal generation and object detection jointly.
Our HyperNet is primarily based on an elaborately designed Hyper Feature which
aggregates hierarchical feature maps first and then compresses them into a
uniform space. The Hyper Features well incorporate deep but highly semantic,
intermediate but really complementary, and shallow but naturally
high-resolution features of the image, thus enabling us to construct HyperNet
by sharing them both in generating proposals and detecting objects via an
end-to-end joint training strategy. For the deep VGG16 model, our method
achieves completely leading recall and state-of-the-art object detection
accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 using only 100 proposals per image. It
runs with a speed of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, thus having the
potential for real-time processing.

 <dc:description>  Locomotion in the real world involves unexpected perturbations, and therefore
requires strategies to maintain stability to successfully execute desired
behaviours. Ensuring the safety of locomoting systems therefore necessitates a
quantitative metric for stability. Due to the difficulty of determining the set
of perturbations that induce failure, researchers have used a variety of
features as a proxy to describe stability. This paper utilises recent advances
in dynamical systems theory to develop a personalised, automated framework to
compute the set of perturbations from which a system can avoid failure, which
is known as the basin of stability. The approach tracks human motion to
synthesise a control input that is analysed to measure the basin of stability.
The utility of this analysis is verified on a Sit-to-Stand task performed by 15
individuals. The experiment illustrates that the computed basin of stability
for each individual can successfully differentiate between less and more stable
Sit-to-Stand strategies.

 <dc:description>  An approach that extracts global attributes from outdoor images to facilitate
geometric layout labeling is investigated in this work. The proposed
Global-attributes Assisted Labeling (GAL) system exploits both local features
and global attributes. First, by following a classical method, we use local
features to provide initial labels for all super-pixels. Then, we develop a set
of techniques to extract global attributes from 2D outdoor images. They include
sky lines, ground lines, vanishing lines, etc. Finally, we propose the GAL
system that integrates global attributes in the conditional random field (CRF)
framework to improve initial labels so as to offer a more robust labeling
result. The performance of the proposed GAL system is demonstrated and
benchmarked with several state-of-the-art algorithms against a popular outdoor
scene layout dataset.

 <dc:description>  As a promising paradigm to reduce both capital and operating expenditures,
the cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has been shown to provide high spectral
efficiency and energy efficiency. Motivated by its significant theoretical
performance gains and potential advantages, C-RANs have been advocated by both
the industry and research community. This paper comprehensively surveys the
recent advances of C-RANs, including system architectures, key techniques, and
open issues. The system architectures with different functional splits and the
corresponding characteristics are comprehensively summarized and discussed. The
state-of-the-art key techniques in C-RANs are classified as: the fronthaul
compression, large-scale collaborative processing, and channel estimation in
the physical layer; and the radio resource allocation and optimization in the
upper layer. Additionally, given the extensiveness of the research area, open
issues and challenges are presented to spur future investigations, in which the
involvement of edge cache, big data mining, social-aware device-to-device,
cognitive radio, software defined network, and physical layer security for
C-RANs are discussed, and the progress of testbed development and trial test
are introduced as well.

 <dc:description>  A parallel fast direct solver for rank-compressible block tridiagonal linear
systems is presented. Algorithmic synergies between Cyclic Reduction and
Hierarchical matrix arithmetic operations result in a solver with $O(N \log^2
N)$ arithmetic complexity and $O(N \log N)$ memory footprint. We provide a
baseline for performance and applicability by comparing with well known
implementations of the $\mathcal{H}$-LU factorization and algebraic multigrid
with a parallel implementation that leverages the concurrency features of the
method. Numerical experiments reveal that this method is comparable with other
fast direct solvers based on Hierarchical Matrices such as $\mathcal{H}$-LU and
that it can tackle problems where algebraic multigrid fails to converge.

 <dc:title>Optimizing the Diffusion System Based on Continuous-Time Consensus
  Algorithm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jafarizadeh, Saber</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditionally, systems governed by linear Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs) are spatially discretized to exploit their algebraic structure and
reduce the computational effort for controlling them. Due to beneficial
insights of the PDEs, recently, the reverse of this approach is implemented
where a spatially-discrete system is approximated by a spatially-continuous
one, governed by linear PDEs forming diffusion equations. In the case of
distributed consensus algorithms, this approach is adapted to enhance its
convergence rate to the equilibrium. In previous studies within this context,
constant diffusion parameter is considered for obtaining the diffusion
equations. This is equivalent to assigning a constant weight to all edges of
the underlying graph in the consensus algorithm. Here, by relaxing this
restricting assumption, a spatially-variable diffusion parameter is considered
and by optimizing the obtained system, it is shown that significant
improvements are achievable in terms of the convergence rate of the obtained
spatially-continuous system. As a result of approximation, the system is
divided into two sections, namely, the spatially-continuous path branches and
the lattice core which connects these branches at one end. The optimized
weights and diffusion parameter for each of these sections are optimal
individually but considering the whole system, they are suboptimal. It is shown
that the symmetric star topology is an exception and the obtained results for
this topology are globally optimal. Furthermore, through variational method,
the results obtained for the symmetric star topology are validated and it is
shown that the variable diffusion parameter improves the robustness of the
system too.

 <dc:title>Secure wireless communication under spatial and local Gaussian noise
  assumptions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hayashi, Masahito</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider wireless communication between Alice and Bob when the
intermediate space between Alice and Bob is controlled by Eve. That is, our
model divides the channel noise into two parts, the noise generated during the
transmission and the noise generated in the detector. Eve is allowed to control
the former, but is not allowed to do the latter. While the latter is assumed to
be a Gaussian random variable, the former is not assumed to be a Gaussian
random variable. In this situation, using backward reconciliation and the
random sampling, we propose a protocol to generate secure keys between Alice
and Bob under the assumption that Eve's detector has a Gaussian noise and Eve
is out of Alice's neighborhood. In our protocol, the security criteria are
quantitatively guaranteed even with finite block-length code based on the
evaluation of error of the estimation of channel.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: I have added analysis for estimation error. Also, I have removed the
  assumption of Gaussian random variable for the noise during the transmission</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  A deep understanding of the queuing performance of wireless networks is
essential for the advancement of future wireless communications. The stochastic
nature of wireless channels in general gives rise to a time varying
transmission rate. In such an environment, interference is increasingly
becoming a key constraint. Obtaining an expressive model for offered service of
such channels has major implications in the design and optimization of future
networks. However, interference channels are not well-understood with respect
to their higher layer performance. The particular difficulty for handling
interference channels arises from the superposition of random fading processes
for the signals of the transmitters involved (i.e., for the signal of interest
and for the signals of the interferers). Starting from the distribution of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we derive a statistical
characterization of the underlying service process in terms of its Mellin
transform. Then, we adapt a recent stochastic network calculus approach for
fading channels to derive measures of the queuing performance of single- and
multi-hop wireless interference networks. Special cases of our solution include
noise-limited and interference-limited systems. A key finding of our analysis
is that for a given average signal and average sum interference power, the
performance of interfered systems not only depends on the relative strength of
the sum interference with respect to the signal-of-interest power, but also on
the interference structure (i.e., the number of interferers) as well as the
absolute levels.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the development of the Robotarium -- a remotely
accessible, multi-robot research facility. The impetus behind the Robotarium is
that multi-robot testbeds constitute an integral and essential part of the
multi-agent research cycle, yet they are expensive, complex, and time-consuming
to develop, operate, and maintain. These resource constraints, in turn, limit
access for large groups of researchers and students, which is what the
Robotarium is remedying by providing users with remote access to a
state-of-the-art multi-robot test facility. This paper details the design and
operation of the Robotarium as well as connects these to the particular
considerations one must take when making complex hardware remotely accessible.
In particular, safety must be built in already at the design phase without
overly constraining which coordinated control programs the users can upload and
execute, which calls for minimally invasive safety routines with provable
performance guarantees.

 <dc:title>COARA: Code Offloading on Android with AspectJ</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Smartphones suffer from limited computational capabilities and battery life.
A method to mitigate these problems is code offloading: executing application
code on a remote server. We introduce COARA, a middleware platform for code
offloading on Android that uses aspect-oriented programming (AOP) with AspectJ.
AOP allows COARA to intercept code for offloading without a customized compiler
or modification of the operating system. COARA requires minimal changes to
application source code, and does not require the application developer to be
aware of AOP. Since state transfer to the server is often a bottleneck that
hinders performance, COARA uses AOP to intercept the transmission of large
objects from the client and replaces them with object proxies. The server can
begin execution of the offloaded application code, regardless of whether all
required objects been transferred to the server. We run COARA with Android
applications from the Google Play store on a Nexus 4 running unmodified Android
4.3 to prove that our platform improves performance and reduces energy
consumption. Our approach yields speedups of 24x and 6x over WiFi and 3G
respectively.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Quantum computing is a new way of data processing based on the concept of
quantum mechanics. Quantum circuit design is a process of converting a quantum
gate to a series of basic gates and is divided into two general categories
based on the decomposition and composition. In the second group, using
evolutionary algorithms and especially genetic algorithms, multiplication of
matrix gates was used to achieve the final characteristic of quantum circuit.
Genetic programming is a subfield of evolutionary computing in which computer
programs evolve to solve studied problems. In past research that has been done
in the field of quantum circuits design, only one cost metrics (usually quantum
cost) has been investigated. In this paper for the first time, a
multi-objective approach has been provided to design quantum circuits using
genetic programming that considers the depth and the cost of nearest neighbor
metrics in addition to quantum cost metric. Another innovation of this article
is the use of two-step fitness function and taking into account the equivalence
of global phase in quantum gates. The results show that the proposed method is
able to find a good answer in a short time.

 <dc:description>  One of the common artificial intelligence applications in electronic games
consists of making an artificial agent learn how to execute some determined
task successfully in a game environment. One way to perform this task is
through machine learning algorithms capable of learning the sequence of actions
required to win in a given game environment. There are several supervised
learning techniques able to learn the correct answer for a problem through
examples. However, when learning how to play electronic games, the correct
answer might only be known by the end of the game, after all the actions were
already taken. Thus, not being possible to measure the accuracy of each
individual action to be taken at each time step. A way for dealing with this
problem is through Neuroevolution, a method which trains Artificial Neural
Networks using evolutionary algorithms. In this article, we introduce a
framework for testing optimization algorithms with artificial agent controllers
in electronic games, called EvoMan, which is inspired in the action-platformer
game Mega Man II. The environment can be configured to run in different
experiment modes, as single evolution, coevolution and others. To demonstrate
some challenges regarding the proposed platform, as initial experiments we
applied Neuroevolution using Genetic Algorithms and the NEAT algorithm, in the
context of competitively coevolving two distinct agents in this game.

 <dc:title>Analysis and Optimization of Caching and Multicasting in Large-Scale
  Cache-Enabled Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) provide a powerful approach to meet
the dramatic mobile traffic growth, but also impose a significant challenge on
backhaul. Caching and multicasting at macro and pico base stations (BSs) are
two promising methods to support massive content delivery and reduce backhaul
load in HetNets. In this paper, we jointly consider caching and multicasting in
a large-scale cache-enabled HetNet with backhaul constraints. We propose a
hybrid caching design consisting of identical caching in the macro-tier and
random caching in the pico-tier, and a corresponding multicasting design. By
carefully handling different types of interferers and adopting appropriate
approximations, we derive tractable expressions for the successful transmission
probability in the general region as well as the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and user density region, utilizing tools from stochastic geometry. Then,
we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing
the design parameters, which is a very challenging mixed discrete-continuous
optimization problem due to the sophisticated structure of the successful
transmission probability. By using optimization techniques and exploring the
structural properties, we obtain a near optimal solution with superior
performance and manageable complexity. This solution achieves better
performance in the general region than any asymptotically optimal solution,
under a mild condition. The analysis and optimization results provide valuable
design insights for practical cache-enabled HetNets.

 <dc:description>  Learning from multiple-relational data which contains noise, ambiguities, or
duplicate entities is essential to a wide range of applications such as
statistical inference based on Web Linked Data, recommender systems,
computational biology, and natural language processing. These tasks usually
require working with very large and complex datasets - e.g., the Web graph -
however, current approaches to multi-relational learning are not practical for
such scenarios due to their high computational complexity and poor scalability
on large data.
  In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable approach for multi-relational
factorization based on consensus optimization. Our model, called ConsMRF, is
based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework,
which enables us to optimize each target relation using a smaller set of
parameters than the state-of-the-art competitors in this task.
  Due to ADMM's nature, ConsMRF can be easily parallelized which makes it
suitable for large multi-relational data. Experiments on large Web datasets -
derived from DBpedia, Wikipedia and YAGO - show the efficiency and performance
improvement of ConsMRF over strong competitors. In addition, ConsMRF
near-linear scalability indicates great potential to tackle Web-scale problem
sizes.

 <dc:description>  The use of mmWave frequencies is one of the key strategies to achieve the
fascinating 1000x increase in the capacity of future 5G wireless systems. While
for traditional sub-6 GHz cellular frequencies several well-developed
statistical channel models are available for system simulation, similar tools
are not available for mmWave frequencies, thus preventing a fair comparison of
independently developed transmission and reception schemes. In this paper we
provide a simple albeit accurate statistical procedure for the generation of a
clustered MIMO channel model operating at mmWaves, for both the cases of slowly
and rapidly time-varying channels. Matlab scripts for channel generation are
also provided, along with an example of their use.

 <dc:title>A Characterization of the Non-Uniqueness of Nonnegative Matrix

 <dc:description>  Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular dimension reduction
technique that produces interpretable decomposition of the data into parts.
However, this decompostion is not generally identifiable (even up to
permutation and scaling). While other studies have provide criteria under which
NMF is identifiable, we present the first (to our knowledge) characterization
of the non-identifiability of NMF. We describe exactly when and how
non-uniqueness can occur, which has important implications for algorithms to
efficiently discover alternate solutions, if they exist.

 <dc:description>  The stability theorem for persistent homology is a central result in
topological data analysis. While the original formulation of the result
concerns the persistence barcodes of $\mathbb{R}$-valued functions, the result
was later cast in a more general algebraic form, in the language of
\emph{persistence modules} and \emph{interleavings}. In this paper, we
establish an analogue of this algebraic stability theorem for zigzag
persistence modules. To do so, we functorially extend each zigzag persistence
module to a two-dimensional persistence module, and establish an algebraic
stability theorem for these extensions. One part of our argument yields a
stability result for free two-dimensional persistence modules.
  As an application of our main theorem, we strengthen a result of Bauer et al.
on the stability of the persistent homology of Reeb graphs. Our main result
also yields an alternative proof of the stability theorem for level set
persistent homology of Carlsson et al.

 <dc:description>  Do users from Carnegie Mellon University form social communities on Facebook?
Do signal processing researchers from tightly collaborate with each other? Do
Chinese restaurants in Manhattan cluster together? These seemingly different
problems share a common structure: an attribute that may be localized on a
graph. In other words, nodes activated by an attribute form a subgraph that can
be easily separated from other nodes. In this paper, we thus focus on the task
of detecting localized attributes on a graph. We are particularly interested in
categorical attributes such as attributes in online social networks, ratings in
recommender systems and viruses in cyber-physical systems because they are
widely used in numerous data mining applications. To solve the task, we
formulate a statistical hypothesis testing problem to decide whether a given
attribute is localized or not. We propose two statistics: graph wavelet
statistic and graph scan statistic, both of which are provably effective in
detecting localized attributes. We validate the robustness of the proposed
statistics on both simulated data and two real-world applications: high
air-pollution detection and keyword ranking in a co-authorship network
collected from IEEE Xplore. Experimental results show that the proposed graph
wavelet statistic and graph scan statistic are effective and efficient.

 <dc:description>  Bicycle-sharing systems, which can provide shared bike usage services for the
public, have been launched in many big cities. In bicycle-sharing systems,
people can borrow and return bikes at any stations in the service region very
conveniently. Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as a
short-distance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular public
transportation. Meanwhile, for stations located at different places in the
service region, the bike usages can be quite skewed and imbalanced. Some
stations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks for
upcoming bikes, while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough
bikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential destinations
and arriving time of each individual trip beforehand can effectively help the
service providers schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. In this paper,
we will study the individual trip prediction problem for bicycle-sharing
systems. To address the problem, we study a real-world bicycle-sharing system
and analyze individuals' bike usage behaviors first. Based on the analysis
results, a new trip destination prediction and trip duration inference model
will be introduced. Experiments conducted on a real-world bicycle-sharing
system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

 <dc:description>  Privacy-preservation for sensitive data has become a challenging issue in
cloud computing. Threat modeling as a part of requirements engineering in
secure software development provides a structured approach for identifying
attacks and proposing countermeasures against the exploitation of
vulnerabilities in a system . This paper describes an extension of Cloud
Privacy Threat Modeling (CPTM) methodology for privacy threat modeling in
relation to processing sensitive data in cloud computing environments. It
describes the modeling methodology that involved applying Method Engineering to
specify characteristics of a cloud privacy threat modeling methodology,
different steps in the proposed methodology and corresponding products. In
addition, a case study has been implemented as a proof of concept to
demonstrate the usability of the proposed methodology. We believe that the
extended methodology facilitates the application of a privacy-preserving cloud
software development approach from requirements engineering to design.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  As a widely used non-linear activation, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
separates noise and signal in a feature map by learning a threshold or bias.
However, we argue that the classification of noise and signal not only depends
on the magnitude of responses, but also the context of how the feature
responses would be used to detect more abstract patterns in higher layers. In
order to output multiple response maps with magnitude in different ranges for a
particular visual pattern, existing networks employing ReLU and its variants
have to learn a large number of redundant filters. In this paper, we propose a
multi-bias non-linear activation (MBA) layer to explore the information hidden
in the magnitudes of responses. It is placed after the convolution layer to
decouple the responses to a convolution kernel into multiple maps by
multi-thresholding magnitudes, thus generating more patterns in the feature
space at a low computational cost. It provides great flexibility of selecting
responses to different visual patterns in different magnitude ranges to form
rich representations in higher layers. Such a simple and yet effective scheme
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  On the Web, there is always a need to aggregate opinions from the crowd (as
in posts, social networks, forums, etc.). Different mechanisms have been
implemented to capture these opinions such as &quot;Like&quot; in Facebook, &quot;Favorite&quot; in
Twitter, thumbs-up/down, flagging, and so on. However, in more contested
domains (e.g. Wikipedia, political discussion, and climate change discussion)
these mechanisms are not sufficient since they only deal with each issue
independently without considering the relationships between different claims.
We can view a set of conflicting arguments as a graph in which the nodes
represent arguments and the arcs between these nodes represent the defeat
relation. A group of people can then collectively evaluate such graphs. To do
this, the group must use a rule to aggregate their individual opinions about
the entire argument graph. Here, we present the first experimental evaluation
of different principles commonly employed by aggregation rules presented in the
literature. We use randomized controlled experiments to investigate which
principles people consider better at aggregating opinions under different
conditions. Our analysis reveals a number of factors, not captured by
traditional formal models, that play an important role in determining the
efficacy of aggregation. These results help bring formal models of
argumentation closer to real-world application.

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider event-driven methods in a general framework for the control and
optimization of multi-agent systems, viewing them as stochastic hybrid systems.
Such systems often have feasible realizations in which the events needed to
excite an on-line event-driven controller cannot occur, rendering the use of
such controllers ineffective. We show that this commonly happens in
environments which contain discrete points of interest which the agents must
visit. To address this problem in event-driven gradient-based optimization
problems, we propose a new metric for the objective function which creates a
potential field guaranteeing that gradient values are non-zero when no events
are present and which results in eventual event excitation. We apply this
approach to the class of cooperative multi-agent data collection problems using
the event-driven Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) methodology and
include numerical examples illustrating its effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  An inconsistent knowledge base can be abstracted as a set of arguments and a
defeat relation among them. There can be more than one consistent way to
evaluate such an argumentation graph. Collective argument evaluation is the
problem of aggregating the opinions of multiple agents on how a given set of
arguments should be evaluated. It is crucial not only to ensure that the
outcome is logically consistent, but also satisfies measures of social
optimality and immunity to strategic manipulation. This is because agents have
their individual preferences about what the outcome ought to be. In the current
paper, we analyze three previously introduced argument-based aggregation
operators with respect to Pareto optimality and strategy proofness under
different general classes of agent preferences. We highlight fundamental
trade-offs between strategic manipulability and social optimality on one hand,
and classical logical criteria on the other. Our results motivate further
investigation into the relationship between social choice and argumentation
theory. The results are also relevant for choosing an appropriate aggregation
operator given the criteria that are considered more important, as well as the
nature of agents' preferences.

 <dc:description>  Academic research is driven by several factors causing different disciplines
to act as &quot;sources&quot; or &quot;sinks&quot; of knowledge. However, how the flow of authors'
research interests -- a proxy of human knowledge -- evolved across time is
still poorly understood. Here, we build a comprehensive map of such flows
across one century, revealing fundamental periods in the raise of interest in
areas of human knowledge. We identify and quantify the most attractive topics
over time, when a relatively significant number of researchers moved from their
original area to another one, causing what we call a &quot;diaspora of the
knowledge&quot; towards sinks of scientific interest, and we relate these points to
crucial historical and political events. Noticeably, only a few areas -- like
Medicine, Physics or Chemistry -- mainly act as sources of the diaspora,
whereas areas like Material Science, Chemical Engineering, Neuroscience,
Immunology and Microbiology or Environmental Science behave like sinks.

 <dc:description>  IBM TrueNorth chip uses digital spikes to perform neuromorphic computing and
achieves ultrahigh execution parallelism and power efficiency. However, in
TrueNorth chip, low quantization resolution of the synaptic weights and spikes
significantly limits the inference (e.g., classification) accuracy of the
deployed neural network model. Existing workaround, i.e., averaging the results
over multiple copies instantiated in spatial and temporal domains, rapidly
exhausts the hardware resources and slows down the computation. In this work,
we propose a novel learning method on TrueNorth platform that constrains the
random variance of each computation copy and reduces the number of needed
copies. Compared to the existing learning method, our method can achieve up to
68.8% reduction of the required neuro-synaptic cores or 6.5X speedup, with even
slightly improved inference accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Compressed sensing is now established as an effective method for dimension
reduction when the underlying signals are sparse or compressible with respect
to some suitable basis or frame. One important, yet under-addressed problem
regarding the compressive acquisition of analog signals is how to perform
quantization. This is directly related to the important issues of how
&quot;compressed&quot; compressed sensing is (in terms of the total number of bits one
ends up using after acquiring the signal) and ultimately whether compressed
sensing can be used to obtain compressed representations of suitable signals.
Building on our recent work, we propose a concrete and practicable method for
performing &quot;analog-to-information conversion&quot;. Following a compressive signal
acquisition stage, the proposed method consists of a quantization stage, based
on $\Sigma\Delta$ (sigma-delta) quantization, and a subsequent encoding
(compression) stage that fits within the framework of compressed sensing
seamlessly. We prove that, using this method, we can convert analog compressive
samples to compressed digital bitstreams and decode using tractable algorithms
based on convex optimization. We prove that the proposed AIC provides a nearly
optimal encoding of sparse and compressible signals. Finally, we present
numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed
analog-to-information converter.

 <dc:description>  Sharing unused vehicles is one practical solution for traffic congestion. We
propose an advanced vehicle-sharing service that maximizes the sharing of
vehicles and improves traffic efficiency by coordinating user trips via an
information system. We formulate ride-sharing games that model externalities in
vehicle sharing caused by insufficient vehicle supply. We show how Bayes
correlated equilibrium can coordinate players in ride-sharing games and verify
the resultant improvement in the price of anarchy.

 <dc:description>  We study the unweighted Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP) via the Lasserre (Sum
of Squares) system. We prove an approximation guarantee of ($1.8+\epsilon$)
relative to an SDP relaxation, which matches the combinatorial approximation
guarantee of Even, Feldman, Kortsarz and Nutov in ACM TALG (2009), where
$\epsilon&gt;0$ is a constant. We generalize the combinatorial analysis of
integral solutions of Even, et al., to fractional solutions by identifying some
properties of fractional solutions of the Lasserre system via the decomposition
result of Rothvo{\ss} (arXiv:1111.5473, 2011) and Karlin, Mathieu and Nguyen

 <dc:description>  In this study, we formulate positive and negative externalities caused by
changes in the supply of shared vehicles as ride sharing games. The study aims
to understand the price of anarchy (PoA) and its improvement via a coordination
technique in ride sharing games. A critical question is whether ride sharing
games exhibit a pure Nash equilibrium (pNE) since the PoA bound assumes it. Our
result shows a sufficient condition for a ride sharing game to have a finite
improvement property and a pNE similar to potential games. This is the first
step to analyze PoA bound and its improvement by coordination in ride sharing
games. We also show an example of coordinating players in ride sharing games
using signaling and evaluate the improvement in the PoA.

of our approach on the SimpleQuestions dataset (Bordes et al., 2015), where we

an equivalent word-level model, can be learned with significantly less data
compared to previous work, which relies on data augmentation, and is robust to
new entities in testing.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces depth estimation from water drops. The key idea is that
a single water drop adhered to window glass is totally transparent and convex,
and thus optically acts like a fisheye lens. If we have more than one water
drop in a single image, then through each of them we can see the environment
with different view points, similar to stereo. To realize this idea, we need to
rectify every water drop imagery to make radially distorted planar surfaces
look flat. For this rectification, we consider two physical properties of water
drops: (1) A static water drop has constant volume, and its geometric convex
shape is determined by the balance between the tension force and gravity. This
implies that the 3D geometric shape can be obtained by minimizing the overall
potential energy, which is the sum of the tension energy and the gravitational
potential energy. (2) The imagery inside a water-drop is determined by the
water-drop 3D shape and total reflection at the boundary. This total reflection
generates a dark band commonly observed in any adherent water drops. Hence,
once the 3D shape of water drops are recovered, we can rectify the water drop
images through backward raytracing. Subsequently, we can compute depth using
stereo. In addition to depth estimation, we can also apply image refocusing.
Experiments on real images and a quantitative evaluation show the effectiveness
of our proposed method. To our best knowledge, never before have adherent water
drops been used to estimate depth.

 <dc:description>  A key challenge in entity linking is making effective use of contextual
information to disambiguate mentions that might refer to different entities in
different contexts. We present a model that uses convolutional neural networks
to capture semantic correspondence between a mention's context and a proposed
target entity. These convolutional networks operate at multiple granularities
to exploit various kinds of topic information, and their rich parameterization
gives them the capacity to learn which n-grams characterize different topics.
We combine these networks with a sparse linear model to achieve
state-of-the-art performance on multiple entity linking datasets, outperforming
the prior systems of Durrett and Klein (2014) and Nguyen et al. (2014).

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a data compression algorithm with error bound guarantee
for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using compressing neural networks. The
proposed algorithm minimizes data congestion and reduces energy consumption by
exploring spatio-temporal correlations among data samples. The adaptive
rate-distortion feature balances the compressed data size (data rate) with the
required error bound guarantee (distortion level). This compression relieves
the strain on energy and bandwidth resources while collecting WSN data within
tolerable error margins, thereby increasing the scale of WSNs. The algorithm is
evaluated using real-world datasets and compared with conventional methods for
temporal and spatial data compression. The experimental validation reveals that
the proposed algorithm outperforms several existing WSN data compression
methods in terms of compression efficiency and signal reconstruction. Moreover,
an energy analysis shows that compressing the data can reduce the energy
expenditure, and hence expand the service lifespan by several folds.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing projects have many implications, including issues such as
security, compliance, funding, cohesion with existing systems, operational
resource requirements, and number of employees involved. In order to gain a
better understanding of why businesses are interested in adopting cloud
services in spite of these potential difficulties, we interviewed senior IT
personnel at five different organizations about their processes related to
cloud decisions, their thoughts before and during the process, and the outcome
of their endeavor. Our results provide insights from their perspectives into
the similarities and differences among the organizations and the implications
of going into the cloud. We conclude with a list of recommended questions and
areas to consider for use by other organizations looking into adopting cloud
services. The ultimate goal is to help businesses considering a cloud computing
project by providing advice from other organizations based on their experience.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the energy efficient resource allocation for
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) relay systems, where the
system is supplied by the conventional utility grid and a renewable energy
generator equipped with a storage device. The optimal usage of radio resource
depends on the characteristics of the renewable energy generation and the
mobile traffic, which exhibit both temporal and spatial diversities. Lyapunov
optimization method is used to decompose the problem into the joint flow
control, radio resource allocation and energy management without knowing a
priori knowledge of system statistics. It is proven that the proposed algorithm
can result in close-to-optimal performance with capacity limited data buffer
and storage device. Simulation results show that the flexible tradeoff between
the system utility and the conventional energy consumption can be achieved.
Compared with other schemes, the proposed algorithm demonstrates better
performance.

 <dc:description>  Zero forcing is a dynamic graph coloring process whereby a colored vertex
with a single uncolored neighbor forces that neighbor to be colored. This
forcing process has been used to approximate certain linear algebraic
parameters, as well as to model the spread of diseases and information in
social networks. In this paper, we introduce and study the connected forcing
process -- a restriction of zero forcing in which the initially colored set of
vertices induces a connected subgraph. We show that the connected forcing
number -- the cardinality of the smallest initially colored vertex set which
forces the entire graph to be colored -- is a sharp upper bound to the maximum
nullity, path cover number, and leaf number of the graph. We also give closed
formulas and bounds for the connected forcing numbers of several families of
graphs including trees, hypercubes, and flower snarks, and characterize graphs
with extremal connected forcing numbers.

 <dc:description>  A novel compressive-sensing based signal multiplexing scheme is proposed in
this paper to further improve the multiplexing gain for multiple input multiple
output (MIMO) system. At the transmitter side, a Gaussian random measurement
matrix in compressive sensing is employed before the traditional spatial
multiplexing in order to carry more data streams on the available spatial
multiplexing streams of the underlying MIMO system. At the receiver side, it is
proposed to reformulate the detection of the multiplexing signal into two
steps. In the first step, the traditional MIMO equalization can be used to
restore the transmitted spatial multiplexing signal of the MIMO system. While
in the second step, the standard optimization based detection algorithm assumed
in the compressive sensing framework is utilized to restore the CS multiplexing
data streams, wherein the exhaustive over-complete dictionary is used to
guarantee the sparse representation of the CS multiplexing signal. In order to
avoid the excessive complexity, the sub-block based dictionary and the
sub-block based CS restoration is proposed. Finally, simulation results are
presented to show the feasibility of the proposed CS based enhanced MIMO
multiplexing scheme. And our efforts in this paper shed some lights on the
great potential in further improving the spatial multiplexing gain for the MIMO
system.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a support set reconstruction problem in which the
signals of interest are jointly sparse with a common support set, and sampled
by joint sparsity model-2 (JSM-2) in the presence of noise. Using mathematical
tools, we develop upper and lower bounds on the failure probability of support
set reconstruction in terms of the sparsity, the ambient dimension, the minimum
signal to noise ratio, the number of measurement vectors and the number of
measurements. These bounds can be used to provide a guideline to determine the
system parameters in various applications of compressed sensing with noisy
JSM-2. Based on the bounds, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for
reliable support set reconstruction. We interpret these conditions to give
theoretical explanations about the benefits enabled by joint sparsity structure
in noisy JSM-2. We compare our sufficient condition with the existing result of
noisy multiple measurement vectors model (MMV). As a result, we show that noisy
JSM-2 may require less number of measurements than noisy MMV for reliable
support set reconstruction.

 <dc:description>  Most complex systems are intrinsically dynamic in nature. The evolution of a
dynamic complex system is typically represented as a sequence of snapshots,
where each snapshot describes the configuration of the system at a particular
instant of time. Then, one may directly follow how the snapshots evolve in
time, or aggregate the snapshots within some time intervals to form
representative &quot;slices&quot; of the evolution of the system configuration. This is
often done with constant intervals, whose duration is based on arguments on the
nature of the system and of its dynamics. A more refined approach would be to
consider the rate of activity in the system to perform a separation of
timescales. However, an even better alternative would be to define dynamic
intervals that match the evolution of the system's configuration. To this end,
we propose a method that aims at detecting evolutionary changes in the
configuration of a complex system, and generates intervals accordingly. We show
that evolutionary timescales can be identified by looking for peaks in the
similarity between the sets of events on consecutive time intervals of data.
Tests on simple toy models reveal that the technique is able to detect
evolutionary timescales of time-varying data both when the evolution is smooth
as well as when it changes sharply. This is further corroborated by analyses of
several real datasets. Our method is scalable to extremely large datasets and
is computationally efficient. This allows a quick, parameter-free detection of
multiple timescales in the evolution of a complex system.

 <dc:title>Probabilistic bounds on the trapping redundancy of linear codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tsunoda, Yu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Fujiwara, Yuichiro</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The trapping redundancy of a linear code is the number of rows of a smallest
parity-check matrix such that no submatrix forms an $(a,b)$-trapping set. This
concept was first introduced in the context of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes in an attempt to estimate the number of redundant rows in a parity-check
matrix suitable for iterative decoding. Essentially the same concepts appear in
other contexts as well such as robust syndrome extraction for quantum error
correction. Among the known upper bounds on the trapping redundancy, the
strongest one was proposed by employing a powerful tool in probabilistic
combinatorics, called the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma. Unfortunately, the proposed
proof invoked this tool in a situation where an assumption made in the lemma
does not necessarily hold. Hence, although we do not doubt that nonetheless the
proposed bound actually holds, for it to be a mathematical theorem, a more
rigorous proof is desired. Another disadvantage of the proposed bound is that
it is only applicable to $(a,b)$-trapping sets with rather small $a$. Here, we
give a more general and sharper upper bound on trapping redundancy by making
mathematically more rigorous use of probabilistic combinatorics without relying
on the lemma. Our bound is applicable to all potentially avoidable
$(a,b)$-trapping sets with $a$ smaller than the minimum distance of a given
linear code, while being generally much sharper than the bound through the
Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma. In fact, our upper bound is sharp enough to exactly
determine the trapping redundancy for many cases, thereby providing precise
knowledge in the form of a more general bound with mathematical rigor.

 <dc:description>  To elucidate the non-trivial empirical statistical properties of fluctuations
of a typical non-steady time series representing the appearance of words in
blogs, we investigated approximately five billion Japanese blogs over a period
of six years and analyse some corresponding mathematical models. First, we
introduce a solvable non-steady extension of the random diffusion model, which
can be deduced by modelling the behaviour of heterogeneous random bloggers.
Next, we deduce theoretical expressions for both the temporal and ensemble
fluctuation scalings of this model, and demonstrate that these expressions can
reproduce all empirical scalings over eight orders of magnitude. Furthermore,
we show that the model can reproduce other statistical properties of time
series representing the appearance of words in blogs, such as functional forms
of the probability density and correlations in the total number of blogs. As an
application, we quantify the abnormality of special nationwide events by
measuring the fluctuation scalings of 1771 basic adjectives.

 <dc:description>  Web technology is one of the key areas in information and communication
technology to be used as a powerful tool in ensuring food security which is one
of the main issues in Sri Lanka. Web technology involves in communicating and
sharing resources in network of computers all over the world. Main focus of
food security is to ensure that all people have fair access to sufficient and
quality food without endangering the future supply of the same food. In this
context, web sites play a vital and major role in achieving food security in
Sri Lanka. In this case study, websites pertaining to Sri Lankan government and
link with food security were analyzed to find out their impact in achieving the
goals of food security using web technologies and how they are being involved
in ensuring food security in Sri Lanka. The other objective of this study is to
make the Sri Lankan government aware of present situation of those websites in
addressing food security related issues and how modern web technologies could
be effectively and efficiently used to address those issues. So, the relevant
websites were checked against several criteria and scores were used to assess
their capabilities to address the concerns of food security. It was found that
the amount of emphasis given by these websites to address the issues of food
security is not satisfactory. Further, it showed that if these web sites could
be improved further, they would generate a powerful impact on ensuring food
security in Sri Lanka.

 <dc:description>  This tutorial introduces the CMA Evolution Strategy (ES), where CMA stands
for Covariance Matrix Adaptation. The CMA-ES is a stochastic, or randomized,
method for real-parameter (continuous domain) optimization of non-linear,
non-convex functions. We try to motivate and derive the algorithm from
intuitive concepts and from requirements of non-linear, non-convex search in
continuous domain.

 <dc:description>  Multi-label classification is a common supervised machine learning problem
where each instance is associated with multiple classes. The key challenge in
this problem is learning the correlations between the classes. An additional
challenge arises when the labels of the training instances are provided by
noisy, heterogeneous crowdworkers with unknown qualities. We first assume
labels from a perfect source and propose a novel topic model where the present
as well as the absent classes generate the latent topics and hence the words.
We non-trivially extend our topic model to the scenario where the labels are
provided by noisy crowdworkers. Extensive experimentation on real world
datasets reveals the superior performance of the proposed model. The proposed
model learns the qualities of the annotators as well, even with minimal
training data.

 <dc:description>  This letter studies the impact of relay selection (RS) on the performance of
cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In particular, a two-stage
RS strategy is proposed, and analytical results are developed to demonstrate
that this two-stage strategy can achieve the minimal outage probability among
all possible RS schemes, and realize the maximal diversity gain. The provided
simulation results show that cooperative NOMA with this two-stage RS scheme
outperforms that with the conventional max-min approach, and can also yield a
significant performance gain over orthogonal multiple access.

 <dc:title>Achieving Open Vocabulary Neural Machine Translation with Hybrid
  Word-Character Models</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Nearly all previous work on neural machine translation (NMT) has used quite
restricted vocabularies, perhaps with a subsequent method to patch in unknown
words. This paper presents a novel word-character solution to achieving open
vocabulary NMT. We build hybrid systems that translate mostly at the word level
and consult the character components for rare words. Our character-level
recurrent neural networks compute source word representations and recover
unknown target words when needed. The twofold advantage of such a hybrid
approach is that it is much faster and easier to train than character-based
ones; at the same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case of
word-based models. On the WMT'15 English to Czech translation task, this hybrid
approach offers an addition boost of +2.1-11.4 BLEU points over models that
already handle unknown words. Our best system achieves a new state-of-the-art
result with 20.7 BLEU score. We demonstrate that our character models can
successfully learn to not only generate well-formed words for Czech, a
highly-inflected language with a very complex vocabulary, but also build
correct representations for English source words.

 <dc:description>  This work presents an end-to-end trainable deep bidirectional LSTM
(Long-Short Term Memory) model for image captioning. Our model builds on a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) and two separate LSTM networks. It is
capable of learning long term visual-language interactions by making use of
history and future context information at high level semantic space. Two novel
deep bidirectional variant models, in which we increase the depth of
nonlinearity transition in different way, are proposed to learn hierarchical
visual-language embeddings. Data augmentation techniques such as multi-crop,
multi-scale and vertical mirror are proposed to prevent overfitting in training
deep models. We visualize the evolution of bidirectional LSTM internal states
over time and qualitatively analyze how our models &quot;translate&quot; image to
sentence. Our proposed models are evaluated on caption generation and
image-sentence retrieval tasks with three benchmark datasets: Flickr8K,
Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We demonstrate that bidirectional LSTM models
achieve highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art results on
caption generation even without integrating additional mechanism (e.g. object
detection, attention model etc.) and significantly outperform recent methods on
retrieval task.

 <dc:title>Extending DLR with Labelled Tuples, Projections, Functional Dependencies

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce an extension of the n-ary description logic DLR to deal with
attribute-labelled tuples (generalising the positional notation), with
arbitrary projections of relations (inclusion dependencies), generic functional
dependencies and with global and local objectification (reifying relations or
their projections). We show how a simple syntactic condition on the appearance
of projections and functional dependencies in a knowledge base makes the
language decidable without increasing the computational complexity of the basic
DLR language.

 <dc:description>  Recently, in Paris, the world has reached an agreement whereby many countries
commit to bolster their efforts about reducing adverse climate changes. Hence,
we can expect that decarbonization will even attract more attention in
different energy sectors in near future. In particular, both generation side
and consumption side are required to be run more congruently and
environmentally friendly. Thus, employing the renewables at the generation side
along with our proposed decarbonized demand response (DDR) at the consumption
side could significantly reduce deleterious impacts on the climate. Such
ambition, at the consumption side, necessitates symbiosis and synergy between
the customers and the retailer, and among customers, respectively. In other
words, there should be some incentive-based collaboration between customers and
the retailer as well as coordination among customers to make the objective be
achieved successfully. In this paper, we present such matching demand response
(DR) algorithm for residential users owning vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled
plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) who obtain electricity from a common retailer.
The retailer itself is connected to the wholesale electricity market to
purchase and sell electricity. Furthermore, we explain the details of the
existing symbiosis and synergy in our system. Our simulation results illustrate
that substantial cost savings can be achieved along with pollution reduction by
our proposed technique.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the performance of cooperative receive diversity, for
the wireless body area network (WBAN) radio channel, compliant with the IEEE
802.15.6 Standard, in the case of monitoring a sleeping person. Extensive WBAN
measurements near the 2.4 GHz ISM band were used. Up to 7 dB and 20%
improvement for two-hop communications with the use of relays are empirically
demonstrated with respect to outage probability and outage duration, with
3-branch cooperative selection combining and 3-branch cooperative
switch-and-examine combining.

 <dc:description>  Layer-wise relevance propagation is a framework which allows to decompose the
prediction of a deep neural network computed over a sample, e.g. an image, down
to relevance scores for the single input dimensions of the sample such as
subpixels of an image. While this approach can be applied directly to
generalized linear mappings, product type non-linearities are not covered. This
paper proposes an approach to extend layer-wise relevance propagation to neural
networks with local renormalization layers, which is a very common product-type
non-linearity in convolutional neural networks. We evaluate the proposed method
for local renormalization layers on the CIFAR-10, Imagenet and MIT Places
datasets.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge about the roles developers play in a software project is crucial to
understanding the project's collaborative dynamics. Developers are often
classified according to the dichotomy of core and peripheral roles. Typically,
operationalizations based on simple counts of developer activities (e.g.,
number of commits) are used for this purpose, but there is concern regarding
their validity and ability to elicit meaningful insights. To shed light on this
issue, we investigate whether commonly used operationalizations of
core--peripheral roles produce consistent results, and we validate them with
respect to developers' perceptions by surveying 166 developers. Improving over
the state of the art, we propose a relational perspective on developer roles,
using developer networks to model the organizational structure, and by
examining core--peripheral roles in terms of developers' positions and
stability within the organizational structure. In a study of 10 substantial
open-source projects, we found that the existing and our proposed
core--peripheral operationalizations are largely consistent and valid.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a relational perspective can reveal further
meaningful insights, such as that core developers exhibit high positional
stability, upper positions in the hierarchy, and high levels of coordination
with other core developers.

 <dc:description>  The development of autonomous lightweight MAVs, capable of navigating in
unknown indoor environments, is one of the major challenges in robotics. The
complexity of this challenge comes from constraints on weight and power
consumption of onboard sensing and processing devices. In this paper we propose
the &quot;Droplet&quot; strategy, an avoidance strategy based on stereo vision inputs
that outperforms reactive avoidance strategies by allowing constant speed
maneuvers while being computationally extremely efficient, and which does not
need to store previous images or maps. The strategy deals with nonholonomic
motion constraints of most fixed and flapping wing platforms, and with the
limited field-of-view of stereo camera systems. It guarantees obstacle-free
flight in the absence of sensor and motor noise. We first analyze the strategy
in simulation, and then show its robustness in real-world conditions by
implementing it on a 20-gram flapping wing MAV.

 <dc:description>  From a grammar point of view, the role of punctuation marks in a sentence is
formally defined and well understood. In semantic analysis punctuation plays
also a crucial role as a method of avoiding ambiguity of the meaning. A
different situation can be observed in the statistical analyses of language
samples, where the decision on whether the punctuation marks should be
considered or should be neglected is seen rather as arbitrary and at present it
belongs to a researcher's preference. An objective of this work is to shed some
light onto this problem by providing us with an answer to the question whether
the punctuation marks may be treated as ordinary words and whether they should
be included in any analysis of the word co-occurences. We already know from our
previous study (S.~Dro\.zd\.z {\it et al.}, Inf. Sci. 331 (2016) 32-44) that
full stops that determine the length of sentences are the main carrier of
long-range correlations. Now we extend that study and analyze statistical
properties of the most common punctuation marks in a few Indo-European
languages, investigate their frequencies, and locate them accordingly in the
Zipf rank-frequency plots as well as study their role in the word-adjacency
networks. We show that, from a statistical viewpoint, the punctuation marks
reveal properties that are qualitatively similar to the properties of the most
frequent words like articles, conjunctions, pronouns, and prepositions. This
refers to both the Zipfian analysis and the network analysis. By adding the
punctuation marks to the Zipf plots, we also show that these plots that are
normally described by the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution largely restore the
power-law Zipfian behaviour for the most frequent items.

 <dc:title>The Influence of Frequency, Recency and Semantic Context on the Reuse of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study factors that influence tag reuse behavior in social
tagging systems. Our work is guided by the activation equation of the cognitive
model ACT-R, which states that the usefulness of information in human memory
depends on the three factors usage frequency, recency and semantic context. It
is our aim to shed light on the influence of these factors on tag reuse. In our
experiments, we utilize six datasets from the social tagging systems Flickr,
CiteULike, BibSonomy, Delicious, LastFM and MovieLens, covering a range of
various tagging settings. Our results confirm that frequency, recency and
semantic context positively influence the reuse probability of tags. However,
the extent to which each factor individually influences tag reuse strongly
depends on the type of folksonomy present in a social tagging system. Our work
can serve as guideline for researchers and developers of tag-based recommender
systems when designing algorithms for social tagging environments.

 <dc:title>Sparse Fourier Transform in Any Constant Dimension with Nearly-Optimal
  Sample Complexity in Sublinear Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kapralov, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of computing a $k$-sparse approximation to the
Fourier transform of a length $N$ signal. Our main result is a randomized
algorithm for computing such an approximation (i.e. achieving the
$\ell_2/\ell_2$ sparse recovery guarantees using Fourier measurements) using
$O_d(k\log N\log\log N)$ samples of the signal in time domain that runs in time
$O_d(k\log^{d+3} N)$, where $d\geq 1$ is the dimensionality of the Fourier
transform. The sample complexity matches the lower bound of $\Omega(k\log
(N/k))$ for non-adaptive algorithms due to \cite{DIPW} for any $k\leq
N^{1-\delta}$ for a constant $\delta&gt;0$ up to an $O(\log\log N)$ factor. Prior
to our work a result with comparable sample complexity $k\log N \log^{O(1)}\log
N$ and sublinear runtime was known for the Fourier transform on the line
\cite{IKP}, but for any dimension $d\geq 2$ previously known techniques either
suffered from a polylogarithmic factor loss in sample complexity or required
$\Omega(N)$ runtime.

 <dc:title>An Improved DOA Estimation Algorithm for Circular and Non-Circular

 <dc:creator>Wan, Liangtian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Xie, Lihua</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, an improved direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm
for circular and non-circular signals is proposed. Most state-of-the-art
algorithms only deal with the DOA estimation problem for the maximal
non-circularity rated and circular signals. However, common non-circularity
rated signals are not taken into consideration. The proposed algorithm can
estimates not only the maximal non-circularity rated and circular signals, but
also the common non-circularity rated signals. Based on the property of the
non-circularity phase and rate, the incident signals can be divided into three
types as mentioned above, which can be estimated separately. The
interrelationship among these signals can be reduced significantly, which means
the resolution performance among different types of signals is improved.
Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present an approach to polyphonic sound event detection in
real life recordings based on bi-directional long short term memory (BLSTM)
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A single multilabel BLSTM RNN is trained to
map acoustic features of a mixture signal consisting of sounds from multiple
classes, to binary activity indicators of each event class. Our method is
tested on a large database of real-life recordings, with 61 classes (e.g.
music, car, speech) from 10 different everyday contexts. The proposed method
outperforms previous approaches by a large margin, and the results are further
improved using data augmentation techniques. Overall, our system reports an
average F1-score of 65.5% on 1 second blocks and 64.7% on single frames, a
relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art approach of 6.8% and 15.1%
respectively.

 <dc:title>Stability analysis of Model Predictive Controllers using Mixed Integer

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is a well known fact that finite time optimal controllers, such as MPC
does not necessarily result in closed loop stable systems. Within the MPC
community it is common practice to add a final state constraint and/or a final
state penalty in order to obtain guaranteed stability. However, for more
advanced controller structures it can be difficult to show stability using
these techniques. Additionally in some cases the final state constraint set
consists of so many inequalities that the complexity of the MPC problem is too
big for use in certain fast and time critical applications. In this paper we
instead focus on deriving a tool for a-postiori analysis of the closed loop
stability for linear systems controlled with MPC controllers. We formulate an
optimisation problem that gives a sufficient condition for stability of the
closed loop system and we show that the problem can be written as a Mixed
Integer Linear Programming Problem (MILP)

 <dc:title>Disturbance scaling in bidirectional vehicle platoons with different

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a string of vehicles where the local control law uses
the states of the vehicle's immediate predecessor and follower. The coupling
towards the preceding vehicle can be chosen different to the coupling towards
the following vehicle, which is often referred to as an asymmetric
bidirectional string. Further, the asymmetry for the velocity coupling can be
chosen differently to the asymmetry in the position coupling. It is
investigated how the effect of disturbance on the control errors in the string
depends on the string length. It is shown, that in case of symmetric position
coupling and asymmetric velocity coupling, linear scaling can be achieved. For
symmetric interaction in both states, i.e., in symmetric bidirectional strings,
the errors scale quadratically in the number of vehicles. When the coupling in
position is asymmetric, exponential scaling may occur or the system might even
become unstable. The paper thus gives a comprehensive overview of the
achievable performance in linear, asymmetric, bidirectional platoons. The
results reveal that symmetry in the position coupling and asymmetry in velocity
coupling qualitatively improves the performance of the string. Extensive
numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings.

 <dc:title>Automatic Knowledge Base Evolution by Learning Instances</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Sundong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Knowledge base is the way to store structured and unstructured data
throughout the web. Since the size of the web is increasing rapidly, there are
huge needs to structure the knowledge in a fully automated way. However
fully-automated knowledge-base evolution on the Semantic Web is a major
challenges, although there are many ontology evolution techniques available.
Therefore learning ontology automatically can contribute to the semantic web
society significantly. In this paper, we propose full-automated ontology
learning algorithm to generate refined knowledge base from incomplete knowledge
base and rdf-triples. Our algorithm is data-driven approach which is based on
the property of each instance. Ontology class is being elaborated by
generalizing frequent property of its instances. By using that developed class
information, each instance can find its most relatively matching class. By
repeating these two steps, we achieve fully-automated ontology evolution from
incomplete basic knowledge base.

 <dc:title>Mixing Time for Some Adjacent Transposition Markov Chains</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Haddadan, Shahrzad</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Winkler, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We prove rapid mixing for certain Markov chains on the set $S_n$ of
permutations on $1,2,\dots,n$ in which adjacent transpositions are made with
probabilities that depend on the items being transposed. Typically, when in
state $\sigma$, a position $i&lt;n$ is chosen uniformly at random, and $\sigma(i)$
and $\sigma(i{+}1)$ are swapped with probability depending on $\sigma(i)$ and
$\sigma(i{+}1)$. The stationary distributions of such chains appear in various
fields of theoretical computer science, and rapid mixing established in the
uniform case.
  Recently, there has been progress in cases with biased stationary
distributions, but there are wide classes of such chains whose mixing time is
unknown. One case of particular interest is what we call the &quot;gladiator chain,&quot;
in which each number $g$ is assigned a &quot;strength&quot; $s_g$ and when $g$ and $g'$
are adjacent and chosen for possible swapping, $g$ comes out on top with
probability $s_g/(s_g + s_{g'})$. We obtain a polynomial-time upper bound on
mixing time when the gladiators fall into only three strength classes.
  A preliminary version of this paper appeared as &quot;Mixing of Permutations by
Biased Transposition&quot; in STACS 2017.

 <dc:title>A spin glass approach to the directed feedback vertex set problem</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A directed graph (digraph) is formed by vertices and arcs (directed edges)
from one vertex to another. A feedback vertex set (FVS) is a set of vertices
that contains at least one vertex of every directed cycle in this digraph. The
directed feedback vertex set problem aims at constructing a FVS of minimum
cardinality. This is a fundamental cycle-constrained hard combinatorial
optimization problem with wide practical applications. In this paper we
construct a spin glass model for the directed FVS problem by converting the
global cycle constraints into local arc constraints, and study this model
through the replica-symmetric (RS) mean field theory of statistical physics. We
then implement a belief propagation-guided decimation (BPD) algorithm for
single digraph instances. The BPD algorithm slightly outperforms the simulated
annealing algorithm on large random graph instances. The predictions of the RS
mean field theory are noticeably lower than the BPD results, possibly due to
its neglect of cycle-caused long range correlations.

 <dc:description>  The underwater acoustic channel continues to present significant challenges
to efficient throughput performance of underwater acoustic sensor networks
(UASNs) in varying scenarios. As a result, cross-layer approaches that explore
joint PHY/MAC strategies are worthy of further exploration. We consider a
recent high-speed OFDM modem and propose a new cross-layer solution based on
modified CSMA/CA, for a canonical star network topology with few nodes (the
most common scenario in UASNs). Some innovations to an adaptive OFDM PHY link
are developed to jointly select the modulation, convolutional coding and
frequency diversity order (different transmission modes) for matching varying
channel conditions. Additionally, receiver logic that disambiguates the cause
of packet loss between a) that caused by channel vs. b) that due to collisions
is used to modify the ARQ/backoff logic for retransmissions with CSMA/CA random
access. Simulation results reveal that the cross-layer design can effectively
increase network throughput.

 <dc:description>  We consider a server with large capacity delivering video files encoded in
various resolutions. We assume that the system is under saturation in the sense
that the total demand exceeds the server capacity $C$. In such a case, requests
may be rejected. For the policies considered in this paper, instead of
rejecting a video request, it is downgraded. When the occupancy of the server
is above some value $C_0{&lt;}C$, the server delivers the video at a minimal bit
rate. The quantity $C_0$ is the bit rate adaptation threshold. For these
policies, request blocking is thus replaced by bit rate adaptation. Under the
assumptions of Poisson request arrivals and exponential service times, we show
that, by rescaling the system, a process associated to the occupancy of the
server converges to some limiting process whose invariant distribution is
computed by a Wiener-Hopf technique. This allows us to derive an asymptotic
expression of the key performance measure of such a policy, the equilibrium
probability that a request is transmitted without downgrading. Numerical
applications of these results are presented.

 <dc:description>  We describe a new method for comparing frame appearance in a frame-to-model
3-D mapping and tracking system using an low dynamic range (LDR) RGB-D camera
which is robust to brightness changes caused by auto exposure. It is based on a
normalised radiance measure which is invariant to exposure changes and not only
robustifies the tracking under changing lighting conditions, but also enables
the following exposure compensation perform accurately to allow online building
of high dynamic range (HDR) maps. The latter facilitates the frame-to-model
tracking to minimise drift as well as better capturing light variation within
the scene. Results from experiments with synthetic and real data demonstrate
that the method provides both improved tracking and maps with far greater
dynamic range of luminosity.

 <dc:description>  The Axelrod library is an open source Python package that allows for
reproducible game theoretic research into the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. This
area of research began in the 1980s but suffers from a lack of documentation
and test code. The goal of the library is to provide such a resource, with
facilities for the design of new strategies and interactions between them, as
well as conducting tournaments and ecological simulations for populations of
strategies.
  With a growing collection of 139 strategies, the library is a also a platform
for an original tournament that, in itself, is of interest to the game
theoretic community. This paper describes the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, the
Axelrod library and its development, and insights gained from some novel
research.

 <dc:description>  Modellers of complex biological or social systems are often faced with an
invidious choice: to use simple models with few mechanisms that can be fully
analysed, or to construct complicated models that include all the features
which are thought relevant. The former ensures rigour, the latter relevance. We
discuss a method that combines these two approaches, beginning with a complex
model and then modelling the complicated model with simpler models. The
resulting &quot;chain&quot; of models ensures some rigour and relevance. We illustrate
this process on a complex model of voting intentions, constructing a reduced
model which agrees well with the predictions of the full model. Experiments
with variations of the simpler model yield additional insights which are hidden
by the complexity of the full model. This approach facilitated collaboration
between social scientists and physicists -- the complex model was specified
based on the social science literature, and the simpler model constrained to
agree (in core aspects) with the complicated model.

 <dc:description>  We sharpen the result that polarity and monopolarity are NP-complete problems
by showing that they remain NP-complete if the input graph is restricted to be
a $3$-colourable comparability graph. We start by presenting a construction
reducing $1$-$3$-SAT to monopolarity of $3$-colourable comparability graphs.
Then we show that polarity is at least as hard as monopolarity for input graphs
restricted to a fixed disjoint-union-closed class. We conclude the paper by
stating that both polarity and monopolarity of $3$-colourable comparability
graphs are NP-complete problems.

 <dc:title>Detecting Engagement in Egocentric Video</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a wearable camera video, we see what the camera wearer sees. While this
makes it easy to know roughly what he chose to look at, it does not immediately
reveal when he was engaged with the environment. Specifically, at what moments
did his focus linger, as he paused to gather more information about something
he saw? Knowing this answer would benefit various applications in video
summarization and augmented reality, yet prior work focuses solely on the
&quot;what&quot; question (estimating saliency, gaze) without considering the &quot;when&quot;
(engagement). We propose a learning-based approach that uses long-term
egomotion cues to detect engagement, specifically in browsing scenarios where
one frequently takes in new visual information (e.g., shopping, touring). We
introduce a large, richly annotated dataset for ego-engagement that is the
first of its kind. Our approach outperforms a wide array of existing methods.
We show engagement can be detected well independent of both scene appearance
and the camera wearer's identity.

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate the world's first hybrid radio platform which combines the
strengths of active radio (long range and robustness to interference) and
Computational RFIDs (low power consumption). We evaluate the Wireless
Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP), an EPC C1G2 standard-based,
Computational RFID backscatter radio, against Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and
show (theoretically and experimentally) that WISP in high channel attenuation
conditions is less energy efficient per received byte than BLE. Exploiting this
observation we design a simple switching mechanisms that backs off to BLE when
radio conditions for WISP are unfavorable. By a set of laboratory experiments,
we show that our proposed hybrid active/backscatter radio obtains higher
goodput than WISP and lower energy consumption than BLE as stand-alone
platforms, especially when WISP is in range of an RFID interrogator for the
majority of the time. Simultaneously, our proposed platform is as energy
efficient as BLE when user is mostly out of RFID interrogator range.

 <dc:description>  Despite the advances made in artificial intelligence, software agents, and
robotics, there is little we see today that we can truly call a fully
autonomous system. We conjecture that the main inhibitor for advancing autonomy
is lack of trust. Trusted autonomy is the scientific and engineering field to
establish the foundations and ground work for developing trusted autonomous
systems (robotics and software agents) that can be used in our daily life, and
can be integrated with humans seamlessly, naturally and efficiently.
  In this paper, we review this literature to reveal opportunities for
researchers and practitioners to work on topics that can create a leap forward
in advancing the field of trusted autonomy. We focus the paper on the `trust'
component as the uniting technology between humans and machines. Our inquiry
into this topic revolves around three sub-topics: (1) reviewing and positioning
the trust modelling literature for the purpose of trusted autonomy; (2)
reviewing a critical subset of sensor technologies that allow a machine to
sense human states; and (3) distilling some critical questions for advancing
the field of trusted autonomy. The inquiry is augmented with conceptual models
that we propose along the way by recompiling and reshaping the literature into
forms that enables trusted autonomous systems to become a reality. The paper
offers a vision for a Trusted Cyborg Swarm, an extension of our previous
Cognitive Cyber Symbiosis concept, whereby humans and machines meld together in
a harmonious, seamless, and coordinated manner.

 <dc:title>Recognition of unipolar and generalised split graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A graph is unipolar if it can be partitioned into a clique and a disjoint
union of cliques, and a graph is a generalised split graph if it or its
complement is unipolar. A unipolar partition of a graph can be used to find
efficiently the clique number, the stability number, the chromatic number, and
to solve other problems that are hard for general graphs. We present the first
$O(n^2)$ time algorithm for recognition of $n$-vertex unipolar and generalised
split graphs, improving on previous $O(n^3)$ time algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a new way of predicting the performance of a
reinforcement learning policy given historical data that may have been
generated by a different policy. The ability to evaluate a policy from
historical data is important for applications where the deployment of a bad
policy can be dangerous or costly. We show empirically that our algorithm
produces estimates that often have orders of magnitude lower mean squared error
than existing methods---it makes more efficient use of the available data. Our
new estimator is based on two advances: an extension of the doubly robust
estimator (Jiang and Li, 2015), and a new way to mix between model based
estimates and importance sampling based estimates.

 <dc:description>  MIMO interference network optimization is important for increasingly crowded
wireless communication networks. We provide a new algorithm, named Dual Link
algorithm, for the classic problem of weighted sum-rate maximization for MIMO
multiaccess channels (MAC), broadcast channels (BC), and general MIMO
interference channels with Gaussian input and a total power constraint. For
MIMO MAC/BC, the algorithm finds optimal signals to achieve the capacity region
boundary. For interference channels with Gaussian input assumption, two of the
previous state-of-the-art algorithms are the WMMSE algorithm and the polite
water-filling (PWF) algorithm. The WMMSE algorithm is provably convergent,
while the PWF algorithm takes the advantage of the optimal transmit signal
structure and converges the fastest in most situations but is not guaranteed to
converge in all situations. It is highly desirable to design an algorithm that
has the advantages of both algorithms. The dual link algorithm is such an
algorithm. Its fast and guaranteed convergence is important to distributed
implementation and time varying channels. In addition, the technique and a
scaling invariance property used in the convergence proof may find applications
in other non-convex problems in communication networks.

 <dc:description>  The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) involves deciding, given a set of
variables and a set of constraints on the variables, whether or not there is an
assignment to the variables satisfying all of the constraints. One formulation
of the CSP is as the problem of deciding, given a pair (G,H) of relational
structures, whether or not there is a homomorphism from the first structure to
the second structure. The CSP is in general NP-hard; a common way to restrict
this problem is to fix the second structure H, so that each structure H gives
rise to a problem CSP(H). The problem family CSP(H) has been studied using an
algebraic approach, which links the algorithmic and complexity properties of
each problem CSP(H) to a set of operations, the so-called polymorphisms of H.
Certain types of polymorphisms are known to imply the polynomial-time
tractability of $CSP(H)$, and others are conjectured to do so. This article
systematically studies---for various classes of polymorphisms---the
computational complexity of deciding whether or not a given structure H admits
a polymorphism from the class. Among other results, we prove the
NP-completeness of deciding a condition conjectured to characterize the
tractable problems CSP(H), as well as the NP-completeness of deciding if CSP(H)
has bounded width.

 <dc:description>  We present an ensemble approach for categorizing search query entities in the
recruitment domain. Understanding the types of entities expressed in a search
query (Company, Skill, Job Title, etc.) enables more intelligent information
retrieval based upon those entities compared to a traditional keyword-based
search. Because search queries are typically very short, leveraging a
traditional bag-of-words model to identify entity types would be inappropriate
due to the lack of contextual information. Our approach instead combines clues
from different sources of varying complexity in order to collect real-world
knowledge about query entities. We employ distributional semantic
representations of query entities through two models: 1) contextual vectors
generated from encyclopedic corpora like Wikipedia, and 2) high dimensional
word embedding vectors generated from millions of job postings using word2vec.
Additionally, our approach utilizes both entity linguistic properties obtained
from WordNet and ontological properties extracted from DBpedia. We evaluate our
approach on a data set created at CareerBuilder; the largest job board in the
US. The data set contains entities extracted from millions of job
seekers/recruiters search queries, job postings, and resume documents. After
constructing the distributional vectors of search entities, we use supervised
machine learning to infer search entity types. Empirical results show that our
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art word2vec distributional semantics
model trained on Wikipedia. Moreover, we achieve micro-averaged F 1 score of
97% using the proposed distributional representations ensemble.

 <dc:title>Structural Multi-type Sequent Calculus for Inquisitive Logic</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we define a multi-type calculus for inquisitive logic, which
is sound, complete and enjoys Belnap-style cut-elimination and subformula
property. Inquisitive logic is the logic of inquisitive semantics, a semantic
framework developed by Groenendijk, Roelofsen and Ciardelli which captures both
assertions and questions in natural language. Inquisitive logic is sound and
complete w.r.t. the so-called state semantics (also known as team semantics).
The Hilbert-style presentation of inquisitive logic is not closed under uniform
substitution; indeed, some occurrences of formulas are restricted to a certain
subclass of formulas, called flat formulas. This and other features make the
quest for analytic calculi for this logic not straightforward. We develop a
certain algebraic and order-theoretic analysis of the team semantics, which
provides the guidelines for the design of a multi-type environment which
accounts for two domains of interpretation, for flat and for general formulas,
as well as for their interaction. This multi-type environment in its turn
provides the semantic environment for the multi-type calculus for inquisitive
logic we introduce in this paper.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a precursory yet novel approach to the question answering
task using structural decomposition. Our system first generates linguistic
structures such as syntactic and semantic trees from text, decomposes them into
multiple fields, then indexes the terms in each field. For each question, it
decomposes the question into multiple fields, measures the relevance score of
each field to the indexed ones, then ranks all documents by their relevance
scores and weights associated with the fields, where the weights are learned
through statistical modeling. Our final model gives an absolute improvement of
over 40% to the baseline approach using simple search for detecting documents
containing answers.

 <dc:description>  Air travel is one of the most frequently used means of transportation in our
every-day life. Thus, it is not surprising that an increasing number of
travelers share their experiences with airlines and airports in form of online
reviews on the Web. In this work, we thrive to explain and uncover the features
of airline reviews that contribute most to traveler satisfaction. To that end,
we examine reviews crawled from the Skytrax air travel review portal. Skytrax
provides four review categories to review airports, lounges, airlines and
seats. Each review category consists of several five-star ratings as well as
free-text review content. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive feature
study and we find that not only five-star rating information such as airport
queuing time and lounge comfort highly correlate with traveler satisfaction but
also textual features in the form of the inferred review text sentiment. Based
on our findings, we created classifiers to predict traveler satisfaction using
the best performing rating features. Our results reveal that given our
methodology, traveler satisfaction can be predicted with high accuracy.
Additionally, we find that training a model on the sentiment of the review text
provides a competitive alternative when no five star rating information is
available. We believe that our work is of interest for researchers in the area
of modeling and predicting user satisfaction based on available review data on
the Web.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a two-level profit-maximizing strategy, including planning and
control, for battery energy storage system (BESS) owners that participate in
the primary frequency control (PFC) market. Specifically, the optimal BESS
control minimizes the operating cost by keeping the state of charge (SoC) in an
optimal range. Through rigorous analysis, we prove that the optimal BESS
control is a &quot;state-invariant&quot; strategy in the sense that the optimal SoC range
does not vary with the state of the system. As such, the optimal control
strategy can be computed offline once and for all with very low complexity.
Regarding the BESS planning, we prove that the the minimum operating cost is a
decreasing convex function of the BESS energy capacity. This leads to the
optimal BESS sizing that strikes a balance between the capital investment and
operating cost. Our work here provides a useful theoretical framework for
understanding the planning and control strategies that maximize the economic
benefits of BESSs in ancillary service markets.

 <dc:description>  On a two-dimensional cake, there are $m$ pairwise-disjoint toppings. It is
required to cut the cake to $m+b$ pieces, such that each topping is entirely
contained in a unique piece, and the total number of empty pieces ($b$,
&quot;blanks&quot;) is minimized. The minimal number of blanks naturally depends on the
geometric constraints of the cake and its pieces. The paper presents tight
bounds on the number of blanks when the pieces must be connected, convex or
rectangular.

 <dc:description>  Recent developments of the multiplex paradigm included efforts to understand
the role played by the presence of several layers on the dynamics of processes
running on these networks. The possible existence of new phenomena associated
to the richer topology has been discussed and examples of these differences
have been systematically searched. Here, we show that the interconnectivity of
the layers may have an important impact on the speed of the dynamics run in the
network and that microscopic changes such as the addition of one single
inter-layer link can notably affect the arrival at a global stationary state.
As a practical verification, these results obtained with spectral techniques
are confirmed with a Kuramoto dynamics for which the synchronization
consistently delays after the addition of single inter-layer links.

 <dc:description>  Data-driven workflows, of which IBM's Business Artifacts are a prime
exponent, have been successfully deployed in practice, adopted in industrial
standards, and have spawned a rich body of research in academia, focused
primarily on static analysis. The present work represents a significant advance
on the problem of artifact verification, by considering a much richer and more
realistic model than in previous work, incorporating core elements of IBM's
successful Guard-Stage-Milestone model. In particular, the model features task
hierarchy, concurrency, and richer artifact data. It also allows database key
and foreign key dependencies, as well as arithmetic constraints. The results
show decidability of verification and establish its complexity, making use of
novel techniques including a hierarchy of Vector Addition Systems and a variant
of quantifier elimination tailored to our context.

 <dc:description>  This article provides an elaborate overview of current research in extended
object tracking. We provide a clear definition of the extended object tracking
problem and discuss its delimitation to other types of object tracking. Next,
different aspects of extended object modelling are extensively discussed.
Subsequently, we give a tutorial introduction to two basic and well used
extended object tracking approaches - the random matrix approach and the Kalman
filter-based approach for star-convex shapes. The next part treats the tracking
of multiple extended objects and elaborates how the large number of feasible
association hypotheses can be tackled using both Random Finite Set (RFS) and
Non-RFS multi-object trackers. The article concludes with a summary of current
applications, where four example applications involving camera, X-band radar,
light detection and ranging (lidar), red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) sensors are
highlighted.

 <dc:description>  Network theory has proven to be a powerful tool in describing and analyzing
systems by modelling the relations between their constituent objects. In recent
years great progress has been made by augmenting `traditional' network theory.
However, existing network representations still lack crucial features in order
to serve as a general data analysis tool. These include, most importantly, an
explicit association of information with possibly heterogeneous types of
objects and relations, and a conclusive representation of the properties of
groups of nodes as well as the interactions between such groups on different
scales. In this paper, we introduce a collection of definitions resulting in a
framework that, on the one hand, entails and unifies existing network
representations (e.g., network of networks, multilayer networks), and on the
other hand, generalizes and extends them by incorporating the above features.
To implement these features, we first specify the nodes and edges of a finite
graph as sets of properties. Second, the mathematical concept of partition
lattices is transferred to network theory in order to demonstrate how
partitioning the node and edge set of a graph into supernodes and superedges
allows to aggregate, compute and allocate information on and between arbitrary
groups of nodes. The derived partition lattice of a graph, which we denote by
deep graph, constitutes a concise, yet comprehensive representation that
enables the expression and analysis of heterogeneous properties, relations and
interactions on all scales of a complex system in a self-contained manner.
Furthermore, to be able to utilize existing network-based methods and models,
we derive different representations of multilayer networks from our framework
and demonstrate the advantages of our representation. We exemplify an
application of deep graphs using a real world dataset of precipitation
measurements.

 <dc:title>Writer-independent Feature Learning for Offline Signature Verification

 <dc:description>  Automatic Offline Handwritten Signature Verification has been researched over
the last few decades from several perspectives, using insights from graphology,
computer vision, signal processing, among others. In spite of the advancements
on the field, building classifiers that can separate between genuine signatures
and skilled forgeries (forgeries made targeting a particular signature) is
still hard. We propose approaching the problem from a feature learning
perspective. Our hypothesis is that, in the absence of a good model of the data
generation process, it is better to learn the features from data, instead of
using hand-crafted features that have no resemblance to the signature
generation process. To this end, we use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to
learn features in a writer-independent format, and use this model to obtain a
feature representation on another set of users, where we train writer-dependent
classifiers. We tested our method in two datasets: GPDS-960 and Brazilian
PUC-PR. Our experimental results show that the features learned in a subset of
the users are discriminative for the other users, including across different
datasets, reaching close to the state-of-the-art in the GPDS dataset, and
improving the state-of-the-art in the Brazilian PUC-PR dataset.

 <dc:description>  The labyrinth game is a simple yet challenging platform, not only for humans
but also for control algorithms and systems. The game is easy to understand but
still very hard to master. From a system point of view, the ball behaviour is
in general easy to model but close to the obstacles there are severe
non-linearities. Additionally, the far from flat surface on which the ball
rolls provides for changing dynamics depending on the ball position. The
general dynamics of the system can easliy be handled by traditional automatic
control methods. Taking the obstacles and uneaven surface into accout would
require very detailed models of the system. A simple deterministic control
algorithm is combined with a learning control method. The simple control method
provides initial training data. As the learning method is trained, the system
can learn from the results of its own actions and the performance improves well
beyond the performance of the initial controller. A vision system and image
analysis is used to estimate the ball position while a combination of a PID
controller and a learning controller based on LWPR is used to learn to navigate
the ball through the maze.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a trust computation for international relations and its
calculus, which related to Bayesian inference, Dempster Shafer theory and
subjective logic. We proposed a method that allows a trust computation which is
previously subjective and incomputable. An example of case study for the trust
computation is the United States of America Great Britain relations. The method
supports decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense
ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense
(DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be known as a friendly,
neutral or hostile nation.

 <dc:description>  Distributed training of deep learning models on large-scale training data is
typically conducted with asynchronous stochastic optimization to maximize the
rate of updates, at the cost of additional noise introduced from asynchrony. In
contrast, the synchronous approach is often thought to be impractical due to
idle time wasted on waiting for straggling workers. We revisit these
conventional beliefs in this paper, and examine the weaknesses of both
approaches. We demonstrate that a third approach, synchronous optimization with
backup workers, can avoid asynchronous noise while mitigating for the worst
stragglers. Our approach is empirically validated and shown to converge faster
and to better test accuracies.

 <dc:title>Clustering Millions of Faces by Identity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this work, we attempt to address the following problem: Given a large
number of unlabeled face images, cluster them into the individual identities
present in this data. We consider this a relevant problem in different
application scenarios ranging from social media to law enforcement. In
large-scale scenarios the number of faces in the collection can be of the order
of hundreds of million, while the number of clusters can range from a few
thousand to millions--leading to difficulties in terms of both run-time
complexity and evaluating clustering and per-cluster quality. An efficient and
effective Rank-Order clustering algorithm is developed to achieve the desired
scalability, and better clustering accuracy than other well-known algorithms
such as k-means and spectral clustering. We cluster up to 123 million face
images into over 10 million clusters, and analyze the results in terms of both
external cluster quality measures (known face labels) and internal cluster
quality measures (unknown face labels) and run-time. Our algorithm achieves an
F-measure of 0.87 on a benchmark unconstrained face dataset (LFW, consisting of
13K faces), and 0.27 on the largest dataset considered (13K images in LFW, plus
123M distractor images). Additionally, we present preliminary work on video
frame clustering (achieving 0.71 F-measure when clustering all frames in the
benchmark YouTube Faces dataset). A per-cluster quality measure is developed
which can be used to rank individual clusters and to automatically identify a
subset of good quality clusters for manual exploration.

 <dc:description>  Feature descriptors, such as SIFT and ORB, are well-known for their
robustness to illumination changes, which has made them popular for
feature-based VSLAM\@. However, in degraded imaging conditions such as low
light, low texture, blur and specular reflections, feature extraction is often
unreliable. In contrast, direct VSLAM methods which estimate the camera pose by
minimizing the photometric error using raw pixel intensities are often more
robust to low textured environments and blur. Nonetheless, at the core of
direct VSLAM is the reliance on a consistent photometric appearance across
images, otherwise known as the brightness constancy assumption. Unfortunately,
brightness constancy seldom holds in real world applications.
  In this work, we overcome brightness constancy by incorporating feature
descriptors into a direct visual odometry framework. This combination results
in an efficient algorithm that combines the strength of both feature-based
algorithms and direct methods. Namely, we achieve robustness to arbitrary
photometric variations while operating in low-textured and poorly lit
environments. Our approach utilizes an efficient binary descriptor, which we
call Bit-Planes, and show how it can be used in the gradient-based optimization
required by direct methods. Moreover, we show that the squared Euclidean
distance between Bit-Planes is equivalent to the Hamming distance. Hence, the
descriptor may be used in least squares optimization without sacrificing its
photometric invariance. Finally, we present empirical results that demonstrate
the robustness of the approach in poorly lit underground environments.

 <dc:title>Progressive Temporal Window Widening</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tolpin, David</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a scheme for data stream processing which is robust to
batch duration. Streaming frameworks process streams in batches retrieved at
fixed time intervals. In a common setting a pattern recognition algorithm is
applied independently to each batch. Choosing the right time interval is tough
--- a pattern may not fit in an interval which is too short, but detection will
be delayed and memory may be exhausted if the interval is too long. We propose
here Progressive Window Widening, an algorithm for increasing the interval
gradually so that patterns are caught at any pace without unnecessary delays or
memory overflow.
  This algorithm is relevant to computer security, system monitoring, user
behavior tracking, and other applications where patterns of unknown or varying
duration must be recognized online in data streams. Modern data stream
processing frameworks are ubiquitously used to process high volumes of data,
and adaptive memory and CPU allocation, facilitated by Progressive Window
Widening, is crucial for their performance.

 <dc:description>  Since the launch of the Microsoft Kinect, scores of RGBD datasets have been
released. These have propelled advances in areas from reconstruction to gesture
recognition. In this paper we explore the field, reviewing datasets across
eight categories: semantics, object pose estimation, camera tracking, scene
reconstruction, object tracking, human actions, faces and identification. By
extracting relevant information in each category we help researchers to find
appropriate data for their needs, and we consider which datasets have succeeded
in driving computer vision forward and why.
  Finally, we examine the future of RGBD datasets. We identify key areas which
are currently underexplored, and suggest that future directions may include
synthetic data and dense reconstructions of static and dynamic scenes.

 <dc:description>  A methodology is developed to realized optimal channel input conditional
distributions, which maximize the finite-time horizon directed information, for
channels with memory and feedback, by information lossless randomized
strategies. The methodology is applied to general Time-Varying Multiple Input
Multiple Output (MIMO) Gaussian Linear Channel Models (G-LCMs) with memory,
subject to average transmission cost constraints of quadratic form. The
realizations of optimal distributions by randomized strategies are shown to
exhibit a decomposion into a deterministic part and a random part. The
decomposition reveals the dual role of randomized strategies, to control the
channel output process and to transmit new information over the channels.
Moreover, a separation principle is shown between the computation of the
optimal deterministic part and the random part of the randomized strategies.
The dual role of randomized strategies generalizes the
Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) stochastic optimal control theory to directed
information pay-offs. The characterizations of feedback capacity are obtained
from the per unit time limits of finite-time horizon directed information,
without imposing \'a priori assumptions, such as, stability of channel models
or ergodicity of channel input and output processes. For time-invariant MIMO
G-LCMs with memory, it is shown that whether feedback increases capacity, is
directly related to the channel parameters and the transmission cost function,
through the solutions of Riccati matrix equations, and moreover for unstable
channels, feedback capacity is non-zero, provided the power exceeds a critical
level.

 <dc:title>Optimal Multicasting in Hybrid RF/FSO DTNs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The multi-copy routing paradigm in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) implies
that increasing contact bandwidth leads to a decrease in data delivery delay
and an improvement in throughput. With Hybrid Radio Frequency/Free Space
Optical (RF/FSO) PHY layers, the high data rate FSO links can be used to
increase the contact bandwidth. However, due to the highly directional nature
of FSO links, broadcasting is difficult. A naive broadcast strategy where the
beam divergence angle is increased to include many nodes in the broadcast set
results in low data rate, and does not always result in the minimum achievable
delay.
  In this work we develop an optimal multicast algorithm for hybrid RF/FSO
networks. We show that the problem is an abstraction of the minimum weight set
cover problem which is known to be NP-hard. A computationally cheap greedy
local optimum heuristic is proposed. A comprehensive evaluation using delay,
throughput and computation time as metrics is performed using various
solutions. These extensive evaluations show that our solution outperforms both
naive broadcast and multiple unicast, taking 95% less time as compared to the
exact algorithm, while providing comparable performance.

 <dc:title>Information Structures of Maximizing Distributions of Feedback Capacity

 <dc:description>  For any class of channel conditional distributions, with finite memory
dependence on channel input RVs $A^n {\stackrel{\triangle}{=}} \{A_i: i=0,
\ldots, n\}$ or channel output RVs $B^n {\stackrel{\triangle}{=}} \{B_i: i=0,
\ldots, n\}$ or both, we characterize the sets of channel input distributions,
which maximize directed information defined by $ I(A^n \rightarrow B^n)
{\stackrel{\triangle}{=}} \sum_{i=0}^n I(A^i;B_i|B^{i-1}) $ and we derive the
corresponding expressions, called &quot;characterizations of Finite Transmission
Feedback Information (FTFI) capacity&quot;. The main theorems state that optimal
channel input distributions occur in subsets ${\cal P}_{[0,n]}^{CI}\subseteq
{\cal P}_{[0,n]} {\stackrel{\triangle}{=}}\big\{ {\bf P}_{A_i|A^{i-1},
B^{i-1}}: i=0, \ldots, n\big\}$, which satisfy conditional independence on past
information. We derive similar characterizations, when general transmission
cost constraints are imposed. Moreover, we also show that the structural
properties apply to general nonlinear and linear autoregressive channel models
defined by discrete-time recursions on general alphabet spaces, and driven by
arbitrary distributed noise processes. We derive these structural properties by
invoking stochastic optimal control theory and variational equalities of
directed information, to identify tight upper bounds on $I(A^n \rightarrow
B^n)$, which are achievable over subsets of conditional distributions ${\cal
P}_{[0,n]}^{CI} \subseteq {\cal P}_{[0,n]}$, which satisfy conditional
independence and they are specified by the dependence of channel distributions
and transmission cost functions on inputs and output symbols. We apply the
characterizations to recursive Multiple Input Multiple Output Gaussian Linear
Channel Models with limited memory and we show a separation principle between
the computation of the elements of the optimal strategies.

 <dc:description>  We derived the first sparse recovery guarantees for weighted $\ell_1$
minimization with sparse random matrices and the class of weighted sparse
signals, using a weighted versions of the null space property to derive these
guarantees. These sparse matrices from expender graphs can be applied very fast
and have other better computational complexities than their dense counterparts.
In addition we show that, using such sparse matrices, weighted sparse recovery
with weighted $\ell_1$ minimization leads to sample complexities that are
linear in the weighted sparsity of the signal and these sampling rates can be
smaller than those of standard sparse recovery. Moreover, these results reduce
to known results in standard sparse recovery and sparse recovery with prior
information and the results are supported by numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  Finding relevant publications is important for scientists who have to cope
with exponentially increasing numbers of scholarly material. Algorithms can
help with this task as they help for music, movie, and product recommendations.
However, we know little about the performance of these algorithms with
scholarly material. Here, we develop an algorithm, and an accompanying Python
library, that implements a recommendation system based on the content of
articles. Design principles are to adapt to new content, provide near-real time
suggestions, and be open source. We tested the library on 15K posters from the
Society of Neuroscience Conference 2015. Human curated topics are used to cross
validate parameters in the algorithm and produce a similarity metric that
maximally correlates with human judgments. We show that our algorithm
significantly outperformed suggestions based on keywords. The work presented
here promises to make the exploration of scholarly material faster and more
accurate.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the problem of estimating the region of attraction (RA)
of equilibrium points of nonlinear dynamical systems. The estimates we provide
are given by positively invariant sets which are not necessarily defined by
level sets of a Lyapunov function. Moreover, we present conditions for the
existence of Lyapunov functions linked to the positively invariant set
formulation we propose. Connections to fundamental results on estimates of the
RA are presented and support the search of Lyapunov functions of a rational
nature. We then restrict our attention to systems governed by polynomial vector
fields and provide an algorithm that is guaranteed to enlarge the estimate of
the RA at each iteration.

 <dc:description>  The $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm is one of the few algorithms
for which a super-constant speed-up through the use of crossover could be
proven. So far, this algorithm has been used with parameters based also on
intuitive considerations. In this work, we rigorously regard the whole
parameter space and show that the asymptotic time complexity proven by Doerr
and Doerr (GECCO 2015) for the intuitive choice is best possible among all
settings for population size, mutation probability, and crossover bias.

 <dc:description>  Reallocating resources to get mutually beneficial outcomes is a fundamental
problem in various multi-agent settings. In the first part of the paper we
focus on the setting in which agents express additive cardinal utilities over
objects. We present computational hardness results as well as polynomial-time
algorithms for testing Pareto optimality under different restrictions such as
two utility values or lexicographic utilities. In the second part of the paper
we assume that agents express only their (ordinal) preferences over single
objects, and that their preferences are additively separable. In this setting,
we present characterizations and polynomial-time algorithms for possible and
necessary Pareto optimality.

 <dc:description>  Real-time, high-quality, 3D scanning of large-scale scenes is key to mixed
reality and robotic applications. However, scalability brings challenges of
drift in pose estimation, introducing significant errors in the accumulated
model. Approaches often require hours of offline processing to globally correct
model errors. Recent online methods demonstrate compelling results, but suffer
from: (1) needing minutes to perform online correction preventing true
real-time use; (2) brittle frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation
resulting in many tracking failures; or (3) supporting only unstructured
point-based representations, which limit scan quality and applicability. We
systematically address these issues with a novel, real-time, end-to-end
reconstruction framework. At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy,
optimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the
complete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach. We
remove the heavy reliance on temporal tracking, and continually localize to the
globally optimized frames instead. We contribute a parallelizable optimization
framework, which employs correspondences based on sparse features and dense
geometric and photometric matching. Our approach estimates globally optimized
(i.e., bundle adjusted) poses in real-time, supports robust tracking with
recovery from gross tracking failures (i.e., relocalization), and re-estimates
the 3D model in real-time to ensure global consistency; all within a single
framework. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online systems with
quality on par to offline methods, but with unprecedented speed and scan
completeness. Our framework leads to a comprehensive online scanning solution
for large indoor environments, enabling ease of use and high-quality results.

 <dc:description>  Many online social networks thrive on automatic sharing of friends'
activities to a user through activity feeds, which may influence the user's
next actions. However, identifying such social influence is tricky because
these activities are simultaneously impacted by influence and homophily. We
propose a statistical procedure that uses commonly available network and
observational data about people's actions to estimate the extent of
copy-influence---mimicking others' actions that appear in a feed. We assume
that non-friends don't influence users; thus, comparing how a user's activity
correlates with friends versus non-friends who have similar preferences can
help tease out the effect of copy-influence.
  Experiments on datasets from multiple social networks show that estimates
that don't account for homophily overestimate copy-influence by varying, often
large amounts. Further, copy-influence estimates fall below 1% of total actions
in all networks: most people, and almost all actions, are not affected by the
feed. Our results question common perceptions around the extent of
copy-influence in online social networks and suggest improvements to diffusion
and recommendation models.

 <dc:description>  Event retrieval and recognition in a large corpus of videos necessitates a
holistic fixed-size visual representation at the video clip level that is
comprehensive, compact, and yet discriminative. It shall comprehensively
aggregate information across relevant video frames, while suppress redundant
information, leading to a compact representation that can effectively
differentiate among different visual events. In search for such a
representation, we propose to build a spatially consistent counting grid model
to aggregate together deep features extracted from different video frames. The
spatial consistency of the counting grid model is achieved by introducing a
prior model estimated from a large corpus of video data. The counting grid
model produces an intermediate tensor representation for each video, which
automatically identifies and removes the feature redundancy across the
different frames. The tensor representation is subsequently reduced to a
fixed-size vector representation by averaging over the counting grid. When
compared to existing methods on both event retrieval and event classification
benchmarks, we achieve significantly better accuracy with much more compact
representation.

 <dc:description>  The fairness of a secure multi-party quantum key agreement (MQKA) protocol
requires that all involved parties are entirely peer entities and can equally
influence the outcome of the protocol to establish a shared key wherein no one
can decide the shared key alone. However, it is found that parts of the
existing MQKA protocols are sensitive to collusion attacks, i.e., some of the
dishonest participants can collaborate to predetermine the final key without
being detected. In this paper, a multi-party QKA protocol resisting collusion
attacks is proposed. Different from previous QKA protocol resisting $N-1$
coconspirators or resisting $1$ coconspirators, we investigate the general
circle-type MQKA protocol which can be secure against $t$ dishonest
participants' cooperation. Here, $t &lt; N$. We hope the results of the presented
paper will be helpful for further research on fair MQKA protocols.

 <dc:description>  The demand for higher data rates and the scarce spectrum resources drive the
adoption of collaborative communication techniques. In this work we shown that
the existing cluster based collaborative schemes can be greatly improved in
terms of both the achievable performance, and complexity, by allowing
overlapping across clusters. Further improvement is achieved by incorporating
scheduling to the decoding process. Different variants of the improved schemes
are considered and are shown to achieve near optimum performance for practical
signal-to-noise ratios for the one- and two-dimensional (hexagonal) Wyner-type
models.

 <dc:description>  Designing well-connected graphs is a fundamental problem that frequently
arises in various contexts across science and engineering. The weighted number
of spanning trees, as a connectivity measure, emerges in numerous problems and
plays a key role in, e.g., network reliability under random edge failure,
estimation over networks and D-optimal experimental designs. This paper tackles
the open problem of designing graphs with the maximum weighted number of
spanning trees under various constraints. We reveal several new structures,
such as the log-submodularity of the weighted number of spanning trees in
connected graphs. We then exploit these structures and design a pair of
efficient approximation algorithms with performance guarantees and
near-optimality certificates. Our results can be readily applied to a wide
verity of applications involving graph synthesis and graph sparsification
scenarios.

 <dc:title>A Particle-Filtering Based Approach for Distributed Fault Diagnosis of
  Large-Scale Interconnected Nonlinear Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of designing a distributed fault detection
and isolation algorithm for nonlinear large-scale systems that are subjected to
multiple fault modes. To solve this problem, a network of communicating
detection nodes is deployed to monitor the monolithic process. Each node
consists of an estimator with partial observation of the system's state. The
local estimator executes a distributed variation of the particle filtering
algorithm using the partial sensor measurements and the fault progression model
of the process. During the implementation of the algorithm, each node
communicates with its neighbors by sharing pre-processed information. The
communication topology is defined using graph theoretic tools. The information
fusion between the neighboring nodes is performed by means of a distributed
average consensus algorithm to ensure the agreement over the value of the local
likelihood functions. The proposed method enables online hypothesis testing
without the need of a bank of estimators. Numerical simulations demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Predicting the future popularity of online content is highly important in
many applications. Preferential attachment phenomena is encountered in scale
free networks.Under it's influece popular items get more popular thereby
resulting in long tailed distribution problem. Consequently, new items which
can be popular (potential ones), are suppressed by the already popular items.
This paper proposes a novel model which is able to identify potential items. It
identifies the potentially popular items by considering the number of links or
ratings it has recieved in recent past along with it's popularity decay. For
obtaining an effecient model we consider only temporal features of the content,
avoiding the cost of extracting other features. We have found that people
follow recent behaviours of their peers. In presence of fit or quality items
already popular items lose it's popularity. Prediction accuracy is measured on
three industrial datasets namely Movielens, Netflix and Facebook wall post.
Experimental results show that compare to state-of-the-art model our model have
better prediction accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising technology that promises
to significantly reduce the operational costs of network services by deploying
virtualized network functions (VNFs) to commodity servers in place of dedicated
hardware middleboxes. The VNFs are typically running on virtual machine
instances in a cloud infrastructure, where the virtualization technology
enables dynamic provisioning of VNF instances, to process the fluctuating
traffic that needs to go through the network functions in a network service. In
this paper, we target dynamic provisioning of enterprise network services -
expressed as one or multiple service chains - in cloud datacenters, and design
efficient online algorithms without requiring any information on future traffic
rates. The key is to decide the number of instances of each VNF type to
provision at each time, taking into consideration the server resource
capacities and traffic rates between adjacent VNFs in a service chain. In the
case of a single service chain, we discover an elegant structure of the problem
and design an efficient randomized algorithm achieving a e/(e-1) competitive
ratio. For multiple concurrent service chains, an online heuristic algorithm is
proposed, which is O(1)-competitive. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithms using solid theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations.

 <dc:description>  Classifying a visual concept merely from its associated online textual
source, such as a Wikipedia article, is an attractive research topic in
zero-shot learning because it alleviates the burden of manually collecting
semantic attributes. Several recent works have pursued this approach by
exploring various ways of connecting the visual and text domains. This paper
revisits this idea by stepping further to consider one important factor: the
textual representation is usually too noisy for the zero-shot learning
application. This consideration motivates us to design a simple-but-effective
zero-shot learning method capable of suppressing noise in the text.
  More specifically, we propose an $l_{2,1}$-norm based objective function
which can simultaneously suppress the noisy signal in the text and learn a
function to match the text document and visual features. We also develop an
optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting problem. By
conducting experiments on two large datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly outperforms the competing methods which rely on online
information sources but without explicit noise suppression. We further make an
in-depth analysis of the proposed method and provide insight as to what kind of
information in documents is useful for zero-shot learning.

 <dc:description>  To improve the sum-rate (SR) of the dual-hop relay system, a novel two-stage
power allocation scheme with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed.
In this scheme, after the reception of the superposition coded symbol with a
power allocation from the source, the relay node forwards a new superposition
coded symbol with another power allocation to the destination. By employing the
maximum ratio combination (MRC), the destination jointly decodes the
information symbols from the source and the relay. Assuming Rayleigh fading
channels, closed-form solution of the ergodic SR at high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) is derived and a practical power allocation is also designed for the
proposed NOMA scheme. Through numerical results, it is shown that the
performance of the proposed scheme is significantly improved compared with the
existing work.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for the initial access
(a.k.a. Base Station (BS) discovery) in a millimeter-wave (mm-wave)
communication system and propose an effective strategy for transmitting the
Reference Signals (RSs) used for BS discovery. Specifically, by formulating the
problem of BS discovery at User Equipments (UEs) as hypothesis tests, we derive
a detector based on the Generalised Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) and
characterise the statistical behaviour of the detector. The theoretical results
obtained allow analysis of the impact of key system parameters on the
performance of BS discovery, and show that RS transmission with narrow beams
may not be helpful in improving the overall BS discovery performance due to the
cost of spatial scanning. Using the method of large deviations, we identify the
desirable beam pattern that minimises the average miss-discovery probability of
UEs within a targeted detectable region. We then propose to transmit the RS
with sequential scanning, using a pre-designed codebook with narrow and/or wide
beams to approximate the desirable patterns. The proposed design allows
flexible choices of the codebook sizes and the associated beam widths to better
approximate the desirable patterns. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to present the control system design of
Tricopter. We have presented the implementation of control system in software
in this paper. Tricopter's control system mainly consists of two parts
Complimentary filter and PID block. The angles along X, Y and Z axis are taken
from the complementary filter which acts as a feedback block. We have used the
combination of gyroscope and accelerometer for finding the angle. We have also
shown the role of the complimentary filter in finding out the angle along X, Y,
and Z axis instead of using gyroscope and accelerometer directly. The second
main part is the PID Controller which calculates the error in angle along X, Y
and Z axis and produces an output signal which reduces error. We have shown the
importance of the constant parameters of PID Controller. The results of this
paper are tested on an actual Tricopter and also plotted in the form of graph
using Matlab and Processing software.

 <dc:description>  The main advantage of Constraint Programming (CP) approaches for sequential
pattern mining (SPM) is their modularity, which includes the ability to add new
constraints (regular expressions, length restrictions, etc). The current best
CP approach for SPM uses a global constraint (module) that computes the
projected database and enforces the minimum frequency; it does this with a
filtering algorithm similar to the PrefixSpan method. However, the resulting
system is not as scalable as some of the most advanced mining systems like
Zaki's cSPADE. We show how, using techniques from both data mining and CP, one
can use a generic constraint solver and yet outperform existing specialized
systems. This is mainly due to two improvements in the module that computes the
projected frequencies: first, computing the projected database can be sped up
by pre-computing the positions at which an symbol can become unsupported by a
sequence, thereby avoiding to scan the full sequence each time; and second by
taking inspiration from the trailing used in CP solvers to devise a
backtracking-aware data structure that allows fast incremental storing and
restoring of the projected database. Detailed experiments show how this
approach outperforms existing CP as well as specialized systems for SPM, and
that the gain in efficiency translates directly into increased efficiency for
other settings such as mining with regular expressions.

 <dc:description>  A suffix tree is a data structure used mainly for pattern matching. It is
known that the space complexity of simple suffix trees is quadratic in the
length of the string. By a slight modification of the simple suffix trees one
gets the compact suffix trees, which have linear space complexity. The
motivation of this paper is the question whether the space complexity of simple
suffix trees is quadratic not only in the worst case, but also in expectation.

 <dc:title>A Fast Incremental BSP Tree Archive for Non-dominated Points</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Glasmachers, Tobias</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Maintaining an archive of all non-dominated points is a standard task in
multi-objective optimization. Sometimes it is sufficient to store all evaluated
points and to obtain the non-dominated subset in a post-processing step.
Alternatively the non-dominated set can be updated on the fly. While keeping
track of many non-dominated points efficiently is easy for two objectives, we
propose an efficient algorithm based on a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree
for the general case of three or more objectives. Our analysis and our
empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the method over the
brute-force baseline method, as well as graceful scaling to large numbers of
objectives.

 <dc:description>  With ever-increasing amounts of online information available, modeling and
predicting individual preferences-for books or articles, for example-is
becoming more and more important. Good predictions enable us to improve advice
to users, and obtain a better understanding of the socio-psychological
processes that determine those preferences. We have developed a collaborative
filtering model, with an associated scalable algorithm, that makes accurate
predictions of individuals' preferences. Our approach is based on the explicit
assumption that there are groups of individuals and of items, and that the
preferences of an individual for an item are determined only by their group
memberships. Importantly, we allow each individual and each item to belong
simultaneously to mixtures of different groups and, unlike many popular
approaches, such as matrix factorization, we do not assume implicitly or
explicitly that individuals in each group prefer items in a single group of
items. The resulting overlapping groups and the predicted preferences can be
inferred with a expectation-maximization algorithm whose running time scales
linearly (per iteration). Our approach enables us to predict individual
preferences in large datasets, and is considerably more accurate than the
current algorithms for such large datasets.

 <dc:title>Sparse Recovery Guarantees from Extreme Eigenvalues Small Deviations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This article provides a new toolbox to derive sparse recovery guarantees from
small deviations on extreme singular values or extreme eigenvalues obtained in
Random Matrix Theory. This work is based on Restricted Isometry Constants
(RICs) which are a pivotal notion in Compressed Sensing and High-Dimensional
Statistics as these constants finely assess how a linear operator is
conditioned on the set of sparse vectors and hence how it performs in SRSR.
While it is an open problem to construct deterministic matrices with apposite
RICs, one can prove that such matrices exist using random matrices models. In
this paper, we show upper bounds on RICs for Gaussian and Rademacher matrices
using state-of-the-art small deviation estimates on their extreme eigenvalues.
This allows us to derive a lower bound on the probability of getting SRSR. One
benefit of this paper is a direct and explicit derivation of upper bounds on
RICs and lower bounds on SRSR from small deviations on the extreme eigenvalues
given by Random Matrix theory.

 <dc:title>On the Combinatorial Complexity of Approximating Polytopes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Approximating convex bodies succinctly by convex polytopes is a fundamental
problem in discrete geometry. A convex body $K$ of diameter $\mathrm{diam}(K)$
is given in Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, where $d$ is a constant. Given an
error parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the objective is to determine a polytope of
minimum combinatorial complexity whose Hausdorff distance from $K$ is at most
$\varepsilon \cdot \mathrm{diam}(K)$. By combinatorial complexity we mean the
total number of faces of all dimensions of the polytope. A well-known result by
Dudley implies that $O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ facets suffice, and a dual
result by Bronshteyn and Ivanov similarly bounds the number of vertices, but
neither result bounds the total combinatorial complexity. We show that there
exists an approximating polytope whose total combinatorial complexity is
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$, where $\tilde{O}$ conceals a
polylogarithmic factor in $1/\varepsilon$. This is a significant improvement
upon the best known bound, which is roughly $O(1/\varepsilon^{d-2})$.
  Our result is based on a novel combination of both old and new ideas. First,
we employ Macbeath regions, a classical structure from the theory of convexity.
The construction of our approximating polytope employs a new stratified
placement of these regions. Second, in order to analyze the combinatorial
complexity of the approximating polytope, we present a tight analysis of a
width-based variant of B\'{a}r\'{a}ny and Larman's economical cap covering.
Finally, we use a deterministic adaptation of the witness-collector technique
(developed recently by Devillers et al.) in the context of our stratified
construction.

 <dc:title>Modeling Relational Information in Question-Answer Pairs with

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose convolutional neural networks for learning an
optimal representation of question and answer sentences. Their main aspect is
the use of relational information given by the matches between words from the
two members of the pair. The matches are encoded as embeddings with additional
parameters (dimensions), which are tuned by the network. These allows for
better capturing interactions between questions and answers, resulting in a
significant boost in accuracy. We test our models on two widely used answer
sentence selection benchmarks. The results clearly show the effectiveness of
our relational information, which allows our relatively simple network to
approach the state of the art.

 <dc:title>Approximate Polytope Membership Queries</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the polytope membership problem, a convex polytope $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$
is given, and the objective is to preprocess $K$ into a data structure so that,
given any query point $q \in \mathbb{R}^d$, it is possible to determine
efficiently whether $q \in K$. We consider this problem in an approximate
setting. Given an approximation parameter $\varepsilon$, the query can be
answered either way if the distance from $q$ to $K$'s boundary is at most
$\varepsilon$ times $K$'s diameter. We assume that the dimension $d$ is fixed,
and $K$ is presented as the intersection of $n$ halfspaces. Previous solutions
to approximate polytope membership were based on straightforward applications
of classic polytope approximation techniques by Dudley (1974) and Bentley et
al. (1982). The former is optimal in the worst-case with respect to space, and
the latter is optimal with respect to query time.
  We present four main results. First, we show how to combine the two above
techniques to obtain a simple space-time trade-off. Second, we present an
algorithm that dramatically improves this trade-off. In particular, for any
constant $\alpha \ge 4$, this data structure achieves query time
$O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/\alpha})$ and space roughly $O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)(1 -
O(\log \alpha)/\alpha)})$. We do not know whether this space bound is tight,
but our third result shows that there is a convex body such that our algorithm
achieves a space of at least $\Omega(
1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)(1-O(\sqrt{\alpha})/\alpha} )$. Our fourth result shows
that it is possible to reduce approximate Euclidean nearest neighbor searching
to approximate polytope membership queries. Combined with the above results,
this provides significant improvements to the best known space-time trade-offs
for approximate nearest neighbor searching in $\mathbb{R}^d$.

 <dc:description>  We develop an algebraic underpinning of backtracking monad transformers in
the general setting of monoidal categories. As our main technical device, we
introduce Eilenberg--Moore monoids, which combine monoids with algebras for
strong monads. We show that Eilenberg--Moore monoids coincide with algebras for
the list monad transformer ('done right') known from Haskell libraries.
  From this, we obtain a number of results, including the facts that the list
monad transformer is indeed a monad, a transformer, and an instance of the
MonadPlus class. Finally, we construct an Eilenberg--Moore monoid of
endomorphisms, which, via the codensity monad construction, yields a
continuation-based implementation a la Hinze.

 <dc:description>  We develop a simple functional programming language aimed at manipulating
infinite, but first-order definable structures, such as the countably infinite
clique graph or the set of all intervals with rational endpoints. Internally,
such sets are represented by logical formulas that define them, and an external
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver is regularly run by the interpreter
to check their basic properties.
  The language is implemented as a Haskell module.

exist. In this paper, we continue the study of Noetherian sets in the
dependently typed setting of the Agda programming language. We want to say that
a set is Noetherian, if, when we are shown elements from it one after another,
we will sooner or later have seen some element twice. This idea can be made
precise in a number of ways. We explore the properties and connections of some
of the possible encodings. In particular, we show that certain implementations
imply decidable equality while others do not, and we construct counterexamples
in the latter case. Additionally, we explore the relation between
Noetherianness and other notions of finiteness.

data and laws of a directed container morphism those of a monoid morphism in

We draw some conclusions for comonads from this observation, considering in
particular basic constructions and concepts like the opposite category and a

 <dc:title>Enhanced Approximation of Labeled Multi-object Density based on

 <dc:creator>Yi, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Li, Suqi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multi-object density is a fundamental descriptor of a point process and has
ability to describe the randomness of number and values of objects, as well as
the statistical correlation between objects. Due to its comprehensive nature,
it usually has a complicate mathematical structure making the set integral
suffering from the curse of dimension and the combinatorial nature of the
problem. Hence, the approximation of multi-object density is a key research
theme in point process theory or finite set statistics (FISST). Conventional
approaches usually discard part or all of statistical correlation mechanically
in return for computational efficiency, without considering the real situation
of correlation between objects. In this paper, we propose an enhanced
approximation of labeled multi-object (LMO) density which evaluates the
correlation between objects adaptively and factorizes the LMO density into
densities of several independent subsets according to the correlation analysis.
Besides, to get a tractable factorization of LMO density, we derive the set
marginal density of any subset of the universal labeled RFS, the generalized
labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) RFS family and its subclasses. The proposed
method takes into account the simplification of the complicate structure of LMO
density and the reservation of necessary correlation at the same time.

 <dc:description>  Community structures detection in complex network is important for
understanding not only the topological structures of the network, but also the
functions of it. Stochastic block model and nonnegative matrix factorization
are two widely used methods for community detection, which are proposed from
different perspectives. In this paper, the relations between them are studied.
The logarithm of likelihood function for stochastic block model can be
reformulated under the framework of nonnegative matrix factorization. Besides
the model equivalence, the algorithms employed by the two methods are
different. Preliminary numerical experiments are carried out to compare the
behaviors of the algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an exact Bayesian filtering solution for the multi-object
tracking problem with the generic observation model. The proposed solution is
designed in the labeled random finite set framework, using the product styled
representation of labeled multi-object densities, with the standard
multi-object transition kernel and no particular simplifying assumptions on the
multi-object likelihood. Computationally tractable solutions are also devised
by applying a principled approximation involving the replacement of the full
multi-object density with a labeled multi-Bernoulli density that minimizes the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and preserves the first-order moment. To achieve
the fast performance, a dynamic grouping procedure based implementation is
presented with a step-by-step algorithm. The performance of the proposed filter
and its tractable implementations are verified and compared with the
state-of-the-art in numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  Researchers often summarize their work in the form of posters. Posters
provide a coherent and efficient way to convey core ideas from scientific
papers. Generating a good scientific poster, however, is a complex and time
consuming cognitive task, since such posters need to be readable, informative,
and visually aesthetic. In this paper, for the first time, we study the
challenging problem of learning to generate posters from scientific papers. To
this end, a data-driven framework, that utilizes graphical models, is proposed.
Specifically, given content to display, the key elements of a good poster,
including panel layout and attributes of each panel, are learned and inferred
from data. Then, given inferred layout and attributes, composition of graphical
elements within each panel is synthesized. To learn and validate our model, we
collect and make public a Poster-Paper dataset, which consists of scientific
papers and corresponding posters with exhaustively labelled panels and
attributes. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate the effectiveness of
our approach.

 <dc:description>  The paper steps outside the comfort-zone of the traditional NLP tasks like
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) to addresses
two novel problems arising in the automated multilingual news monitoring:
segmentation of the TV and radio program ASR transcripts into individual
stories, and clustering of the individual stories coming from various sources
and languages into storylines. Storyline clustering of stories covering the
same events is an essential task for inquisitorial media monitoring. We address
these two problems jointly by engaging the low-dimensional semantic
representation capabilities of the sequence to sequence neural translation
models. To enable joint multi-task learning for multilingual neural translation
of morphologically rich languages we replace the attention mechanism with the
sliding-window mechanism and operate the sequence to sequence neural
translation model on the character-level rather than on the word-level. The
story segmentation and storyline clustering problem is tackled by examining the
low-dimensional vectors produced as a side-product of the neural translation
process. The results of this paper describe a novel approach to the automatic
story segmentation and storyline clustering problem.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a discrete time linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG)
control problem in which state information of the plant is encoded in a
variable-length binary codeword at every time step, and a control input is
determined based on the codewords generated in the past. We derive a lower
bound of the rate achievable by the class of prefix-free codes attaining the
required LQG control performance. This lower bound coincides with the infimum
of a certain directed information expression, and is computable by semidefinite
programming (SDP). Based on a technique by Silva et al., we also provide an
upper bound of the best achievable rate by constructing a controller equipped
with a uniform quantizer with subtractive dither and Shannon-Fano coding. The
gap between the obtained lower and upper bounds is less than $0.754r+1$ bits
per time step regardless of the required LQG control performance, where $r$ is
the rank of a signal-to-noise ratio matrix obtained by SDP, which is no greater
than the dimension of the state.

 <dc:description>  Tree adjoining grammar (TAG) is specifically suited for morph rich and
agglutinated languages like Tamil due to its psycho linguistic features and
parse time dependency and morph resolution. Though TAG and LTAG formalisms have
been known for about 3 decades, efforts on designing TAG Syntax for Tamil have
not been entirely successful due to the complexity of its specification and the
rich morphology of Tamil language. In this paper we present a minimalistic TAG
for Tamil without much morphological considerations and also introduce a parser
implementation with some obvious variations from the XTAG system

 <dc:title>Mental Lexicon Growth Modelling Reveals the Multiplexity of the English

 <dc:description>  In this work we extend previous analyses of linguistic networks by adopting a
multi-layer network framework for modelling the human mental lexicon, i.e. an
abstract mental repository where words and concepts are stored together with
their linguistic patterns. Across a three-layer linguistic multiplex, we model
English words as nodes and connect them according to (i) phonological
similarities, (ii) synonym relationships and (iii) free word associations. Our
main aim is to exploit this multi-layered structure to explore the influence of
phonological and semantic relationships on lexicon assembly over time. We
propose a model of lexicon growth which is driven by the phonological layer:
words are suggested according to different orderings of insertion (e.g. shorter
word length, highest frequency, semantic multiplex features) and accepted or
rejected subject to constraints. We then measure times of network assembly and
compare these to empirical data about the age of acquisition of words. In
agreement with empirical studies in psycholinguistics, our results provide
quantitative evidence for the hypothesis that word acquisition is driven by
features at multiple levels of organisation within language.

 <dc:description>  In many image-related tasks, learning expressive and discriminative
representations of images is essential, and deep learning has been studied for
automating the learning of such representations. Some user-centric tasks, such
as image recommendations, call for effective representations of not only images
but also preferences and intents of users over images. Such representations are
termed \emph{hybrid} and addressed via a deep learning approach in this paper.
We design a dual-net deep network, in which the two sub-networks map input
images and preferences of users into a same latent semantic space, and then the
distances between images and users in the latent space are calculated to make
decisions. We further propose a comparative deep learning (CDL) method to train
the deep network, using a pair of images compared against one user to learn the
pattern of their relative distances. The CDL embraces much more training data
than naive deep learning, and thus achieves superior performance than the
latter, with no cost of increasing network complexity. Experimental results
with real-world data sets for image recommendations have shown the proposed
dual-net network and CDL greatly outperform other state-of-the-art image
recommendation solutions.

 <dc:description>  We investigate optimal control of dynamical systems which are affine, i.e.,
linear in control, but nonlinear in state. The control task is to enforce the
system state to follow a prescribed desired trajectory as closely as possible,
a task also known as optimal trajectory tracking. To obtain well-behaved
solutions to optimal control, a regularization term with coefficient
$\varepsilon$ must be included in the cost functional. Assuming $\varepsilon$
to be small, we reinterpret affine optimal control problems as singularly
perturbed differential equations. Performing a singular perturbation expansion,
approximations for the optimal tracking of arbitrary desired trajectories are
derived. For $\varepsilon=0$, the state trajectory may become discontinuous,
and the control may diverge. On the other hand, the analytical treatment
becomes exact. We identify the conditions leading to linear evolution
equations. These result in exact analytical solutions for an entire class of
nonlinear trajectory tracking problems. The class comprises, among others,
mechanical control systems in one spatial dimension and the FitzHugh-Nagumo
model with a control acting on the activator.

 <dc:title>Feature extraction using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Neural

 <dc:description>  Feature extraction has gained increasing attention in the field of machine
learning, as in order to detect patterns, extract information, or predict
future observations from big data, the urge of informative features is crucial.
The process of extracting features is highly linked to dimensionality reduction
as it implies the transformation of the data from a sparse high-dimensional
space, to higher level meaningful abstractions. This dissertation employs
Neural Networks for distributed paragraph representations, and Latent Dirichlet
Allocation to capture higher level features of paragraph vectors. Although
Neural Networks for distributed paragraph representations are considered the
state of the art for extracting paragraph vectors, we show that a quick topic
analysis model such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation can provide meaningful
features too. We evaluate the two methods on the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, a
collection of 25,203 movie plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia. Finally,
for both approaches, we use K-Nearest Neighbors to discover similar movies, and
plot the projected representations using T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding to depict the context similarities. These similarities, expressed as
movie distances, can be used for movies recommendation. The recommended movies
of this approach are compared with the recommended movies from IMDB, which use
a collaborative filtering recommendation approach, to show that our two models
could constitute either an alternative or a supplementary recommendation
approach.

 <dc:description>  The first generation of wireless sensor nodes have constrained energy
resources and computational power, which discourages applications to process
any task other than measuring and transmitting towards a central server.
However, nowadays, sensor networks tend to be incorporated into the Internet of
Things and the hardware evolution may change the old strategy of avoiding data
computation in the sensor nodes. In this paper, we show the importance of
reducing the number of transmissions in sensor networks and present the use of
forecasting methods as a way of doing it. Experiments using real sensor data
show that state-of-the-art forecasting methods can be successfully implemented
in the sensor nodes to keep the quality of their measurements and reduce up to
30% of their transmissions, lowering the channel utilization. We conclude that
there is an old paradigm that is no longer the most beneficial, which is the
strategy of always transmitting a measurement when it differs by more than a
threshold from the last one transmitted. Adopting more complex forecasting
methods in the sensor nodes is the alternative to significantly reduce the
number of transmissions without compromising the quality of their measurements,
and therefore support the exponential growth of the Internet of Things.

 <dc:description>  Software-defined networking offers a device-agnostic programmable framework
to encode new network functions. Externally centralized control plane
intelligence allows programmers to write network applications and to build
functional network designs. OpenFlow is a key protocol widely adopted to build
programmable networks because of its programmability, flexibility and ability
to interconnect heterogeneous network devices. We simulate the functional
topology of a multi-node quantum network that uses programmable network
principles to manage quantum metadata for protocols such as teleportation,
superdense coding, and quantum key distribution. We first show how the OpenFlow
protocol can manage the quantum metadata needed to control the quantum channel.
We then use numerical simulation to demonstrate robust programmability of a
quantum switch via the OpenFlow network controller while executing an
application of superdense coding. We describe the software framework
implemented to carry out these simulations and we discuss near-term efforts to
realize these applications.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recognition of goals and plans using incomplete evidence from action
execution can be done efficiently by using planning techniques. In many
applications it is important to recognize goals and plans not only accurately,
but also quickly. In this paper, we develop a heuristic approach for
recognizing plans based on planning techniques that rely on ordering
constraints to filter candidate goals from observations. These ordering
constraints are called landmarks in the planning literature, which are facts or
actions that cannot be avoided to achieve a goal. We show the applicability of
planning landmarks in two settings: first, we use it directly to develop a
heuristic-based plan recognition approach; second, we refine an existing
planning-based plan recognition approach by pre-filtering its candidate goals.
Our empirical evaluation shows that our approach is not only substantially more
accurate than the state-of-the-art in all available datasets, it is also an
order of magnitude faster.

 <dc:title>RIGA at SemEval-2016 Task 8: Impact of Smatch Extensions and
  Character-Level Neural Translation on AMR Parsing Accuracy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Barzdins, Guntis</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gosko, Didzis</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Two extensions to the AMR smatch scoring script are presented. The first
extension com-bines the smatch scoring script with the C6.0 rule-based
classifier to produce a human-readable report on the error patterns frequency
observed in the scored AMR graphs. This first extension results in 4% gain over
the state-of-art CAMR baseline parser by adding to it a manually crafted
wrapper fixing the identified CAMR parser errors. The second extension combines
a per-sentence smatch with an en-semble method for selecting the best AMR graph
among the set of AMR graphs for the same sentence. This second modification
au-tomatically yields further 0.4% gain when ap-plied to outputs of two
nondeterministic AMR parsers: a CAMR+wrapper parser and a novel character-level
neural translation AMR parser. For AMR parsing task the character-level neural
translation attains surprising 7% gain over the carefully optimized word-level
neural translation. Overall, we achieve smatch F1=62% on the SemEval-2016
official scor-ing set and F1=67% on the LDC2015E86 test set.

 <dc:title>Age of Information: The Gamma Awakening</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a scenario where a monitor is interested in being up to date with
respect to the status of some system which is not directly accessible to this
monitor. However, we assume a source node has access to the status and can send
status updates as packets to the monitor through a communication system. We
also assume that the status updates are generated randomly as a Poisson
process. The source node can manage the packet transmission to minimize the age
of information at the destination node, which is defined as the time elapsed
since the last successfully transmitted update was generated at the source. We
use queuing theory to model the source-destination link and we assume that the
time to successfully transmit a packet is a gamma distributed service time. We
consider two packet management schemes: LCFS (Last Come First Served) with
preemption and LCFS without preemption. We compute and analyze the average age
and the average peak age of information under these assumptions. Moreover, we
extend these results to the case where the service time is deterministic.

 <dc:description>  The topic of this paper is the Finiteness Conjecture for minimally
unsatisfiable clause-sets (MUs), stating that for each fixed deficiency (number
of clauses minus number of variables) there are only finitely many patterns,
given a certain basic reduction (generalising unit-clause propagation). We
focus our attention on hitting clause-sets (every two clauses have at least one
clash), where the conjecture says that there are only finitely many isomorphism
types. The Finiteness Conjecture is here known to hold for deficiency at most
2, and we now prove it for deficiency 3. An important tool is the notion of
&quot;(ir)reducible clause-sets&quot;: we show how to reduce the general question to the
irreducible case, and then solve this case (for deficiency 3). This notion
comes from number theory (Korec 1984, Berger et al 1990), and we rediscovered
it in our studies.

 <dc:title>Implementation of the Programming Language Dino -- A Case Study in
  Dynamic Language Performance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Makarov, Vladimir N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The article gives a brief overview of the current state of programming
language Dino in order to see where its stands between other dynamic
programming languages. Then it describes the current implementation, used tools
and major implementation decisions including how to implement a stable,
portable and simple JIT compiler.
  We study the effect of major implementation decisions on the performance of
Dino on x86-64, AARCH64, and Powerpc64. In brief, the performance of some model
benchmark on x86-64 was improved by $\textbf{3.1}$ times after moving from a
stack based virtual machine to a register-transfer architecture, a further
$\textbf{1.5}$ times by adding byte code combining, a further $\textbf{2.3}$
times through the use of JIT, and a further $\textbf{4.4}$ times by performing
type inference with byte code specialization, with a resulting overall
performance improvement of about $\textbf{47}$ times. To put these results in
context, we include performance comparisons of Dino with widely used
implementations of Ruby, Python 3, PyPy and JavaScript on the three platforms
mentioned above.
  The goal of this article is to share the experience of Dino implementation
with other dynamic language implementors in hope that it can help them to
improve implementation of popular dynamic languages to make them probably
faster and more portable, using less developer resources, and may be to avoid
some mistakes and wrong directions which were experienced during Dino
development.

 <dc:description>  A collaborative distributed binary decision problem is considered. Two
statisticians are required to declare the correct probability measure of two
jointly distributed memoryless process, denoted by $X^n=(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ and
$Y^n=(Y_1,\dots,Y_n)$, out of two possible probability measures on finite
alphabets, namely $P_{XY}$ and $P_{\bar{X}\bar{Y}}$. The marginal samples given
by $X^n$ and $Y^n$ are assumed to be available at different locations. The
statisticians are allowed to exchange limited amount of data over multiple
rounds of interactions, which differs from previous work that deals mainly with
unidirectional communication. A single round of interaction is considered
before the result is generalized to any finite number of communication rounds.
A feasibility result is shown, guaranteeing the feasibility of an error
exponent for general hypotheses, through information-theoretic methods. The
special case of testing against independence is revisited as being an instance
of this result for which also an unfeasibility result is proven. A second
special case is studied where zero-rate communication is imposed (data
exchanges grow sub-exponentially with $n$) for which it is shown that
interaction does not improve asymptotic performance.

 <dc:title>Global sensitivity analysis of battery equivalent circuit model
  parameters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhao, Shi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Howey, David A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers one of the most commonly used equivalent circuit models
(ECMs) for lithium-ion batteries and investigates the sensitivity of the model
output to changes of model parameters using the Morris method. Experiments are
carried out on a lithium-ion cell with nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC)
electrode and parameters of the model are identified in the state of charge
(SOC) range [100%,10%]. Although all the model parameters do vary with SOC,
global sensitivity analysis reveals that the uncertainties of some of the
parameters generate very little uncertainty in the voltage output, implying
that those parameters can be taken as constants without compromising the
accuracy of the model. This is further confirmed by experimental validation.

 <dc:description>  There is an obvious trend that more and more data and computation are
migrating into networks nowadays. Combining mature virtualization technologies
with service-centric net- working, we are entering into an era where countless
services reside in an ISP network to provide low-latency access. Such services
are often computation intensive and are dynamically created and destroyed on
demands everywhere in the network to perform various tasks. Consequently, these
ephemeral in-network services introduce a new type of congestion in the network
which we refer to as &quot;computation congestion&quot;. The service load need to be
effectively distributed on different nodes in order to maintain the
funtionality and responsiveness of the network, which calls for a new design
rather than reusing the centralised scheduler designed for cloud-based
services. In this paper, we study both passive and proactive control
strategies, based on the proactive control we further propose a fully
distributed solution which is low complexity, adaptive, and responsive to
network dynamics.

 <dc:title>Towards Label Imbalance in Multi-label Classification with Many Labels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Li</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Houfeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In multi-label classification, an instance may be associated with a set of
labels simultaneously. Recently, the research on multi-label classification has
largely shifted its focus to the other end of the spectrum where the number of
labels is assumed to be extremely large. The existing works focus on how to
design scalable algorithms that offer fast training procedures and have a small
memory footprint. However they ignore and even compound another challenge - the
label imbalance problem. To address this drawback, we propose a novel
Representation-based Multi-label Learning with Sampling (RMLS) approach. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the imbalance problem in
multi-label classification with many labels. Our experimentations with
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  From the generating matrix of a linear code one can construct a sequence of
generalized star configurations which are strongly connected to the generalized
Hamming weights and the underlying matroid of the code. When the code is MDS,
the matrix is generic and we obtain the usual star configurations. In our main
result, we show that the degree of a generalized star configuration as a
projective scheme is determined by the Tutte polynomial of the code. In the
process, we obtain preliminary results on the primary decomposition of the
defining ideals of these schemes. Additionally, we conjecture that these ideals
have linear minimal free resolutions and prove partial results in this
direction.

 <dc:description>  A new method to identify all sufficiently long repeating substrings in one or
several symbol sequences is proposed. The method is based on a specific gauge
applied to symbol sequences that guarantees identification of the repeating
substrings. It allows the matching of substrings to contain a given level of
errors. The gauge is based on the development of a heavily sparse dictionary of
repeats, thus drastically accelerating the search procedure. Some genomic
applications illustrate the method.

 <dc:description>  The goal of cryo-electron microscopy (EM) is to reconstruct the 3-dimensional
structure of a molecule from a collection of its 2-dimensional projected
images. In this article, we show that the basic premise of cryo-EM --- patching
together 2-dimensional projections to reconstruct a 3-dimensional object --- is
naturally one of Cech cohomology with SO(2)-coefficients. We deduce that every
cryo-EM reconstruction problem corresponds to an oriented circle bundle on a
simplicial complex, allowing us to classify cryo-EM problems via principal
bundles. In practice, the 2-dimensional images are noisy and a main task in
cryo-EM is to denoise them. We will see how the aforementioned insights can be
used towards this end.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel approach for instance-level image retrieval. It produces a
global and compact fixed-length representation for each image by aggregating
many region-wise descriptors. In contrast to previous works employing
pre-trained deep networks as a black box to produce features, our method
leverages a deep architecture trained for the specific task of image retrieval.
Our contribution is twofold: (i) we leverage a ranking framework to learn
convolution and projection weights that are used to build the region features;
and (ii) we employ a region proposal network to learn which regions should be
pooled to form the final global descriptor. We show that using clean training
data is key to the success of our approach. To that aim, we use a large scale
but noisy landmark dataset and develop an automatic cleaning approach. The
proposed architecture produces a global image representation in a single
forward pass. Our approach significantly outperforms previous approaches based
on global descriptors on standard datasets. It even surpasses most prior works
based on costly local descriptor indexing and spatial verification. Additional
material is available at www.xrce.xerox.com/Deep-Image-Retrieval.

 <dc:description>  Residual learning has recently surfaced as an effective means of constructing
very deep neural networks for object recognition. However, current incarnations
of residual networks do not allow for the modeling and integration of complex
relations between closely coupled recognition tasks or across domains. Such
problems are often encountered in multimedia applications involving large-scale
content recognition. We propose a novel extension of residual learning for deep
networks that enables intuitive learning across multiple related tasks using
cross-connections called cross-residuals. These cross-residuals connections can
be viewed as a form of in-network regularization and enables greater network
generalization. We show how cross-residual learning (CRL) can be integrated in
multitask networks to jointly train and detect visual concepts across several
tasks. We present a single multitask cross-residual network with &gt;40% less
parameters that is able to achieve competitive, or even better, detection
performance on a visual sentiment concept detection problem normally requiring
multiple specialized single-task networks. The resulting multitask
cross-residual network also achieves better detection performance by about
10.4% over a standard multitask residual network without cross-residuals with
even a small amount of cross-task weighting.

 <dc:description>  A method for designing sequencing barcodes that can withstand a large number
of insertion, deletion and substitution errors and are suitable for use in
multiplex single-molecule real-time sequencing is presented. The manuscript
focuses on the design of barcodes for full-length single-pass reads, impaired
by challenging error rates in the order of 11%. To the authors' knowledge, this
is the first method to specifically address this problem without requiring
upstream quality improvement. The proposed barcodes can multiplex hundreds or
thousands of samples while achieving sample misassignment probabilities as low
as $10^{-7}$, and are designed to be compatible with chemical constraints
imposed by the sequencing process. Software for constructing watermark barcode
sets and demultiplexing barcoded reads, together with example sets of barcodes
and synthetic barcoded reads, are freely available at
www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/ezpeleta/NS-watermark.

 <dc:title>Integrating Local Material Recognition with Large-Scale Perceptual
  Attribute Discovery</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schwartz, Gabriel</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nishino, Ko</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Material attributes have been shown to provide a discriminative intermediate
representation for recognizing materials, especially for the challenging task
of recognition from local material appearance (i.e., regardless of object and
scene context). In the past, however, material attributes have been recognized
separately preceding category recognition. In contrast, neuroscience studies on
material perception and computer vision research on object and place
recognition have shown that attributes are produced as a by-product during the
category recognition process. Does the same hold true for material attribute
and category recognition? In this paper, we introduce a novel material category
recognition network architecture to show that perceptual attributes can, in
fact, be automatically discovered inside a local material recognition
framework. The novel material-attribute-category convolutional neural network
(MAC-CNN) produces perceptual material attributes from the intermediate pooling
layers of an end-to-end trained category recognition network using an auxiliary
loss function that encodes human material perception. To train this model, we
introduce a novel large-scale database of local material appearance organized
under a canonical material category taxonomy and careful image patch extraction
that avoids unwanted object and scene context. We show that the discovered
attributes correspond well with semantically-meaningful visual material traits
via Boolean algebra, and enable recognition of previously unseen material
categories given only a few examples. These results have strong implications in
how perceptually meaningful attributes can be learned in other recognition
tasks.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an approach that leverages surface normal predictions, along
with appearance cues, to retrieve 3D models for objects depicted in 2D still
images from a large CAD object library. Critical to the success of our approach
is the ability to recover accurate surface normals for objects in the depicted
scene. We introduce a skip-network model built on the pre-trained Oxford VGG
convolutional neural network (CNN) for surface normal prediction. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the NYUv2 RGB-D dataset for surface
normal prediction, and recovers fine object detail compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, we develop a two-stream network over the input image and
predicted surface normals that jointly learns pose and style for CAD model
retrieval. When using the predicted surface normals, our two-stream network
matches prior work using surface normals computed from RGB-D images on the task
of pose prediction, and achieves state of the art when using RGB-D input.
Finally, our two-stream network allows us to retrieve CAD models that better
match the style and pose of a depicted object compared with baseline
approaches.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a Bayesian optimization method with exponential
convergence without the need of auxiliary optimization and without the
delta-cover sampling. Most Bayesian optimization methods require auxiliary
optimization: an additional non-convex global optimization problem, which can
be time-consuming and hard to implement in practice. Also, the existing
Bayesian optimization method with exponential convergence requires access to
the delta-cover sampling, which was considered to be impractical. Our approach
eliminates both requirements and achieves an exponential convergence rate.

 <dc:title>Bounded Optimal Exploration in MDP</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Within the framework of probably approximately correct Markov decision
processes (PAC-MDP), much theoretical work has focused on methods to attain
near optimality after a relatively long period of learning and exploration.
However, practical concerns require the attainment of satisfactory behavior
within a short period of time. In this paper, we relax the PAC-MDP conditions
to reconcile theoretically driven exploration methods and practical needs. We
propose simple algorithms for discrete and continuous state spaces, and
illustrate the benefits of our proposed relaxation via theoretical analyses and
numerical examples. Our algorithms also maintain anytime error bounds and
average loss bounds. Our approach accommodates both Bayesian and non-Bayesian
methods.

 <dc:title>Radiometric Scene Decomposition: Scene Reflectance, Illumination, and

 <dc:creator>Lombardi, Stephen</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recovering the radiometric properties of a scene (i.e., the reflectance,
illumination, and geometry) is a long-sought ability of computer vision that
can provide invaluable information for a wide range of applications.
Deciphering the radiometric ingredients from the appearance of a real-world
scene, as opposed to a single isolated object, is particularly challenging as
it generally consists of various objects with different material compositions
exhibiting complex reflectance and light interactions that are also part of the
illumination. We introduce the first method for radiometric scene decomposition
that handles those intricacies. We use RGB-D images to bootstrap geometry
recovery and simultaneously recover the complex reflectance and natural
illumination while refining the noisy initial geometry and segmenting the scene
into different material regions. Most important, we handle real-world scenes
consisting of multiple objects of unknown materials, which necessitates the
modeling of spatially-varying complex reflectance, natural illumination,
texture, interreflection and shadows. We systematically evaluate the
effectiveness of our method on synthetic scenes and demonstrate its application
to real-world scenes. The results show that rich radiometric information can be
recovered from RGB-D images and demonstrate a new role RGB-D sensors can play
for general scene understanding tasks.

 <dc:description>  In turnstile $\ell_p$ $\varepsilon$-heavy hitters, one maintains a
high-dimensional $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ subject to $\texttt{update}(i,\Delta)$
causing $x_i\leftarrow x_i + \Delta$, where $i\in[n]$, $\Delta\in\mathbb{R}$.
Upon receiving a query, the goal is to report a small list $L\subset[n]$, $|L|
= O(1/\varepsilon^p)$, containing every &quot;heavy hitter&quot; $i\in[n]$ with $|x_i|
\ge \varepsilon \|x_{\overline{1/\varepsilon^p}}\|_p$, where $x_{\overline{k}}$
denotes the vector obtained by zeroing out the largest $k$ entries of $x$ in
magnitude.
  For any $p\in(0,2]$ the CountSketch solves $\ell_p$ heavy hitters using
$O(\varepsilon^{-p}\log n)$ words of space with $O(\log n)$ update time,
$O(n\log n)$ query time to output $L$, and whose output after any query is
correct with high probability (whp) $1 - 1/poly(n)$. Unfortunately the query
time is very slow. To remedy this, the work [CM05] proposed for $p=1$ in the
strict turnstile model, a whp correct algorithm achieving suboptimal space
$O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log^2 n)$, worse update time $O(\log^2 n)$, but much better
query time $O(\varepsilon^{-1}poly(\log n))$.
  We show this tradeoff between space and update time versus query time is
unnecessary. We provide a new algorithm, ExpanderSketch, which in the most
general turnstile model achieves optimal $O(\varepsilon^{-p}\log n)$ space,
$O(\log n)$ update time, and fast $O(\varepsilon^{-p}poly(\log n))$ query time,
and whp correctness. Our main innovation is an efficient reduction from the
heavy hitters to a clustering problem in which each heavy hitter is encoded as
some form of noisy spectral cluster in a much bigger graph, and the goal is to
identify every cluster. Since every heavy hitter must be found, correctness
requires that every cluster be found. We then develop a &quot;cluster-preserving
clustering&quot; algorithm, partitioning the graph into clusters without destroying
any original cluster.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this study is to construct a near capacity Irregular Turbo
Code and to evaluate its performance over Gaussian channel. The methodology
used to evaluate and measure the performance of the new design is by simulating
the system by developing a software platform using Matlab. The simulation
carried out by implementing the system over different modulation schemes,
different frame sizes, and different code rates in order to achieve a fair
comparison between irregular turbo code and regular Turbo Code. The simulation
results showed that the Irregular Turbo Code with 64QAM modulation is capable
of achieving a coding gain of 1.29 dB over its corresponding Turbo Code for a
low Bit Error Rate 10 to 5, when used in a Gaussian noisy channel. Also, the
Irregular Turbo Code designed in this paper, utilizes a single recursive
Convolution encoder with short frame size of 5012 bits. The new designed codec
can play an important role in many commercial applications such as
Third-Generation wireless phones, Digital Video Broadcasting systems, or
Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks, etc.

 <dc:description>  What is the right supervisory signal to train visual representations? Current
approaches in computer vision use category labels from datasets such as
ImageNet to train ConvNets. However, in case of biological agents, visual
representation learning does not require millions of semantic labels. We argue
that biological agents use physical interactions with the world to learn visual
representations unlike current vision systems which just use passive
observations (images and videos downloaded from web). For example, babies push
objects, poke them, put them in their mouth and throw them to learn
representations. Towards this goal, we build one of the first systems on a
Baxter platform that pushes, pokes, grasps and observes objects in a tabletop
environment. It uses four different types of physical interactions to collect
more than 130K datapoints, with each datapoint providing supervision to a
shared ConvNet architecture allowing us to learn visual representations. We
show the quality of learned representations by observing neuron activations and
performing nearest neighbor retrieval on this learned representation.
Quantitatively, we evaluate our learned ConvNet on image classification tasks
and show improvements compared to learning without external data. Finally, on
the task of instance retrieval, our network outperforms the ImageNet network on
recall@1 by 3%

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates nonlinear bending and buckling behaviours of
composite plates characterized by a thickness variation. Layer interfaces are
described as functions of inplane coordinates. Top and bottom surfaces of the
plate are symmetric about the midplane and the plate could be considered as a
flat surface in analysis along with thickness parameters which vary over the
plate. The variable thickness at a certain position in the midplane is modeled
by a set of control points (or thickness-parameters) through NURBS (Non-Uniform
Rational B-Spline) basic functions. The knot parameter space which is referred
in modelling geometry and approximating displacement variables is employed for
approximating thickness, simultaneously. The use of quadratic NURBS functions
results in C^1 continuity of modeling variable thickness and analyzing
solutions. Thin to moderately thick laminates in bound of first-order shear
deformation theory (FSDT) are taken into account. Strain-displacement relations

is used for geometrically nonlinear analysis. The weak form is approximated
numerically by the isogeometric analysis (IGA), which has been found to be a
robust, stable and realistic numerical tool. Numerical results confirm the
reliability and capacity of the propose method.

 <dc:description>  Many theoretical results in the machine learning domain stand only for
functions that are Lipschitz continuous. Lipschitz continuity is a strong form
of continuity that linearly bounds the variations of a function. In this paper,
we derive tight Lipschitz constants for two families of metrics: Mahalanobis
distances and bounded-space bilinear forms. To our knowledge, this is the first
time the Mahalanobis distance is formally proved to be Lipschitz continuous and
that such tight Lipschitz constants are derived.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the &quot;isolate first, then share&quot; OS model in which the
processor cores, memory, and devices are divided up between disparate OS
instances and a new abstraction, subOS, is proposed to encapsulate an OS
instance that can be created, destroyed, and resized on-the-fly. The intuition
is that this avoids shared kernel states between applications, which in turn
reduces performance loss caused by contention. We decompose the OS into the
supervisor and several subOSes running at the same privilege level: a subOS
directly manages physical resources, while the supervisor can create, destroy,
resize a subOS on-the-fly. The supervisor and subOSes have few state sharing,
but fast inter-subOS communication mechanisms are provided on demand.
  We present the first implementation, RainForest, which supports unmodified
Linux binaries. Our comprehensive evaluation shows RainForest outperforms Linux
with four different kernels, LXC, and Xen in terms of worst-case and average
performance most of time when running a large number of benchmarks. The source
code is available soon.

 <dc:title>Quantum Bitcoin: An Anonymous and Distributed Currency Secured by the
  No-Cloning Theorem of Quantum Mechanics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jogenfors, Jonathan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The digital currency Bitcoin has had remarkable growth since it was first
proposed in 2008. Its distributed nature allows currency transactions without a
central authority by using cryptographic methods and a data structure called
the blockchain. In this paper we use the no-cloning theorem of quantum
mechanics to introduce Quantum Bitcoin, a Bitcoin-like currency that runs on a
quantum computer. We show that our construction of quantum shards and two
blockchains allows untrusted peers to mint quantum money without risking the
integrity of the currency. The Quantum Bitcoin protocol has several advantages
over classical Bitcoin, including immediate local verification of transactions.
This is a major improvement since we no longer need the computationally
intensive and time-consuming method Bitcoin uses to record all transactions in
the blockchain. Instead, Quantum Bitcoin only records newly minted currency
which drastically reduces the footprint and increases efficiency. We present
formal security proofs for counterfeiting resistance and show that a quantum
bitcoin can be re-used a large number of times before wearing out - just like
ordinary coins and banknotes. Quantum Bitcoin is the first distributed quantum
money system and we show that the lack of a paper trail implies full anonymity
for the users. In addition, there are no transaction fees and the system can
scale to any transaction volume.

 <dc:title>A Complete Characterization of Unitary Quantum Space</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fefferman, Bill</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lin, Cedric Yen-Yu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by understanding the power of quantum computation with restricted
number of qubits, we give two complete characterizations of unitary quantum
space bounded computation. First we show that approximating an element of the
inverse of a well-conditioned efficiently encoded $2^{k(n)}\times 2^{k(n)}$
matrix is complete for the class of problems solvable by quantum circuits
acting on $\mathcal{O}(k(n))$ qubits with all measurements at the end of the
computation. Similarly, estimating the minimum eigenvalue of an efficiently
encoded Hermitian $2^{k(n)}\times 2^{k(n)}$ matrix is also complete for this
class. In the logspace case, our results improve on previous results of Ta-Shma
[STOC '13] by giving new space-efficient quantum algorithms that avoid
intermediate measurements, as well as showing matching hardness results.
  Additionally, as a consequence we show that PreciseQMA, the version of QMA
with exponentially small completeness-soundess gap, is equal to PSPACE. Thus,
the problem of estimating the minimum eigenvalue of a local Hamiltonian to
inverse exponential precision is PSPACE-complete, which we show holds even in
the frustration-free case. Finally, we can use this characterization to give a
provable setting in which the ability to prepare the ground state of a local
Hamiltonian is more powerful than the ability to prepare PEPS states.
  Interestingly, by suitably changing the parameterization of either of these
problems we can completely characterize the power of quantum computation with
simultaneously bounded time and space.

 <dc:description>  Quantum computers promise to transform our notions of computation by offering
a completely new paradigm. To achieve scalable quantum computation, optimizing
compilers and a corresponding software design flow will be essential. We
present a software architecture for compiling quantum programs from a
high-level language program to hardware-specific instructions. We describe the
necessary layers of abstraction and their differences and similarities to
classical layers of a computer-aided design flow. For each layer of the stack,
we discuss the underlying methods for compilation and optimization. Our
software methodology facilitates more rapid innovation among quantum algorithm
designers, quantum hardware engineers, and experimentalists. It enables
scalable compilation of complex quantum algorithms and can be targeted to any
specific quantum hardware implementation.

 <dc:description>  A new scalable parallel math library, dMath, is presented in this paper that
demonstrates leading scaling when using intranode, or internode,
hybrid-parallelism for deep-learning. dMath provides easy-to-use distributed
base primitives and a variety of domain-specific algorithms. These include
matrix multiplication, convolutions, and others allowing for rapid development
of highly scalable applications, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), whereas
previously one was restricted to libraries that provided effective primitives
for only a single GPU, like Nvidia cublas and cudnn or DNN primitives from
Nervana neon framework. Development of HPC software is difficult,
labor-intensive work, requiring a unique skill set. dMath allows a wide range
of developers to utilize parallel and distributed hardware easily. One
contribution of this approach is that data is stored persistently on the GPU
hardware, avoiding costly transfers between host and device. Advanced memory
management techniques are utilized, including caching of transferred data and
memory reuse through pooling. A key contribution of dMath is that it delivers
performance, portability, and productivity to its specific domain of support.
It enables algorithm and application programmers to quickly solve problems
without managing the significant complexity associated with multi-level
parallelism.

 <dc:title>Highly accurate gaze estimation using a consumer RGB-depth sensor</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Determining the direction in which a person is looking is an important
problem in a wide range of HCI applications. In this paper we describe a highly
accurate algorithm that performs gaze estimation using an affordable and widely
available device such as Kinect. The method we propose starts by performing
accurate head pose estimation achieved by fitting a person specific morphable
model of the face to depth data. The ordinarily competing requirements of high
accuracy and high speed are met concurrently by formulating the fitting
objective function as a combination of terms which excel either in accurate or
fast fitting, and then by adaptively adjusting their relative contributions
throughout fitting. Following pose estimation, pose normalization is done by
re-rendering the fitted model as a frontal face. Finally gaze estimates are
obtained through regression from the appearance of the eyes in synthetic,
normalized images. Using EYEDIAP, the standard public dataset for the
evaluation of gaze estimation algorithms from RGB-D data, we demonstrate that
our method greatly outperforms the state of the art.

 <dc:title>Partial Sublinear Time Approximation and Inapproximation for Maximum
  Coverage</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fu, Bin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We develop a randomized approximation algorithm for the classical maximum
coverage problem, which given a list of sets $A_1,A_2,\cdots, A_m$ and integer
parameter $k$, select $k$ sets $A_{i_1}, A_{i_2},\cdots, A_{i_k}$ for maximum
union $A_{i_1}\cup A_{i_2}\cup\cdots\cup A_{i_k}$. In our algorithm, each input
set $A_i$ is a black box that can provide its size $|A_i|$, generate a random
element of $A_i$, and answer the membership query $(x\in A_i?)$ in $O(1)$ time.
Our algorithm gives $(1-{1\over e})$-approximation for maximum coverage problem
in $O(p(m))$ time, which is independent of the sizes of the input sets. No
existing $O(p(m)n^{1-\epsilon})$ time $(1-{1\over e})$-approximation algorithm
for the maximum coverage has been found for any function $p(m)$ that only
depends on the number of sets, where $n=\max(|A_1|,\cdots,| A_m|)$ (the largest
size of input sets). The notion of partial sublinear time algorithm is
introduced. For a computational problem with input size controlled by two
parameters $n$ and $m$, a partial sublinear time algorithm for it runs in a
$O(p(m)n^{1-\epsilon})$ time or $O(q(n)m^{1-\epsilon})$ time. The maximum
coverage has a partial sublinear time $O(p(m))$ constant factor approximation.
On the other hand, we show that the maximum coverage problem has no partial
sublinear $O(q(n)m^{1-\epsilon})$ time constant factor approximation algorithm.
It separates the partial sublinear time computation from the conventional
sublinear time computation by disproving the existence of sublinear time
approximation algorithm for the maximum coverage problem.

 <dc:description>  We study the hard-core model defined on independent sets of an input graph
where the independent sets are weighted by a parameter $\lambda&gt;0$. For
constant $\Delta$, previous work of Weitz (2006) established an FPTAS for the
partition function for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ when $\lambda&lt;
\lambda_c(\Delta)$. The threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta)$ is the critical point for
the phase transition for uniqueness/non-uniqueness on the infinite
$\Delta$-regular trees. Sly (2010) showed that there is no FPRAS, unless NP=RP,
when $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c(\Delta)$. The running time of Weitz's algorithm is
exponential in $\log(\Delta)$. Here we present an FPRAS for the partition
function whose running time is $O^*(n^2)$. We analyze the simple single-site
Glauber dynamics for sampling from the associated Gibbs distribution. We prove
there exists a constant $\Delta_0$ such that for all graphs with maximum degree
$\Delta\geq\Delta_0$ and girth $\geq 7$, the mixing time of the Glauber
dynamics is $O(n\log(n))$ when $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c(\Delta)$. Our work
complements that of Weitz which applies for constant $\Delta$ whereas our work
applies for all $\Delta \geq \Delta_0$.
  We utilize loopy BP (belief propagation), a widely-used inference algorithm.
A novel aspect of our work is using the principal eigenvector for the BP
operator to design a distance function which contracts in expectation for pairs
of states that behave like the BP fixed point. We also prove that the Glauber
dynamics behaves locally like loopy BP. As a byproduct we obtain that the
Glauber dynamics converges, after a short burn-in period, close to the BP fixed
point, and this implies that the fixed point of loopy BP is a close
approximation to the Gibbs distribution. Using these connections we establish
that loopy BP quickly converges to the Gibbs distribution when the girth $\geq
6$ and $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c(\Delta)$.

 <dc:description>  A new O(nlog(n)) algorithm is presented for performing Delaunay triangulation
of sets of 2D points. The novel component of the algorithm is a radially
propagating \emph{sweep-hull} (sequentially created from the radially sorted
set of 2D points, giving a non-overlapping triangulation), paired with a final
triangle flipping step to give the Delaunay triangluation.
  In empirical tests the algorithm runs in approximately half the time of
q-hull for 2D Delaunay triangulation on randomly generated point sets.

 <dc:title>Fast and Space-optimal Low-rank Factorization in the Streaming Model
  With Application in Differential Privacy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Upadhyay, Jalaj</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of computing a low-rank factorization
of an $m \times n$ matrix in the general turnstile update model. We consider
both the private and non-private setting. In the non-private setting, we give a
space-optimal algorithm that computes a low-rank factorization. Our algorithm
maintains three sketches of the matrix instead of five as in Boutsidis {\it et
al.} (STOC 2016). Our algorithm takes $\widetilde{O}(1)$ time to update the
sketch and computes the factorization in time linear in the sparsity and the
dimensions of the matrix. In the private setting, we study low-rank
factorization in the framework of differential privacy and under turnstile
updates. We give two algorithms with respect to two levels of privacy. Both of
our privacy levels are stronger than earlier studied privacy levels, namely
that of Blocki {\it et al.} (FOCS 2012), Dwork {\it et al.} (STOC 2014), Hardt
and Roth (STOC 2012, STOC 2013), and Hardt and Price (NIPS 2014).

 <dc:description>  We develop predictive models of pedestrian dynamics by encoding the coupled
nature of multi-pedestrian interaction using game theory, and deep
learning-based visual analysis to estimate person-specific behavior parameters.
Building predictive models for multi-pedestrian interactions however, is very
challenging due to two reasons: (1) the dynamics of interaction are complex
interdependent processes, where the predicted behavior of one pedestrian can
affect the actions taken by others and (2) dynamics are variable depending on
an individuals physical characteristics (e.g., an older person may walk slowly
while the younger person may walk faster). To address these challenges, we (1)
utilize concepts from game theory to model the interdependent decision making
process of multiple pedestrians and (2) use visual classifiers to learn a
mapping from pedestrian appearance to behavior parameters. We evaluate our
proposed model on several public multiple pedestrian interaction video
datasets. Results show that our strategic planning model explains human
interactions 25% better when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a multi-terminal source coding problem under a
logarithmic loss fidelity which does not necessarily lead to an additive
distortion measure. The problem is motivated by an extension of the Information
Bottleneck method to a multi-source scenario where several encoders have to
build cooperatively rate-limited descriptions of their sources in order to
maximize information with respect to other unobserved (hidden) sources. More
precisely, we study fundamental information-theoretic limits of the so-called:
(i) Two-way Collaborative Information Bottleneck (TW-CIB) and (ii) the
Collaborative Distributed Information Bottleneck (CDIB) problems. The TW-CIB
problem consists of two distant encoders that separately observe marginal
(dependent) components $X_1$ and $X_2$ and can cooperate through multiple
exchanges of limited information with the aim of extracting information about
hidden variables $(Y_1,Y_2)$, which can be arbitrarily dependent on
$(X_1,X_2)$. On the other hand, in CDIB there are two cooperating encoders
which separately observe $X_1$ and $X_2$ and a third node which can listen to
the exchanges between the two encoders in order to obtain information about a
hidden variable $Y$. The relevance (figure-of-merit) is measured in terms of a
normalized (per-sample) multi-letter mutual information metric (log-loss
fidelity) and an interesting tradeoff arises by constraining the complexity of
descriptions, measured in terms of the rates needed for the exchanges between
the encoders and decoders involved. Inner and outer bounds to the
complexity-relevance region of these problems are derived from which optimality
is characterized for several cases of interest. Our resulting theoretical
complexity-relevance regions are finally evaluated for binary symmetric and
Gaussian statistical models.

 <dc:title>A General Formula for Compound Channel Capacity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Loyka, Sergey</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A general formula for the capacity of arbitrary compound channels with the
receiver channel state information is obtained using the information density
approach. No assumptions of ergodicity, stationarity or information stability
are made and the channel state set is arbitrary. A direct (constructive) proof
is given. To prove achievability, we generalize Feinstein Lemma to the compound
channel setting, and to prove converse, we generalize Verdu-Han Lemma to the
same compound setting. A notion of a uniform compound channel is introduced and
the general formula is shown to reduce to the familiar $\sup-\inf$ expression
for such channels. As a by-product, the arbitrary varying channel capacity is
established under maximum error probability and deterministic coding.
Conditions are established under which the worst-case and compound channel
capacities are equal so that the full channel state information at the
transmitter brings in no advantage.
  The compound inf-information rate plays a prominent role in the general
formula. Its properties are studied and a link between information-unstable and
information-stable regimes of a compound channel is established. The results
are extended to include $\varepsilon$-capacity of compound channels. Sufficient
and necessary conditions for the strong converse to hold are given.

 <dc:description>  We consider Max-min Share (MmS) allocations of items both in the case where
items are goods (positive utility) and when they are chores (negative utility).
We show that fair allocations of goods and chores have some fundamental
connections but differences as well. We prove that like in the case for goods,
an MmS allocation does not need to exist for chores and computing an MmS
allocation - if it exists - is strongly NP-hard. In view of these non-existence
and complexity results, we present a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm
for MmS fairness for chores. We then introduce a new fairness concept called
optimal MmS that represents the best possible allocation in terms of MmS that
is guaranteed to exist. For both goods and chores, we use connections to
parallel machine scheduling to give (1) an exponential-time exact algorithm and
(2) a polynomial-time approximation scheme for computing an optimal MmS
allocation when the number of agents is fixed.

vision community to solve complex problems in image recognition and analysis.
We describe an application of the CNN technology to the problem of identifying
particle interactions in sampling calorimeters used commonly in high energy
physics and high energy neutrino physics in particular. Following a discussion
of the core concepts of CNNs and recent innovations in CNN architectures
related to the field of deep learning, we outline a specific application to the
NOvA neutrino detector. This algorithm, CVN (Convolutional Visual Network)
identifies neutrino interactions based on their topology without the need for
detailed reconstruction and outperforms algorithms currently in use by the NOvA
collaboration.

  For example, in our framework, existing algorithms can compute the diameter
and the radius of a graph in subquadratic time, and sometimes even in time

central vertices according to closeness centrality in subquadratic time, and to
design a distance oracle with sublinear query time and subquadratic space
occupancy.
  In the worst case, it is impossible to obtain comparable results for any of
these problems, unless widely-believed conjectures are false.

 <dc:description>  Technical Debt is a term used to classify non-optimal solutions during
software development. These solutions cause several maintenance problems and
hence they should be avoided or at least documented. Although there are a
considered number of studies that focus on the identification of Technical
Debt, we focus on the identification of Technical Debt in pull requests.
Specifically, we conduct an investigation to reveal the different types of
Technical Debt that can lead to the rejection of pull requests. From the
analysis of 1,722 pull requests, we classify Technical Debt in seven categories
namely design, documentation, test, build, project convention, performance, or
security debt. Our results indicate that the most common category of Technical
Debt is design with 39.34%, followed by test with 23.70% and project convention
with 15.64%. We also note that the type of Technical Debt influences on the
size of push request discussions, e.g., security and project convention debts
instigate more discussion than the other types.

 <dc:description>  This letter studies the limited feedback cognitive radio system, where the
primary users (PU) are interfered by the secondary transmitter (ST) due to the
imperfect beamforming. We propose to allocate the feedback bits among multiple
PUs to minimize the maximum interference caused by the ST, by exploiting the
heterogeneous average channel gains. In addition, we study the problem of
minimizing the total feedback bits under a predefined interference threshold at
the PUs. The solutions with low complexity are proposed for the studied
problems, and the performances of bit allocations are analyzed. Simulation
results validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed solutions work
very well in terms of minimizing the maximum interference caused by the ST and
minimizing the total feedback bits under predefined interference threshold at
the PUs for limited feedback CR system.

 <dc:description>  This paper quantifies the benefits and limitations of cooperative
communications by providing a statistical analysis of the downlink in network
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We consider an idealized model
where the multiple-antenna base-stations (BSs) are distributed according to a
homogeneous Poisson point process and cooperate by forming disjoint clusters.
We assume that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the
cooperating BSs without any overhead. Multiple single-antenna users are served
using zero-forcing beamforming with equal power allocation across the beams.
For such a system, we obtain tractable, but accurate, approximations of the
signal power and inter-cluster interference power distributions and derive a
computationally efficient expression for the achievable per-BS ergodic sum rate
using tools from stochastic geometry. This expression allows us to obtain the
optimal loading factor, i.e., the ratio between the number of scheduled users
and the number of BS antennas, that maximizes the per-BS ergodic sum rate.
Further, it allows us to quantify the performance improvement of network MIMO
systems as a function of the cooperating cluster size. We show that to perform
zero-forcing across the distributed set of BSs within the cluster, the network
MIMO system introduces a penalty in received signal power. Along with the
inevitable out-of-cluster interference, we show that the per-BS ergodic sum
rate of a network MIMO system does not approach that of an isolated cell even
at unrealistically large cluster sizes. Nevertheless, network MIMO does provide
significant rate improvement as compared to uncoordinated single-cell
processing even at relatively modest cluster sizes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework, called
Self-Paced Multi-Task Learning (SPMTL). Different from previous works treating
all tasks and instances equally when training, SPMTL attempts to jointly learn
the tasks by taking into consideration the complexities of both tasks and
instances. This is inspired by the cognitive process of human brain that often
learns from the easy to the hard. We construct a compact SPMTL formulation by
proposing a new task-oriented regularizer that can jointly prioritize the tasks
and the instances. Thus it can be interpreted as a self-paced learner for MTL.
A simple yet effective algorithm is designed for optimizing the proposed
objective function. An error bound for a simplified formulation is also
analyzed theoretically. Experimental results on toy and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, compared to the
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the $\ell_\infty$-constrained representation which
demonstrates robustness to quantization errors, utilizing the tool of deep
learning. Based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we
formulate the original convex minimization problem as a feed-forward neural
network, named \textit{Deep $\ell_\infty$ Encoder}, by introducing the novel
Bounded Linear Unit (BLU) neuron and modeling the Lagrange multipliers as
network biases. Such a structural prior acts as an effective network

the effective use of the proposed model in the application of hashing, by
coupling the proposed encoders under a supervised pairwise loss, to develop a
\textit{Deep Siamese $\ell_\infty$ Network}, which can be optimized from end to
end. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performances of the
proposed model. We also provide an in-depth analysis of its behaviors against
the competitors.

 <dc:title>Zadoff-Chu sequence design for random access initial uplink

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The autocorrelation of a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence with a non-zero cyclically
shifted version of itself is zero. Due to the interesting property, ZC
sequences are widely used in the LTE air interface in the primary
synchronization signal (PSS), random access preamble (PRACH), uplink control
channel (PUCCH) etc. However, this interesting property of ZC sequence is not
useful in the random access initial uplink synchronization problem due to some
specific structures of the underlying problem. In particular, the state of the
art uplink synchronization algorithms do not perform equally for all ZC
sequences. In this work, we show a systematic procedure to choose the ZC
sequences that yield the optimum performance of the uplink synchronization
algorithms. At first, we show that the uplink synchronization is a sparse
signal recovery problem on an overcomplete basis. Next, we use the theory of
sparse recovery algorithms and identify a factor that controls performance of
the algorithms. We then suggest a ZC sequence design procedure to optimally
choose this factor. The simulation results show that the performance of most of
the state of the art uplink synchronization algorithms improve significantly
when the ZC sequences are chosen by using the proposed technique.

 <dc:description>  Let $n$ be any positive integer and $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subsets of
$[n]$.
  A family $\mathcal{F}'$ is said to be $D$-\emph{secting} for $\mathcal{F}$ if
for every $A \in \mathcal{F}$, there exists a subset $A' \in \mathcal{F}'$ such
that $|A \cap A'| - |A \cap ([n] \setminus A')|=i$, where $i \in D$, $D
\subseteq \{-n,-n+1,\ldots,0,\ldots,n\}$.
  A $D$-\emph{secting} family $\mathcal{F}'$ of $\mathcal{F}$, where
$D=\{-1,0,1\}$, is a \emph{bisecting} family ensuring the existence of a subset
$A' \in \mathcal{F}'$ such that $|A \cap A'| \in \{\lceil
\frac{|A|}{2}\rceil,\lfloor \frac{|A|}{2}\rfloor\}$, for each $A \in
\mathcal{F}$.
  In this paper, we study $D$-secting families for $\mathcal{F}$ with
restrictions on $D$, and the cardinalities of $\mathcal{F}$ and the subsets of
$\mathcal{F}$.

 <dc:description>  Visual Question and Answering (VQA) problems are attracting increasing
interest from multiple research disciplines. Solving VQA problems requires
techniques from both computer vision for understanding the visual contents of a
presented image or video, as well as the ones from natural language processing
for understanding semantics of the question and generating the answers.
Regarding visual content modeling, most of existing VQA methods adopt the
strategy of extracting global features from the image or video, which
inevitably fails in capturing fine-grained information such as spatial
configuration of multiple objects. Extracting features from auto-generated
regions -- as some region-based image recognition methods do -- cannot
essentially address this problem and may introduce some overwhelming irrelevant
features with the question. In this work, we propose a novel Focused Dynamic
Attention (FDA) model to provide better aligned image content representation
with proposed questions. Being aware of the key words in the question, FDA
employs off-the-shelf object detector to identify important regions and fuse
the information from the regions and global features via an LSTM unit. Such
question-driven representations are then combined with question representation
and fed into a reasoning unit for generating the answers. Extensive evaluation
on a large-scale benchmark dataset, VQA, clearly demonstrate the superior
performance of FDA over well-established baselines.

 <dc:description>  A rigorous runtime analysis of evolutionary multi-objective optimization for
the classical vertex cover problem in the context of parameterized complexity
analysis has been presented by Kratsch and Neumann (2013). In this paper, we
extend the analysis to the weighted vertex cover problem and provide a fixed
parameter evolutionary algorithm with respect to OPT, the cost of the the
optimal solution for the problem. Moreover, using a diversity mechanisms, we
present a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that finds a 2-approximation
in expected polynomial time and introduce a population-based evolutionary
algorithm which finds a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation in expected time
$O(n\cdot 2^{\min \{n,2(1- \varepsilon)OPT \}} + n^3)$.

 <dc:description>  Wisely utilizing the internal and external learning methods is a new
challenge in super-resolution problem. To address this issue, we analyze the
attributes of two methodologies and find two observations of their recovered
details: 1) they are complementary in both feature space and image plane, 2)
they distribute sparsely in the spatial space. These inspire us to propose a
low-rank solution which effectively integrates two learning methods and then
achieves a superior result. To fit this solution, the internal learning method
and the external learning method are tailored to produce multiple preliminary
results. Our theoretical analysis and experiment prove that the proposed
low-rank solution does not require massive inputs to guarantee the performance,
and thereby simplifying the design of two learning methods for the solution.
Intensive experiments show the proposed solution improves the single learning
method in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Surprisingly, it shows
more superior capability on noisy images and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of facial analysis in videos. We propose a novel weakly
supervised learning method that models the video event (expression, pain etc.)
as a sequence of automatically mined, discriminative sub-events (eg. onset and
offset phase for smile, brow lower and cheek raise for pain). The proposed
model is inspired by the recent works on Multiple Instance Learning and latent
SVM/HCRF- it extends such frameworks to model the ordinal or temporal aspect in
the videos, approximately. We obtain consistent improvements over relevant
competitive baselines on four challenging and publicly available video based
facial analysis datasets for prediction of expression, clinical pain and intent
in dyadic conversations. In combination with complimentary features, we report
state-of-the-art results on these datasets.

 <dc:description>  We revisit the problem of protein structure determination from geometrical
restraints from NMR, using convex optimization. It is well-known that the
NP-hard distance geometry problem of determining atomic positions from pairwise
distance restraints can be relaxed into a convex semidefinite program. Often
the NOE distance restraints are too imprecise and sparse for accurate structure
determination. Residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements provide additional
geometric information on the angles between atom-pair directions and axes of
the principal-axis-frame. The optimization problem involving RDC is highly
non-convex and requires a good initialization even within the simulated
annealing framework. In this paper, we model the protein backbone as an
articulated structure composed of rigid units. Determining the rotation of each
rigid unit gives the full protein structure. We propose solving the non-convex
optimization problems using the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy. The two
algorithms - RDC-SOS and RDC-NOE-SOS, have polynomial time complexity in the
number of amino-acid residues and run efficiently on a standard desktop. In
many instances, the proposed methods exactly recover the solution to the
original non-convex optimization problem. We introduce a statistical tool, the
Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), to provide an information theoretic bound on the
highest resolution one can hope to achieve when determining protein structure
from noisy measurements using any methodology. Our simulation results show that
when the RDC measurements are corrupted by Gaussian noise of realistic
variance, both SOS based algorithms attain the CRB. We successfully apply our
method in a divide-and-conquer fashion to determine the structure of ubiquitin
from experimental NOE and RDC measurements, achieving more accurate and faster
reconstructions compared to the current state of the art.

 <dc:subject>I.2.9</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of manipulating a uniformly rotating chain:
the chain is rotated at a constant angular speed around a fixed axis using a
robotic manipulator. Manipulation is quasi-static in the sense that transitions
are slow enough for the chain to be always in &quot;rotational&quot; equilibrium. The
curve traced by the chain in a rotating plane -- its shape function -- can be
determined by a simple force analysis, yet it possesses complex multi-solutions
behavior typical of non-linear systems. We prove that the configuration space
of the uniformly rotating chain is homeomorphic to a two-dimensional surface
embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Using that representation, we devise a manipulation
strategy for transiting between different rotation modes in a stable and
controlled manner. We demonstrate the strategy on a physical robotic arm
manipulating a rotating chain. Finally, we discuss how the ideas developed here
might find fruitful applications in the study of other flexible objects, such
as elastic rods or concentric tubes.

 <dc:description>  The Support Vector Machine using Privileged Information (SVM+) has been
proposed to train a classifier to utilize the additional privileged information
that is only available in the training phase but not available in the test
phase. In this work, we propose an efficient solution for SVM+ by simply
utilizing the squared hinge loss instead of the hinge loss as in the existing
SVM+ formulation, which interestingly leads to a dual form with less variables
and in the same form with the dual of the standard SVM. The proposed algorithm
is utilized to leverage the additional web knowledge that is only available
during training for the image categorization tasks. The extensive experimental
results on both Caltech101 andWebQueries datasets show that our proposed method
can achieve a factor of up to hundred times speedup with the comparable
accuracy when compared with the existing SVM+ method.

 <dc:description>  The incorporation of Cognitive Radio (CR) and Energy Harvesting (EH)
capabilities in wireless sensor networks enables spectrum and energy efficient
heterogeneous cognitive radio sensor networks (HCRSNs). The new networking
paradigm of HCRSNs consists of EH-enabled spectrum sensors and battery powered
data sensors. Spectrum sensors can cooperatively scan the licensed spectrum for
available channels, while data sensors monitor an area of interest and transmit
sensed data to the sink over those channels. In this work, we propose a
resource allocation solution for the HCRSN to achieve the sustainability of
spectrum sensors and conserve energy of data sensors. The proposed solution is
achieved by two algorithms that operate in tandem, a spectrum sensor scheduling
algorithm and a data sensor resource allocation algorithm. The spectrum sensor
scheduling algorithm allocates channels to spectrum sensors such that the
average detected available time for the channels is maximized, while the EH
dynamics are considered and PU transmissions are protected. The data sensor
resource allocation algorithm allocates the transmission time, power and
channels such that the energy consumption of the data sensors is minimized.
Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the energy consumption of the
data sensors can be significantly reduced while maintaining the sustainability
of the spectrum sensors.

 <dc:description>  Committee scoring rules form a rich class of aggregators of voters'
preferences for the purpose of selecting subsets of objects with desired
properties, e.g., a shortlist of candidates for an interview, a representative
collective body such as a parliament, or a set of locations for a set of public
facilities. In the spirit of celebrated Young's characterization result that
axiomatizes single-winner scoring rules, we provide an axiomatic
characterization of multiwinner committee scoring rules. We show that committee
scoring rules---despite forming a remarkably general class of rules---are
characterized by the set of four standard axioms, anonymity, neutrality,
consistency and continuity, and by one axiom specific to multiwinner rules
which we call committee dominance. In the course of our proof, we develop
several new notions and techniques. In particular, we introduce and
axiomatically characterize multiwinner decision scoring rules, a class of rules
that broadly generalizes the well-known majority relation.

 <dc:description>  We take the generation of Chinese classical poem lines as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem, and build a novel system based on the
RNN Encoder-Decoder structure to generate quatrains (Jueju in Chinese), with a
topic word as input. Our system can jointly learn semantic meaning within a
single line, semantic relevance among lines in a poem, and the use of
structural, rhythmical and tonal patterns, without utilizing any constraint
templates. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other
competitive systems. We also find that the attention mechanism can capture the
word associations in Chinese classical poetry and inverting target lines in
training can improve performance.

 <dc:description>  This paper aims at providing an introduction to the behavior of authors
submitting a paper to a scientific journal. Dates of electronic submission of
papers to the Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society have been recorded from
the 1st January 2013 till the 31st December 2014, thus over 2 years.
  There is no Monday or Friday effect like in financial markets, but rather a
Tuesday-Wednesday effect occurs: papers are more often submitted on Wednesday;
however, the relative number of going to be accepted papers is larger if these
are submitted on Tuesday. On the other hand, weekend days (Saturday and Sunday)
are not the best days to finalize and submit manuscripts. An interpretation
based on the type of submitted work (&quot;experimental chemistry&quot;) and on the
influence of (senior) coauthors is presented. A thermodynamic connection is
proposed within an entropy context. A (new) entropic distance is defined in
order to measure the &quot;opaqueness&quot; = disorder) of the submission process.

 <dc:description>  In this work we investigate the problem of road scene semantic segmentation
using Deconvolutional Networks (DNs). Several constraints limit the practical
performance of DNs in this context: firstly, the paucity of existing pixel-wise
labelled training data, and secondly, the memory constraints of embedded
hardware, which rule out the practical use of state-of-the-art DN architectures
such as fully convolutional networks (FCN). To address the first constraint, we
introduce a Multi-Domain Road Scene Semantic Segmentation (MDRS3) dataset,
aggregating data from six existing densely and sparsely labelled datasets for
training our models, and two existing, separate datasets for testing their
generalisation performance. We show that, while MDRS3 offers a greater volume
and variety of data, end-to-end training of a memory efficient DN does not
yield satisfactory performance. We propose a new training strategy to overcome
this, based on (i) the creation of a best-possible source network (S-Net) from
the aggregated data, ignoring time and memory constraints; and (ii) the
transfer of knowledge from S-Net to the memory-efficient target network
(T-Net). We evaluate different techniques for S-Net creation and T-Net
transferral, and demonstrate that training a constrained deconvolutional
network in this manner can unlock better performance than existing training
approaches. Specifically, we show that a target network can be trained to
achieve improved accuracy versus an FCN despite using less than 1\% of the
memory. We believe that our approach can be useful beyond automotive scenarios
where labelled data is similarly scarce or fragmented and where practical
constraints exist on the desired model size. We make available our network
models and aggregated multi-domain dataset for reproducibility.

 <dc:title>A Multivariate Approach for Checking Resiliency in Access Control</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In recent years, several combinatorial problems were introduced in the area
of access control. Typically, such problems deal with an authorization policy,
seen as a relation $UR \subseteq U \times R$, where $(u, r) \in UR$ means that
user $u$ is authorized to access resource $r$. Li, Tripunitara and Wang (2009)
introduced the Resiliency Checking Problem (RCP), in which we are given an
authorization policy, a subset of resources $P \subseteq R$, as well as
integers $s \ge 0$, $d \ge 1$ and $t \geq 1$. It asks whether upon removal of
any set of at most $s$ users, there still exist $d$ pairwise disjoint sets of
at most $t$ users such that each set has collectively access to all resources
in $P$. This problem possesses several parameters which appear to take small
values in practice. We thus analyze the parameterized complexity of RCP with
respect to these parameters, by considering all possible combinations of $|P|,
s, d, t$. In all but one case, we are able to settle whether the problem is in
FPT, XP, W[2]-hard, para-NP-hard or para-coNP-hard. We also consider the
restricted case where $s=0$ for which we determine the complexity for all
possible combinations of the parameters.

 <dc:title>Achievable Rates for Gaussian Degraded Relay Channels with Non-Vanishing
  Error Probabilities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fong, Silas L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tan, Vincent Y. F.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper revisits the Gaussian degraded relay channel, where the link that
carries information from the source to the destination is a physically degraded
version of the link that carries information from the source to the relay. The
source and the relay are subject to expected power constraints. The
$\varepsilon$-capacity of the channel is characterized and it is strictly
larger than the capacity for $\varepsilon&gt;0$, which implies that the channel
does not possess the strong converse property. The proof of the achievability
part is based on several key ideas: block Markov coding which is used in the
classical decode-forward strategy, power control for Gaussian channels under
expected power constraints, and a careful scaling between the block size and
the total number of block uses. The converse part is proved by first
establishing two non-asymptotic lower bounds on the error probability, which
are derived from the type-II errors of some binary hypothesis tests.
Subsequently, each lower bound is simplified by conditioning on an event
related to the power of some linear combination of the codewords transmitted by
the source and the relay. Lower and upper bounds on the second-order term of
the optimal coding rate in terms of blocklength and error probability are also
obtained.

 <dc:description>  We present the Pascal animal classes Eye Tracking database. Our database
comprises eye movement recordings compiled from forty users for the bird, cat,
cow, dog, horse and sheep {trainval} sets from the VOC 2012 image set.
Different from recent eye-tracking databases such as
\cite{kiwon_cvpr13_gaze,PapadopoulosCKF14}, a salient aspect of PET is that it
contains eye movements recorded for both the free-viewing and visual search
task conditions. While some differences in terms of overall gaze behavior and
scanning patterns are observed between the two conditions, a very similar
number of fixations are observed on target objects for both conditions. As a
utility application, we show how feature pooling around fixated locations
enables enhanced (animal) object classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Network models with latent geometry have been used successfully in many
applications in network science and other disciplines, yet it is usually
impossible to tell if a given real network is geometric, meaning if it is a
typical element in an ensemble of random geometric graphs. Here we identify
structural properties of networks that guarantee that random graphs having
these properties are geometric. Specifically we show that random graphs in
which expected degree and clustering of every node are fixed to some constants
are equivalent to random geometric graphs on the real line, if clustering is
sufficiently strong. Large numbers of triangles, homogeneously distributed
across all nodes as in real networks, are thus a consequence of network
geometricity. The methods we use to prove this are quite general and applicable
to other network ensembles, geometric or not, and to certain problems in
quantum gravity.

 <dc:description>  We consider a variation of Construction A of lattices from linear codes based
on two classes of number fields, totally real and CM Galois number fields. We
propose a generic construction with explicit generator and Gram matrices, then
focus on modular and unimodular lattices, obtained in the particular cases of
totally real, respectively, imaginary, quadratic fields. Our motivation comes
from coding theory, thus some relevant properties of modular lattices, such as
minimal norm, theta series, kissing number and secrecy gain are analyzed.
Interesting lattices are exhibited.

 <dc:title>Blind quantum computing with two almost identical states</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The question of whether a fully classical client can delegate a quantum
computation to an untrusted quantum server while fully maintaining privacy
(blindness) is one of the big open questions in quantum cryptography. Both yes
and no answers have important practical and theoretical consequences, and the
question seems genuinely hard. The state-of-the-art approaches to securely
delegating quantum computation, without exception, rely on granting the client
modest quantum powers, or on additional, non-communicating, quantum servers. In
this work, we consider the single server setting, and push the boundaries of
the minimal devices of the client, which still allow for blind quantum
computation. Our approach is based on the observation that, in many blind
quantum computing protocols, the &quot;quantum&quot; part of the protocol, from the
clients perspective, boils down to the establishing classical-quantum
correlations (independent from the computation) between the client and the
server, following which the steering of the computation itself requires only
classical communication. Here, we abstract this initial preparation phase,
specifically for the Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol of Broadbent,
Fitzsimons and Kashefi. We identify sufficient criteria on the powers of the
client, which still allow for secure blind quantum computation. We work in a
universally composable framework, and provide a series of protocols, where each
step reduces the number of differing states the client needs to be able to
prepare. As the limit of such reductions, we show that the capacity to prepare
just two pure states, which have an arbitrarily high overlap (thus are
arbitrarily close to identical), suffices for efficient and secure blind
quantum computation.

Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI) modality produces data
sets of
  3D symmetric positive definite matrices anchored at voxel positions capturing
the anisotropic diffusion properties of water molecules in biological tissues.
The space of symmetric matrices can be partially ordered using the L\&quot;owner
ordering, and computing extremal matrices dominating a given set of matrices is
a basic primitive used in matrix-valued signal processing. In this letter, we
design a fast and easy-to-implement iterative algorithm to approximate
arbitrarily finely these extremal matrices. Finally, we discuss on extensions

 <dc:title>A Synthetic MIMO PLC Channel Model</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The huge and increasing demand of data connectivity motivates the development
of new and effective power line communication (PLC) channel models, which are
able to faithfully describe a real communication scenario. This is of
fundamental importance since a good model represents a quick evaluation tool
for new standards or devices, allowing a considerable saving in time and costs.
The aim of this paper is to discuss a novel top-down MIMO PLC synthetic channel
model, able to numerically emulate a real PLC environment. First, the most
common channel modeling strategies are briefly described, highlighting
strengths and weaknesses. Afterwards, the basic model approach is described
considering the SISO scenario. The implementation strategy is then extended to
the MIMO case. The validity of the proposed model is proved making a comparison
between the simulated channels and channels obtained with measurements in terms
of both performance and statistical metrics. The focus is on the broadband
frequency spectrum.

1980's, and restudied recently in the context of model checking and program
verification. We show that the class of unsafe order-(n+1) word languages
coincides with the class of frontier languages of unsafe order-n tree
languages. We use intersection types for transforming an order-(n+1) word
grammar to a corresponding order-n tree grammar. The result has been proved for
safe languages by Damm in 1982, but it has been open for unsafe languages, to
our knowledge. Various known results on higher-order grammars can be obtained
as almost immediate corollaries of our result.

 <dc:description>  The growth of the sharing economy is driven by the emergence of sharing
platforms, e.g., Uber and Lyft, that match owners looking to share their
resources with customers looking to rent them. The design of such platforms is
a complex mixture of economics and engineering, and how to &quot;optimally&quot; design
such platforms is still an open problem. In this paper, we focus on the design
of prices and subsidies in sharing platforms. Our results provide insights into
the tradeoff between revenue maximizing prices and social welfare maximizing
prices. Specifically, we introduce a novel model of sharing platforms and
characterize the profit and social welfare maximizing prices in this model.
Further, we bound the efficiency loss under profit maximizing prices, showing
that there is a strong alignment between profit and efficiency in practical
settings. Our results highlight that the revenue of platforms may be limited in
practice due to supply shortages; thus platforms have a strong incentive to
encourage sharing via subsidies. We provide an analytic characterization of
when such subsidies are valuable and show how to optimize the size of the
subsidy provided. Finally, we validate the insights from our analysis using
data from Didi Chuxing, the largest ridesharing platform in China.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a new robust sound source localization and tracking
method using an array of eight microphones (US patent pending) . The method
uses a steered beamformer based on the reliability-weighted phase transform
(RWPHAT) along with a particle filter-based tracking algorithm. The proposed
system is able to estimate both the direction and the distance of the sources.
In a videoconferencing context, the direction was estimated with an accuracy
better than one degree while the distance was accurate within 10% RMS. Tracking
of up to three simultaneous moving speakers is demonstrated in a noisy

 <dc:title>Information Utilization Ratio in Heuristic Optimization Algorithms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Junzhi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tan, Ying</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Heuristic algorithms are able to optimize objective functions efficiently
because they use intelligently the information about the objective functions.
Thus, information utilization is critical to the performance of heuristics.
However, the concept of information utilization has remained vague and abstract
because there is no reliable metric to reflect the extent to which the
information about the objective function is utilized by heuristic algorithms.
In this paper, the metric of information utilization ratio (IUR) is defined,
which is the ratio of the utilized information quantity over the acquired
information quantity in the search process. The IUR proves to be well-defined.
Several examples of typical heuristic algorithms are given to demonstrate the
procedure of calculating the IUR. Empirical evidences on the correlation
between the IUR and the performance of a heuristic are also provided. The IUR
can be an index of how finely an algorithm is designed and guide the invention
of new heuristics and the improvement of existing ones.

 <dc:description>  Mathematical models of physical systems are subject to many uncertainties
such as measurement errors and uncertain initial and boundary conditions. After
accounting for these uncertainties, it is often revealed that discrepancies
between the model output and the observations remain; if so, the model is said
to be inadequate. In practice, the inadequate model may be the best that is
available or tractable, and so despite its inadequacy the model may be used to
make predictions of unobserved quantities. In this case, a representation of
the inadequacy is necessary, so the impact of the observed discrepancy can be
determined. We investigate this problem in the context of chemical kinetics and
propose a new technique to account for model inadequacy that is both
probabilistic and physically meaningful. A stochastic inadequacy operator
$\mathcal{S}$ is introduced which is embedded in the ODEs describing the
evolution of chemical species concentrations and which respects certain
physical constraints such as conservation laws. The parameters of $\mathcal{S}$
are governed by probability distributions, which in turn are characterized by a
set of hyperparameters. The model parameters and hyperparameters are calibrated
using high-dimensional hierarchical Bayesian inference. We apply the method to
a typical problem in chemical kinetics---the reaction mechanism of hydrogen
combustion.

 <dc:description>  This work studies the optimal Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) of the $K$-User MISO
Broadcast Channel (BC) with delayed Channel-State Information at the
Transmitter (CSIT) and with additional current noisy CSIT where the current
channel estimation error scales in~$P^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in[0,1]$. This
papers establishes for the first time the optimal DoF in this setting thanks to
a new transmission scheme which achieves the elusive DoF-optimal combining of
the Maddah-Ali and Tse scheme (MAT) introduced in their seminal work in $2010$
with Zero-Forcing (ZF) for an arbitrary number of users. The derived sum DoF
takes the surprisingly simple form $(1-\alpha) K/H_K+\alpha K$ where
$H_K\triangleq \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{1}{k}$ is the sum-DoF achieved using solely
MAT.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new correlated and individual multi-modal deep
learning (CIMDL) method for RGB-D object recognition. Unlike most conventional
RGB-D object recognition methods which extract features from the RGB and depth
channels individually, our CIMDL jointly learns feature representations from
raw RGB-D data with a pair of deep neural networks, so that the sharable and
modal-specific information can be simultaneously exploited. Specifically, we
construct a pair of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the RGB and
depth data, and concatenate them at the top layer of the network with a loss
function which learns a new feature space where both correlated part and the
individual part of the RGB-D information are well modelled. The parameters of
the whole networks are updated by using the back-propagation criterion.
Experimental results on two widely used RGB-D object image benchmark datasets
clearly show that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:description>  While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text
understanding play an important role in human intelligence, the subsequent
tasks that involve inference, reasoning and planning require an even higher
level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major advances in many
perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference,
however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still
more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves
both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate
deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework,
which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception
of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level
inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to
enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a general
introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on
recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this survey, we also discuss
the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other
related topics like Bayesian treatment of neural networks.

 <dc:title>Market Share Analysis with Brand Effect</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fang, Zhixuan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Longbo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the effect of brand in market competition.
Specifically, we propose a variant Hotelling model where companies and
customers are represented by points in an Euclidean space, with axes being
product features. $N$ companies compete to maximize their own profits by
optimally choosing their prices, while each customer in the market, when
choosing sellers, considers the sum of product price, discrepancy between
product feature and his preference, and a company's brand name, which is
modeled by a function of its market area of the form $-\beta\cdot\text{(Market
Area)}^q$, where $\beta$ captures the brand influence and $q$ captures how
market share affects the brand. By varying the parameters $\beta$ and $q$, we
derive existence results of Nash equilibrium and equilibrium market prices and
shares. In particular, we prove that pure Nash equilibrium always exists when
$q=0$ for markets with either one and two dominating features, and it always
exists in a single dominating feature market when market affects brand name
linearly, i.e., $q=1$. Moreover, we show that at equilibrium, a company's price
is proportional to its market area over the competition intensity with its
neighbors, a result that quantitatively reconciles the common belief of a
company's pricing power. We also study an interesting &quot;wipe out&quot; phenomenon
that only appears when $q&gt;0$, which is similar to the &quot;undercut&quot; phenomenon in
the Hotelling model, where companies may suddenly lose the entire market area
with a small price increment. Our results offer novel insight into market
pricing and positioning under competition with brand effect.

 <dc:description>  Unraveling quality of experience (QoE) of video streaming is very challenging
in bandwidth shared wireless networks. It is unclear how QoE metrics such as
starvation probability and buffering time interact with dynamics of streaming
traffic load. In this paper, we collect view records from one of the largest
streaming providers in China over two weeks and perform an in-depth measurement
study on flow arrival and viewing time that shed light on the real traffic
pattern. Our most important observation is that the viewing time of streaming
users fits a hyper-exponential distribution quite well. This implies that all
the views can be categorized into two classes, short and long views with
separated time scales. We then map the measured traffic pattern to bandwidth
shared cellular networks and propose an analytical framework to compute the
closed-form starvation probability on the basis of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Our framework can be naturally extended to investigate
practical issues including the progressive downloading and the finite video
duration. Extensive trace-driven simulations validate the accuracy of our
models. Our study reveals that the starvation metrics of the short and long
views possess different sensitivities to the scheduling priority at base
station. Hence, a better QoE tradeoff between the short and long views has a
potential to be leveraged by offering them different scheduling weights. The
flow differentiation involves tremendous technical and non-technical challenges
because video content is owned by content providers but not the network
operators and the viewing time of each session is unknown beforehand. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose an online Bayesian approach to infer
the viewing time of each incoming flow with the &quot;least&quot; information from
content providers.

 <dc:title>Fusing Face and Periocular biometrics using Canonical correlation
  analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lakshmiprabha, N. S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel face and periocular biometric fusion at feature
level using canonical correlation analysis. Face recognition itself has
limitations such as illumination, pose, expression, occlusion etc. Also,
periocular biometrics has spectacles, head angle, hair and expression as its
limitations. Unimodal biometrics cannot surmount all these limitations. The
recognition accuracy can be increased by fusing dual information (face and
periocular) from a single source (face image) using canonical correlation
analysis (CCA). This work also proposes a new wavelet decomposed local binary
pattern (WD-LBP) feature extractor which provides sufficient features for
fusion. A detailed analysis on face and periocular biometrics shows that WD-LBP
features are more accurate and faster than local binary pattern (LBP) and gabor
wavelet. The experimental results using Muct face database reveals that the
proposed multimodal biometrics performs better than the unimodal biometrics.

 <dc:title>Face Image Analysis using AAM, Gabor, LBP and WD features for Gender,
  Age, Expression and Ethnicity Classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lakshmiprabha, N. S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The growth in electronic transactions and human machine interactions rely on
the information such as gender, age, expression and ethnicity provided by the
face image. In order to obtain these information, feature extraction plays a
major role. In this paper, retrieval of age, gender, expression and race
information from an individual face image is analysed using different feature
extraction methods. The performance of four major feature extraction methods
such as Active Appearance Model (AAM), Gabor wavelets, Local Binary Pattern
(LBP) and Wavelet Decomposition (WD) are analyzed for gender recognition, age
estimation, expression recognition and racial recognition in terms of accuracy
(recognition rate), time for feature extraction, neural training and time to
test an image. Each of this recognition system is compared with four feature
extractors on same dataset (training and validation set) to get a better
understanding in its performance. Experiments carried out on FG-NET,
Cohn-Kanade, PAL face database shows that each method has its own merits and
demerits. Hence it is practically impossible to define a method which is best
at all circumstances with less computational complexity. Further, a detailed
comparison of age estimation and age estimation using gender information is
provided along with a solution to overcome aging effect in case of gender
recognition. An attempt has been made in obtaining all (i.e. gender, age range,
expression and ethnicity) information from a test image in a single go.

 <dc:description>  Visual understanding of complex urban street scenes is an enabling factor for
a wide range of applications. Object detection has benefited enormously from
large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic
urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the
complexity of real-world urban scenes.
  To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale
dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level
semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo
video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these
images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have
coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of
weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms
of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our
accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset
characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several
state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.

 <dc:title>Relationship between Variants of One-Class Nearest Neighbours and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In one-class classification problems, only the data for the target class is
available, whereas the data for the non-target class may be completely absent.
In this paper, we study one-class nearest neighbour (OCNN) classifiers and
their different variants. We present a theoretical analysis to show the
relationships among different variants of OCNN that may use different
neighbours or thresholds to identify unseen examples of the non-target class.
We also present a method based on inter-quartile range for optimising
parameters used in OCNN in the absence of non-target data during training.
Then, we propose two ensemble approaches based on random subspace and random
projection methods to create accurate OCNN ensembles. We tested the proposed
methods on 15 benchmark and real world domain-specific datasets and show that
random-projection ensembles of OCNN perform best.

 <dc:description>  A currently successful approach to computational semantics is to represent
words as embeddings in a machine-learned vector space. We present an ensemble
method that combines embeddings produced by GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) and
word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) with structured knowledge from the semantic
networks ConceptNet (Speer and Havasi, 2012) and PPDB (Ganitkevitch et al.,
2013), merging their information into a common representation with a large,
multilingual vocabulary. The embeddings it produces achieve state-of-the-art
performance on many word-similarity evaluations. Its score of $\rho = .596$ on
an evaluation of rare words (Luong et al., 2013) is 16% higher than the
previous best known system.

 <dc:description>  Human flourishing is often severely limited by persistent violence.
Quantitative conflict research has found common temporal and other statistical
patterns in warfare, but very little is understood about its general spatial
patterns. While the importance of topology in geostrategy has long been
recognised, the role of spatial patterns of cities in determining a region's
vulnerability to conflict has gone unexplored. Here, we show that global
patterns in war and peace are closely related to the relative position of
cities in a global interaction network. We find that regions with betweenness
centrality above a certain threshold are often engulfed in entrenched conflict,
while a high degree correlates with peace. In fact, betweenness accounts for
over 80% of the variance in number of attacks. This metric is also a good
predictor of the distance to a conflict zone and can estimate the risk of
conflict. We conjecture that a high betweenness identifies areas with fuzzy
cultural boundaries, whereas high degree cities are in cores where peace is
more easily maintained. This is supported by a simple agent-based model in
which cities influence their neighbours, which exhibits the same threshold
behaviour with betweenness as seen in conflict data. These findings not only
shed new light on the causes of violence, but could be used to estimate the
risk associated with actions such as the merging of cities, construction of
transportation infrastructure, or interventions in trade or migration patterns.

 <dc:description>  Representation and learning of commonsense knowledge is one of the
foundational problems in the quest to enable deep language understanding. This
issue is particularly challenging for understanding casual and correlational
relationships between events. While this topic has received a lot of interest
in the NLP community, research has been hindered by the lack of a proper
evaluation framework. This paper attempts to address this problem with a new
framework for evaluating story understanding and script learning: the 'Story
Cloze Test'. This test requires a system to choose the correct ending to a
four-sentence story. We created a new corpus of ~50k five-sentence commonsense
stories, ROCStories, to enable this evaluation. This corpus is unique in two
ways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal commonsense relations
between daily events, and (2) it is a high quality collection of everyday life
stories that can also be used for story generation. Experimental evaluation
shows that a host of baselines and state-of-the-art models based on shallow
language understanding struggle to achieve a high score on the Story Cloze
Test. We discuss these implications for script and story learning, and offer
suggestions for deeper language understanding.

 <dc:title>Online Lower Bounds via Duality</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we exploit linear programming duality in the online setting
(i.e., where input arrives on the fly) from the unique perspective of designing
lower bounds on the competitive ratio. In particular, we provide a general
technique for obtaining online deterministic and randomized lower bounds (i.e.,
hardness results) on the competitive ratio for a wide variety of problems. We
show the usefulness of our approach by providing new, tight lower bounds for
three diverse online problems. The three problems we show tight lower bounds
for are the Vector Bin Packing problem, Ad-auctions (and various online
matching problems), and the Capital Investment problem. Our methods are
sufficiently general that they can also be used to reconstruct existing lower
bounds.
  Our techniques are in stark contrast to previous works, which exploit linear
programming duality to obtain positive results, often via the useful
primal-dual scheme. We design a general recipe with the opposite aim of
obtaining negative results via duality. The general idea behind our approach is
to construct a primal linear program based on a collection of input sequences,
where the objective function corresponds to optimizing the competitive ratio.
We then obtain the corresponding dual linear program and provide a feasible
solution, where the objective function yields a lower bound on the competitive
ratio. Online lower bounds are often achieved by adapting the input sequence
according to an online algorithm's behavior and doing an appropriate ad hoc
case analysis. Using our unifying techniques, we simultaneously combine these
cases into one linear program and achieve online lower bounds via a more robust
analysis. We are confident that our framework can be successfully applied to
produce many more lower bounds for a wide array of online problems.

 <dc:description>  We exploit human color metamers to send light-modulated messages less visible
to the human eye, but recoverable by cameras. These messages are a key
component to camera-display messaging, such as handheld smartphones capturing
information from electronic signage. Each color pixel in the display image is
modified by a particular color gradient vector. The challenge is to find the
color gradient that maximizes camera response, while minimizing human response.
The mismatch in human spectral and camera sensitivity curves creates an
opportunity for hidden messaging. Our approach does not require knowledge of
these sensitivity curves, instead we employ a data-driven method. We learn an
ellipsoidal partitioning of the six-dimensional space of colors and color
gradients. This partitioning creates metamer sets defined by the base color at
the display pixel and the color gradient direction for message encoding. We
sample from the resulting metamer sets to find color steps for each base color
to embed a binary message into an arbitrary image with reduced visible
artifacts. Unlike previous methods that rely on visually obtrusive intensity
modulation, we embed with color so that the message is more hidden. Ordinary
displays and cameras are used without the need for expensive LEDs or high speed
devices. The primary contribution of this work is a framework to map the pixels
in an arbitrary image to a metamer pair for steganographic photo messaging.

Specifically, we integrate both a neural language model and distributional

 <dc:title>Efficiency and Sequenceability in Fair Division of Indivisible Goods

 <dc:description>  In fair division of indivisible goods, using sequences of sincere choices (or
picking sequences) is a natural way to allocate the objects. The idea is the
following: at each stage, a designated agent picks one object among those that
remain. This paper, restricted to the case where the agents have numerical
additive preferences over objects, revisits to some extent the seminal paper by
Brams and King [9] which was specific to ordinal and linear order preferences
over items. We point out similarities and differences with this latter context.
In particular, we show that any Pareto-optimal allocation (under additive
preferences) is sequenceable, but that the converse is not true anymore. This
asymmetry leads naturally to the definition of a &quot;scale of efficiency&quot; having
three steps: Pareto-optimality, sequenceability without Pareto-optimality, and
non-sequenceability. Finally, we investigate the links between these efficiency
properties and the &quot;scale of fairness&quot; we have described in an earlier work
[7]: we first show that an allocation can be envy-free and non-sequenceable,
but that every competitive equilibrium with equal incomes is sequenceable. Then
we experimentally explore the links between the scales of efficiency and
fairness.

 <dc:description>  It is widely acknowledged that the forthcoming 5G architecture will be highly
heterogeneous and deployed with a high degree of density. These changes over
the current 4G bring many challenges on how to achieve an efficient operation
from the network management perspective. In this article, we introduce a
revolutionary vision of the future 5G wireless networks, in which the network
is no longer limited by hardware or even software. Specifically, by the idea of
virtualizing the wireless networks, which has recently gained increasing
attention, we introduce the Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) taxonomy to light
the way towards designing the service-oriented wireless networks. The concepts,
challenges along with the research opportunities for realizing XaaS in wireless
networks are overviewed and discussed.

 <dc:description>  -In this paper, a novel resource allocation scheme based on discrete
Cournot-Nash equilibria and optimal transport theory is proposed. The
originality of this framework lies in the joint optimization of downlink
bandwidth allocation and cooperation between base stations. A tractable
formalization is given in the form of a quadratic optimization problem. A low
complexity approximate solution is derived and theoretically characterized.
Simulations highlight the existence of an optimal working point, that maximizes
user satisfaction ratio and network load. The impact of the network deployment
on the optimum is numerically investigated, thanks to the $\beta$-Ginibre
model. Indeed, base stations are assumed to be drawn according to
$\beta$-Ginibre point processes. Numerical analysis shows that the network
performance increases with $\beta$ going to one.

 <dc:description>  We present a correct-by-design method of state-dependent control synthesis
for linear discrete-time switching systems. Given an objective region R of the
state space, the method builds a capture set S and a control which steers any
element of S into R. The method works by iterated backward reachability from R.
More precisely, S is given as a parametric extension of R, and the maximum
value of the parameter is solved by linear programming. The method can also be
used to synthesize a stability control which maintains indefinitely within R
all the states starting at R. We explain how the synthesis method can be
performed in a distributed manner. The method has been implemented and
successfully applied to the synthesis of a distributed control of a concrete
floor heating system with 11 rooms and 2^11 = 2048 switching modes.

 <dc:description>  Computer vision has a great potential to help our daily lives by searching
for lost keys, watering flowers or reminding us to take a pill. To succeed with
such tasks, computer vision methods need to be trained from real and diverse
examples of our daily dynamic scenes. While most of such scenes are not
particularly exciting, they typically do not appear on YouTube, in movies or TV
broadcasts. So how do we collect sufficiently many diverse but boring samples
representing our lives? We propose a novel Hollywood in Homes approach to
collect such data. Instead of shooting videos in the lab, we ensure diversity
by distributing and crowdsourcing the whole process of video creation from
script writing to video recording and annotation. Following this procedure we
collect a new dataset, Charades, with hundreds of people recording videos in
their own homes, acting out casual everyday activities. The dataset is composed
of 9,848 annotated videos with an average length of 30 seconds, showing
activities of 267 people from three continents. Each video is annotated by
multiple free-text descriptions, action labels, action intervals and classes of
interacted objects. In total, Charades provides 27,847 video descriptions,
66,500 temporally localized intervals for 157 action classes and 41,104 labels
for 46 object classes. Using this rich data, we evaluate and provide baseline
results for several tasks including action recognition and automatic
description generation. We believe that the realism, diversity, and casual
nature of this dataset will present unique challenges and new opportunities for
computer vision community.

 <dc:description>  Fix a finite semigroup $S$ and let $a_1, \ldots, a_k, b$ be tuples in a
direct power $S^n$. The subpower membership problem (SMP) for $S$ asks whether
$b$ can be generated by $a_1, \ldots, a_k$. For combinatorial Rees matrix
semigroups we establish a dichotomy result: if the corresponding matrix is of a
certain form, then the SMP is in P; otherwise it is NP-complete. For
combinatorial Rees matrix semigroups with adjoined identity, we obtain a
trichotomy: the SMP is either in P, NP-complete, or PSPACE-complete. This
result yields various semigroups with PSPACE-complete SMP including the
$6$-element Brandt monoid, the full transformation semigroup on $3$ or more
letters, and semigroups of all $n$ by $n$ matrices over a field for $n\ge 2$.

 <dc:description>  We formalize the idea of probability distributions that lead to reliable
predictions about some, but not all aspects of a domain. The resulting notion
of `safety' provides a fresh perspective on foundational issues in statistics,
providing a middle ground between imprecise probability and multiple-prior
models on the one hand and strictly Bayesian approaches on the other. It also
allows us to formalize fiducial distributions in terms of the set of random
variables that they can safely predict, thus taking some of the sting out of
the fiducial idea. By restricting probabilistic inference to safe uses, one
also automatically avoids paradoxes such as the Monty Hall problem. Safety
comes in a variety of degrees, such as &quot;validity&quot; (the strongest notion),
&quot;calibration&quot;, &quot;confidence safety&quot; and &quot;unbiasedness&quot; (almost the weakest
notion).

 <dc:title>A Subpath Kernel for Learning Hierarchical Image Representations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Tree kernels have demonstrated their ability to deal with hierarchical data,
as the intrinsic tree structure often plays a discriminative role. While such
kernels have been successfully applied to various domains such as nature
language processing and bioinformatics, they mostly concentrate on ordered
trees and whose nodes are described by symbolic data. Meanwhile, hierarchical
representations have gained increasing interest to describe image content. This
is particularly true in remote sensing, where such representations allow for
revealing different objects of interest at various scales through a tree
structure. However, the induced trees are unordered and the nodes are equipped
with numerical features. In this paper, we propose a new structured kernel for
hierarchical image representations which is built on the concept of subpath
kernel. Experimental results on both artificial and remote sensing datasets
show that the proposed kernel manages to deal with the hierarchical nature of
the data, leading to better classification rates.

 <dc:description>  Motivation: High throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies generate an
excessive number of small DNA segments -called short reads- that cause
significant computational burden. To analyze the entire genome, each of the
billions of short reads must be mapped to a reference genome based on the
similarity between a read and &quot;candidate&quot; locations in that reference genome.
The similarity measurement, called alignment, formulated as an approximate
string matching problem, is the computational bottleneck because: (1) it is
implemented using quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithms, and (2) the
majority of candidate locations in the reference genome do not align with a
given read due to high dissimilarity. Calculating the alignment of such
incorrect candidate locations consumes an overwhelming majority of a modern
read mapper's execution time. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and
effective filter that can detect incorrect candidate locations and eliminate
them before using computationally costly alignment operations. Results: We
propose GateKeeper, a new hardware accelerator that functions as a
pre-alignment step that quickly filters out most incorrect candidate locations.
GateKeeper is the first design to accelerate pre-alignment using
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which can perform pre-alignment much
faster than software. GateKeeper can be integrated with any mapper that
performs sequence alignment for verification. When implemented on a single FPGA
chip, GateKeeper maintains high accuracy (on average &gt;96%) while providing up
to 105-fold and 215-fold speedup over the state-of-the-art software
pre-alignment techniques, Adjacency Filter and Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD),
respectively. Availability: GateKeeper is available at:

 <dc:description>  Very deep CNNs with small 3x3 kernels have recently been shown to achieve
very strong performance as acoustic models in hybrid NN-HMM speech recognition
systems. In this paper we investigate how to efficiently scale these models to
larger datasets. Specifically, we address the design choice of pooling and
padding along the time dimension which renders convolutional evaluation of
sequences highly inefficient. We propose a new CNN design without timepadding
and without timepooling, which is slightly suboptimal for accuracy, but has two
significant advantages: it enables sequence training and deployment by allowing
efficient convolutional evaluation of full utterances, and, it allows for batch
normalization to be straightforwardly adopted to CNNs on sequence data. Through
batch normalization, we recover the lost peformance from removing the
time-pooling, while keeping the benefit of efficient convolutional evaluation.
We demonstrate the performance of our models both on larger scale data than
before, and after sequence training. Our very deep CNN model sequence trained
on the 2000h switchboard dataset obtains 9.4 word error rate on the Hub5
test-set, matching with a single model the performance of the 2015 IBM system
combination, which was the previous best published result.

 <dc:description>  Complex systems show the capacity to aggregate information and to display
coordinated activity. In the case of social systems the interaction of
different individuals leads to the emergence of norms, trends in political
positions, opinions, cultural traits, and even scientific progress. Examples of
collective behavior can be observed in activities like the Wikipedia and Linux,
where individuals aggregate their knowledge for the benefit of the community,
and citizen science, where the potential of collectives to solve complex
problems is exploited. Here, we conducted an online experiment to investigate
the performance of a collective when solving a guessing problem in which each
actor is endowed with partial information and placed as the nodes of an
interaction network. We measure the performance of the collective in terms of
the temporal evolution of the accuracy, finding no statistical difference in
the performance for two classes of networks, regular lattices and random
networks. We also determine that a Bayesian description captures the behavior
pattern the individuals follow in aggregating information from neighbors to
make decisions. In comparison with other simple decision models, the strategy
followed by the players reveals a suboptimal performance of the collective. Our
contribution provides the basis for the micro-macro connection between
individual based descriptions and collective phenomena.

 <dc:description>  The combination of clinical and personal health and wellbeing data can tell
us much about our behaviors, risks and overall status. The way this data is
visualized may affect our understanding of our own health. To study this
effect, we conducted a small experiment with 30 participants in which we
presented a holistic overview of the health and wellbeing of two modeled
individuals, one of them with metabolic syndrome. We used an insight-based
methodology to assess the effectiveness of the visualizations. The results show
that adequate visualization of holistic health data helps users without medical
background to better understand the overall health situation and possible
health risks related to lifestyles. Furthermore, we found that the application
of insight-based methodology in the health and wellbeing domain remains
unexplored and additional research and methodology development are needed.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning techniques are often used in computer vision due to their
ability to leverage large amounts of training data to improve performance.
Unfortunately, most generic object trackers are still trained from scratch
online and do not benefit from the large number of videos that are readily
available for offline training. We propose a method for offline training of
neural networks that can track novel objects at test-time at 100 fps. Our
tracker is significantly faster than previous methods that use neural networks
for tracking, which are typically very slow to run and not practical for
real-time applications. Our tracker uses a simple feed-forward network with no
online training required. The tracker learns a generic relationship between
object motion and appearance and can be used to track novel objects that do not
appear in the training set. We test our network on a standard tracking
benchmark to demonstrate our tracker's state-of-the-art performance. Further,
our performance improves as we add more videos to our offline training set. To
the best of our knowledge, our tracker is the first neural-network tracker that
learns to track generic objects at 100 fps.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel theoretical result that generalises the Discriminative
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM). While originally the DRBM was defined
assuming the {0, 1}-Bernoulli distribution in each of its hidden units, this
result makes it possible to derive cost functions for variants of the DRBM that
utilise other distributions, including some that are often encountered in the
literature. This is illustrated with the Binomial and {-1, +1}-Bernoulli
distributions here. We evaluate these two DRBM variants and compare them with
the original one on three benchmark datasets, namely the MNIST and USPS digit
classification datasets, and the 20 Newsgroups document classification dataset.
Results show that each of the three compared models outperforms the remaining
two in one of the three datasets, thus indicating that the proposed theoretical
generalisation of the DRBM may be valuable in practice.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a robust fast multi-band image fusion method to merge a
high-spatial low-spectral resolution image and a low-spatial high-spectral
resolution image. Following the method recently developed in [1], the
generalized Sylvester matrix equation associated with the multi-band image
fusion problem is solved in a more robust and efficient way by exploiting the
Woodbury formula, avoiding any permutation operation in the frequency domain as
well as the blurring kernel invertibility assumption required in [1]. Thanks to
this improvement, the proposed algorithm requires fewer computational
operations and is also more robust with respect to the blurring kernel compared
with the one in [1]. The proposed new algorithm is tested with different priors
considered in [1]. Our conclusion is that the proposed fusion algorithm is more
robust than the one in [1] with a reduced computational cost.

 <dc:description>  We tackle the problem of estimating optical flow from a monocular camera in
the context of autonomous driving. We build on the observation that the scene
is typically composed of a static background, as well as a relatively small
number of traffic participants which move rigidly in 3D. We propose to estimate
the traffic participants using instance-level segmentation. For each traffic
participant, we use the epipolar constraints that govern each independent
motion for faster and more accurate estimation. Our second contribution is a
new convolutional net that learns to perform flow matching, and is able to
estimate the uncertainty of its matches. This is a core element of our flow
estimation pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the
challenging KITTI 2015 flow benchmark, and show that our approach outperforms
published approaches by a large margin.

 <dc:description>  Value functions arise as a component of algorithms as well as performance
metrics in statistics and engineering applications. Computation of the
associated Bellman equations is numerically challenging in all but a few
special cases. A popular approximation technique is known as Temporal
Difference (TD) learning. The algorithm introduced in this paper is intended to
resolve two well-known problems with this approach:In the discounted-cost
setting, the variance of the algorithm diverges as the discount factor
approaches unity. Second, for the average cost setting, unbiased algorithms
exist only in special cases.
  It is shown that the gradient of any of these value functions admits a
representation that lends itself to algorithm design. Based on this result, the
new differential TD method is obtained for Markovian models on Euclidean space
with smooth dynamics.
  Numerical examples show remarkable improvements in performance. In
application to speed scaling, variance is reduced by two orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  The social networking era has left us with little privacy. The details of the
social network users are published on Social Networking sites. Vulnerability
has reached new heights due to the overpowering effects of social networking.
The sites like Facebook, Twitter are having a huge set of users who publish
their files, comments, messages in other users walls. These messages and
comments could be of any nature. Even friends could post a comment that would
harm a persons integrity. Thus there has to be a system which will monitor the
messages and comments that are posted on the walls. If the messages are found
to be neutral (does not have any harmful content), then it can be published. If
the messages are found to have non-neutral content in them, then these messages
would be blocked by the social network manager. The messages that are
non-neutral would be of sexual, offensive, hatred, pun intended nature. Thus
the social network manager can classify content as neutral and non-neutral and
notify the user if there seems to be messages of non-neutral behavior.

 <dc:description>  We consider a broadcast channel, in which a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice)
sends $K$ confidential information signals to $K$ legitimate users (Bobs) in
the presence of $L$ eavesdroppers (Eves). Alice uses MIMO precoding to generate
the information signals along with her own (Tx-based) friendly jamming.
Interference at each Bob is removed by MIMO zero-forcing. This, however, leaves
a &quot;vulnerability region&quot; around each Bob, which can be exploited by a nearby
Eve. We address this problem by augmenting Tx-based friendly jamming (TxFJ)
with Rx-based friendly jamming (RxFJ), generated by each Bob. Specifically,
each Bob uses self-interference suppression (SIS) to transmit a friendly
jamming signal while simultaneously receiving an information signal over the
same channel. We minimize the powers allocated to the information, TxFJ, and
RxFJ signals under given guarantees on the individual secrecy rate for each
Bob. The problem is solved for the cases when the eavesdropper's channel state
information is known/unknown. Simulations show the effectiveness of the
proposed solution. Furthermore, we discuss how to schedule transmissions when
the rate requirements need to be satisfied on average rather than
instantaneously. Under special cases, a scheduling algorithm that serves only
the strongest receivers is shown to outperform the one that schedules all
receivers.

 <dc:title>Clustering Via Crowdsourcing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In recent years, crowdsourcing, aka human aided computation has emerged as an
effective platform for solving problems that are considered complex for
machines alone. Using human is time-consuming and costly due to monetary
compensations. Therefore, a crowd based algorithm must judiciously use any
information computed through an automated process, and ask minimum number of
questions to the crowd adaptively.
  One such problem which has received significant attention is {\em entity
resolution}. Formally, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with unknown edge set $E$
where $G$ is a union of $k$ (again unknown, but typically large $O(n^\alpha)$,
for $\alpha&gt;0$) disjoint cliques $G_i(V_i, E_i)$, $i =1, \dots, k$. The goal is
to retrieve the sets $V_i$s by making minimum number of pair-wise queries $V
\times V\to\{\pm1\}$ to an oracle (the crowd). When the answer to each query is
correct, e.g. via resampling, then this reduces to finding connected components
in a graph. On the other hand, when crowd answers may be incorrect, it
corresponds to clustering over minimum number of noisy inputs. Even, with
perfect answers, a simple lower and upper bound of $\Theta(nk)$ on query
complexity can be shown. A major contribution of this paper is to reduce the
query complexity to linear or even sublinear in $n$ when mild side information
is provided by a machine, and even in presence of crowd errors which are not
correctable via resampling. We develop new information theoretic lower bounds
on the query complexity of clustering with side information and errors, and our
upper bounds closely match with them. Our algorithms are naturally
parallelizable, and also give near-optimal bounds on the number of adaptive
rounds required to match the query complexity.

 <dc:description>  An enduring issue in higher education is student retention to successful
graduation. National statistics indicate that most higher education
institutions have four-year degree completion rates around 50 percent, or just
half of their student populations. While there are prediction models which
illuminate what factors assist with college student success, interventions that
support course selections on a semester-to-semester basis have yet to be deeply
understood. To further this goal, we develop a system to predict students'
grades in the courses they will enroll in during the next enrollment term by
learning patterns from historical transcript data coupled with additional
information about students, courses and the instructors teaching them.
  We explore a variety of classic and state-of-the-art techniques which have
proven effective for recommendation tasks in the e-commerce domain. In our
experiments, Factorization Machines (FM), Random Forests (RF), and the
Personalized Multi-Linear Regression model achieve the lowest prediction error.
Application of a novel feature selection technique is key to the predictive
success and interpretability of the FM. By comparing feature importance across
populations and across models, we uncover strong connections between instructor
characteristics and student performance. We also discover key differences
between transfer and non-transfer students. Ultimately we find that a hybrid
FM-RF method can be used to accurately predict grades for both new and
returning students taking both new and existing courses. Application of these
techniques holds promise for student degree planning, instructor interventions,
and personalized advising, all of which could improve retention and academic
performance.

us to leverage object detection through image classification on supporting

of the deformable model objector from 35.9% to 39.5% in average precision over

 <dc:description>  We optimize the throughput of a single cell multiuser orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing system with proportional data rate fairness among the
users. The concept is to support mobile users with different levels of service.
The optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem,
which is computationally very expensive. We propose a novel and efficient
near-optimal solution adopting a two-phase optimization approach that separates
the subcarrier and power allocation. In the first phase, we relax the strict
proportional data rate requirements and employ an iterative subcarrier
allocation approach that coarsely satisfies desired data rate proportionality
constraints. In the second phase, we reallocate the power among the users in an
iterative way to further enhance the adherence to the desired proportions by
exploiting the normalized proportionality deviation measure. The simulation
results show that the proposed solution exhibits very strong adherence to the
desired proportional data rate fairness while achieving higher system
throughput compared to the other existing solutions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the communication complexity for the problem of
computing a conjunctive query on a large database in a parallel setting with
$p$ servers. In contrast to previous work, where upper and lower bounds on the
communication were specified for particular structures of data (either data
without skew, or data with specific types of skew), in this work we focus on
worst-case analysis of the communication cost. The goal is to find worst-case
optimal parallel algorithms, similar to the work of [18] for sequential
algorithms.
  We first show that for a single round we can obtain an optimal worst-case
algorithm. The optimal load for a conjunctive query $q$ when all relations have
size equal to $M$ is $O(M/p^{1/\psi^*})$, where $\psi^*$ is a new query-related
quantity called the edge quasi-packing number, which is different from both the
edge packing number and edge cover number of the query hypergraph. For multiple
rounds, we present algorithms that are optimal for several classes of queries.
Finally, we show a surprising connection to the external memory model, which
allows us to translate parallel algorithms to external memory algorithms. This
technique allows us to recover (within a polylogarithmic factor) several recent
results on the I/O complexity for computing join queries, and also obtain
optimal algorithms for other classes of queries.

 <dc:description>  Existing person re-identification benchmarks and methods mainly focus on
matching cropped pedestrian images between queries and candidates. However, it
is different from real-world scenarios where the annotations of pedestrian
bounding boxes are unavailable and the target person needs to be searched from
a gallery of whole scene images. To close the gap, we propose a new deep
learning framework for person search. Instead of breaking it down into two
separate tasks---pedestrian detection and person re-identification, we jointly
handle both aspects in a single convolutional neural network. An Online
Instance Matching (OIM) loss function is proposed to train the network
effectively, which is scalable to datasets with numerous identities. To
validate our approach, we collect and annotate a large-scale benchmark dataset
for person search. It contains 18,184 images, 8,432 identities, and 96,143
pedestrian bounding boxes. Experiments show that our framework outperforms
other separate approaches, and the proposed OIM loss function converges much
faster and better than the conventional Softmax loss.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies how to maximize a spectrum database operator's expected
revenue in sharing spectrum to secondary users, through joint pricing and
admission control of spectrum resources. A unique feature of our model is the
consideration of the stochastic and heterogeneous nature of secondary users'
demands. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic programming problem,
and present the optimal solutions under both static and dynamic pricing
schemes. In the case of static pricing, the prices do not change with time,
although the admission control policy can still be time-dependent. In this
case, we show that a stationary (time-independent) admission policy is in fact
optimal under a wide range of system parameters. In the case of dynamic
pricing, we allow both prices and admission control policies to be
time-dependent. We show that the optimal dynamic pricing can improve the
operator's revenue by more than 30% over the optimal static pricing, when
secondary users' demands for spectrum opportunities are highly elastic.

 <dc:description>  A system of nested dichotomies is a method of decomposing a multi-class
problem into a collection of binary problems. Such a system recursively splits
the set of classes into two subsets, and trains a binary classifier to
distinguish between each subset. Even though ensembles of nested dichotomies
with random structure have been shown to perform well in practice, using a more
sophisticated class subset selection method can be used to improve
classification accuracy. We investigate an approach to this problem called
random-pair selection, and evaluate its effectiveness compared to other
published methods of subset selection. We show that our method outperforms
other methods in many cases when forming ensembles of nested dichotomies, and
is at least on par in all other cases.

 <dc:description>  We study the stochastic optimization of canonical correlation analysis (CCA),
whose objective is nonconvex and does not decouple over training samples.
Although several stochastic gradient based optimization algorithms have been
recently proposed to solve this problem, no global convergence guarantee was
provided by any of them. Inspired by the alternating least squares/power
iterations formulation of CCA, and the shift-and-invert preconditioning method
for PCA, we propose two globally convergent meta-algorithms for CCA, both of
which transform the original problem into sequences of least squares problems
that need only be solved approximately. We instantiate the meta-algorithms with
state-of-the-art SGD methods and obtain time complexities that significantly
improve upon that of previous work. Experimental results demonstrate their
superior performance.

 <dc:title>When is Nontrivial Estimation Possible for Graphons and Stochastic Block

 <dc:description>  Block graphons (also called stochastic block models) are an important and
widely-studied class of models for random networks. We provide a lower bound on
the accuracy of estimators for block graphons with a large number of blocks. We
show that, given only the number $k$ of blocks and an upper bound $\rho$ on the
values (connection probabilities) of the graphon, every estimator incurs error
at least on the order of $\min(\rho, \sqrt{\rho k^2/n^2})$ in the $\delta_2$
metric with constant probability, in the worst case over graphons. In
particular, our bound rules out any nontrivial estimation (that is, with
$\delta_2$ error substantially less than $\rho$) when $k\geq n\sqrt{\rho}$.
Combined with previous upper and lower bounds, our results characterize, up to
logarithmic terms, the minimax accuracy of graphon estimation in the $\delta_2$
metric. A similar lower bound to ours was obtained independently by Klopp,
Tsybakov and Verzelen (2016).

 <dc:title>A Single-Letter Upper Bound on the Feedback Capacity of Unifilar
  Finite-State Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  An upper bound on the feedback capacity of unifilar finite-state channels
(FSCs) is derived. A new technique, called the $Q$-contexts, is based on a
construction of a directed graph that is used to quantize recursively the
receiver's output sequences to a finite set of contexts. For any choice of
$Q$-graph, the feedback capacity is bounded by a single-letter expression,
$C_\text{fb}\leq \sup I(X,S;Y|Q)$, where the supremum is over $P_{X|S,Q}$ and
the distribution of $(S,Q)$ is their stationary distribution. It is shown that
the bound is tight for all unifilar FSCs where feedback capacity is known:
channels where the state is a function of the outputs, the trapdoor channel,
Ising channels, the no-consecutive-ones input-constrained erasure channel and
for the memoryless channel. Its efficiency is also demonstrated by deriving a
new capacity result for the dicode erasure channel (DEC); the upper bound is
obtained directly from the above expression and its tightness is concluded with
a general sufficient condition on the optimality of the upper bound. This
sufficient condition is based on a fixed point principle of the BCJR equation
and, indeed, formulated as a simple lower bound on feedback capacity of
unifilar FSCs for arbitrary $Q$-graphs. This upper bound indicates that a
single-letter expression might exist for the capacity of finite-state channels
with or without feedback based on a construction of auxiliary random variable
with specified structure, such as $Q$-graph, and not with i.i.d distribution.
The upper bound also serves as a non-trivial bound on the capacity of channels
without feedback, a problem that is still open.

 <dc:description>  Projective analysis is an important solution for 3D shape retrieval, since
human visual perceptions of 3D shapes rely on various 2D observations from
different view points. Although multiple informative and discriminative views
are utilized, most projection-based retrieval systems suffer from heavy
computational cost, thus cannot satisfy the basic requirement of scalability
for search engines. In this paper, we present a real-time 3D shape search
engine based on the projective images of 3D shapes. The real-time property of
our search engine results from the following aspects: (1) efficient projection
and view feature extraction using GPU acceleration; (2) the first inverted
file, referred as F-IF, is utilized to speed up the procedure of multi-view
matching; (3) the second inverted file (S-IF), which captures a local
distribution of 3D shapes in the feature manifold, is adopted for efficient
context-based re-ranking. As a result, for each query the retrieval task can be
finished within one second despite the necessary cost of IO overhead. We name
the proposed 3D shape search engine, which combines GPU acceleration and
Inverted File Twice, as GIFT. Besides its high efficiency, GIFT also
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in retrieval accuracy on
various shape benchmarks and competitions.

 <dc:title>Robust MRAC augmentation of flight control laws for center of gravity
  adaptation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Simon, Daniel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When an aircraft is flying and burning fuel the center of gravity (c.g.) of
the aircraft shifts slowly. The c.g. can also be shifted abruptly when e.g. a
fighter aircraft releases a weapon. The shift in c.g. is difficult to measure
or estimate so the flight control systems need to be robustly designed to cope
with this variation. However for fighter aircrafts with high manoeuvrability
there is room for improvements. In this project we investigate if the use of
adaptive control law augmentation can be used to better cope with the change in
c.g. We augment a baseline controller with a robust Model Reference Adaptive
Control (MRAC) design and analyse its benefits and possible issues.

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic image registration methods estimate the posterior distribution
of transformation. The conventional way of interpreting the transformation
posterior is to use the mode as the most likely transformation and assign its
corresponding intensity to the registered voxel. Meanwhile, summary statistics
of the posterior are employed to evaluate the registration uncertainty, that is
the trustworthiness of the registered image. Despite the wide acceptance, this
convention has never been justified. In this paper, based on illustrative
examples, we question the correctness and usefulness of conventional methods.
In order to faithfully translate the transformation posterior, we propose to
encode the variability of values into a novel data type called ensemble fields.
Ensemble fields can serve as a complement to the registered image and a
foundation for developing advanced methods to characterize the uncertainty in
registration-based tasks. We demonstrate the potential of ensemble fields by
pilot examples

 <dc:description>  We investigate the performance characteristics of a numerically enhanced
scalar product (dot) kernel loop that uses the Kahan algorithm to compensate
for numerical errors, and describe efficient SIMD-vectorized implementations on
recent multi- and manycore processors. Using low-level instruction analysis and
the execution-cache-memory (ECM) performance model we pinpoint the relevant
performance bottlenecks for single-core and thread-parallel execution, and
predict performance and saturation behavior. We show that the Kahan-enhanced
scalar product comes at almost no additional cost compared to the naive
(non-Kahan) scalar product if appropriate low-level optimizations, notably SIMD
vectorization and unrolling, are applied. The ECM model is extended
appropriately to accommodate not only modern Intel multicore chips but also the
Intel Xeon Phi &quot;Knights Corner&quot; coprocessor and an IBM POWER8 CPU. This allows
us to discuss the impact of processor features on the performance across four
modern architectures that are relevant for high performance computing.

 <dc:description>  Scene text recognition plays an important role in many computer vision
applications. The small size of available public available scene text datasets
is the main challenge when training a text recognition CNN model. In this
paper, we propose a CNN based Chinese text recognition algorithm. To enlarge
the dataset for training the CNN model, we design a synthetic data engine for
Chinese scene character generation, which generates representative character
images according to the fonts use frequency of Chinese texts. As the Chinese
text is more complex, the English text recognition CNN architecture is modified
for Chinese text. To ensure the small size nature character dataset and the
large size artificial character dataset are comparable in training, the CNN
model are trained progressively. The proposed Chinese text recognition
algorithm is evaluated with two Chinese text datasets. The algorithm achieves
better recognize accuracy compared to the baseline methods.

 <dc:description>  Candidate text region extraction plays a critical role in convolutional
neural network (CNN) based text detection from natural images. In this paper,
we propose a CNN based scene text detection algorithm with a new text region
extractor. The so called candidate text region extractor I-MSER is based on
Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER), which can improve the independency and
completeness of the extracted candidate text regions. Design of I-MSER is
motivated by the observation that text MSERs have high similarity and are close
to each other. The independency of candidate text regions obtained by I-MSER is
guaranteed by selecting the most representative regions from a MSER tree which
is generated according to the spatial overlapping relationship among the MSERs.
A multi-layer CNN model is trained to score the confidence value of the
extracted regions extracted by the I-MSER for text detection. The new text
detection algorithm based on I-MSER is evaluated with wide-used ICDAR 2011 and
2013 datasets and shows improved detection performance compared to the existing
algorithms.

Nevertheless, as traditional neural network utilizes maximum likelihood
estimation for parameter optimization, it essentially constrains the expected
training objective within word level rather than sentence level. Moreover, the
performance of model prediction significantly relies on training data
distribution. To overcome these drawbacks, we employ minimum risk training
strategy in this paper, which directly optimizes model parameters in sentence
level with respect to evaluation metrics and leads to significant improvements
for headline generation. Experiment results show that our models outperforms
state-of-the-art systems on both English and Chinese headline generation tasks.

 <dc:description>  We generalize the transfinite triangular interpolant of (Nielson, 1987) in
order to generate visually smooth (not necessarily polynomial) local
interpolating quasi-optimal triangular spline surfaces. Given as input a
triangular mesh stored in a half-edge data structure, at first we produce a
local interpolating network of curves by optimizing quadratic energy
functionals described along the arcs as weighted combinations of squared length
variations of first and higher order derivatives, then by optimizing weighted
combinations of first and higher order quadratic thin-plate-spline-like
energies we locally interpolate each curvilinear face of the previous curve
network with triangular patches that are usually only $C^0$ continuous along
their common boundaries. In a following step, these local interpolating optimal
triangular surface patches are used to construct quasi-optimal continuous
vector fields of averaged unit normals along the joints, and finally we extend
the $G^1$ continuous transfinite triangular interpolation scheme of (Nielson,
1987) by imposing further optimality constraints concerning the isoparametric
lines of those groups of three side-vertex interpolants that have to be
convexly blended in order to generate the final visually smooth local
interpolating quasi-optimal triangular spline surface. While we describe the
problem in a general context, we present examples in special polynomial,
trigonometric, hyperbolic and algebraic-trigonometric vector spaces of
functions that may be useful both in computer-aided geometric design and in
computer graphics.

 <dc:title>Efficient Multi-Point Local Decoding of Reed-Muller Codes via
  Interleaved Codex</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Reed-Muller codes are among the most important classes of locally correctable
codes. Currently local decoding of Reed-Muller codes is based on decoding on
lines or quadratic curves to recover one single coordinate. To recover multiple
coordinates simultaneously, the naive way is to repeat the local decoding for
recovery of a single coordinate. This decoding algorithm might be more
expensive, i.e., require higher query complexity. In this paper, we focus on
Reed-Muller codes with usual parameter regime, namely, the total degree of
evaluation polynomials is $d=\Theta({q})$, where $q$ is the code alphabet size
(in fact, $d$ can be as big as $q/4$ in our setting). By introducing a novel
variation of codex, i.e., interleaved codex (the concept of codex has been used
for arithmetic secret sharing \cite{C11,CCX12}), we are able to locally recover
arbitrarily large number $k$ of coordinates of a Reed-Muller code
simultaneously at the cost of querying $O(q^2k)$ coordinates. It turns out that
our local decoding of Reed-Muller codes shows ({\it perhaps surprisingly}) that
accessing $k$ locations is in fact cheaper than repeating the procedure for
accessing a single location for $k$ times. Precisely speaking, to get the same
success probability from repetition of local decoding for recovery of a single
coordinate, one has to query $O(qk^2)$ coordinates. Thus, the query complexity
of our local decoding is smaller for $k=\Omega(q)$. In addition, our local
decoding decoding is efficient, i.e., the decoding complexity is $\poly(k,q)$.
Construction of an interleaved codex is based on concatenation of a codex with
a multiplication friendly pair, while the main tool to realize codex is based
on algebraic function fields (or more precisely, algebraic geometry codes).

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of geometric scene parsing, i.e.
simultaneously labeling geometric surfaces (e.g. sky, ground and vertical
plane) and determining the interaction relations (e.g. layering, supporting,
siding and affinity) between main regions. This problem is more challenging
than the traditional semantic scene labeling, as recovering geometric
structures necessarily requires the rich and diverse contextual information. To
achieve these goals, we propose a novel recurrent neural network model, named
Hierarchical Long Short-Term Memory (H-LSTM). It contains two coupled
sub-networks: the Pixel LSTM (P-LSTM) and the Multi-scale Super-pixel LSTM
(MS-LSTM) for handling the surface labeling and relation prediction,
respectively. The two sub-networks provide complementary information to each
other to exploit hierarchical scene contexts, and they are jointly optimized
for boosting the performance. Our extensive experiments show that our model is
capable of parsing scene geometric structures and outperforming several
state-of-the-art methods by large margins. In addition, we show promising 3D
reconstruction results from the still images based on the geometric parsing.

 <dc:title>The Complexity of Synchronizing Markov Decision Processes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider Markov decision processes (MDP) as generators of sequences of
probability distributions over states. A probability distribution is
p-synchronizing if the probability mass is at least p in a single state, or in
a given set of states. We consider four temporal synchronizing modes: a
sequence of probability distributions is always p-synchronizing, eventually
p-synchronizing, weakly p-synchronizing, or strongly p-synchronizing if,
respectively, all, some, infinitely many, or all but finitely many
distributions in the sequence are p-synchronizing.
  For each synchronizing mode, an MDP can be (i) sure winning if there is a
strategy that produces a 1-synchronizing sequence; (ii) almost-sure winning if
there is a strategy that produces a sequence that is, for all epsilon &gt; 0, a
(1-epsilon)-synchronizing sequence; (iii) limit-sure winning if for all epsilon
&gt; 0, there is a strategy that produces a (1-epsilon)-synchronizing sequence.
  We provide fundamental results on the expressiveness, decidability, and
complexity of synchronizing properties for MDPs. For each synchronizing mode,
we consider the problem of deciding whether an MDP is sure, almost-sure, or
limit-sure winning, and we establish matching upper and lower complexity bounds
of the problems: for all winning modes, we show that the problems are
PSPACE-complete for eventually and weakly synchronizing, and PTIME-complete for
always and strongly synchronizing. We establish the memory requirement for
winning strategies, and we show that all winning modes coincide for always
synchronizing, and that the almost-sure and limit-sure winning modes coincide
for weakly and strongly synchronizing.

 <dc:description>  As recurrent neural networks become larger and deeper, training times for
single networks are rising into weeks or even months. As such there is a
significant incentive to improve the performance and scalability of these
networks. While GPUs have become the hardware of choice for training and
deploying recurrent models, the implementations employed often make use of only
basic optimizations for these architectures. In this article we demonstrate
that by exposing parallelism between operations within the network, an order of
magnitude speedup across a range of network sizes can be achieved over a naive
implementation. We describe three stages of optimization that have been
incorporated into the fifth release of NVIDIA's cuDNN: firstly optimizing a
single cell, secondly a single layer, and thirdly the entire network.

 <dc:description>  Demand response is widely employed by today's data centers to reduce energy
consumption in response to the increasing of electricity cost. To incentivize
users of data centers participate in the demand response programs, i.e.,
breaking the &quot;split incentive&quot; hurdle, some prior researches propose
market-based mechanisms such as dynamic pricing and static monetary rewards.
However, these mechanisms are either intrusive or unfair. In this paper, we use
time-varying rewards to incentivize users, who have flexible deadlines and are
willing to trading performance degradation for monetary rewards, grant
time-shifting of their requests. With a game-theoretic framework, we model the
game between a single data center and its users. Further, we extend our design
via integrating it with two other emerging practical demand response
strategies: server shutdown and local renewable energy generation. With
real-world data traces, we show that a DC with our design can effectively shed
its peak electricity load and overall electricity cost without reducing its
profit, when comparing it with the current practice where no incentive
mechanism is established.

 <dc:description>  Methods from convex optimization are widely used as building blocks for deep
learning algorithms. However, the reasons for their empirical success are
unclear, since modern convolutional networks (convnets), incorporating
rectifier units and max-pooling, are neither smooth nor convex. Standard
guarantees therefore do not apply. This paper provides the first convergence
rates for gradient descent on rectifier convnets. The proof utilizes the
particular structure of rectifier networks which consists in binary
active/inactive gates applied on top of an underlying linear network. The
approach generalizes to max-pooling, dropout and maxout. In other words, to
precisely the neural networks that perform best empirically. The key step is to
introduce gated games, an extension of convex games with similar convergence
properties that capture the gating function of rectifiers. The main result is
that rectifier convnets converge to a critical point at a rate controlled by
the gated-regret of the units in the network. Corollaries of the main result
include: (i) a game-theoretic description of the representations learned by a
neural network; (ii) a logarithmic-regret algorithm for training neural nets;
and (iii) a formal setting for analyzing conditional computation in neural nets
that can be applied to recently developed models of attention.

equivalent descriptions for toric difference varieties are presented in terms
of difference rational parametrization, difference coordinate rings, toric

toric difference varieties and affine N[x]-semimodules are established by
proving the correspondence between the irreducible invariant difference
subvarieties and the faces of the N[x]-submodules and the orbit-face
correspondence. Finally, an algorithm is given to decide whether a binomial
difference ideal represented by a Z[x]-lattice defines a toric difference
variety.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Non-photorealistic rendering techniques work on image features and often
manipulate a set of characteristics such as edges and texture to achieve a
desired depiction of the scene. Most computational photography methods
decompose an image using edge preserving filters and work on the resulting base
and detail layers independently to achieve desired visual effects. We propose a
new approach for content-aware non-photorealistic rendering of images where we
manipulate the visually salient and the non-salient regions separately. We
propose a novel content-aware framework in order to render an image for
applications such as detail exaggeration, artificial blurring and image
abstraction. The processed regions of the image are blended seamlessly for all
these applications. We demonstrate that content awareness of the proposed
method leads to automatic generation of non-photorealistic rendering of the
same image for the different applications mentioned above.

 <dc:description>  Transfer Entropy and Directed Information are information-theoretic measures
of the directional dependency between stochastic processes. Following the
definitions of Schreiber and Massey in discrete time, we define and evaluate
these measures for the components of multidimensional Gaussian diffusion
processes. When the components are jointly Markov, the Transfer Entropy and
Directed Information are both measures of influence according to a simple
physical principle. More generally, the effect of other components has to be
accounted for, and this can be achieved in more than one way. We propose two
definitions, one of which preserves the properties of influence of the jointly
Markov case. The Transfer Entropy and Directed Information are expressed in
terms of the solutions of matrix Riccati equations, and so are easy to compute.
The definition of continuous-time Directed Information we propose differs from
that previously appearing in the literature. We argue that the latter is not
strictly directional.

 <dc:creator>Dobzinski, Shahar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We characterize the communication complexity of truthful mechanisms. Our
departure point is the well known taxation principle. The taxation principle
asserts that every truthful mechanism can be interpreted as follows: every
player is presented with a menu that consists of a price for each bundle (the
prices depend only on the valuations of the other players). Each player is
allocated a bundle that maximizes his profit according to this menu. We define
the taxation complexity of a truthful mechanism to be the logarithm of the
maximum number of menus that may be presented to a player.
  Our main finding is that in general the taxation complexity essentially
equals the communication complexity. The proof consists of two main steps.
First, we prove that for rich enough domains the taxation complexity is at most
the communication complexity. We then show that the taxation complexity is much
smaller than the communication complexity only in &quot;pathological&quot; cases and
provide a formal description of these extreme cases.
  Next, we study mechanisms that access the valuations via value queries only.
In this setting we establish that the menu complexity -- a notion that was
already studied in several different contexts -- characterizes the number of
value queries that the mechanism makes in exactly the same way that the
taxation complexity characterizes the communication complexity.
  Our approach yields several applications, including strengthening the
solution concept with low communication overhead, fast computation of prices,
and hardness of approximation by computationally efficient truthful mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  Convex relaxations of nonconvex multilabel problems have been demonstrated to
produce superior (provably optimal or near-optimal) solutions to a variety of
classical computer vision problems. Yet, they are of limited practical use as
they require a fine discretization of the label space, entailing a huge demand
in memory and runtime. In this work, we propose the first sublabel accurate
convex relaxation for vectorial multilabel problems. The key idea is that we
approximate the dataterm of the vectorial labeling problem in a piecewise
convex (rather than piecewise linear) manner. As a result we have a more
faithful approximation of the original cost function that provides a meaningful
interpretation for the fractional solutions of the relaxed convex problem. In
numerous experiments on large-displacement optical flow estimation and on color
image denoising we demonstrate that the computed solutions have superior
quality while requiring much lower memory and runtime.

 <dc:description>  In this note, analysis of time delay systems using Lambert W function
approach is reassessed. A common canonical form of time delay systems is
defined. We extended the recent results of [6] for second order into nth order
system. The eigenvalues of a time delay system are either real or complex
conjugate pairs and therefore, the whole eigenspectrum can be associated with
only two real branches of the Lambert W function. A new class of time delay
systems is characterized to extend the applicability of the above said method.
A state variable transformation is used to transform the proposed class of
systems into the common canonical form. Moreover, this approach has been
exploited to design a controller which places a subset of eigenvalues at
desired locations. Stability is analyesed by the help of Nyquist plot. The
approach is validated through an example.

 <dc:description>  Many different approaches for estimating the Interaction Quality (IQ) of
Spoken Dialogue Systems have been investigated. While dialogues clearly have a
sequential nature, statistical classification approaches designed for
sequential problems do not seem to work better on automatic IQ estimation than
static approaches, i.e., regarding each turn as being independent of the
corresponding dialogue. Hence, we analyse this effect by investigating the
subset of temporal features used as input for statistical classification of IQ.
We extend the set of temporal features to contain the system and the user view.
We determine the contribution of each feature sub-group showing that temporal
features contribute most to the classification performance. Furthermore, for
the feature sub-group modeling the temporal effects with a window, we modify
the window size increasing the overall performance significantly by +15.69%.

 <dc:title>Practical Subtyping for System F with Sized (Co-)Induction</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We present a rich type system with subtyping for an extension of System F.
Our type constructors include sum and product types, universal and existential
quantifiers, inductive and coinductive types. The latter two size annotations
allowing the preservation of size invariants. For example it is possible to
derive the termination of the quicksort by showing that partitioning a list
does not increase its size. The system deals with complex programs involving
mixed induction and coinduction, or even mixed (co-)induction and polymorphism
(as for Scott-encoded datatypes). One of the key ideas is to completely
separate the induction on sizes from the notion of recursive programs. We use
the size change principle to check that the proof is well-founded, not that the
program terminates. Termination is obtained by a strong normalization proof.
Another key idea is the use symbolic witnesses to handle quantifiers of all
sorts. To demonstrate the practicality of our system, we provide an
implementation that accepts all the examples discussed in the paper and much
more.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We study online optimization of smoothed piecewise constant functions over
the domain [0, 1). This is motivated by the problem of adaptively picking
parameters of learning algorithms as in the recently introduced framework by
Gupta and Roughgarden (2016). Majority of the machine learning literature has
focused on Lipschitz-continuous functions or functions with bounded gradients.
1 This is with good reason---any learning algorithm suffers linear regret even
against piecewise constant functions that are chosen adversarially, arguably
the simplest of non-Lipschitz continuous functions. The smoothed setting we
consider is inspired by the seminal work of Spielman and Teng (2004) and the
recent work of Gupta and Roughgarden---in this setting, the sequence of
functions may be chosen by an adversary, however, with some uncertainty in the
location of discontinuities. We give algorithms that achieve sublinear regret
in the full information and bandit settings.

 <dc:description>  Distant pointing is still not efficient, accurate or flexible enough for many
applications, although many researchers have focused on it. To improve upon
distant pointing, we propose MPP3D, which is especially suitable for
high-resolution displays. MPP3D uses two dimensions of hand positioning to move
a pointer, and it also uses the third dimension to adjust the precision of the
movement. Based on the idea of MPP3D, we propose four techniques which combine
two ways of mapping and two techniques for precision adjustment. We further
provide three types of mapping scheme and visual feedback for each technique.
The potential of the proposed techniques was investigated through
experimentation. The results show that these techniques were competent for
usual computer operations with a cursor, and the adjustment for pointing
precision was beneficial for both pointing efficiency and accuracy.

 <dc:description>  The emergence of &quot;big data&quot; offers unprecedented opportunities for not only
accelerating scientific advances but also enabling new modes of discovery.
Scientific progress in many disciplines is increasingly enabled by our ability
to examine natural phenomena through the computational lens, i.e., using
algorithmic or information processing abstractions of the underlying processes;
and our ability to acquire, share, integrate and analyze disparate types of
data. However, there is a huge gap between our ability to acquire, store, and
process data and our ability to make effective use of the data to advance
discovery. Despite successful automation of routine aspects of data management
and analytics, most elements of the scientific process currently require
considerable human expertise and effort. Accelerating science to keep pace with
the rate of data acquisition and data processing calls for the development of
algorithmic or information processing abstractions, coupled with formal methods
and tools for modeling and simulation of natural processes as well as major
innovations in cognitive tools for scientists, i.e., computational tools that
leverage and extend the reach of human intellect, and partner with humans on a
broad range of tasks in scientific discovery (e.g., identifying, prioritizing
formulating questions, designing, prioritizing and executing experiments
designed to answer a chosen question, drawing inferences and evaluating the
results, and formulating new questions, in a closed-loop fashion). This calls
for concerted research agenda aimed at: Development, analysis, integration,
sharing, and simulation of algorithmic or information processing abstractions
of natural processes, coupled with formal methods and tools for their analyses
and simulation; Innovations in cognitive tools that augment and extend human
intellect and partner with humans in all aspects of science.

 <dc:description>  We consider a piecewise-deterministic queueing (PDQ) model to study traffic
queues due to stochastic capacity fluctuations in transportation facilities.
The saturation rate (capacity) of the PDQ model switches between a finite set
of values (modes) according to a Markov chain. The inflow to the PDQ is
controlled by a state-feedback policy. The main results of this article are
stability conditions of PDQs, i.e. conditions under which the distribution of
the queue length converges to a unique invariant probability measure. On one
hand, a necessary condition for stability is that the average inflow does not
exceed the average saturation rate. On the other hand, based on the
Foster-Lyapunov criteria, we derive a sufficient condition that requires a
bilinear matrix inequality to admit positive solutions and the invariant
probability measure to be unique. We also study the rate of convergence for
stable PDQs. Furthermore, for PDQs with two modes, a necessary and sufficient
condition for stability is available. In addition, we present examples for the
stability analysis of feedback control policies for single PDQs as well as a
network of two PDQ links in parallel.

 <dc:description>  Aiming at applications to the scientific visualization of three dimensional
simulations with time evolution, a keyboard based control method to specify
rotations in four dimensions is proposed. It is known that four dimensional
rotations are generally so-called double rotations, and a double rotation is a
combination of simultaneously applied two simple rotations. The proposed method
can specify both the simple and double rotations by single key typings of the
keyboard. The method is tested in visualizations of a regular pentachoron in
four dimensional space by a hyperplane slicing.

 <dc:description>  The study of networks plays a crucial role in investigating the structure,
dynamics, and function of a wide variety of complex systems in myriad
disciplines. Despite the success of traditional network analysis, standard
networks provide a limited representation of complex systems, which often
include different types of relationships (i.e., &quot;multiplexity&quot;) among their
constituent components and/or multiple interacting subsystems. Such structural
complexity has a significant effect on both dynamics and function. Throwing
away or aggregating available structural information can generate misleading
results and be a major obstacle towards attempts to understand complex systems.
  The recent &quot;multilayer&quot; approach for modeling networked systems explicitly
allows the incorporation of multiplexity and other features of realistic
systems. On one hand, it allows one to couple different structural
relationships by encoding them in a convenient mathematical object. On the
other hand, it also allows one to couple different dynamical processes on top
of such interconnected structures. The resulting framework plays a crucial role
in helping achieve a thorough, accurate understanding of complex systems. The
study of multilayer networks has also revealed new physical phenomena that
remain hidden when using ordinary graphs, the traditional network
representation. Here we survey progress towards attaining a deeper
understanding of spreading processes on multilayer networks, and we highlight
some of the physical phenomena related to spreading processes that emerge from
multilayer structure.

 <dc:description>  Topic models have emerged as fundamental tools in unsupervised machine
learning. Most modern topic modeling algorithms take a probabilistic view and
derive inference algorithms based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or its
variants. In contrast, we study topic modeling as a combinatorial optimization
problem, and propose a new objective function derived from LDA by passing to
the small-variance limit. We minimize the derived objective by using ideas from
combinatorial optimization, which results in a new, fast, and high-quality
topic modeling algorithm. In particular, we show that our results are
competitive with popular LDA-based topic modeling approaches, and also discuss
the (dis)similarities between our approach and its probabilistic counterparts.

 <dc:description>  Today's cities face many challenges due to population growth, aging
population, pedestrian and vehicular traffic congestion, water usage increase,
increased electricity demands, crumbling physical infrastructure of buildings,
roads, water sewage, power grid, and declining health care services. Moreover,
major trends indicate the global urbanization of society, and the associated
pressures it brings, will continue to accelerate. One of the approaches to
assist in solving some of the challenges is to deploy extensive IT technology.
It has been recognized that cyber-technology plays a key role in improving
quality of people's lives, strengthening business and helping government
agencies serve citizens better. In this white paper, we discuss the benefits
and challenges of cyber-technologies within &quot;Smart Cities&quot;, especially the IoT
(Internet of Things) for smart communities, which means considering the
benefits and challenges of IoT cyber-technologies on smart cities physical
infrastructures and their human stakeholders. To point out the IoT challenges,
we will first present the framework within which IoT lives, and then proceed
with the challenges, conclusions and recommendations.

 <dc:description>  Image recognition is the need of the hour. In order to be able to recognize
an image, it is of immense importance that the image should be distinguishable
from the background. In the present work, an approach is presented for
automatic detection and recognition of regular 2D shapes in low noise
environments. The work has a large number of direct applications in the real
world. The algorithm proposed is based on locating the edges and thus, in turn
calculating the area of the object helps in identification of a specified
shape. The results were simulated using MATLAB tool are encouraging and
validate the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel appearance-based approach for pose estimation of a human
hand using the point clouds provided by the low-cost Microsoft Kinect sensor.
Both the free-hand case, in which the hand is isolated from the surrounding
environment, and the hand-object case, in which the different types of
interactions are classified, have been considered. The hand-object case is
clearly the most challenging task having to deal with multiple tracks. The
approach proposed here belongs to the class of partial pose estimation where
the estimated pose in a frame is used for the initialization of the next one.
The pose estimation is obtained by applying a modified version of the Iterative
Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to synthetic models to obtain the rigid
transformation that aligns each model with respect to the input data. The
proposed framework uses a &quot;pure&quot; point cloud as provided by the Kinect sensor
without any other information such as RGB values or normal vector components.
For this reason, the proposed method can also be applied to data obtained from
other types of depth sensor, or RGB-D camera.

 <dc:description>  Lossy compression algorithms take advantage of the inherent limitations of
the human eye and discard information that cannot be seen. In the present
paper, a technique termed as Lossy Data Compression using Logarithm (LDCL) is
proposed to compress incoming binary data in the form of a resultant matrix
containing the logarithmic values of different chosen numeric sets. The
proposed method is able to achieve compression ratio up to 60 in many major
cases.

 <dc:description>  We propose Sentence Level Recurrent Topic Model (SLRTM), a new topic model
that assumes the generation of each word within a sentence to depend on both
the topic of the sentence and the whole history of its preceding words in the
sentence. Different from conventional topic models that largely ignore the
sequential order of words or their topic coherence, SLRTM gives full
characterization to them by using a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based
framework. Experimental results have shown that SLRTM outperforms several
strong baselines on various tasks. Furthermore, SLRTM can automatically
generate sentences given a topic (i.e., topics to sentences), which is a key
technology for real world applications such as personalized short text
conversation.

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the analysis of correlation between two
high-dimensional data sets when there are only few correlated signal components
but the number of samples is very small, possibly much smaller than the
dimensions of the data. In such a scenario, a principal component analysis
(PCA) rank-reduction preprocessing step is commonly performed before applying
canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We present simple, yet very effective
approaches to the joint model-order selection of the number of dimensions that
should be retained through the PCA step and the number of correlated signals.
These approaches are based on reduced-rank versions of the Bartlett-Lawley
hypothesis test and the minimum description length information-theoretic
criterion. Simulation results show that the techniques perform well for very
small sample sizes even in colored noise.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of generating interpretable recommendations by
identifying overlapping co-clusters of clients and products, based only on
positive or implicit feedback. Our approach is applicable on very large
datasets because it exhibits almost linear complexity in the input examples and
the number of co-clusters. We show, both on real industrial data and on
publicly available datasets, that the recommendation accuracy of our algorithm
is competitive to that of state-of-art matrix factorization techniques. In
addition, our technique has the advantage of offering recommendations that are
textually and visually interpretable. Finally, we examine how to implement our
technique efficiently on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).

 <dc:description>  Information-theoretic principles for learning and acting have been proposed
to solve particular classes of Markov Decision Problems. Mathematically, such
approaches are governed by a variational free energy principle and allow
solving MDP planning problems with information-processing constraints expressed
in terms of a Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to a reference
distribution. Here we consider a generalization of such MDP planners by taking
model uncertainty into account. As model uncertainty can also be formalized as
an information-processing constraint, we can derive a unified solution from a
single generalized variational principle. We provide a generalized value
iteration scheme together with a convergence proof. As limit cases, this
generalized scheme includes standard value iteration with a known model,
Bayesian MDP planning, and robust planning. We demonstrate the benefits of this
approach in a grid world simulation.

 <dc:description>  Recent investigations on the longitudinal and lateral control of wheeled
autonomous vehicles are reported. Flatness-based techniques are first
introduced via a simplified model. It depends on some physical parameters, like
cornering stiffness coefficients of the tires, friction coefficient of the
road, ..., which are notoriously difficult to identify. Then a model-free
control strategy, which exploits the flat outputs, is proposed. Those outputs
also depend on physical parameters which are poorly known, i.e., the vehicle
mass and inertia and the position of the center of gravity. A totally
model-free control law is therefore adopted. It employs natural output
variables, namely the longitudinal velocity and the lateral deviation of the
vehicle. This last method, which is easily understandable and implementable,
ensures a robust trajectory tracking problem in both longitudinal and lateral
dynamics. Several convincing computer simulations are displayed.

oscillatory neural networks for pattern recognition or restrict technical
realizations to small networks. We propose a new network architecture of
coupled oscillators for pattern recognition which shows none of the mentioned
aws. Furthermore we illustrate the recognition process with simulation results
and analyze the new dynamics analytically: Possible output patterns are
isolated attractors of the system. Additionally, simple criteria for
recognition success are derived from a lower bound on the basins of attraction.

 <dc:description>  A new, comprehensive approach to inhabitation problems in simply-typed
lambda-calculus is shown, dealing with both decision and counting problems.
This approach works by exploiting a representation of the search space
generated by a given inhabitation problem, which is in terms of a
lambda-calculus for proof search that the authors developed recently. The
representation may be seen as extending the Curry-Howard representation of
proofs by lambda-terms, staying within the methods of lambda-calculus and type
systems. Our methodology reveals inductive descriptions of the decision
problems, driven by the syntax of the proof-search expressions, and the end
products are simple, recursive decision procedures and counting functions.

 <dc:description>  We initiate the study of dynamic algorithms for graph sparsification problems
and obtain fully dynamic algorithms, allowing both edge insertions and edge
deletions, that take polylogarithmic time after each update in the graph. Our
three main results are as follows. First, we give a fully dynamic algorithm for
maintaining a $ (1 \pm \epsilon) $-spectral sparsifier with amortized update
time $poly(\log{n}, \epsilon^{-1})$. Second, we give a fully dynamic algorithm
for maintaining a $ (1 \pm \epsilon) $-cut sparsifier with \emph{worst-case}
update time $poly(\log{n}, \epsilon^{-1})$. Both sparsifiers have size $ n
\cdot poly(\log{n}, \epsilon^{-1})$. Third, we apply our dynamic sparsifier
algorithm to obtain a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining a $(1 +
\epsilon)$-approximation to the value of the maximum flow in an unweighted,
undirected, bipartite graph with amortized update time $poly(\log{n},
\epsilon^{-1})$.

 <dc:description>  Pathogens can spread epidemically through populations. Beneficial contagions,
such as viruses that enhance host survival or technological innovations that
improve quality of life, also have the potential to spread epidemically. How do
the dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics differ from those of
detrimental epidemics? We investigate this question using three theoretical
approaches. First, in the context of population genetics, we show that a
horizontally-transmissible element that increases fitness, such as viral DNA,
spreads superexponentially through a population, more quickly than a beneficial
mutation. Second, in the context of behavioral epidemiology, we show that
infections that cause increased connectivity lead to superexponential fixation
in the population. Third, in the context of dynamic social networks, we find
that preferences for increased global infection accelerate spread and produce
superexponential fixation, but preferences for local assortativity halt
epidemics by disconnecting the infected from the susceptible. We conclude that
the dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics are characterized by
the rapid spread of beneficial elements, which is facilitated in biological
systems by horizontal transmission and in social systems by active spreading
behavior of infected individuals.

 <dc:description>  Cumulative advantage (CA) refers to the notion that accumulated resources
foster the accumulation of further resources in competitions, a phenomenon that
has been empirically observed in various contexts. The oldest and arguably
simplest mathematical model that embodies this general principle is the P\'olya
urn process, which finds applications in a myriad of problems. The original
model captures the dynamics of competitions between two equally fit agents
under linear CA effects, which can be readily generalized to incorporate
different fitnesses and nonlinear CA effects. We study two statistics of
competitions under the generalized model, namely duration (i.e., time of the
last tie) and intensity (i.e., number of ties). We give rigorous mathematical
characterizations of the tail distributions of both duration and intensity
under the various regimes for fitness and nonlinearity, which reveal very
interesting behaviors. For example, fitness superiority induces much shorter
competitions in the sublinear regime while much longer competitions in the
superlinear regime. Our findings can shed light on the application of P\'olya
urn processes in more general contexts where fitness and nonlinearity may be
present.

 <dc:description>  Mutual exclusivity is a widely recognized property of many cancer drivers.
Knowledge about these relationships can provide important insights into cancer
drivers, cancer-driving pathways, and cancer subtypes. It can also be used to
predict new functional interactions between cancer driving genes and uncover
novel cancer drivers. Currently, most of mutual exclusivity analyses are
preformed focusing on a limited set of genes in part due to the computational
cost required to rigorously compute p-values. To reduce the computing cost and
perform less restricted mutual exclusivity analysis, we developed an efficient
method to estimate p-values while controlling the mutation rates of individual
patients and genes similar to the permutation test. A comprehensive mutual
exclusivity analysis allowed us to uncover mutually exclusive pairs, some of
which may have relatively low mutation rates. These pairs often included likely
cancer drivers that have been missed in previous analyses. More importantly,
our results demonstrated that mutual exclusivity can also provide information
that goes beyond the interactions between cancer drivers and can, for example,
elucidate different mutagenic processes in different cancer groups. In
particular, including frequently mutated, long genes such as TTN in our
analysis allowed us to observe interesting patterns of APOBEC activity in
breast cancer and identify a set of related driver genes that are highly
predictive of patient survival. In addition, we utilized our mutual exclusivity
analysis in support of a previously proposed model where APOBEC activity is the
underlying process that causes TP53 mutations in a subset of breast cancer
cases.

 <dc:description>  Signals are generally modeled as a superposition of exponential functions in
spectroscopy of chemistry, biology and medical imaging. For fast data
acquisition or other inevitable reasons, however, only a small amount of
samples may be acquired and thus how to recover the full signal becomes an
active research topic. But existing approaches can not efficiently recover
$N$-dimensional exponential signals with $N\geq 3$. In this paper, we study the
problem of recovering N-dimensional (particularly $N\geq 3$) exponential
signals from partial observations, and formulate this problem as a low-rank
tensor completion problem with exponential factor vectors. The full signal is
reconstructed by simultaneously exploiting the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC structure and
the exponential structure of the associated factor vectors. The latter is
promoted by minimizing an objective function involving the nuclear norm of
Hankel matrices. Experimental results on simulated and real magnetic resonance
spectroscopy data show that the proposed approach can successfully recover full
signals from very limited samples and is robust to the estimated tensor rank.

 <dc:title>Cooperative Planning of Renewable Generations for Interconnected

 <dc:description>  We study the renewable energy generations in Hong Kong based on realistic
meteorological data, and find that different renewable sources exhibit diverse
time-varying and location-dependent profiles. To efficiently explore and
utilize the diverse renewable energy generations, we propose a theoretical
framework for the cooperative planning of renewable generations in a system of
interconnected microgrids. The cooperative framework considers the
self-interested behaviors of microgrids, and incorporates both their long-term
investment costs and short-term operational costs over the planning horizon.
Specifically, interconnected microgrids jointly decide where and how much to
deploy renewable energy generations, and how to split the associated investment
cost. We show that the cooperative framework minimizes the overall system cost.
We also design a fair cost sharing method based on Nash bargaining to
incentivize cooperative planning, such that all microgrids will benefit from
cooperative planning. Using realistic data obtained from the Hong Kong
observatory, we validate the cooperative planning framework, and demonstrate
that all microgrids benefit through the cooperation, and the overall system
cost is reduced by 35.9% compared to the noncooperative planning benchmark.

We prove that the inequality $I(f(X^n); g(Y^n)) \le I(X; Y)$ holds for any two

 <dc:description>  We present a shared memory implementation of a parallel algorithm, called
delta-stepping, for solving the single source shortest path problem for
directed and undirected graphs. In order to reduce synchronization costs we
make some deviations from the algorithm and discuss the consequences. We study
the behaviour of our implementation on small-world and scale-free graphs, and
graphs arising from game maps. We collect performance data on multi-core CPUs
and Intel Xeon Phi. When run in sequential mode, our implementation outperforms
the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm from Boost Graph Library on graphs
with a small diameter. Both on the CPU and the co-processor we achieve an
overall performance of at least 50% parallel efficiency.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a framework for studying the interactions of autonomous
system components and the design of the connectivity structure in Systems of
Systems (SoSs). This framework, which uses complex network models, is also used
to study the connectivity structure's impact on resource management. We discuss
resource sharing as a mechanism that adds a level of flexibility to distributed
systems and describe the connectivity structures that enhance components'
access to the resources available within the system. The framework introduced
in this paper explicitly incorporates costs of connection and the benefits that
are received by direct and indirect access to resources and provides measures
of the optimality of connectivity structures. We discuss central and a
distributed schemes that, respectively, represent systems in which a central
planner determines the connectivity structure and systems in which distributed
components are allowed to add and sever connections to improve their own
resource access. Furthermore, we identify optimal connectivity structures for
systems with various heterogeneity conditions.

 <dc:description>  Egocentric videos are characterised by their ability to have the first person
view. With the popularity of Google Glass and GoPro, use of egocentric videos
is on the rise. Recognizing action of the wearer from egocentric videos is an
important problem. Unstructured movement of the camera due to natural head
motion of the wearer causes sharp changes in the visual field of the egocentric
camera causing many standard third person action recognition techniques to
perform poorly on such videos. Objects present in the scene and hand gestures
of the wearer are the most important cues for first person action recognition
but are difficult to segment and recognize in an egocentric video. We propose a
novel representation of the first person actions derived from feature
trajectories. The features are simple to compute using standard point tracking
and does not assume segmentation of hand/objects or recognizing object or hand
pose unlike in many previous approaches. We train a bag of words classifier
with the proposed features and report a performance improvement of more than
11% on publicly available datasets. Although not designed for the particular
case, we show that our technique can also recognize wearer's actions when hands
or objects are not visible.

 <dc:description>  As autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles are deployed on the roads, they
will have to eventually start communicating with each other in order to achieve
increased efficiency and safety. Current approaches in the control of
collaborative vehicles primarily consider homogeneous simplified vehicle
dynamics and usually ignore any communication issues. This raises an important
question of how systems without the aforementioned limiting assumptions can be
modeled, analyzed and certified for safe operation by both industry and
governmental agencies. In this work, we propose a modeling framework where
communication and system reconfiguration is modeled through $\pi$-calculus
expressions while the closed-loop control systems are modeled through hybrid
automata. We demonstrate how the framework can be utilized for modeling and
simulation of platooning behaviors of heterogeneous vehicles.

 <dc:description>  This work is motivated by the needs of predictive analytics on healthcare
data as represented by Electronic Medical Records. Such data is invariably
problematic: noisy, with missing entries, with imbalance in classes of
interests, leading to serious bias in predictive modeling. Since standard data
mining methods often produce poor performance measures, we argue for
development of specialized techniques of data-preprocessing and classification.
In this paper, we propose a new method to simultaneously classify large
datasets and reduce the effects of missing values. It is based on a multilevel
framework of the cost-sensitive SVM and the expected maximization imputation
method for missing values, which relies on iterated regression analyses. We
compare classification results of multilevel SVM-based algorithms on public
benchmark datasets with imbalanced classes and missing values as well as real
data in health applications, and show that our multilevel SVM-based method
produces fast, and more accurate and robust classification results.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to simultaneously perform semantic segmentation and
prepositional phrase attachment resolution for captioned images. Some
ambiguities in language cannot be resolved without simultaneously reasoning
about an associated image. If we consider the sentence &quot;I shot an elephant in
my pajamas&quot;, looking at language alone (and not using common sense), it is
unclear if it is the person or the elephant wearing the pajamas or both. Our
approach produces a diverse set of plausible hypotheses for both semantic
segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution that are then
jointly reranked to select the most consistent pair. We show that our semantic
segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution modules have
complementary strengths, and that joint reasoning produces more accurate
results than any module operating in isolation. Multiple hypotheses are also
shown to be crucial to improved multiple-module reasoning. Our vision and
language approach significantly outperforms the Stanford Parser (De Marneffe et
al., 2006) by 17.91% (28.69% relative) and 12.83% (25.28% relative) in two
different experiments. We also make small improvements over DeepLab-CRF (Chen
et al., 2015).

 <dc:title>On Stochastic Belief Revision and Update and their Combination</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rens, Gavin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  I propose a framework for an agent to change its probabilistic beliefs when a
new piece of propositional information $\alpha$ is observed. Traditionally,
belief change occurs by either a revision process or by an update process,
depending on whether the agent is informed with $\alpha$ in a static world or,
respectively, whether $\alpha$ is a 'signal' from the environment due to an
event occurring. Boutilier suggested a unified model of qualitative belief
change, which &quot;combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more
realistic characterization of belief change.&quot; In this paper, I propose a
unified model of quantitative belief change, where an agent's beliefs are
represented as a probability distribution over possible worlds. As does
Boutilier, I take a dynamical systems perspective. The proposed approach is
evaluated against several rationality postulated, and some properties of the
approach are worked out.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cryptompress, a new 128-bit (initial) private-key cryptography algorithm is
proposed. It uses a block size of at least 30 bits and increments prior key
size to additional 32 bits on each unsuccessful attempt of any means, including
bruteforcing, further changing a specific portion of the cyphertext using the
reformed Feistel network. Encryption process results from a proposed
compression sequence developed using lookup table and shift operations followed
by key generation. Eventually, four matrixes named add-sub matrix, reduced
matrix, sequence matrix and term matrix are obtained which ultimately forms a
cyphertext.

 <dc:description>  The horizon line is an important contextual attribute for a wide variety of
image understanding tasks. As such, many methods have been proposed to estimate
its location from a single image. These methods typically require the image to
contain specific cues, such as vanishing points, coplanar circles, and regular
textures, thus limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce a large,
realistic evaluation dataset, Horizon Lines in the Wild (HLW), containing
natural images with labeled horizon lines. Using this dataset, we investigate
the application of convolutional neural networks for directly estimating the
horizon line, without requiring any explicit geometric constraints or other
special cues. An extensive evaluation shows that using our CNNs, either in
isolation or in conjunction with a previous geometric approach, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the challenging HLW dataset and two existing
benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for an agent to revise its incomplete probabilistic
beliefs when a new piece of propositional information is observed. In this
work, an agent's beliefs are represented by a set of probabilistic formulae --
a belief base. The method involves determining a representative set of
'boundary' probability distributions consistent with the current belief base,
revising each of these probability distributions and then translating the
revised information into a new belief base. We use a version of Lewis Imaging
as the revision operation. The correctness of the approach is proved. The
expressivity of the belief bases under consideration are rather restricted, but
has some applications. We also discuss methods of belief base revision
employing the notion of optimum entropy, and point out some of the benefits and
difficulties in those methods. Both the boundary distribution method and the
optimum entropy method are reasonable, yet yield different results.

 <dc:description>  The recent COCO object detection dataset presents several new challenges for
object detection. In particular, it contains objects at a broad range of
scales, less prototypical images, and requires more precise localization. To
address these challenges, we test three modifications to the standard Fast
R-CNN object detector: (1) skip connections that give the detector access to
features at multiple network layers, (2) a foveal structure to exploit object
context at multiple object resolutions, and (3) an integral loss function and
corresponding network adjustment that improve localization. The result of these
modifications is that information can flow along multiple paths in our network,
including through features from multiple network layers and from multiple
object views. We refer to our modified classifier as a &quot;MultiPath&quot; network. We
couple our MultiPath network with DeepMask object proposals, which are well
suited for localization and small objects, and adapt our pipeline to predict
segmentation masks in addition to bounding boxes. The combined system improves
results over the baseline Fast R-CNN detector with Selective Search by 66%
overall and by 4x on small objects. It placed second in both the COCO 2015
detection and segmentation challenges.

 <dc:description>  We propose an efficient numerical algorithm for the solution of diffeomorphic
image registration problems. We use an optimization formulation constrained by
a partial differential equation (PDE), where the constraints are a scalar
transport equation.
  We use a pseudospectral discretization in space and second-order accurate
semi-Lagrangian time stepping scheme for the transport PDE. We solve for a
stationary velocity field using a preconditioned, globalized, matrix-free
Newton-Krylov scheme. We propose and test a two-level Hessian preconditioner.
We consider two strategies for inverting the preconditioner on the coarse grid:
a nested preconditioned conjugate gradient method (exact solve) and a nested
Chebyshev iterative method (inexact solve) with a fixed number of iterations.
  We test the performance of our solver in different synthetic and real-world
two-dimensional application scenarios. We study grid convergence and
computational efficiency of our new scheme. We compare the performance of our
solver against our initial implementation that uses the same spatial
discretization but a standard, explicit, second-order Runge-Kutta scheme for
the numerical time integration of the transport equations and a single-level
preconditioner. Our improved scheme delivers significant speedups over our
original implementation. As a highlight, we observe a 20$\times$ speedup for a
two dimensional, real world multi-subject medical image registration problem.

 <dc:description>  Codes with various kinds of decipherability, weaker than the usual unique
decipherability, have been studied since multiset decipherability was
introduced in mid-1980s. We consider decipherability of directed figure codes,
where directed figures are defined as labelled polyominoes with designated
start and end points, equipped with catenation operation that may use a merging
function to resolve possible conflicts. This is one of possible extensions
generalizing words and variable-length codes to planar structures. Here,
verification whether a given set is a code is no longer decidable in general.
We study the decidability status of figure codes depending on catenation type
(with or without a merging function), decipherability kind (unique, multiset,
set or numeric) and code geometry (several classes determined by relative
positions of start and end points of figures). We give decidability or
undecidability proofs in all but two cases that remain open.

 <dc:description>  Smartphones' cameras, microphones, and device displays enable users to
capture and view memorable moments of their lives. However, adversaries can
trick users into authorizing malicious apps that exploit weaknesses in current
mobile platforms to misuse such on-board I/O devices to stealthily capture
photos, videos, and screen content without the users' consent. Contemporary
mobile operating systems fail to prevent such misuse of I/O devices by
authorized apps due to lack of binding between users' interactions and accesses
to I/O devices performed by these apps. In this paper, we propose Aware, a
security framework for authorizing app requests to perform operations using I/O
devices, which binds app requests with user intentions to make all uses of
certain I/O devices explicit. We evaluate our defense mechanisms through
laboratory-based experimentation and a user study, involving 74 human subjects,
whose ability to identify undesired operations targeting I/O devices increased
significantly. Without Aware, only 18% of the participants were able to
identify attacks from tested RAT apps. Aware systematically blocks all the
attacks in absence of user consent and supports users in identifying 82% of
social-engineering attacks tested to hijack approved requests, including some
more sophisticated forms of social engineering not yet present in available
RATs. Aware introduces only 4.79% maximum performance overhead over operations
targeting I/O devices. Aware shows that a combination of system defenses and
user interface can significantly strengthen defenses for controlling the use of
on-board I/O devices.

 <dc:description>  The recently proposed generalized epidemic modeling framework (GEMF)
\cite{sahneh2013generalized} lays the groundwork for systematically
constructing a broad spectrum of stochastic spreading processes over complex
networks. This article builds an algorithm for exact, continuous-time numerical
simulation of GEMF-based processes. Moreover the implementation of this
algorithm, GEMFsim, is available in popular scientific programming platforms
such as MATLAB, R, Python, and C; GEMFsim facilitates simulating stochastic
spreading models that fit in GEMF framework. Using these simulations one can
examine the accuracy of mean-field-type approximations that are commonly used
for analytical study of spreading processes on complex networks.

 <dc:description>  The SDN and NFV paradigms enable novel network services which can be realized
and embedded in a flexible and rapid manner. For example, SDN can be used to
flexibly steer traffic from a source to a destination through a sequence of
virtualized middleboxes, in order to realize so-called service chains. The
service chain embedding problem consists of three tasks: admission control,
finding suitable locations to allocate the virtualized middleboxes and
computing corresponding routing paths. This paper considers the offline batch
embedding of multiple service chains. Concretely, we consider the objectives of
maximizing the profit by embedding an optimal subset of requests or minimizing
the costs when all requests need to be embedded. Interestingly, while the
service chain embedding problem has recently received much attention, so far,
only non- polynomial time algorithms (based on integer programming) as well as
heuristics (which do not provide any formal guarantees) are known. This paper
presents the first polynomial time service chain approximation algorithms both
for the case with admission and without admission control. Our algorithm is
based on a novel extension of the classic linear programming and randomized
rounding technique, which may be of independent interest. In particular, we
show that our approach can also be extended to more complex service graphs,
containing cycles or sub-chains, hence also providing new insights into the
classic virtual network embedding problem.

 <dc:description>  We present the largest kinship recognition dataset to date, Families in the
Wild (FIW). Motivated by the lack of a single, unified dataset for kinship
recognition, we aim to provide a dataset that captivates the interest of the
research community. With only a small team, we were able to collect, organize,
and label over 10,000 family photos of 1,000 families with our annotation tool
designed to mark complex hierarchical relationships and local label information
in a quick and efficient manner. We include several benchmarks for two
image-based tasks, kinship verification and family recognition. For this, we
incorporate several visual features and metric learning methods as baselines.
Also, we demonstrate that a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as
an off-the-shelf feature extractor outperforms the other feature types. Then,
results were further boosted by fine-tuning two deep CNNs on FIW data: (1) for

 <dc:description>  Motivated by applications in computer vision and databases, we introduce and
study the Simultaneous Nearest Neighbor Search (SNN) problem. Given a set of
data points, the goal of SNN is to design a data structure that, given a
collection of queries, finds a collection of close points that are compatible
with each other. Formally, we are given $k$ query points $Q=q_1,\cdots,q_k$,
and a compatibility graph $G$ with vertices in $Q$, and the goal is to return
data points $p_1,\cdots,p_k$ that minimize (i) the weighted sum of the
distances from $q_i$ to $p_i$ and (ii) the weighted sum, over all edges $(i,j)$
in the compatibility graph $G$, of the distances between $p_i$ and $p_j$. The
problem has several applications, where one wants to return a set of consistent
answers to multiple related queries. This generalizes well-studied
computational problems, including NN, Aggregate NN and the 0-extension problem.
  In this paper we propose and analyze the following general two-step method
for designing efficient data structures for SNN. In the first step, for each
query point $q_i$ we find its (approximate) nearest neighbor point $\hat{p}_i$;
this can be done efficiently using existing approximate nearest neighbor
structures. In the second step, we solve an off-line optimization problem over
sets $q_1,\cdots,q_k$ and $\hat{p}_1,\cdots,\hat{p}_k$; this can be done
efficiently given that $k$ is much smaller than $n$. Even though
$\hat{p}_1,\cdots,\hat{p}_k$ might not constitute the optimal answers to
queries $q_1,\cdots,q_k$, we show that, for the unweighted case, the resulting
algorithm is $O(\log k/\log \log k)$-approximation. Also, we show that the
approximation factor can be in fact reduced to a constant for compatibility
graphs frequently occurring in practice.
  Finally, we show that the &quot;empirical approximation factor&quot; provided by the
above approach is very close to 1.

 <dc:description>  The encoder-decoder framework for neural machine translation (NMT) has been
shown effective in large data scenarios, but is much less effective for
low-resource languages. We present a transfer learning method that
significantly improves Bleu scores across a range of low-resource languages.
Our key idea is to first train a high-resource language pair (the parent
model), then transfer some of the learned parameters to the low-resource pair
(the child model) to initialize and constrain training. Using our transfer
learning method we improve baseline NMT models by an average of 5.6 Bleu on
four low-resource language pairs. Ensembling and unknown word replacement add
another 2 Bleu which brings the NMT performance on low-resource machine
translation close to a strong syntax based machine translation (SBMT) system,
exceeding its performance on one language pair. Additionally, using the
transfer learning model for re-scoring, we can improve the SBMT system by an
average of 1.3 Bleu, improving the state-of-the-art on low-resource machine
translation.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers large scale constrained convex programs, which are
usually not solvable by interior point methods or other Newton-type methods due
to the prohibitive computation and storage complexity for Hessians and matrix
inversions. Instead, large scale constrained convex programs are often solved
by gradient based methods or decomposition based methods. The conventional
primal-dual subgradient method, aka, Arrow-Hurwicz-Uzawa subgradient method, is
a low complexity algorithm with the $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ convergence rate, where $t$
is the number of iterations. If the objective and constraint functions are
separable, the Lagrangian dual type method can decompose a large scale convex
program into multiple parallel small scale convex programs. The classical dual
gradient algorithm is an example of Lagrangian dual type methods and has
convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. Recently, a new Lagrangian dual type
algorithm with faster $O(1/t)$ convergence is proposed in Yu and Neely (2015).
However, if the objective or constraint functions are not separable, each
iteration of the Lagrangian dual type method in Yu and Neely (2015) requires to
solve a large scale unconstrained convex program, which can have huge
complexity. This paper proposes a new primal-dual type algorithm, which only
involves simple gradient updates at each iteration and has the $O(1/t)$
convergence rate.

 <dc:title>A Low Complexity Algorithm with $O(\sqrt{T})$ Regret and Finite

 <dc:description>  This paper considers online convex optimization over a complicated constraint
set, which typically consists of multiple functional constraints and a set
constraint. The conventional projection based online projection algorithm
(Zinkevich, 2003) can be difficult to implement due to the potentially high
computation complexity of the projection operation. In this paper, we relax the
functional constraints by allowing them to be violated at each round but still
requiring them to be satisfied in the long term. This type of relaxed online
convex optimization (with long term constraints) was first considered in
Mahdavi et al. (2012). That prior work proposes an algorithm to achieve
$O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(T^{3/4})$ constraint violations for general
problems and another algorithm to achieve an $O(T^{2/3})$ bound for both regret
and constraint violations when the constraint set can be described by a finite
number of linear constraints. A recent extension in Jenatton et al. (2016) can
achieve $O(T^{\max\{\beta,1-\beta\}})$ regret and $O(T^{1-\beta/2})$ constraint
violations where $\beta\in (0,1)$. The current paper proposes a new simple
algorithm that yields improved performance in comparison to prior works. The
new algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound with finite constraint
violations.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: In the previous version, both the regret bound and the constraint
  violation bound are $O(\sqrt{T})$. The current version improves the
  constraint violation bound from $O(\sqrt{T})$ to $O(1)$, i.e., a finite
  constant that is independent of T, while preserving the same $O(\sqrt{T})$
  regret bound</dc:description>

 <dc:title>On Capacity and Delay of Multi-channel Wireless Networks with
  Infrastructure Support</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dai, Hong-Ning</dc:creator>

 <dc:creator>Wang, Hao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-channel network with infrastructure
support, called an MC-IS network, which has not been studied in the literature.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study such an MC-IS network.
Our proposed MC-IS network has a number of advantages over three existing
conventional networks, namely a single-channel wireless ad hoc network (called
an SC-AH network), a multi-channel wireless ad hoc network (called an MC-AH
network) and a single-channel network with infrastructure support (called an
SC-IS network). In particular, the network capacity of our proposed MC-IS
network is $\sqrt{n \log n}$ times higher than that of an SC-AH network and an
MC-AH network and the same as that of an SC-IS network, where $n$ is the number
of nodes in the network. The average delay of our MC-IS network is $\sqrt{\log
n/n}$ times lower than that of an SC-AH network and an MC-AH network, and
$\min\{C_I,m\}$ times lower than the average delay of an SC-IS network, where
$C_I$ and $m$ denote the number of channels dedicated for infrastructure
communications and the number of interfaces mounted at each infrastructure
node, respectively. Our analysis on an MC-IS network equipped with
omni-directional antennas only has been extended to an MC-IS network equipped
with directional antennas only, which are named as an MC-IS-DA network. We show
that an MC-IS-DA network has an even lower delay of $\frac{c}{\lfloor
\frac{2\pi}{\theta}\rfloor \cdot C_I}$ compared with an SC-IS network and our
MC-IS network. For example, when $C_I=12$ and $\theta=\frac{\pi}{12}$, an
MC-IS-DA network can further reduce the delay by 24 times lower that of an
MC-IS network and reduce the delay by 288 times lower than that of an SC-IS
network.

 <dc:title>Approximate Capacity Region of the MAC-IC-MAC</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pang, Yimin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Varanasi, Mahesh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An approximate capacity region is established of a class of interfering
multiple access channels consisting of two multiple-access channels (MACs),
each with an arbitrary number of users, with interference from one of the
transmitters of one MAC to the receiver of the other MAC, which we refer to
henceforth as the MAC-IC-MAC. It is shown that, for the semi-deterministic
MAC-IC-MAC, single-user coding at the non-interfering transmitters in each MAC
and superposition coding at the interfering transmitter of each MAC achieves a
rate region that is within a quantifiable gap of the capacity region, thereby
generalizing the result by Telatar and Tse for the 2-user semi-deterministic
interference channel. Next, with an explicit coding scheme, we establish an
approximate capacity region that is within a one-bit gap of the capacity region
for the Gaussian MAC-IC-MAC, thereby extending the work by Etkin {\em et al}
for the two-user Gaussian interference channel. The symmetric generalized
degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the symmetric Gaussian MAC-IC-MAC with more than
one user per cell, which is a function of the interference strength (the ratio
of INR to SNR at high SNR, both expressed in dB) and the numbers of users in
each cell, is V-shaped with flat shoulders. An analysis based on the
deterministic method shows that, when interference is sufficiently weak or
strong, the non-interfering transmitters are not mere sharers of the degrees of
freedom with the interfering transmitters. They instead also utilize power
levels that cannot be accessed by interfering transmitters (due to the
restriction of superposition coding), thereby improving the symmetric sum GDoF
to up to one degree of freedom per cell under a range of SINR exponent levels.
Time sharing between interfering and non-interfering transmitters is
suboptimal.

 <dc:description>  Haar wavelet is one of the best mathematical tools in image cryptography and
analysis. Because of the specific structure, this wavelet has the ability which
is combined with other mathematical tools such as chaotic maps. The rational
order chaotic maps are one of clusters of chaotic maps which their
deterministic behaviors have high sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a
novel method of gradient Haar wavelet transform for image encryption. This
method use linearity properties of the scaling function of the gradient Haar
wavelet and deterministic behaviors of rational order chaotic maps in order to
generate encrypted images with high security factor. The security of the
encrypted images is evaluated by the key space analysis, the correlation
coefficient analysis, and differential attack. The method could be used in
other fields such as image and signal processing.

 <dc:description>  The combinatorics of squares in a word depends on how the equivalence of
halves of the square is defined. We consider Abelian squares, parameterized
squares, and order-preserving squares. The word $uv$ is an Abelian
(parameterized, order-preserving) square if $u$ and $v$ are equivalent in the
Abelian (parameterized, order-preserving) sense. The maximum number of ordinary
squares in a word is known to be asymptotically linear, but the exact bound is
still investigated. We present several results on the maximum number of
distinct squares for nonstandard subword equivalence relations. Let
$\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma)$ and
$\mathit{SQ}'_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma)$ denote the maximum number of Abelian
squares in a word of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$, which are
distinct as words and which are nonequivalent in the Abelian sense,
respectively. For $\sigma\ge 2$ we prove that
$\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma)=\Theta(n^2)$,
$\mathit{SQ}'_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma)=\Omega(n^{3/2})$ and
$\mathit{SQ}'_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma) = O(n^{11/6})$. We also give linear
bounds for parameterized and order-preserving squares for alphabets of constant
size: $\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{param}}(n,O(1))=\Theta(n)$,
$\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{op}}(n,O(1))=\Theta(n)$. The upper bounds have quadratic
dependence on the alphabet size for order-preserving squares and exponential
dependence for parameterized squares.
  As a side result we construct infinite words over the smallest alphabet which
avoid nontrivial order-preserving squares and nontrivial parameterized cubes
(nontrivial parameterized squares cannot be avoided in an infinite word).

 <dc:description>  Since the start of Indian cinema, a number of films have been made where a
particular song is based on a certain raga. These songs have been taking a
major role in spreading the essence of classical music to the common people,
who have no formal exposure to classical music. In this paper, we look to
explore what are the particular features of a certain raga which make it
understandable to common people and enrich the song to a great extent. For
this, we chose two common ragas of Hindustani classical music, namely Bhairav
and Mian ki Malhar which are known to have widespread application in popular
film music. We have taken 3 minute clips of these two ragas from the renderings
of two eminent maestros of Hindustani classical music. 3 min clips of ten (10)
widely popular songs of Bollywood films were selected for analysis. These were
analyzed with the help of a latest non linear analysis technique called
Multifractal Detrended Cross correlation Analysis (MFDXA). With this technique,
all parts of the Film music and the renderings from the eminent maestros are
analyzed to find out a cross correlation coefficient ({\gamma}x) which gives
the degree of correlation between these two signals. We hypothesize that the
parts which have the highest degree of cross correlation are the parts in which
that particular raga is established in the song. Also the variation of cross
correlation coefficient in the different parts of the two samples gives a
measure of the modulation that is executed by the singer. Thus, in nutshell we
try to study scientifically the amount of correlation that exists between the
raga and the same raga being utilized in Film music. This will help in
generating an automated algorithm through which a naive listener will relish
the flavor of a particular raga in a popular film song. The results are
discussed in detail.

trained. The trained model does not require any user guidance or a reference
image database in the recall phase to produce images with a natural appearance.
To preserve the rich details of the NIR image, its high frequency features are
transferred to the estimated RGB image. The presented approach is trained and
evaluated on a real-world dataset containing a large amount of road scene
images in summer. The dataset was captured by a multi-CCD NIR/RGB camera, which
ensures a perfect pixel to pixel registration.

 <dc:description>  Hindustani classical music is entirely based on the Raga structures. In
Hindustani music, a Gharana or school refers to the adherence of a group of
musicians to a particular musical style of performing a certain raga. The
objective of this work was to find out if any characteristic acoustic cues
exist which discriminates a particular gharana from the other. Another
intriguing fact is if the artists of the same gharana keep their singing style
unchanged over generations or evolution of music takes place like everything
else in nature. In this work, we chose to study the similarities and
differences in singing style of some artists from at least four consecutive
generations representing four different gharanas using robust non-linear
methods. For this, alap parts of a particular raga sung by all the artists were
analyzed with the help of non linear multifractal analysis (MFDFA) technique.
The spectral width obtained from the MFDFA method gives an estimate of the
complexity of the signal. The observations give a cue in the direction to the
scientific recognition of guru-shisya parampara (teacher-student tradition) a
hitherto much-heard philosophical term. Moreover the variation in the
complexity patterns among various gharanas will give a hint of the
characteristic feature of that particular gharana as well as the effect of
globalization in the field of classical music happening through past few
decades.

 <dc:description>  Routing for low latency underwater acoustic network-communication is
investigated. The application is monitoring of ice-threats to offshore
operations in the Arctic - to provide warnings that enable operators to react
to such threats. The scenario produces relatively high traffic load, and the
network should favour low delay and adequate reliability rather than energy
usage minimization. The ICRP (Information-Carrying based Routing Protocol),
originally proposed by Wei Liang et al. in 2007, is chosen as basis. ICRP
obtains unicast routing paths by sending data payload as broadcast packets when
no route information is available. Thus, data can be delivered without the cost
of reactive signalling latency. In this paper we explore the capabilities of a
slightly enhanced/adapted ICRP, tailored to the ice monitoring application. By
simulations and experiments at sea it is demonstrated that the protocol
performs well and can manage the applications high traffic load - this provided
that the point-to-point links provide sufficient bit rates and capacity
headroom.

 <dc:description>  Indefinite similarity measures can be frequently found in bio-informatics by
means of alignment scores, but are also common in other fields like shape
measures in image retrieval. Lacking an underlying vector space, the data are
given as pairwise similarities only. The few algorithms available for such data
do not scale to larger datasets. Focusing on probabilistic batch classifiers,
the Indefinite Kernel Fisher Discriminant (iKFD) and the Probabilistic
Classification Vector Machine (PCVM) are both effective algorithms for this
type of data but, with cubic complexity. Here we propose an extension of iKFD
and PCVM such that linear runtime and memory complexity is achieved for low
rank indefinite kernels. Employing the Nystr\&quot;om approximation for indefinite
kernels, we also propose a new almost parameter free approach to identify the
landmarks, restricted to a supervised learning problem. Evaluations at several
larger similarity data from various domains show that the proposed methods
provides similar generalization capabilities while being easier to parametrize
and substantially faster for large scale data.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in top-down mass spectrometry enabled identification of
intact proteins, but this technology still faces challenges. For example,
top-down mass spectrometry suffers from a lack of sensitivity since the ion
counts for a single fragmentation event are often low. In contrast, nanopore
technology is exquisitely sensitive to single intact molecules, but it has only
been successfully applied to DNA sequencing, so far. Here, we explore the
potential of sub-nanopores for single-molecule protein identification (SMPI)
and describe an algorithm for identification of the electrical current blockade
signal (nanospectrum) resulting from the translocation of a denaturated,
linearly charged protein through a sub-nanopore. The analysis of identification
p-values suggests that the current technology is already sufficient for
matching nanospectra against small protein databases, e.g., protein
identification in bacterial proteomes.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses a fundamental problem of scene understanding: How to
parse the scene image into a structured configuration (i.e., a semantic object
hierarchy with object interaction relations) that finely accords with human
perception. We propose a deep architecture consisting of two networks: i) a
convolutional neural network (CNN) extracting the image representation for
pixelwise object labeling and ii) a recursive neural network (RNN) discovering
the hierarchical object structure and the inter-object relations. Rather than
relying on elaborative user annotations (e.g., manually labeling semantic maps
and relations), we train our deep model in a weakly-supervised manner by
leveraging the descriptive sentences of the training images. Specifically, we
decompose each sentence into a semantic tree consisting of nouns and verb
phrases, and facilitate these trees discovering the configurations of the
training images. Once these scene configurations are determined, then the
parameters of both the CNN and RNN are updated accordingly by back propagation.
The entire model training is accomplished through an Expectation-Maximization
method. Extensive experiments suggest that our model is capable of producing
meaningful and structured scene configurations and achieving more favorable
scene labeling performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 over other state-of-the-art
weakly-supervised methods.

 <dc:description>  As we enter into the big data age and an avalanche of images have become
readily available, recognition systems face the need to move from close, lab
settings where the number of classes and training data are fixed, to dynamic
scenarios where the number of categories to be recognized grows continuously
over time, as well as new data providing useful information to update the
system. Recent attempts, like the open world recognition framework, tried to
inject dynamics into the system by detecting new unknown classes and adding
them incrementally, while at the same time continuously updating the models for
the known classes. incrementally adding new classes and detecting instances
from unknown classes, while at the same time continuously updating the models
for the known classes. In this paper we argue that to properly capture the
intrinsic dynamic of open world recognition, it is necessary to add to these
aspects (a) the incremental learning of the underlying metric, (b) the
incremental estimate of confidence thresholds for the unknown classes, and (c)
the use of local learning to precisely describe the space of classes. We extend
three existing metric learning algorithms towards these goals by using online
metric learning. Experimentally we validate our approach on two large-scale
datasets in different learning scenarios. For all these scenarios our proposed
methods outperform their non-online counterparts. We conclude that local and
online learning is important to capture the full dynamics of open world
recognition.

 <dc:title>A modified block Lanczos algorithm with fewer vectors</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The block Lanczos algorithm proposed by Peter Montgomery is an efficient
means to tackle the sparse linear algebra problem which arises in the context
of the number field sieve factoring algorithm and its predecessors. We present
here a modified version of the algorithm, which incorporates several
improvements: we discuss how to efficiently handle homogeneous systems and how
to reduce the number of vectors stored in the course of the computation. We
also provide heuristic justification for the success probability of our
modified algorithm. While the overall complexity and expected number of steps
of the block Lanczos is not changed by the modifications presented in this
article, we expect these to be useful for implementations of the block Lanczos
algorithm where the storage of auxiliary vectors sometimes has a non-negligible
cost. 1 Linear systems for integer factoring For factoring a composite integer
N, algorithms based on the technique of combination of congruences look for
several pairs of integers (x, y) such that x 2 $\not\equiv$ y 2 mod N. This
equality is hoped to be non trivial for at least one of the obtained pairs,
letting gcd(x -- y, N) unveil a factor of the integer N. Several algorithms use
this strategy: the CFRAC algorithm, the quadratic sieve and its variants, and
the number field sieve. Pairs (x, y) as above are obtained by combining
relations which have been collected as a step of these algorithms. Relations
are written multiplicatively as a set of valuations. All the algorithms
considered seek a multiplicative combination of these relations which can be
rewritten as an equality of squares. This is achieved by solving a system of
linear equations defined over F 2, where equations are parity constraints on

 <dc:description>  We study a two-level uncapacitated lot-sizing problem with inventory bounds
that occurs in a supply chain composed of a supplier and a retailer. The first
level with the demands is the retailer level and the second one is the supplier
level. The aim is to minimize the cost of the supply chain so as to satisfy the
demands when the quantity of item that can be held in inventory at each period
is limited. The inventory bounds can be imposed at the retailer level, at the
supplier level or at both levels. We propose a polynomial dynamic programming
algorithm to solve this problem when the inventory bounds are set on the
retailer level. When the inventory bounds are set on the supplier level, we
show that the problem is NP-hard. We give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm which
solves this problem when there are inventory bounds on both levels. In the case
where demand lot-splitting is not allowed, i.e. each demand has to be satisfied
by a single order, we prove that the uncapacitated lot-sizing problem with
inventory bounds is strongly NP-hard. This implies that the two-level
lot-sizing problems with inventory bounds are also strongly NP-hard when demand
lot-splitting is considered.

 <dc:description>  We present the Temporal Logic Synthesis Format (TLSF), a high-level format to
describe synthesis problems via Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The format builds
upon standard LTL, but additionally allows to use high-level constructs, such
as sets and functions, to provide a compact and human-readable representation.
Furthermore, the format allows to identify parameters of a specification such
that a single description can be used to define a family of problems.
Additionally, we present a tool to automatically translate the format into
plain LTL, which then can be used for synthesis by a solver. The tool also
allows to adjust parameters of the specification and to apply standard
transformations on the resulting formula.

 <dc:title>The QWERTY effect on the web: How typing shapes the meaning of words in
  online human-computer interaction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Garcia, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Strohmaier, Markus</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The QWERTY effect postulates that the keyboard layout influences word
meanings by linking positivity to the use of the right hand and negativity to
the use of the left hand. For example, previous research has established that
words with more right hand letters are rated more positively than words with
more left hand letters by human subjects in small scale experiments. In this
paper, we perform large scale investigations of the QWERTY effect on the web.
Using data from eleven web platforms related to products, movies, books, and
videos, we conduct observational tests whether a hand-meaning relationship can
be found in decoding text on the web. Furthermore, we investigate whether
encoding text on the web exhibits the QWERTY effect as well, by analyzing the
relationship between the text of online reviews and their star ratings in four
additional datasets. Overall, we find robust evidence for the QWERTY effect
both at the point of text interpretation (decoding) and at the point of text
creation (encoding). We also find under which conditions the effect might not
hold. Our findings have implications for any algorithmic method aiming to
evaluate the meaning of words on the web, including for example semantic or
sentiment analysis, and show the existence of &quot;dactilar onomatopoeias&quot; that
shape the dynamics of word-meaning associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to reveal the extent to which the QWERTY effect exists
in large scale human-computer interaction on the web.

only example of a 4-critical $t$-perfect graph, due to Laurent and Seymour, is
the complement of the line graph of the prism $\Pi$ (a graph is 4-critical if
it has chromatic number 4 and all its proper induced subgraphs are
3-colorable).
  In this paper, we show a new example of a 4-critical $t$-perfect graph: the
complement of the line graph of the 5-wheel $W_5$. Furthermore, we prove that
these two examples are in fact the only 4-critical $t$-perfect graphs in the
class of complements of line graphs. As a byproduct, an analogous and more
general result is obtained for $h$-perfect graphs in this class.
  The class of $P_6$-free graphs is a proper superclass of complements of line
graphs and appears as a natural candidate to further investigate the chromatic
number of $t$-perfect graphs. We observe that a result of Randerath,
Schiermeyer and Tewes implies that every $t$-perfect $P_6$-free graph is
4-colorable. Finally, we use results of Chudnovsky et al to show that
$\overline{L(W_5)}$ and $\overline{L(\Pi)}$ are also the only 4-critical
$t$-perfect $P_6$-free graphs.

 <dc:title>A method for locally approximating regularized iterative tomographic
  reconstruction methods</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In many applications of tomography, the acquired projections are either
limited in number or contain a significant amount of noise. In these cases,
standard reconstruction methods tend to produce artifacts that can make further
analysis difficult. Advanced regularized iterative methods, such as total
variation minimization, are often able to achieve a higher reconstruction
quality by exploiting prior knowledge about the scanned object. In practice,
however, these methods often have prohibitively long computation times or large
memory requirements. Furthermore, since they are based on minimizing a global
objective function, regularized iterative methods need to reconstruct the
entire scanned object, even when one is only interested in a (small) region of
the reconstructed image.
  In this paper, we present a method to approximate regularized iterative
reconstruction methods inside a (small) region of the scanned object. The
method only performs computations inside the region of interest, ensuring low
computational requirements. Reconstruction results for different phantom images
and types of regularization are given, showing that reconstructions of the
proposed local method are almost identical to those of the global regularized
iterative methods that are approximated, even for relatively small regions of
interest. Furthermore, we show that larger regions can be reconstructed
efficiently by reconstructing several small regions in parallel and combining
them into a single reconstruction afterwards.

 <dc:description>  The main result of this paper is the decidability of the membership problem
for $2\times 2$ nonsingular integer matrices. Namely, we will construct the
first algorithm that for any nonsingular $2\times 2$ integer matrices
$M_1,\dots,M_n$ and $M$ decides whether $M$ belongs to the semigroup generated
by $\{M_1,\dots,M_n\}$.
  Our algorithm relies on a translation of the numerical problem on matrices
into combinatorial problems on words. It also makes use of some algebraical
properties of well-known subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and various
new techniques and constructions that help to limit an infinite number of
possibilities by reducing them to the membership problem for regular languages.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel activation function that implements piece-wise orthogonal
non-linear mappings based on permutations. It is straightforward to implement,
and very computationally efficient, also it has little memory requirements. We
tested it on two toy problems for feedforward and recurrent networks, it shows
similar performance to tanh and ReLU. OPLU activation function ensures norm
preservance of the backpropagated gradients, therefore it is potentially good

 <dc:description>  Recently, vision-based Advanced Driver Assist Systems have gained broad
interest. In this work, we investigate free-space detection, for which we
propose to employ a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). We show that this FCN
can be trained in a self-supervised manner and achieve similar results compared
to training on manually annotated data, thereby reducing the need for large
manually annotated training sets. To this end, our self-supervised training
relies on a stereo-vision disparity system, to automatically generate (weak)
training labels for the color-based FCN. Additionally, our self-supervised
training facilitates online training of the FCN instead of offline.
Consequently, given that the applied FCN is relatively small, the free-space
analysis becomes highly adaptive to any traffic scene that the vehicle
encounters. We have validated our algorithm using publicly available data and
on a new challenging benchmark dataset that is released with this paper.
Experiments show that the online training boosts performance with 5% when
compared to offline training, both for Fmax and AP.

 <dc:description>  Many current traffic monitoring systems employ deep packet inspection (DPI)
in order to analyze network traffic. These systems include intrusion detection
systems, software for network traffic accounting, traffic classification, or
systems for monitoring service-level agreements. Traffic volumes and link
speeds of current enterprise and ISP networks transform the process of
inspecting traffic payload into a challenging task. In this paper we propose a
novel adaptive sampling algorithm that selects the maximum number of packets
from the network that the DPI system is able to consume. Our algorithm adapts
its sampling rate according to the network traffic currently observed, and the
number of packets that a monitoring application is able to process. It can be
used in conjunction with current multicore-aware network traffic analysis
setups, which allow for exploiting current multi-core hardware. We show the
applicability of our algorithm with live-tests on a heavily used 10G link with
real network monitoring tools.

 <dc:description>  Objects or structures that are regular take uniform dimensions. Based on the
concepts of regular models, our previous research work has developed a system
of a regular ontology that models learning structures in a multiagent system
for uniform pre-assessments in a learning environment. This regular ontology
has led to the modelling of a classified rules learning algorithm that predicts
the actual number of rules needed for inductive learning processes and decision
making in a multiagent system. But not all processes or models are regular.
Thus this paper presents a system of polynomial equation that can estimate and
predict the required number of rules of a non-regular ontology model given some
defined parameters.

 <dc:title>An O(|E|)-linear Model for the MaxCut Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A polytope $P$ is a {\em model} for a combinatorial problem on finite graphs
$G$ whose variables are indexed by the edge set $E$ of $G$ if the points of $P$
with (0,1)-coordinates are precisely the characteristic vectors of the subset
of edges inducing the feasible configurations for the problem. In the case of
the (simple) MaxCut Problem, which is the one that concern us here, the
feasible subsets of edges are the ones inducing the bipartite subgraphs of $G$.
In this paper we introduce a new polytope $\mathbb{P}_{12} \subset
\mathbb{R}^{|E|}$ given by at most $11|E|$ inequalities, which is a model for
the MaxCut Problem on $G$. Moreover, the left side of each inequality is the
sum of at most 4 edge variables with coefficients $\pm1$ and right side 0,1, or
2. We restrict our analysis to the case of $G=K_{z}$, the complete graph in $z$
vertices, where $z$ is an even positive integer $z\ge 4$. This case is
sufficient to study because the simple MaxCut problem for general graphs $G$
can be reduced to the complete graph $K_z$ by considering the obective function
of the associated integer programming as the characteristic vector of the edges
in $G \subseteq K_z$. This is a polynomial algorithmic transformation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a cache aided network in which each user is
assumed to have individual caches, while upon users' requests, an update
message is sent though a common link to all users. First, we formulate a
general information theoretic setting that represents the database as a
discrete memoryless source, and the users' requests as side information that is
available everywhere except at the cache encoder. The decoders' objective is to
recover a function of the source and the side information. By viewing cache
aided networks in terms of a general distributed source coding problem and
through information theoretic arguments, we present inner and outer bounds on
the fundamental tradeoff of cache memory size and update rate. Then, we
specialize our general inner and outer bounds to a specific model of content
delivery networks: File selection networks, in which the database is a
collection of independent equal-size files and each user requests one of the
files independently. For file selection networks, we provide an outer bound and
two inner bounds (for centralized and decentralized caching strategies). For
the case when the user request information is uniformly distributed, we
characterize the rate vs. cache size tradeoff to within a multiplicative gap of
4. By further extending our arguments to the framework of Maddah-Ali and
Niesen, we also establish a new outer bound and two new inner bounds in which
it is shown to recover the centralized and decentralized strategies, previously
established by Maddah-Ali and Niesen. Finally, in terms of rate vs. cache size
tradeoff, we improve the previous multiplicative gap of 72 to 4.7 for the
average case with uniform requests.

 <dc:description>  In recent years graphical processing units (GPUs) have become a powerful tool
in scientific computing. Their potential to speed up highly parallel
applications brings the power of high performance computing to a wider range of
users. However, programming these devices and integrating their use in existing
applications is still a challenging task.
  In this paper we examined the potential of GPUs for two different
applications. The first application, created at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI),
is used for parameter fitting during data analysis of muSR (muon spin rotation,
relaxation and resonance) experiments. The second application, developed at
ETH, is used for PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image reconstruction and
analysis. Applications currently in use were examined to identify parts of the
algorithms in need of optimization. Efficient GPU kernels were created in order
to allow applications to use a GPU, to speed up the previously identified
parts. Benchmarking tests were performed in order to measure the achieved
speedup
  During this work, we focused on single GPU systems to show that real time
data analysis of these problems can be achieved without the need for large
computing clusters. The results show that the currently used application for
parameter fitting, which uses OpenMP to parallelize calculations over multiple
CPU cores, can be accelerated around 40 times through the use of a GPU. The
speedup may vary depending on the size and complexity of the problem. For PET
image analysis, the obtained speedups of the GPU version was more than x40
larger compared to a single core CPU implementation. The achieved results show
that it is possible to improve the execution time by orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  Estimating student proficiency is an important task for computer based
learning systems. We compare a family of IRT-based proficiency estimation
methods to Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a recently proposed recurrent neural
network model with promising initial results. We evaluate how well each model
predicts a student's future response given previous responses using two
publicly available and one proprietary data set. We find that IRT-based methods
consistently matched or outperformed DKT across all data sets at the finest
level of content granularity that was tractable for them to be trained on. A
hierarchical extension of IRT that captured item grouping structure performed
best overall. When data sets included non-trivial autocorrelations in student
response patterns, a temporal extension of IRT improved performance over
standard IRT while the RNN-based method did not. We conclude that IRT-based
models provide a simpler, better-performing alternative to existing RNN-based
models of student interaction data while also affording more interpretability
and guarantees due to their formulation as Bayesian probabilistic models.

 <dc:description>  The ladder graph plays an important role in many applications as Electronics,
Electrical and Wireless communication areas. The aim of this work is to present
a new class of odd graceful labeling for the ladder graph. In particular, we
show that the ladder graph Ln with m-pendant Ln + mk1 is odd graceful. We also
show that the subdivision of ladder graph Ln with m-pendant S(Ln) + mk1 is odd
graceful. Finally, we prove that all the subdivision of triangular snakes
(delt-k snake) with pendant edges S(delt-k snake)+ mk are odd graceful.

 <dc:description>  Learning a good distance metric in feature space potentially improves the
performance of the KNN classifier and is useful in many real-world
applications. Many metric learning algorithms are however based on the point
estimation of a quadratic optimization problem, which is time-consuming,
susceptible to overfitting, and lack a natural mechanism to reason with
parameter uncertainty, an important property useful especially when the
training set is small and/or noisy. To deal with these issues, we present a
novel Bayesian metric learning method, called Bayesian NCA, based on the
well-known Neighbourhood Component Analysis method, in which the metric
posterior is characterized by the local label consistency constraints of
observations, encoded with a similarity graph instead of independent pairwise
constraints. For efficient Bayesian optimization, we explore the variational
lower bound over the log-likelihood of the original NCA objective. Experiments
on several publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is
able to learn robust metric measures from small size dataset and/or from
challenging training set with labels contaminated by errors. The proposed
method is also shown to outperform a previous pairwise constrained Bayesian
metric learning method.

 <dc:title>The (1+1) Elitist Black-Box Complexity of LeadingOnes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  One important goal of black-box complexity theory is the development of
complexity models allowing to derive meaningful lower bounds for whole classes
of randomized search heuristics. Complementing classical runtime analysis,
black-box models help us understand how algorithmic choices such as the
population size, the variation operators, or the selection rules influence the
optimization time. One example for such a result is the $\Omega(n \log n)$
lower bound for unary unbiased algorithms on functions with a unique global
optimum [Lehre/Witt, GECCO 2010], which tells us that higher arity operators or
biased sampling strategies are needed when trying to beat this bound. In lack
of analyzing techniques, almost no non-trivial bounds are known for other
restricted models. Proving such bounds therefore remains to be one of the main
challenges in black-box complexity theory.
  With this paper we contribute to our technical toolbox for lower bound
computations by proposing a new type of information-theoretic argument. We
regard the permutation- and bit-invariant version of \textsc{LeadingOnes} and
prove that its (1+1) elitist black-box complexity is $\Omega(n^2)$, a bound
that is matched by (1+1)-type evolutionary algorithms. The (1+1) elitist
complexity of \textsc{LeadingOnes} is thus considerably larger than its
unrestricted one, which is known to be of order $n\log\log n$ [Afshani et al.,
2013].

 <dc:title>A Hybrid Classification Algorithm to Classify Engineering Students'
  Problems and Perks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The social networking sites have brought a new horizon for expressing views
and opinions of individuals. Moreover, they provide medium to students to share
their sentiments including struggles and joy during the learning process. Such
informal information has a great venue for decision making. The large and
growing scale of information needs automatic classification techniques.
Sentiment analysis is one of the automated techniques to classify large data.
The existing predictive sentiment analysis techniques are highly used to
classify reviews on E-commerce sites to provide business intelligence. However,
they are not much useful to draw decisions in education system since they
classify the sentiments into merely three preset categories: positive, negative
and neutral. Moreover, classifying the students sentiments into positive or
negative category does not provide deeper insight into their problems and
perks. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Classification Algorithm to
classify engineering students sentiments. Unlike traditional predictive
sentiment analysis techniques, the proposed algorithm makes sentiment analysis
process descriptive. Moreover, it classifies engineering students perks in
addition to problems into several categories to help future students and
education system in decision making.

 <dc:description>  Author performance indices (such as h-index and its variants) fail to resolve
ties while ranking authors with low index values (majority in number) which
includes the young researchers. In this work we leverage the citations as well
as collaboration profile of an author in a novel way using a weighted
multi-layered network and propose a variant of page-rank algorithm to obtain a
new author performance measure, $C^3$-index. Experiments on a massive
publication dataset reveal several interesting characteristics of our metric:
(i) we observe that $C^3$-index is consistent over time, (ii) $C^3$-index has
high potential to break ties among low rank authors, (iii) $C^3$-index can
effectively be used to predict future achievers at the early stage of their
career.

 <dc:description>  This study examines the traditional approach to software development within
the United Kingdom Government and the accreditation process. Initially we look
at the Waterfall methodology that has been used for several years. We discuss
the pros and cons of Waterfall before moving onto the Agile Scrum methodology.
Agile has been adopted by the majority of Government digital departments
including the Government Digital Services. Agile, despite its ability to
achieve high rates of productivity organized in short, flexible, iterations,
has faced security professionals disbelief when working within the U.K.
Government. One of the major issues is that we develop in Agile but the
accreditation process is conducted using Waterfall resulting in delays to go
live dates. Taking a brief look into the accreditation process that is used
within Government for I.T. systems and applications, we focus on giving the
accreditor the assurance they need when developing new applications and
systems. A framework has been produced by utilizing the Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP) Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS).
This framework will allow security and Agile to work side by side and produce
secure code.

 <dc:title>Finding Optimal Combination of Kernels using Genetic Programming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In Computer Vision, problem of identifying or classifying the objects present
in an image is called Object Categorization. It is a challenging problem,
especially when the images have clutter background, occlusions or different
lighting conditions. Many vision features have been proposed which aid object
categorization even in such adverse conditions. Past research has shown that,
employing multiple features rather than any single features leads to better
recognition. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework has been developed for
learning an optimal combination of features for object categorization. Existing
MKL methods use linear combination of base kernels which may not be optimal for
object categorization. Real-world object categorization may need to consider
complex combination of kernels(non-linear) and not only linear combination.
Evolving non-linear functions of base kernels using Genetic Programming is
proposed in this report. Experiment results show that non-kernel generated
using genetic programming gives good accuracy as compared to linear combination
of kernels.

 <dc:title>A New Communication Theory on Complex Information and a Groundbreaking
  New Declarative Method to Update Object Databases</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Virkkunen, Heikki</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article I introduce a new communication theory for complex
information represented as a direct graph of nodes. In addition, I introduce an
application for the theory, a new radical method, embed, that can be used to
update object databases declaratively. The embed method revolutionizes updating
of object databases. One embed method call can replace dozens of lines of
complicated updating code in a traditional client program of an object
database, which is a huge improvement. As a declarative method the embed method
takes only one natural parameter, the root object of a modified object
structure in the run-time memory, which makes it extremely easy to use.The
communication theory behind the embed method states that modified complex
information represented as a directed graph of nodes can always be transferred
back to its original system in an exact and meaningful way. The theory can also
have additional applications since today information often has a network or
directed graph like structure and it often evolves or it is maintained. The
embed method applies the communication theory by modeling the object database
and a modified object structure in the run-time memory as directed graphs of
nodes without any artificial limitations. For example, different kinds of
circular substructures and their modifications are allowed. Persistence in the
object database is defined in a well known and accepted way, by reachability
from persistent root objects. The embed method also removes structures of
garbage objects from the object database if any appear during the update
operation, leaving the database in a consistent state. The embed method applies
reference counting techniques. It understands local topology of the object
database, avoiding examining unrelated objects in the database. For these
reasons, the embed method is efficient and it scales for databases of different
sizes.

 <dc:description>  We consider a group of $m$ trusted and authenticated nodes that aim to create
a shared secret key $K$ over a wireless channel in the presence of an
eavesdropper Eve. We assume that there exists a state dependent wireless
broadcast channel from one of the honest nodes to the rest of them including
Eve. All of the trusted nodes can also discuss over a cost-free, noiseless and
unlimited rate public channel which is also overheard by Eve. For this setup,
we develop an information-theoretically secure secret key agreement protocol.
We show the optimality of this protocol for &quot;linear deterministic&quot; wireless
broadcast channels. This model generalizes the packet erasure model studied in
literature for wireless broadcast channels. For &quot;state-dependent Gaussian&quot;
wireless broadcast channels, we propose an achievability scheme based on a
multi-layer wiretap code. Finding the best achievable secret key generation
rate leads to solving a non-convex power allocation problem. We show that using
a dynamic programming algorithm, one can obtain the best power allocation for
this problem. Moreover, we prove the optimality of the proposed achievability
scheme for the regime of high-SNR and large-dynamic range over the channel
states in the (generalized) degrees of freedom sense.

 <dc:title>An extensible formal semantics for UML activity diagrams</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents an operational semantics for UML activity diagrams. The
purpose of this semantics is three-fold: to give a robust basis for verifying
model correctness; to help validate model transformations; and to provide a
well-formed basis for assessing whether a proposed extension/interpretation of
the modeling language is consistent with the standard. The challenges of a
general formal framework for UML models include the semi-formality of the
semantics specification, the extensibility of the language, and (sometimes
deliberate, sometimes accidental) under-specification of model behavior in the
standard. Our approach is based on structural operational semantics, which can
be extended according to domain-specific needs. The presented semantics has
been implemented and tested.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel superpixel-based multi-view convolutional neural network
for semantic image segmentation. The proposed network produces a high quality
segmentation of a single image by leveraging information from additional views
of the same scene. Particularly in indoor videos such as captured by robotic
platforms or handheld and bodyworn RGBD cameras, nearby video frames provide
diverse viewpoints and additional context of objects and scenes. To leverage
such information, we first compute region correspondences by optical flow and
image boundary-based superpixels. Given these region correspondences, we
propose a novel spatio-temporal pooling layer to aggregate information over
space and time. We evaluate our approach on the NYU--Depth--V2 and the SUN3D
datasets and compare it to various state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view
approaches. Besides a general improvement over the state-of-the-art, we also
show the benefits of making use of unlabeled frames during training for
multi-view as well as single-view prediction.

 <dc:description>  Working under a model of privacy in which data remains private even from the
statistician, we study the tradeoff between privacy guarantees and the risk of
the resulting statistical estimators. We develop private versions of classical
information-theoretic bounds, in particular those due to Le Cam, Fano, and
Assouad. These inequalities allow for a precise characterization of statistical
rates under local privacy constraints and the development of provably (minimax)
optimal estimation procedures. We provide a treatment of several canonical
families of problems: mean estimation and median estimation, generalized linear
models, and nonparametric density estimation. For all of these families, we
provide lower and upper bounds that match up to constant factors, and exhibit
new (optimal) privacy-preserving mechanisms and computationally efficient
estimators that achieve the bounds. Additionally, we present a variety of
experimental results for estimation problems involving sensitive data,
including salaries, censored blog posts and articles, and drug abuse; these
experiments demonstrate the importance of deriving optimal procedures.

 <dc:description>  The paper deals with decentralized state estimation for spatially distributed
systems described by linear partial differential equations from discrete
in-space-and-time noisy measurements provided by sensors deployed over the
spatial domain of interest. A fully scalable approach is pursued by decomposing
the domain into overlapping subdomains assigned to different processing nodes
interconnected to form a network. Each node runs a local finite-dimensional
Kalman filter which exploits the finite element approach for spatial
discretization and the parallel Schwarz method to iteratively enforce consensus
on the estimates and covariances over the boundaries of adjacent subdomains.
Stability of the proposed distributed consensus-based finite element Kalman
filter is mathematically proved and its effectiveness is demonstrated via
simulation experiments concerning the estimation of a bi-dimensional
temperature field.

 <dc:description>  The social brain hypothesis predicts that humans have an average of about 150
relationships at any given time. Within this 150, there are layers of friends
of an ego, where the number of friends in a layer increases as the emotional
closeness decreases. Here we analyse a mobile phone dataset, firstly, to
ascertain whether layers of friends can be identified based on call frequency.
We then apply different clustering algorithms to break the call frequency of
egos into clusters and compare the number of alters in each cluster with the
layer size predicted by the social brain hypothesis. In this dataset we find
strong evidence for the existence of a layered structure. The clustering yields
results that match well with previous studies for the innermost and outermost
layers, but for layers in between we observe large variability.

 <dc:description>  In theoretical cognitive science, there is a tension between highly
structured models whose parameters have a direct psychological interpretation
and highly complex, general-purpose models whose parameters and representations
are difficult to interpret. The former typically provide more insight into
cognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently
surfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning
approach to predicting students' performance as they work through a series of
exercises---termed deep knowledge tracing or DKT---has demonstrated a stunning
performance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge
tracing or BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for DKT's
advantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that
DKT can leverage but which BKT cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity
that BKT fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence,
inter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate
that when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical
regularities---using extensions previously proposed in the literature---BKT
achieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue
that while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling
student learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel
representations---the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the
question posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not
require `depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us
greater interpretability and explanatory power.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in
many computer vision tasks. However, this achievement is preceded by extreme
manual annotation in order to perform either training from scratch or
fine-tuning for the target task. In this work, we propose to fine-tune CNN for
image retrieval from a large collection of unordered images in a fully
automated manner. We employ state-of-the-art retrieval and
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods to obtain 3D models, which are used to
guide the selection of the training data for CNN fine-tuning. We show that both
hard positive and hard negative examples enhance the final performance in
particular object retrieval with compact codes.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of streaming live content to a cluster of co-located
wireless devices that have both an expensive unicast base-station-to-device
(B2D) interface, as well as an inexpensive broadcast device-to-device (D2D)
interface, which can be used simultaneously. Our setting is a streaming system
that uses a block-by-block random linear coding approach to achieve a target
percentage of on-time deliveries with minimal B2D usage. Our goal is to design
an incentive framework that would promote such cooperation across devices,
while ensuring good quality of service. Based on ideas drawn from truth-telling
auctions, we design a mechanism that achieves this goal via appropriate
transfers (monetary payments or rebates) in a setting with a large number of
devices, and with peer arrivals and departures. Here, we show that a Mean Field
Game can be used to accurately approximate our system. Furthermore, the
complexity of calculating the best responses under this regime is low. We
implement the proposed system on an Android testbed, and illustrate its
efficient performance using real world experiments.

 <dc:title>On the Secrecy Capacity Region of the 2-user Z Interference Channel with

 <dc:description>  In this work, the role of unidirectional limited rate transmitter cooperation
is studied in the case of the 2-user Z interference channel (Z-IC) with secrecy
constraints at the receivers, on achieving two conflicting goals
simultaneously: mitigating interference and ensuring secrecy. First, the
problem is studied under the linear deterministic model. The achievable schemes
for the deterministic model use a fusion of cooperative precoding and
transmission of a jamming signal. The optimality of the proposed scheme is
established for the deterministic model for all possible parameter settings
using the outer bounds derived by the authors in a previous work. Using the
insights obtained from the deterministic model, a lower bound on the secrecy
capacity region of the 2-user Gaussian Z-IC are obtained. The achievable scheme
in this case uses stochastic encoding in addition to cooperative precoding and
transmission of a jamming signal. The secure sum generalized degrees of freedom
(GDOF) is characterized and shown to be optimal for the weak/moderate
interference regime. It is also shown that the secure sum capacity lies within
2 bits/s/Hz of the outer bound for the weak/moderate interference regime for
all values of the capacity of the cooperative link. Interestingly, in case of
the deterministic model, it is found that there is no penalty on the capacity
region of the Z-IC due to the secrecy constraints at the receivers in the
weak/moderate interference regimes. Similarly, it is found that there is no
loss in the secure sum GDOF for the Gaussian case due to the secrecy constraint
at the receiver, in the weak/moderate interference regimes. The results
highlight the importance of cooperation in facilitating secure communication
over the Z-IC.

 <dc:description>  Almost all real-world networks are subject to constant evolution, and plenty
of evolving networks have been investigated to uncover the underlying
mechanisms for a deeper understanding of the organization and development of
them. Compared with the rapid expansion of the empirical studies about
evolution mechanisms exploration, the future links prediction methods
corresponding to the evolution mechanisms are deficient. Real-world information
always contain hints of what would happen next, which is also the case in the
observed evolving networks. In this paper, we firstly propose a
structured-dependent index to strengthen the robustness of link prediction
methods. Then we treat the observed links and their timestamps in evolving
networks as known information. We envision evolving networks as dynamic systems
and model the evolutionary dynamics of nodes similarity. Based on the iterative
updating of nodes' network position, the potential trend of evolving networks
is uncovered, which improves the accuracy of future links prediction.
Experiments on various real-world networks show that the proposed index
performs better than baseline methods and the spatial-temporal position drift
model performs well in real-world evolving networks.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of maintaining statistic aggregates over the
last W elements of a data stream. First, the problem of counting the number of
1's in the last W bits of a binary stream is considered. A lower bound of
{\Omega}(1/{\epsilon} + log W) memory bits for W{\epsilon}-additive
approximations is derived. This is followed by an algorithm whose memory
consumption is O(1/{\epsilon} + log W) bits, indicating that the algorithm is
optimal and that the bound is tight. Next, the more general problem of
maintaining a sum of the last W integers, each in the range of {0,1,...,R}, is
addressed. The paper shows that approximating the sum within an additive error
of RW{\epsilon} can also be done using {\Theta}(1/{\epsilon} + log W) bits for
{\epsilon}={\Omega}(1/W). For {\epsilon}=o(1/W), we present a succinct
algorithm which uses B(1 + o(1)) bits, where B={\Theta}(Wlog(1/W{\epsilon})) is
the derived lower bound. We show that all lower bounds generalize to randomized
algorithms as well. All algorithms process new elements and answer queries in
O(1) worst-case time.

 <dc:title>Outer Bounds on the Secrecy Capacity Region of the 2-user Z Interference

 <dc:description>  This paper derives outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region of the 2-user
Z interference channel (Z-IC) with rate-limited unidirectional cooperation
between the transmitters. First, the model is studied under the linear
deterministic setting. The derivation of the outer bounds on the secrecy
capacity region involves careful selection of the side information to be
provided to the receivers and using the secrecy constraints at the receivers in
a judicious manner. To this end, a novel partitioning of the encoded messages
and outputs is proposed for the deterministic model based on the strength of
interference and signal. The obtained outer bounds are shown to be tight using
the achievable scheme derived by the authors in a previous work. Using the
insight obtained from the deterministic model, outer bounds on the secrecy
capacity region of the 2-user Gaussian Z-IC are obtained. The equivalence
between the outer bounds for both the models is also established. It is also
shown that secrecy constraint at the receiver does not hurt the capacity region
of the 2-user Z-IC for the deterministic model in the weak/moderate
interference regime. On the other hand, the outer bounds developed for the
Gaussian case shows that secrecy constraint at the receiver can reduce the
capacity region for the weak/moderate interference regime. The study of the
relative performance of these bounds reveals insight into the fundamental
limits of the 2-user Z-IC with limited rate transmitter cooperation.

 <dc:description>  Computer vision has become a major source of information for autonomous
navigation of robots of various types, self-driving cars, military robots and
mars/lunar rovers are some examples. Nevertheless, the majority of methods
focus on analysing images captured in visible spectrum. In this manuscript we
elaborate on the problem of segmenting cross-country scenes captured in IR
spectrum. For this purpose we proposed employing salient features. Salient
features are robust to variations in scale, brightness and view angle. We
suggest the Speeded-Up Robust Features as a basis for our salient features for
a number of reasons discussed in the paper. We also provide a comparison of two
SURF implementations. The SURF features are extracted from images of different
terrain types. For every feature we estimate a terrain class membership
function. The membership values are obtained by means of either the multi-layer
perceptron or nearest neighbours. The features' class membership values and
their spatial positions are then applied to estimate class membership values
for all pixels in the image. To decrease the effect of segmentation blinking
that is caused by rapid switching between different terrain types and to speed
up segmentation, we are tracking camera position and predict features'
positions. The comparison of the multi-layer perception and the nearest
neighbour classifiers is presented in the paper. The error rate of the terrain
segmentation using the nearest neighbours obtained on the testing set is
16.6+-9.17%.

 <dc:description>  Standard higher-order contract monitoring breaks tail recursion and leads to
space leaks that can change a program's asymptotic complexity; space-efficiency
restores tail recursion and bounds the amount of space used by contracts.
Space-efficient contract monitoring for contracts enforcing simple type
disciplines (a/k/a gradual typing) is well studied. Prior work establishes a
space-efficient semantics for manifest contracts without dependency (Greenberg
2015); we adapt that work to a latent calculus with dependency. We guarantee
space efficiency when no dependency is used; we cannot generally guarantee
space efficiency when dependency is used, but instead offer a framework for
making such programs space efficient on a case-by-case basis.

 <dc:description>  Compressed sensing (CS) demonstrates that sparse signals can be estimated
from under-determined linear systems. Distributed CS (DCS) further reduces the
number of measurements by considering joint sparsity within signal ensembles.
DCS with jointly sparse signals has applications in multi-sensor acoustic
sensing, magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, remote sensing, and
array signal processing. Multi-measurement vector (MMV) problems consider the
estimation of jointly sparse signals under the DCS framework. Two related MMV
settings are studied. In the first setting, each signal vector is measured by a
different independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) measurement matrix,
while in the second setting, all signal vectors are measured by the same i.i.d.
matrix. Replica analysis is performed for these two MMV settings, and the
minimum mean squared error (MMSE), which turns out to be identical for both
settings, is obtained as a function of the noise variance and number of
measurements. To showcase the application of MMV models, the MMSE's of complex
CS problems with both real and complex measurement matrices are also analyzed.
Multiple performance regions for MMV are identified where the MMSE behaves
differently as a function of the noise variance and the number of measurements.
  Belief propagation (BP) is a CS signal estimation framework that often
achieves the MMSE asymptotically. A phase transition for BP is identified. This
phase transition, verified by numerical results, separates the regions where BP
achieves the MMSE and where it is suboptimal. Numerical results also illustrate
that more signal vectors in the jointly sparse signal ensemble lead to a better
phase transition.

 <dc:description>  One-class classifiers offer valuable tools to assess the presence of outliers
in data. In this paper, we propose a design methodology for one-class
classifiers based on entropic spanning graphs. Our approach takes into account
the possibility to process also non-numeric data by means of an embedding
procedure. The spanning graph is learned on the embedded input data and the
outcoming partition of vertices defines the classifier. The final partition is
derived by exploiting a criterion based on mutual information minimization.
Here, we compute the mutual information by using a convenient formulation
provided in terms of the $\alpha$-Jensen difference. Once training is
completed, in order to associate a confidence level with the classifier
decision, a graph-based fuzzy model is constructed. The fuzzification process
is based only on topological information of the vertices of the entropic
spanning graph. As such, the proposed one-class classifier is suitable also for
data characterized by complex geometric structures. We provide experiments on
well-known benchmarks containing both feature vectors and labeled graphs. In
addition, we apply the method to the protein solubility recognition problem by
considering several representations for the input samples. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method with
respect to other state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:title>On the Hessian of Shape Matching Energy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fei, Yun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this technical report we derive the analytic form of the Hessian matrix
for shape matching energy. Shape matching is a useful technique for meshless
deformation, which can be easily combined with multiple techniques in real-time
dynamics. Nevertheless, it has been rarely applied in scenarios where implicit
integrators are required, and hence strong viscous damping effect, though
popular in simulation systems nowadays, is forbidden for shape matching. The
reason lies in the difficulty to derive the Hessian matrix of the shape
matching energy. Computing the Hessian matrix correctly, and stably, is the key
to more broadly application of shape matching in implicitly-integrated systems.

 <dc:description>  The use of visual information for the navigation of unmanned ground vehicles
in a cross-country environment recently received great attention. However,
until now, the use of textural information has been somewhat less effective
than color or laser range information. This manuscript reviews the recent
achievements in cross-country scene segmentation and addresses their
shortcomings. It then describes a problem related to classification of high
dimensional texture features. Finally, it compares three machine learning
algorithms aimed at resolving this problem. The experimental results for each
machine learning algorithm with the discussion of comparisons are given at the
end of the manuscript.

 <dc:description>  We give a new, strongly polynomial algorithm and improved analysis of the
metric $s-t$ path TSP. The algorithm finds a tour of cost less than 1.53 times
the optimum of the subtour elimination LP, while known examples show that 1.5
is a lower bound for the integrality gap.
  A key new idea is the deletion of some edges, where the arising connectivity
problems can be solved for a minor extra cost. On the one hand our algorithm
and analysis extend previous tools, at the same time simplifying the framework.
On the other hand new tools are introduced, such as a linear program that
allows us to efficiently choose the probabilities of edges used for analyzing
the reconnection cost and a new way of applying the matroid partition theorem
and algorithm to different matroids, in order to write the subtour elimination
optimum as a particular convex combination of spanning trees.
  Furthermore, the 3/2 target-bound is easily reached in some relevant new
cases.

 <dc:title>Application of Multifractal Analysis to Segmentation of Water Bodies in

 <dc:description>  A method for segmenting water bodies in optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) satellite images is proposed. It makes use of the textural features of
the different regions in the image for segmentation. The method consists in a
multiscale analysis of the images, which allows us to study the images
regularity both, locally and globally. As results of the analysis, coarse
multifractal spectra of studied images and a group of images that associates
each position (pixel) with its corresponding value of local regularity (or
singularity) spectrum are obtained. Thresholds are then applied to the
multifractal spectra of the images for the classification. These thresholds are
selected after studying the characteristics of the spectra under the assumption
that water bodies have larger local regularity than other soil types.
Classifications obtained by the multifractal method are compared quantitatively
with those obtained by neural networks trained to classify the pixels of the
images in covered against uncovered by water. In optical images, the
classifications are also compared with those derived using the so-called
Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI).

 <dc:title>Challenges in Bayesian Adaptive Data Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Elder, Sam</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditional statistical analysis requires that the analysis process and data
are independent. By contrast, the new field of adaptive data analysis hopes to
understand and provide algorithms and accuracy guarantees for research as it is
commonly performed in practice, as an iterative process of interacting
repeatedly with the same data set, such as repeated tests against a holdout
set. Previous work has defined a model with a rather strong lower bound on
sample complexity in terms of the number of queries, $n\sim\sqrt q$, arguing
that adaptive data analysis is much harder than static data analysis, where
$n\sim\log q$ is possible. Instead, we argue that those strong lower bounds
point to a limitation of the previous model in that it must consider wildly
asymmetric scenarios which do not hold in typical applications.
  To better understand other difficulties of adaptivity, we propose a new
Bayesian version of the problem that mandates symmetry. Since the other lower
bound techniques are ruled out, we can more effectively see difficulties that
might otherwise be overshadowed. As a first contribution to this model, we
produce a new problem using error-correcting codes on which a large family of
methods, including all previously proposed algorithms, require roughly
$n\sim\sqrt[4]q$. These early results illustrate new difficulties in adaptive
data analysis regarding slightly correlated queries on problems with
concentrated uncertainty.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a fault-tolerant algorithm for the QR factorization of
general matrices. It relies on the communication-avoiding algorithm, and uses
the structure of the reduction of each part of the computation to introduce
redundancies that are sufficient to recover the state of a failed process.
After a process has failed, its state can be recovered based on the data held
by one process only. Besides, it does not add any significant operation in the
critical path during failure-free execution.

 <dc:title>Word embeddings and recurrent neural networks based on Long-Short Term

 <dc:description>  Word sense disambiguation helps identifying the proper sense of ambiguous
words in text. With large terminologies such as the UMLS Metathesaurus
ambiguities appear and highly effective disambiguation methods are required.
Supervised learning algorithm methods are used as one of the approaches to
perform disambiguation. Features extracted from the context of an ambiguous
word are used to identify the proper sense of such a word. The type of features
have an impact on machine learning methods, thus affect disambiguation
performance. In this work, we have evaluated several types of features derived
from the context of the ambiguous word and we have explored as well more global
features derived from MEDLINE using word embeddings. Results show that word
embeddings improve the performance of more traditional features and allow as
well using recurrent neural network classifiers based on Long-Short Term Memory
(LSTM) nodes. The combination of unigrams and word embeddings with an SVM sets
a new state of the art performance with a macro accuracy of 95.97 in the MSH
WSD data set.

 <dc:description>  We propose a computational model of situated language comprehension based on
the Indexical Hypothesis that generates meaning representations by translating
amodal linguistic symbols to modal representations of beliefs, knowledge, and
experience external to the linguistic system. This Indexical Model incorporates
multiple information sources, including perceptions, domain knowledge, and
short-term and long-term experiences during comprehension. We show that
exploiting diverse information sources can alleviate ambiguities that arise
from contextual use of underspecific referring expressions and unexpressed
argument alternations of verbs. The model is being used to support linguistic
interactions in Rosie, an agent implemented in Soar that learns from
instruction.

 <dc:description>  With the development of wireless communication, industrial wireless sensor
networks (IWSNs) plays an important role in monitoring and control systems. In
this paper, we extend the application of IWSNs into High Frequency Surface-Wave
Radar (HFSWR) system. The traditional antenna is replaced by mobile IWSNs. In
combination of the application precondition of super-directivity in HF band and
circular topology of IWSNs, a super-directivity synthesis method is presented
for designing super-directivity array. In this method, the dominance of
external noise is ensured by constraining the Ratio of External to Internal
Noise (REIN) of the array, and the desired side lobe level is achieved by
implementing linear constraint. By using this method, the highest directivity
will be achieved in certain conditions. Using the designed super directive
circular array as sub-arrays, the compact receive antenna array is constructed,
the purpose of miniaturization is achieved. Simulation verifies that the
proposed method is correct and effective, the validity of the proposed method
has been proved.

 <dc:description>  Relaying is an effective technique to achieve reliable wireless connectivity
in harsh communication environment. However, most of the existing relaying
schemes are based on relays with fixed locations, or \emph{static relaying}. In
this paper, we consider a novel \emph{mobile relaying} technique, where the
relay nodes are assumed to be capable of moving at high speed. Compared to
static relaying, mobile relaying offers a new degree of freedom for performance
enhancement via careful relay trajectory design. We study the throughput
maximization problem in mobile relaying systems by optimizing the source/relay
transmit power along with the relay trajectory, subject to practical mobility
constraints (on the relay speed and initial/final relay locations), as well as
the \emph{information-causality constraint} at the relay owing to its
decode-store-and-forward (DSF) strategy. It is shown that for fixed relay
trajectory, the throughput-optimal source/relay power allocations over time
follow a &quot;staircase&quot; water filling (WF) structure, with \emph{non-increasing}
and \emph{non-decreasing} water levels at the source and relay, respectively.
On the other hand, with given power allocations, the throughput can be further
improved by optimizing the relay trajectory via successive convex optimization.
An iterative algorithm is thus proposed to optimize the power allocations and
relay trajectory alternately. Furthermore, for the special case with free
initial and final relay locations, the jointly optimal power allocation and
relay trajectory are derived. Numerical results show that by optimizing the
trajectory of the relay and power allocations adaptive to its induced channel
variation, mobile relaying is able to achieve significant throughput gains over
the conventional static relaying.

 <dc:description>  Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) will connect billions of small computing
devices embedded in the environment and support their device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Powering this massive number of embedded devices is a key
challenge of designing IoT since batteries increase the devices' form factors
and their recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel network architecture that integrates wireless power transfer
and backscatter communication, called wirelessly powered backscatter
communication (WP-BC) networks. In this architecture, power beacons (PBs) are
deployed for wirelessly powering devices; their ad-hoc communication relies on
backscattering and modulating incident continuous waves from PBs, which
consumes orders-of-magnitude less power than traditional radios. Thereby, the
dense deployment of low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a
large-scale IoT. In this paper, a WP-BC network is modeled as a random Poisson
cluster process in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and
active ad-hoc pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation
distances form random clusters centered at PBs. Furthermore, by harvesting
energy from and backscattering radio frequency (RF) waves transmitted by PBs,
the transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated
PB. Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and
transmission capacity are derived and optimized as functions of the backscatter
duty cycle and reflection coefficient as well as the PB density. The effects of
the parameters on network performance are characterized.

 <dc:title>Multiuser Resource Allocation for Mobile-Edge Computation Offloading</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) offloads intensive mobile
computation to clouds located at the edges of cellular networks. Thereby, MECO
is envisioned as a promising technique for prolonging the battery lives and
enhancing the computation capacities of mobiles. In this paper, we consider
resource allocation in a MECO system comprising multiple users that time share
a single edge cloud and have different computation loads. The optimal resource
allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem for minimizing the
weighted sum mobile energy consumption under constraint on computation latency
and for both the cases of infinite and finite edge cloud computation
capacities. The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based structure
with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields priorities
for users according to their channel gains and local computing energy
consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given
threshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Computing the
threshold requires iterative computation. To reduce the complexity, a
sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is proposed and shown by simulation
to have close-to-optimal performance.

 <dc:description>  Musicologists and sociologists have long been interested in patterns of music
consumption and their relation to socioeconomic status. In particular, the
Omnivore Thesis examines the relationship between these variables and the
diversity of music a person consumes. Using data from social media users of
Last.fm and Twitter, we design and evaluate a measure that reasonably captures
diversity of musical tastes. We use that measure to explore associations
between musical diversity and variables that capture socioeconomic status,
demographics, and personal traits such as openness and degree of interest in
music (into-ness). Our musical diversity measure can provide a useful means for
studies of musical preferences and consumption. Also, our study of the Omnivore
Thesis provides insights that extend previous survey and interview-based
studies.

 <dc:description>  The AUV three-dimension path planning in complex turbulent underwater
environment is investigated in this research, in which static current map data
and uncertain static-moving time variant obstacles are taken into account.
Robustness of AUVs path planning to this strong variability is known as a
complex NP-hard problem and is considered a critical issue to ensure vehicles
safe deployment. Efficient evolutionary techniques have substantial potential
of handling NP hard complexity of path planning problem as more powerful and
fast algorithms among other approaches for mentioned problem. For the purpose
of this research Differential Evolution (DE) technique is conducted to solve
the AUV path planning problem in a realistic underwater environment. The path
planners designed in this paper are capable of extracting feasible areas of a
real map to determine the allowed spaces for deployment, where coastal area,
islands, static/dynamic obstacles and ocean current is taken into account and
provides the efficient path with a small computation time. The results obtained
from analyze of experimental demonstrate the inherent robustness and drastic
efficiency of the proposed scheme in enhancement of the vehicles path planning
capability in coping undesired current, using useful current flow, and avoid
colliding collision boundaries in a real-time manner. The proposed approach is
also flexible and strictly respects to vehicle's kinematic constraints
resisting current instabilities.

 <dc:description>  Feedback mechanism based algorithms are frequently used to solve network
optimization problems. These schemes involve users and network exchanging
information (e.g. requests for bandwidth allocation and pricing) to achieve
convergence towards an optimal solution. However, in the implementation, these
algorithms do not guarantee that messages will be delivered to the destination
when network congestion occurs. This in turn often results in packet drops,
which may cause information loss, and this condition may lead to algorithm
failing to converge. To prevent this failure, we propose least square (LS)
estimation algorithm to recover the missing information when packets are
dropped from the network. The simulation results involving several scenarios
demonstrate that LS estimation can provide the convergence for feedback
mechanism based algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Given a sparse matrix $A$, the selected inversion algorithm is an efficient
method for computing certain selected elements of $A^{-1}$. These selected
elements correspond to all or some nonzero elements of the LU factors of $A$.
In many ways, the type of matrix updates performed in the selected inversion
algorithm is similar to that performed in the LU factorization, although the
sequence of operation is different. In the context of LU factorization, it is
known that the left-looking and right-looking algorithms exhibit different
memory access and data communication patterns, and hence different behavior on
shared memory and distributed memory parallel machines. Corresponding to
right-looking and left-looking LU factorization, selected inversion algorithm
can be organized as a left-looking and a right-looking algorithm. The parallel
right-looking version of the algorithm has been developed in [1]. The sequence
of operations performed in this version of the selected inversion algorithm is
similar to those performed in a left-looking LU factorization algorithm. In
this paper, we describe the left-looking variant of the selected inversion
algorithm, and based on task parallel method, present an efficient
implementation of the algorithm for shared memory machines. We demonstrate that
with the task scheduling features provided by OpenMP 4.0, the left-looking
selected inversion algorithm can scale well both on the Intel Haswell multicore
architecture and on the Intel Knights Corner (KNC) manycore architecture.
Compared to the right-looking selected inversion algorithm, the left-looking
formulation facilitates pipelining of work along different branches of the
elimination tree, and can be a promising candidate for future development of
massively parallel selected inversion algorithms on heterogeneous architecture.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel large-scale dataset and comprehensive baselines for
end-to-end pedestrian detection and person recognition in raw video frames. Our
baselines address three issues: the performance of various combinations of
detectors and recognizers, mechanisms for pedestrian detection to help improve
overall re-identification accuracy and assessing the effectiveness of different
detectors for re-identification. We make three distinct contributions. First, a
new dataset, PRW, is introduced to evaluate Person Re-identification in the
Wild, using videos acquired through six synchronized cameras. It contains 932
identities and 11,816 frames in which pedestrians are annotated with their
bounding box positions and identities. Extensive benchmarking results are
presented on this dataset. Second, we show that pedestrian detection aids
re-identification through two simple yet effective improvements: a
discriminatively trained ID-discriminative Embedding (IDE) in the person
subspace using convolutional neural network (CNN) features and a Confidence
Weighted Similarity (CWS) metric that incorporates detection scores into
similarity measurement. Third, we derive insights in evaluating detector
performance for the particular scenario of accurate person re-identification.

 <dc:description>  The state-of-the-art performance for object detection has been significantly
improved over the past two years. Besides the introduction of powerful deep
neural networks such as GoogleNet and VGG, novel object detection frameworks
such as R-CNN and its successors, Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, play an
essential role in improving the state-of-the-art. Despite their effectiveness
on still images, those frameworks are not specifically designed for object
detection from videos. Temporal and contextual information of videos are not
fully investigated and utilized. In this work, we propose a deep learning
framework that incorporates temporal and contextual information from tubelets
obtained in videos, which dramatically improves the baseline performance of
existing still-image detection frameworks when they are applied to videos. It
is called T-CNN, i.e. tubelets with convolutional neueral networks. The
proposed framework won the recently introduced object-detection-from-video
(VID) task with provided data in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition
Challenge 2015 (ILSVRC2015).

 <dc:description>  This paper studies two design tasks faced by a geo-distributed cloud data
market: which data to purchase (data purchasing) and where to place/replicate
the data for delivery (data placement). We show that the joint problem of data
purchasing and data placement within a cloud data market can be viewed as a
facility location problem, and is thus NP-hard. However, we give a provably
optimal algorithm for the case of a data market made up of a single data
center, and then generalize the structure from the single data center setting
in order to develop a near-optimal, polynomial-time algorithm for a
geo-distributed data market. The resulting design, Datum, decomposes the joint
purchasing and placement problem into two subproblems, one for data purchasing
and one for data placement, using a transformation of the underlying bandwidth
costs. We show, via a case study, that Datum is near-optimal (within 1.6%) in
practical settings.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel retrieval pipeline for video collections, which
aims to retrieve the most significant parts of an edited video for a given
query, and represent them with thumbnails which are at the same time
semantically meaningful and aesthetically remarkable. Videos are first
segmented into coherent and story-telling scenes, then a retrieval algorithm
based on deep learning is proposed to retrieve the most significant scenes for
a textual query. A ranking strategy based on deep features is finally used to
tackle the problem of visualizing the best thumbnail. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments are conducted on a collection of edited videos to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:title>A finite alternation result for reversible boolean circuits</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Selinger, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We say that a reversible boolean function on n bits has alternation depth d
if it can be written as the sequential composition of d reversible boolean
functions, each of which acts only on the top n-1 bits or on the bottom n-1
bits. Moreover, if the functions on n-1 bits are even, we speak of even
alternation depth. We show that every even reversible boolean function of n &gt;=
4 bits has alternation depth at most 9 and even alternation depth at most 13.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a data structure, a quadruple neighbor list
(QN-list, for short), to support real time queries of all longest increasing
subsequence (LIS) and LIS with constraints over sequential data streams. The
QN-List built by our algorithm requires $O(w)$ space, where $w$ is the time
window size. The running time for building the initial QN-List takes $O(w\log
w)$ time. Applying the QN-List, insertion of the new item takes $O(\log w)$
time and deletion of the first item takes $O(w)$ time. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to support both LIS enumeration and LIS with
constraints computation by using a single uniform data structure for real time
sequential data streams. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
both time and space cost, not only theoretically, but also empirically.

 <dc:title>The Complexity of Computing a Fourier Perturbation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ailon, Nir</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yehuda, Gal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The complexity of computing the Fourier transform is a longstanding open
problem. Very recently, Ailon (2013, 2014, 2015) showed in a collection of
papers that, roughly speaking, a speedup of the Fourier transform computation
implies numerical ill-condition. The papers also quantify this tradeoff. The
main method for proving these results is via a potential function called
quasi-entropy, reminiscent of Shannon entropy. The quasi-entropy method opens
new doors to understanding the computational complexity of the important
Fourier transformation. However, it suffers from various drawbacks. This paper,
motivated by one such drawback, eliminates it by extending the method.

 <dc:description>  Modern day wireless networks have tremendously evolved driven by a sharp
increase in user demands, continuously requesting more data and services. This
puts significant strain on infrastructure based macro cellular networks due to
the inefficiency in handling these traffic demands, cost effectively. A viable
solution is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as intermediate aerial
nodes between the macro and small cell tiers for improving coverage and
boosting capacity. This letter investigates the problem of user demand based
UAV assignment over geographical areas subject to high traffic demands. A
neural based cost function approach is formulated in which UAVs are matched to
a particular geographical area. It is shown that leveraging multiple UAVs not
only provides long range connectivity but also better load balancing and
traffic offload. Simulation study demonstrate that the proposed approach yields
significant improvements in terms of 5th percentile spectral efficiency up to
38\% and reduced delays up to 37.5\% compared to a ground-based network
baseline without UAVs.

 <dc:description>  Scientific abstracts contain what is considered by the author(s) as
information that best describe documents' content. They represent a compressed
view of the informational content of a document and allow readers to evaluate
the relevance of the document to a particular information need. However, little
is known on their composition. This paper contributes to the understanding of
the structure of abstracts, by comparing similarity between scientific
abstracts and the text content of research articles. More specifically, using
sentence-based similarity metrics, we quantify the phenomenon of text re-use in
abstracts and examine the positions of the sentences that are similar to
sentences in abstracts in the IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results
and Discussion), using a corpus of over 85,000 research articles published in
the seven PLOS journals. We provide evidence that 84% of abstract have at least
one sentence in common with the body of the article. Our results also show that
the sections of the paper from which abstract sentence are taken are invariant
across the PLOS journals, with sentences mainly coming from the beginning of
the introduction and the end of the conclusion.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including long short-term memory (LSTM)
RNNs, have produced state-of-the-art results on a variety of speech recognition
tasks. However, these models are often too large in size for deployment on
mobile devices with memory and latency constraints. In this work, we study
mechanisms for learning compact RNNs and LSTMs via low-rank factorizations and
parameter sharing schemes. Our goal is to investigate redundancies in recurrent
architectures where compression can be admitted without losing performance. A
hybrid strategy of using structured matrices in the bottom layers and shared
low-rank factors on the top layers is found to be particularly effective,
reducing the parameters of a standard LSTM by 75%, at a small cost of 0.3%
increase in WER, on a 2,000-hr English Voice Search task.

 <dc:title>Can Uplink Transmissions Survive in Full-duplex Cellular Environments?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In-band full-duplex (FD) communication is considered a potential candidate to
be adopted by the fifth generation (5G) cellular networks. FD communication
renders the entire spectrum simultaneously accessible by uplink and downlink,
and hence, is optimistically promoted to double the transmission rate. While
this is true for a single communication link, cross-mode interference (i.e.,
interference between uplink and downlink) may diminish the full-duplexing gain.
This paper studies FD operation in large-scale cellular networks with real base
stations (BSs) locations and 3GPP propagation environment. The results show
that the uplink is the bottleneck for FD operation due to the overwhelming
cross-mode interference from BSs. Operating uplink and downlink on a common set
of channels in an FD fashion improves the downlink rate but significantly
degrades (over 1000-fold) the uplink rate. Therefore, we propose the
$\alpha$-duplex scheme to balance the tradeoff between the uplink and downlink
rates via adjustable partial overlap between uplink and downlink channels. The
$\alpha$-duplex scheme can provide a simultaneous $30\%$ improvement in each of
the uplink and downlink rates. To this end, we discuss the backward
compatibility of the $\alpha$-duplex scheme with half-duplex user-terminals.
Finally, we point out future research directions for FD enabled cellular
networks.

 <dc:description>  We survey the prospects for an Information Dynamics which can serve as the
basis for a fundamental theory of information, incorporating qualitative and
structural as well as quantitative aspects. We motivate our discussion with
some basic conceptual puzzles: how can information increase in computation, and
what is it that we are actually computing in general? Then we survey a number
of the theories which have been developed within Computer Science, as partial
exemplifications of the kind of fundamental theory which we seek: including
Domain Theory, Dynamic Logic, and Process Algebra. We look at recent work
showing new ways of combining quantitative and qualitative theories of
information, as embodied respectively by Domain Theory and Shannon Information
Theory. Then we look at Game Semantics and Geometry of Interaction, as examples
of dynamic models of logic and computation in which information flow and
interaction are made central and explicit. We conclude by looking briefly at
some key issues for future progress.

 <dc:description>  The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from mixed populations has become
important in the study of cancer evolution, as sequencing is often performed on
bulk tumor tissue containing mixed populations of cells. Recent work has shown
how to reconstruct a perfect phylogeny tree from samples that contain mixtures
of two-state characters, where each character/locus is either mutated or not.
However, most cancers contain more complex mutations, such as copy-number
aberrations, that exhibit more than two states. We formulate the Multi-State
Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution Problem of reconstructing a multi-state
perfect phylogeny tree given mixtures of the leaves of the tree. We
characterize the solutions of this problem as a restricted class of spanning
trees in a graph constructed from the input data, and prove that the problem is
NP-complete. We derive an algorithm to enumerate such trees in the important
special case of cladisitic characters, where the ordering of the states of each
character is given. We apply our algorithm to simulated data and to two cancer
datasets. On simulated data, we find that for a small number of samples, the
Multi-State Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution Problem often has many
solutions, but that this ambiguity declines quickly as the number of samples
increases. On real data, we recover copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity,
single-copy amplification and single-copy deletion events, as well as their
interactions with single-nucleotide variants.

 <dc:description>  Traditional classification algorithms assume that training and test data come
from similar distributions. This assumption is violated in adversarial
settings, where malicious actors modify instances to evade detection. A number
of custom methods have been developed for both adversarial evasion attacks and
robust learning. We propose the first systematic and general-purpose retraining
framework which can: a) boost robustness of an \emph{arbitrary} learning
algorithm, in the face of b) a broader class of adversarial models than any
prior methods. We show that, under natural conditions, the retraining framework
minimizes an upper bound on optimal adversarial risk, and show how to extend
this result to account for approximations of evasion attacks. Extensive
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our retraining methods are nearly
indistinguishable from state-of-the-art algorithms for optimizing adversarial
risk, but are more general and far more scalable. The experiments also confirm
that without retraining, our adversarial framework dramatically reduces the
effectiveness of learning. In contrast, retraining significantly boosts
robustness to evasion attacks without significantly compromising overall
accuracy.

 <dc:description>  As the amount of scientific data continues to grow at ever faster rates, the
research community is increasingly in need of flexible computational
infrastructure that can support the entirety of the data science lifecycle,
including long-term data storage, data exploration and discovery services, and
compute capabilities to support data analysis and re-analysis, as new data are
added and as scientific pipelines are refined. We describe our experience
developing data commons-- interoperable infrastructure that co-locates data,
storage, and compute with common analysis tools--and present several cases
studies. Across these case studies, several common requirements emerge,
including the need for persistent digital identifier and metadata services,
APIs, data portability, pay for compute capabilities, and data peering
agreements between data commons. Though many challenges, including
sustainability and developing appropriate standards remain, interoperable data
commons bring us one step closer to effective Data Science as Service for the
scientific research community.

 <dc:description>  Network topology inference is a cornerstone problem in statistical analyses
of complex systems. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates
benefits from convex optimization and graph signal processing, to identify the
so-termed graph shift operator (encoding the network topology) given only the
eigenvectors of the shift. These spectral templates can be obtained, for
example, from principal component analysis of a set of graph signals defined on
the particular network. The novel idea is to find a graph shift that while
being consistent with the provided spectral information, it endows the network
structure with certain desired properties such as sparsity. The focus is on
developing efficient recovery algorithms along with identifiability conditions
for two particular shifts, the adjacency matrix and the normalized graph
Laplacian. Application domains include network topology identification from
steady-state signals generated by a diffusion process, and design of a graph
filter that facilitates the distributed implementation of a prescribed linear
network operator. Numerical tests showcase the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms in recovering synthetic and structural brain networks.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach to perform sentiment analysis of news
videos, based on the fusion of audio, textual and visual clues extracted from
their contents. The proposed approach aims at contributing to the
semiodiscoursive study regarding the construction of the ethos (identity) of
this media universe, which has become a central part of the modern-day lives of
millions of people. To achieve this goal, we apply state-of-the-art
computational methods for (1) automatic emotion recognition from facial
expressions, (2) extraction of modulations in the participants' speeches and
(3) sentiment analysis from the closed caption associated to the videos of
interest. More specifically, we compute features, such as, visual intensities
of recognized emotions, field sizes of participants, voicing probability, sound
loudness, speech fundamental frequencies and the sentiment scores (polarities)
from text sentences in the closed caption. Experimental results with a dataset
containing 520 annotated news videos from three Brazilian and one American
popular TV newscasts show that our approach achieves an accuracy of up to 84%
in the sentiments (tension levels) classification task, thus demonstrating its
high potential to be used by media analysts in several applications,
especially, in the journalistic domain.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel representation of structured polynomial ideals, which we
refer to as chordal networks. The sparsity structure of a polynomial system is
often described by a graph that captures the interactions among the variables.
Chordal networks provide a computationally convenient decomposition into
simpler (triangular) polynomial sets, while preserving the underlying graphical
structure. We show that many interesting families of polynomial ideals admit
compact chordal network representations (of size linear in the number of
variables), even though the number of components is exponentially large.
Chordal networks can be computed for arbitrary polynomial systems using a
refinement of the chordal elimination algorithm from [Cifuentes-Parrilo-2016].
Furthermore, they can be effectively used to obtain several properties of the
variety, such as its dimension, cardinality, and equidimensional components, as
well as an efficient probabilistic test for radical ideal membership. We apply
our methods to examples from algebraic statistics and vector addition systems;
for these instances, algorithms based on chordal networks outperform existing
techniques by orders of magnitude.

 <dc:title>TextProposals: a Text-specific Selective Search Algorithm for Word
  Spotting in the Wild</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by the success of powerful while expensive techniques to recognize
words in a holistic way, object proposals techniques emerge as an alternative
to the traditional text detectors. In this paper we introduce a novel object
proposals method that is specifically designed for text. We rely on a
similarity based region grouping algorithm that generates a hierarchy of word
hypotheses. Over the nodes of this hierarchy it is possible to apply a holistic
word recognition method in an efficient way.
  Our experiments demonstrate that the presented method is superior in its
ability of producing good quality word proposals when compared with
class-independent algorithms. We show impressive recall rates with a few
thousand proposals in different standard benchmarks, including focused or
incidental text datasets, and multi-language scenarios. Moreover, the
combination of our object proposals with existing whole-word recognizers shows
competitive performance in end-to-end word spotting, and, in some benchmarks,
outperforms previously published results. Concretely, in the challenging
ICDAR2015 Incidental Text dataset, we overcome in more than 10 percent f-score
the best-performing method in the last ICDAR Robust Reading Competition. Source
code of the complete end-to-end system is available at

 <dc:description>  We revisit the development of grid based recursive approximate filtering of
general Markov processes in discrete time, partially observed in conditionally
Gaussian noise. The grid based filters considered rely on two types of state
quantization: The \textit{Markovian} type and the \textit{marginal} type. We
propose a set of novel, relaxed sufficient conditions, ensuring strong and
fully characterized pathwise convergence of these filters to the respective
MMSE state estimator. In particular, for marginal state quantizations, we
introduce the notion of \textit{conditional regularity of stochastic kernels},
which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most relaxed condition
proposed, under which asymptotic optimality of the respective grid based
filters is guaranteed. Further, we extend our convergence results, including
filtering of bounded and continuous functionals of the state, as well as
recursive approximate state prediction. For both Markovian and marginal
quantizations, the whole development of the respective grid based filters
relies more on linear-algebraic techniques and less on measure theoretic
arguments, making the presentation considerably shorter and technically
simpler.

 <dc:description>  We propose a unified and systematic framework for performing online
nonnegative matrix factorization in the presence of outliers. Our framework is
particularly suited to large-scale data. We propose two solvers based on
projected gradient descent and the alternating direction method of multipliers.
We prove that the sequence of objective values converges almost surely by
appealing to the quasi-martingale convergence theorem. We also show the
sequence of learned dictionaries converges to the set of stationary points of
the expected loss function almost surely. In addition, we extend our basic
problem formulation to various settings with different constraints and
regularizers. We also adapt the solvers and analyses to each setting. We
perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. These
experiments demonstrate the computational efficiency and efficacy of our
algorithms on tasks such as (parts-based) basis learning, image denoising,
shadow removal and foreground-background separation.

 <dc:description>  Soaring capacity and coverage demands dictate that future cellular networks
need to soon migrate towards ultra-dense networks. However, network
densification comes with a host of challenges that include compromised energy
efficiency, complex interference management, cumbersome mobility management,
burdensome signaling overheads and higher backhaul costs. Interestingly, most
of the problems, that beleaguer network densification, stem from legacy
networks' one common feature i.e., tight coupling between the control and data
planes regardless of their degree of heterogeneity and cell density.
Consequently, in wake of 5G, control and data planes separation architecture
(SARC) has recently been conceived as a promising paradigm that has potential
to address most of aforementioned challenges. In this article, we review
various proposals that have been presented in literature so far to enable SARC.
More specifically, we analyze how and to what degree various SARC proposals
address the four main challenges in network densification namely: energy
efficiency, system level capacity maximization, interference management and
mobility management. We then focus on two salient features of future cellular
networks that have not yet been adapted in legacy networks at wide scale and
thus remain a hallmark of 5G, i.e., coordinated multipoint (CoMP), and
device-to-device (D2D) communications. After providing necessary background on
CoMP and D2D, we analyze how SARC can particularly act as a major enabler for
CoMP and D2D in context of 5G. This article thus serves as both a tutorial as
well as an up to date survey on SARC, CoMP and D2D. Most importantly, the
article provides an extensive outlook of challenges and opportunities that lie
at the crossroads of these three mutually entangled emerging technologies.

 <dc:description>  The success of deep neural networks is mostly due their ability to learn
meaningful features from the data. Features learned in the hidden layers of
deep neural networks trained in computer vision tasks have been shown to be
similar to mid-level vision features. We leverage this fact in this work and
propose the visualization regularizer for image tasks. The proposed
regularization technique enforces smoothness of the features learned by hidden
nodes and turns out to be a special case of Tikhonov regularization. We achieve
higher classification accuracy as compared to existing regularizers such as the
L2 norm regularizer and dropout, on benchmark datasets without changing the
training computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the concept of unconstrained real-time 3D facial performance
capture through explicit semantic segmentation in the RGB input. To ensure
robustness, cutting edge supervised learning approaches rely on large training
datasets of face images captured in the wild. While impressive tracking quality
has been demonstrated for faces that are largely visible, any occlusion due to
hair, accessories, or hand-to-face gestures would result in significant visual
artifacts and loss of tracking accuracy. The modeling of occlusions has been
mostly avoided due to its immense space of appearance variability. To address
this curse of high dimensionality, we perform tracking in unconstrained images
assuming non-face regions can be fully masked out. Along with recent
breakthroughs in deep learning, we demonstrate that pixel-level facial
segmentation is possible in real-time by repurposing convolutional neural
networks designed originally for general semantic segmentation. We develop an
efficient architecture based on a two-stream deconvolution network with
complementary characteristics, and introduce carefully designed training
samples and data augmentation strategies for improved segmentation accuracy and
robustness. We adopt a state-of-the-art regression-based facial tracking
framework with segmented face images as training, and demonstrate accurate and
uninterrupted facial performance capture in the presence of extreme occlusion
and even side views. Furthermore, the resulting segmentation can be directly
used to composite partial 3D face models on the input images and enable
seamless facial manipulation tasks, such as virtual make-up or face
replacement.

 <dc:description>  We present a hierarchical regression framework for estimating hand joint
positions from single depth images based on local surface normals. The
hierarchical regression follows the tree structured topology of hand from wrist
to finger tips. We propose a conditional regression forest, i.e., the Frame
Conditioned Regression Forest (FCRF) which uses a new normal difference
feature. At each stage of the regression, the frame of reference is established
from either the local surface normal or previously estimated hand joints. By
making the regression with respect to the local frame, the pose estimation is
more robust to rigid transformations. We also introduce a new efficient
approximation to estimate surface normals. We verify the effectiveness of our
method by conducting experiments on two challenging real-world datasets and
show consistent improvements over previous discriminative pose estimation
methods.

 <dc:title>Sub-Nyquist Cyclostationary Detection for Cognitive Radio</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cohen, Deborah</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Eldar, Yonina C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cognitive Radio requires efficient and reliable spectrum sensing of wideband
signals. In order to cope with the sampling rate bottleneck, new sampling
methods have been proposed that sample below the Nyquist rate. However, such
techniques decrease the signal to noise ratio (SNR), deteriorating the
performance of subsequent energy detection. Cyclostationary detection, which
exploits the periodic property of communication signal statistics, absent in
stationary noise, is a natural candidate for this setting. In this work, we
consider cyclic spectrum recovery from sub-Nyquist samples, in order to achieve
both efficiency and robustness to noise. To that end, we propose a structured
compressed sensing algorithm, that extends orthogonal matching pursuit to
account for the structure imposed by cyclostationarity. Next, we derive a lower
bound on the sampling rate required for perfect cyclic spectrum recovery in the
presence of stationary noise and show that it can be reconstructed from samples
obtained below Nyquist, without any sparsity constraints on the signal. In
particular, in non sparse settings, the cyclic spectrum can be recovered at
$4/5$ of the Nyquist rate. If the signal of interest is sparse, then the
sampling rate may be further reduced to $8/5$ of the Landau rate. Once the
cyclic spectrum is recovered, we estimate the number of transmissions that
compose the input signal, along with their carrier frequencies and bandwidths.
Simulations show that cyclostationary detection outperforms energy detection in
low SNRs in the sub-Nyquist regime. This was already known in the Nyquist
regime, but is even more pronounced at sub-Nyquist sampling rates.

 <dc:description>  The cooperative transmission is an effective approach for vehicular
communications to improve the wireless transmission capacity and reliability in
the fifth generation (5G) small cell networks. Based on distances between the
vehicle and cooperative small cell BSs, the cooperative probability and the
coverage probability have been derived for 5G cooperative small cell networks
where small cell base stations (BSs) follow Poisson point process
distributions. Furthermore, the vehicular handoff rate and the vehicular
overhead ratio have been proposed to evaluate the vehicular mobility
performance in 5G cooperative small cell networks. To balance the vehicular
communication capacity and the vehicular handoff ratio, an optimal vehicular
overhead ratio can be achieved by adjusting the cooperative threshold of 5G
cooperative small cell networks.

 <dc:description>  With the massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antennas technology adopted
for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems, a large number of
radio frequency (RF) chains have to be employed for RF circuits. However, a
large number of RF chains not only increase the cost of RF circuits but also
consume additional energy in 5G wireless communication systems. In this paper
we investigate energy and cost efficiency optimization solutions for 5G
wireless communication systems with a large number of antennas and RF chains.
An energy efficiency optimization problem is formulated for 5G wireless
communication systems using massive MIMO antennas and millimeter wave
technology. Considering the nonconcave feature of the objective function, a
suboptimal iterative algorithm, i.e., the energy efficient hybrid precoding
(EEHP) algorithm is developed for maximizing the energy efficiency of 5G
wireless communication systems. To reduce the cost of RF circuits, the energy
efficient hybrid precoding with the minimum number of RF chains (EEHP-MRFC)
algorithm is also proposed. Moreover, the critical number of antennas searching
(CNAS) and user equipment number optimization (UENO) algorithms are further
developed to optimize the energy efficiency of 5G wireless communication
systems by the number of transmit antennas and UEs. Compared with the maximum
energy efficiency of conventional zero-forcing (ZF) precoding algorithm,
numerical results indicate that the maximum energy efficiency of the proposed
EEHP and EEHP-MRFC algorithms are improved by 220% and 171%, respectively.

 <dc:description>  We develop a quasi-polynomial time Las Vegas algorithm for approximating Nash
equilibria in polymatrix games over trees, under a mild renormalizing
assumption. Our result, in particular, leads to an expected polynomial-time
algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of tree polymatrix games in
which the number of actions per player is a fixed constant. Further, for trees
with constant degree, the running time of the algorithm matches the best known
upper bound for approximating Nash equilibria in bimatrix games (Lipton,
Markakis, and Mehta 2003).
  Notably, this work closely complements the hardness result of Rubinstein
(2015), which establishes the inapproximability of Nash equilibria in
polymatrix games over constant-degree bipartite graphs with two actions per
player.

 <dc:description>  The morphology of glands has been used routinely by pathologists to assess
the malignancy degree of adenocarcinomas. Accurate segmentation of glands from
histology images is a crucial step to obtain reliable morphological statistics
for quantitative diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed an efficient deep
contour-aware network (DCAN) to solve this challenging problem under a unified
multi-task learning framework. In the proposed network, multi-level contextual
features from the hierarchical architecture are explored with auxiliary
supervision for accurate gland segmentation. When incorporated with multi-task
regularization during the training, the discriminative capability of
intermediate features can be further improved. Moreover, our network can not
only output accurate probability maps of glands, but also depict clear contours
simultaneously for separating clustered objects, which further boosts the gland
segmentation performance. This unified framework can be efficient when applied
to large-scale histopathological data without resorting to additional steps to
generate contours based on low-level cues for post-separating. Our method won
the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge out of 13 competitive teams,
surpassing all the other methods by a significant margin.

 <dc:title>The Intensity Matching Approach: A Tractable Stochastic Geometry
  Approximation to System-Level Analysis of Cellular Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The intensity matching approach for tractable performance evaluation and
optimization of cellular networks is introduced. It assumes that the base
stations are modeled as points of a Poisson point process and leverages
stochastic geometry for system-level analysis. Its rationale relies on
observing that system-level performance is determined by the intensity measure
of transformations of the underlaying spatial Poisson point process. By
approximating the original system model with a simplified one, whose
performance is determined by a mathematically convenient intensity measure,
tractable yet accurate integral expressions for computing area spectral
efficiency and potential throughput are provided. The considered system model
accounts for many practical aspects that, for tractability, are typically
neglected, e.g., line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation, antenna
radiation patterns, traffic load, practical cell associations, general fading
channels. The proposed approach, more importantly, is conveniently formulated
for unveiling the impact of several system parameters, e.g., the density of
base stations and blockages. The effectiveness of this novel and general
methodology is validated with the aid of empirical data for the locations of
base stations and for the footprints of buildings in dense urban environments.

concepts of $n\times n$ $\Pi_n$-matrix and disjoint $\Pi_n$-matrices. The
article, using the set-theoretical approach, describes an algorithm for
obtaining $n^2$-tuples of $n\times n$ mutually disjoint $\Pi_n$ matrices. We
show that in input $n^2$ mutually disjoint $\Pi_n$ matrices, it is not
difficult to receive a Sudoku matrix.

 <dc:description>  Social status refers to the relative position within the society. It is an
important notion in sociology and related research. The problem of measuring
social status has been studied for many years. Various indicators are proposed
to assess social status of individuals, including educational attainment,
occupation, and income/wealth. However, these indicators are sometimes
difficult to collect or measure.
  We investigate social networks for alternative measures of social status.
Online activities expose certain traits of users in the real world. We are
interested in how these activities are related to social status, and how social
status can be predicted with social network data. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study on connecting online activities with social status in
reality.
  In particular, we focus on the network structure of microblogs in this study.
A user following another implies some kind of status. We cast the predicted
social status of users to the &quot;status&quot; of real-world entities, e.g.,
universities, occupations, and regions, so that we can compare and validate
predicted results with facts in the real world. We propose an efficient
algorithm for this task and evaluate it on a dataset consisting of 3.4 million
users from Sina Weibo. The result shows that it is possible to predict social
status with reasonable accuracy using social network data. We also point out
challenges and limitations of this approach, e.g., inconsistence between online
popularity and real-world status for certain users. Our findings provide
insights on analyzing online social status and future designs of ranking
schemes for social networks.

 <dc:description>  Human 3D pose estimation from a single image is a challenging task with
numerous applications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently
achieved superior performance on the task of 2D pose estimation from a single
image, by training on images with 2D annotations collected by crowd sourcing.
This suggests that similar success could be achieved for direct estimation of
3D poses. However, 3D poses are much harder to annotate, and the lack of
suitable annotated training images hinders attempts towards end-to-end
solutions. To address this issue, we opt to automatically synthesize training
images with ground truth pose annotations. Our work is a systematic study along
this road. We find that pose space coverage and texture diversity are the key
ingredients for the effectiveness of synthetic training data. We present a
fully automatic, scalable approach that samples the human pose space for
guiding the synthesis procedure and extracts clothing textures from real
images. Furthermore, we explore domain adaptation for bridging the gap between
our synthetic training images and real testing photos. We demonstrate that CNNs
trained with our synthetic images out-perform those trained with real photos on
3D pose estimation tasks.

 <dc:description>  Optimal operation of a country's air transport infrastructure plays a major
role in the economic development of nations. Due to the increasing use of air
transportation in today's world, flights' boarding times have become a concern
for both airlines and airports, thus the importance of knowing beforehand how
changes in flights demand parameters and physical airport layout will affect
passengers flow and boarding times. This paper presents a pedestrian modeling
study in which a national airport passenger flow was analyzed. The study was
conducted at Vanguardia National Airport in Villavicencio, Meta, Colombia.
Different effects of structural changes are shown and provide judging elements
for decision makers regarding passenger traffic in airport design.

preferences, might limit the exposure to unsolicited contents. In this work, we
study how the same contents (videos) are consumed on different platforms --
i.e. Facebook and YouTube -- over a sample of $12M$ of users. Our findings show
that the same content lead to the formation of echo chambers, irrespective of

Finally, we show that the users' commenting patterns are accurate early
predictors for the formation of echo-chambers.

 <dc:description>  In this work, a directional modulation-based technique is devised to enhance
the security of a multi-antenna wireless communication system employing M-PSK
modulation to convey information. The directional modulation method operates by
steering the array beam in such a way that the phase of the received signal at
the receiver matches that of the intended M-PSK symbol. Due to the difference
between the channels of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, the
signals received by the eavesdropper generally encompass a phase component
different than the actual symbols. As a result, the transceiver which employs
directional modulation can impose a high symbol error rate on the eavesdropper
without requiring to know the eavesdropper's channel. The optimal directional
modulation beamformer is designed to minimize the consumed power subject to
satisfying a specific resulting phase and minimal signal amplitude at each
antenna of the legitimate receiver. The simulation results show that the
directional modulation results in a much higher symbol error rate at the
eavesdropper compared to the conventional benchmark scheme, i.e., zero-forcing
precoding at the transmitter.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by recent applications of dominator computations, we consider the
problem of dynamically maintaining the dominators of flow graphs through a
sequence of insertions and deletions of edges. Our main theoretical
contribution is a simple incremental algorithm that maintains the dominator
tree of a flow graph with $n$ vertices through a sequence of $k$ edge
insertions in $O(m\min\{n,k\}+kn)$ time, where $m$ is the total number of edges
after all insertions. Moreover, we can test in constant time if a vertex $u$
dominates a vertex $v$, for any pair of query vertices $u$ and $v$. Next, we
present a new decremental algorithm to update a dominator tree through a
sequence of edge deletions. Although our new decremental algorithm is not
asymptotically faster than repeated applications of a static algorithm, i.e.,
it runs in $O(mk)$ time for $k$ edge deletions, it performs well in practice.
By combining our new incremental and decremental algorithms we obtain a fully
dynamic algorithm that maintains the dominator tree through intermixed sequence
of insertions and deletions of edges. Finally, we present efficient
implementations of our new algorithms as well as of existing algorithms, and
conduct an extensive experimental study on real-world graphs taken from a
variety of application areas.

n^2$ permutation matrices containing a single 1 in each canonical $n \times n$
subsquare (block). The article suggests a formula for counting mutually
disjoint pairs of $n^2 \times n^2$ S-permutation matrices in the general case
by restricting this task to the problem of finding some numerical
characteristics of the elements of specially defined for this purpose
factor-set of the set of $n \times n$ binary matrices. The paper describe an
algorithm that solves the main problem. To do that, every $n\times n$ binary
matrix is represented uniquely as a n-tuple of integers.

 <dc:title>Canonical binary matrices related to bipartite graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The current paper is dedicated to the problem of finding the number of
mutually non isomorphic bipartite graphs of the type $g=\langle R_g ,C_g ,E_g
\rangle$ at given $n=|R_g |$ and $m=|C_g |$, where $R_g$ and $C_g$ are the two
disjoint parts of the vertices of the graphs $g$, and $E_g$ is the set of
edges, $Eg \subseteq R_g \times C_g$. For this purpose, the concept of
canonical binary matrix is introduced. The different canonical matrices
unambiguously describe the different with exactness up to isomorphism bipartite
graphs. We have found a necessary and sufficient condition an arbitrary matrix
to be canonical. This condition could be the base for realizing recursive
algorithm for finding all $n \times m$ canonical binary matrices and
consequently for finding all with exactness up to isomorphism binary matrices
with cardinality of each part equal to $n$ and $m$.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a novel way of efficiently localizing a soccer field
from a single broadcast image of the game. Related work in this area relies on
manually annotating a few key frames and extending the localization to similar
images, or installing fixed specialized cameras in the stadium from which the
layout of the field can be obtained. In contrast, we formulate this problem as
a branch and bound inference in a Markov random field where an energy function
is defined in terms of field cues such as grass, lines and circles. Moreover,
our approach is fully automatic and depends only on single images from the
broadcast video of the game. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by
applying it to various games and obtain promising results. Finally, we posit
that our approach can be applied easily to other sports such as hockey and
basketball.

 <dc:title>Construction of a Pragmatic Base Line for Journal Classifications and

 <dc:description>  A number of journal classification systems have been developed in
bibliometrics since the launch of the Citation Indices by the Institute of
Scientific Information (ISI) in the 1960s. These systems are used to normalize
citation counts with respect to field-specific citation patterns. The best
known system is the so-called &quot;Web-of-Science Subject Categories&quot; (WCs). In
other systems papers are classified by algorithmic solutions. Using the Journal
Citation Reports 2014 of the Science Citation Index and the Social Science
Citation Index (n of journals = 11,149), we examine options for developing a
new system based on journal classifications into subject categories using
aggregated journal-journal citation data. Combining routines in VOSviewer and
Pajek, a tree-like classification is developed. At each level one can generate
a map of science for all the journals subsumed under a category. Nine major
fields are distinguished at the top level. Further decomposition of the social
sciences is pursued for the sake of example with a focus on journals in
information science (LIS) and science studies (STS). The new classification
system improves on alternative options by avoiding the problem of randomness in
each run that has made algorithmic solutions hitherto irreproducible.
Limitations of the new system are discussed (e.g. the classification of
multi-disciplinary journals). The system's usefulness for field-normalization
in bibliometrics should be explored in future studies.

 <dc:description>  Spectrum sensing and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation have been
thoroughly investigated, both separately and as a joint task. Estimating the
support of a set of signals and their DOAs is crucial to many signal processing
applications, such as Cognitive Radio (CR). A challenging scenario, faced by
CRs, is that of multiband signals, composed of several narrowband transmissions
spread over a wide spectrum each with unknown carrier frequencies and DOAs. The
Nyquist rate of such signals is high and constitutes a bottleneck both in the
analog and digital domains. To alleviate the sampling rate issue, several
sub-Nyquist sampling methods, such as multicoset sampling or the modulated
wideband converter (MWC), have been proposed in the context of spectrum
sensing. In this work, we first suggest an alternative sub-Nyquist sampling and
signal reconstruction method to the MWC, based on a uniform linear array (ULA).
We then extend our approach to joint spectrum sensing and DOA estimation and
propose the CompreSsed CArrier and DOA Estimation (CaSCADE) system, composed of
an L-shaped array with two ULAs. In both cases, we derive perfect recovery
conditions of the signal parameters (carrier frequencies and DOAs if relevant)
and the signal itself and provide two reconstruction algorithms, one based on
the ESPRIT method and the second on compressed sensing techniques. Both our
joint carriers and DOAs recovery algorithms overcome the well-known pairing
issue between the two parameters. Simulations demonstrate that our alternative
spectrum sensing system outperforms the MWC in terms of recovery error and
design complexity and show joint carrier frequencies and DOAs from our CaSCADE
system's sub-Nyquist samples.

 <dc:description>  A new technique for performance regulation in event-driven systems, recently
proposed by the authors, consists of an adaptive-gain integral control. The
gain is adjusted in the control loop by a real-time estimation of the
derivative of the plant-function with respect to the control input. This
estimation is carried out by Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA). The
main motivation comes from applications to throughput regulation in computer
processors, where to-date, testing and assessment of the proposed control
technique has been assessed by simulation. The purpose of this paper is to
report on its implementation on a machine, namely an Intel Haswell
microprocessor, and compare its performance to that obtained from cycle-level,
full system simulation environment. The intrinsic contribution of the paper to
the Workshop on Discrete Event System is in describing the process of taking an
IPA-based design and simulation to a concrete implementation, thereby providing
a bridge between theory and applications.

 <dc:title>Construction methods for generalized bent functions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Generalized bent (gbent) functions is a class of functions $f: \mathbb{Z}_2^n
\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_q$, where $q \geq 2$ is a positive integer, that
generalizes a concept of classical bent functions through their co-domain
extension. A lot of research has recently been devoted towards derivation of
the necessary and sufficient conditions when $f$ is represented as a collection
of Boolean functions. Nevertheless, apart from the necessary conditions that
these component functions are bent when $n$ is even (respectively semi-bent
when $n$ is odd), no general construction method has been proposed yet for $n$
odd case. In this article, based on the use of the well-known
Maiorana-McFarland (MM) class of functions, we give an explicit construction
method of gbent functions, for any even $q &gt;2$ when $n$ is even and for any $q$
of the form $q=2^r$ (for $r&gt;1$) when $n$ is odd. Thus, a long-term open problem
of providing a general construction method of gbent functions, for odd $n$, has
been solved. The method for odd $n$ employs a large class of disjoint spectra
semi-bent functions with certain additional properties which may be useful in
other cryptographic applications.

 <dc:title>Gone in Six Characters: Short URLs Considered Harmful for Cloud Services</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Georgiev, Martin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shmatikov, Vitaly</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modern cloud services are designed to encourage and support collaboration. To
help users share links to online documents, maps, etc., several services,
including cloud storage providers such as Microsoft OneDrive and mapping
services such as Google Maps, directly integrate URL shorteners that convert
long, unwieldy URLs into short URLs, consisting of a domain such as 1drv.ms or
goo.gl and a short token.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that the space of 5- and 6-character tokens
included in short URLs is so small that it can be scanned using brute-force
search. Therefore, all online resources that were intended to be shared with a
few trusted friends or collaborators are effectively public and can be accessed
by anyone. This leads to serious security and privacy vulnerabilities.
  In the case of cloud storage, we focus on Microsoft OneDrive. We show how to
use short-URL enumeration to discover and read shared content stored in the
OneDrive cloud, including even files for which the user did not generate a
short URL. 7% of the OneDrive accounts exposed in this fashion allow anyone to
write into them. Since cloud-stored files are automatically copied into users'
personal computers and devices, this is a vector for large-scale, automated
malware injection.
  In the case of online maps, we show how short-URL enumeration reveals the
directions that users shared with each other. For many individual users, this
enables inference of their residential addresses, true identities, and
extremely sensitive locations they visited that, if publicly revealed, would
violate medical and financial privacy.

 <dc:description>  Almost all of the work in graphical models for game theory has mirrored
previous work in probabilistic graphical models. Our work considers the
opposite direction: Taking advantage of recent advances in equilibrium
computation for probabilistic inference. We present formulations of inference
problems in Markov random fields (MRFs) as computation of equilibria in a
certain class of game-theoretic graphical models. We concretely establishes the
precise connection between variational probabilistic inference in MRFs and
correlated equilibria. No previous work exploits recent theoretical and
empirical results from the literature on algorithmic and computational game
theory on the tractable, polynomial-time computation of exact or approximate
correlated equilibria in graphical games with arbitrary, loopy graph structure.
We discuss how to design new algorithms with equally tractable guarantees for
the computation of approximate variational inference in MRFs. Also, inspired by
a previously stated game-theoretic view of state-of-the-art tree-reweighed
(TRW) message-passing techniques for belief inference as zero-sum game, we
propose a different, general-sum potential game to design approximate
fictitious-play techniques. We perform synthetic experiments evaluating our
proposed approximation algorithms with standard methods and TRW on several
classes of classical Ising models (i.e., with binary random variables). We also
evaluate the algorithms using Ising models learned from the MNIST dataset. Our
experiments show that our global approach is competitive, particularly shinning
in a class of Ising models with constant, &quot;highly attractive&quot; edge-weights, in
which it is often better than all other alternatives we evaluated. With a
notable exception, our more local approach was not as effective. Yet, in
fairness, almost all of the alternatives are often no better than a simple
baseline: estimate 0.5.

 <dc:description>  We derive sequential necessary and sufficient conditions for any channel
input conditional distribution ${\cal
P}_{0,n}\triangleq\{P_{X_t|X^{t-1},Y^{t-1}}:~t=0,\ldots,n\}$ to maximize the
finite-time horizon directed information defined by $$C^{FB}_{X^n \rightarrow
Y^n} \triangleq \sup_{{\cal P}_{0,n}} I(X^n\rightarrow{Y^n}),~~~ I(X^n
\rightarrow Y^n) =\sum_{t=0}^n{I}(X^t;Y_t|Y^{t-1})$$ for channel distributions
$\{P_{Y_t|Y^{t-1},X_t}:~t=0,\ldots,n\}$ and
$\{P_{Y_t|Y_{t-M}^{t-1},X_t}:~t=0,\ldots,n\}$, where
$Y^t\triangleq\{Y_0,\ldots,Y_t\}$ and $X^t\triangleq\{X_0,\ldots,X_t\}$ are the
channel input and output random processes, and $M$ is a finite nonnegative
integer.
  \noi We apply the necessary and sufficient conditions to application examples
of time-varying channels with memory and we derive recursive closed form
expressions of the optimal distributions, which maximize the finite-time
horizon directed information. Further, we derive the feedback capacity from the
asymptotic properties of the optimal distributions by investigating the limit
$$C_{X^\infty \rightarrow Y^\infty}^{FB} \triangleq \lim_{n \longrightarrow
\infty} \frac{1}{n+1} C_{X^n \rightarrow Y^n}^{FB}$$ without any \'a priori
assumptions, such as, stationarity, ergodicity or irreducibility of the channel
distribution. The necessary and sufficient conditions can be easily extended to
a variety of channels with memory, beyond the ones considered in this paper.

 <dc:description>  Heterogeneous hetworks (HetNets) have been introduced as an emerging
technology in order to meet the increasing demand for mobile data. HetNets are
a combination of multi-layer networks such as macrocells and small cells. In
such networks, users may suffer significant cross-layer interference. To manage
this interference, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced
enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) techniques. Almost Blank
SubFrame (ABSF) is one of the time-domain techniques used in eICIC solutions.
We propose a dynamically optimal Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio
(SINR)-based ABSF framework to ensure macro user performance while maintaining
small user performance. We also study cooperative mechanisms to help small
cells collaborate efficiently in order to reduce mutual interference.
Simulations show that our proposed scheme achieves good performance and
outperforms the existing ABSF frameworks.

 <dc:description>  With the recent popularity of animated GIFs on social media, there is need
for ways to index them with rich metadata. To advance research on animated GIF
understanding, we collected a new dataset, Tumblr GIF (TGIF), with 100K
animated GIFs from Tumblr and 120K natural language descriptions obtained via
crowdsourcing. The motivation for this work is to develop a testbed for image
sequence description systems, where the task is to generate natural language
descriptions for animated GIFs or video clips. To ensure a high quality
dataset, we developed a series of novel quality controls to validate free-form
text input from crowdworkers. We show that there is unambiguous association
between visual content and natural language descriptions in our dataset, making
it an ideal benchmark for the visual content captioning task. We perform
extensive statistical analyses to compare our dataset to existing image and
video description datasets. Next, we provide baseline results on the animated
GIF description task, using three representative techniques: nearest neighbor,
statistical machine translation, and recurrent neural networks. Finally, we
show that models fine-tuned from our animated GIF description dataset can be
helpful for automatic movie description.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of joint inband backhauling and
interference mitigation in 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in which a
massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) macro cell base station equipped
with a large number of antennas, overlaid with self-backhauled small cells is
assumed. This problem is cast as a network utility maximization subject to
wireless backhaul constraints. Due to the non-tractability of the problem, we
first resort to random matrix theory to get a closed-form expression of the
achievable rate and transmit power in the asymptotic regime, i.e., as the
number of antennas and users grows large. Subsequently, leveraging the
framework of stochastic optimization, the problem is decoupled into dynamic
scheduling of macro cell users and backhaul provisioning of small cells as a
function of interference and backhaul links. Via simulations, we evaluate the
performance gains of our proposed framework under different network
architectures and low/high frequency bands. Our proposed HetNet method achieves
the achievable average UE throughput of 1.7 Gbps as well as ensures 1 Gbps
cell-edge UE throughput when serving 200 UEs per km2 at 28 GHz with 1 GHz
bandwidth. In ultra-dense network, the UE throughput at 28 GHz achieves 62x
gain as compared to 2.4 GHz.

 <dc:description>  We consider large-scale linear inverse problems in Bayesian settings. Our
general approach follows a recent line of work that applies the approximate
message passing (AMP) framework in multi-processor (MP) computational systems
by storing and processing a subset of rows of the measurement matrix along with
corresponding measurements at each MP node. In each MP-AMP iteration, nodes of
the MP system and its fusion center exchange lossily compressed messages
pertaining to their estimates of the input. There is a trade-off between the
physical costs of the reconstruction process including computation time,
communication loads, and the reconstruction quality, and it is impossible to
simultaneously minimize all the costs. We pose this minimization as a
multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and study the properties of the
best trade-offs (Pareto optimality) in this MOP. We prove that the achievable
region of this MOP is convex, and conjecture how the combined cost of
computation and communication scales with the desired mean squared error. These
properties are verified numerically.

 <dc:description>  Circuit codes are constructed from induced cycles in the graph of the $n$
dimensional hypercube. They are both theoretically and practically important,
as circuit codes can be used as error correcting codes. When constructing
circuit codes, the length of the cycle determines its accuracy and a parameter
called the spread determines how many errors it can detect. We present a new
method for constructing a circuit code of spread $k+1$ from a circuit code of
spread $k$. This method leads to record code lengths for circuit codes of
spread $k=7 \text{ and } 8$ in dimension $22\le n\le 30$. We also derive a new
lower bound on the length of circuit codes of spread 4, improving upon the
current bound for dimension $n\ge 86$.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Query evaluation on probabilistic databases is generally intractable
(#P-hard). Existing dichotomy results have identified which queries are
tractable (or safe), and connected them to tractable lineages. In our previous
work, using different tools, we showed that query evaluation is linear-time on
probabilistic databases for arbitrary monadic second-order queries, if we bound
the treewidth of the instance.
  In this paper, we study limitations and extensions of this result. First, for
probabilistic query evaluation, we show that MSO tractability cannot extend
beyond bounded treewidth: there are even FO queries that are hard on any
efficiently constructible unbounded-treewidth class of graphs. This dichotomy
relies on recent polynomial bounds on the extraction of planar graphs as
minors, and implies lower bounds in non-probabilistic settings, for query
evaluation and match counting in subinstance-closed families. Second, we show
how to explain our tractability result in terms of lineage: the lineage of MSO
queries on bounded-treewidth instances can be represented as bounded-treewidth
circuits, polynomial-size OBDDs, and linear-size d-DNNFs. By contrast, we can
strengthen the previous dichotomy to lineages, and show that there are even
UCQs with disequalities that have superpolynomial OBDDs on all
unbounded-treewidth graph classes; we give a characterization of such queries.
Last, we show how bounded-treewidth tractability explains the tractability of
the inversion-free safe queries: we can rewrite their input instances to have
bounded-treewidth.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a distributed alternating mixed discrete-continuous
(DAMDC) algorithm to approach the oracle algorithm based on the diffusion
strategy for parameter and spectrum estimation over sensor networks. A least
mean squares (LMS) type algorithm that obtains the oracle matrix adaptively is
developed and compared with the existing sparsity-aware and conventional
algorithms. The proposed algorithm exhibits improved performance in terms of
mean square deviation and power spectrum estimation accuracy. Numerical results
show that the DAMDC algorithm achieves excellent performance.

 <dc:title>New Algorithms for Verifying the Null Space Condition in Compressed

 <dc:description>  The null space condition for $\ell_1$ minimization in compressed sensing is a
necessary and sufficient condition on the sensing matrices under which a sparse
signal can be uniquely recovered from the observation data via $\ell_1$
minimization. However, verifying the null space condition is known to be
computationally challenging. Most of the existing methods can provide only
upper and lower bounds on the proportion parameter that characterizes the null
space condition. In this paper, we propose new polynomial-time algorithms to
establish the upper bounds of the proportion parameter. Based on these
polynomial-time algorithms, we have designed new algorithms - Sandwiching
Algorithm (SWA) and Tree Search Algorithm (TSA) - to precisely verify the null
space condition. Simulation results show that our polynomial-time algorithms
can achieve better bounds on recoverable sparsity with low computational
complexity than existing methods in the literature. We also show that Tree
Search Algorithm and Sandwiching Algorithm significantly reduce the
computational complexity when compared with the exhaustive search method.

 <dc:description>  This work describes a methodology to combine logic-based systems and
connectionist systems. Our approach uses finite truth valued {\L}ukasiewicz
logic, where we take advantage of fact what in this type of logics every
connective can be define by a neuron in an artificial network having by
activation function the identity truncated to zero and one. This allowed the
injection of first-order formulas in a network architecture, and also
simplified symbolic rule extraction.
  Our method trains a neural network using Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, where
we restrict the knowledge dissemination in the network structure. We show how
this reduces neural networks plasticity without damage drastically the learning
performance. Making the descriptive power of produced neural networks similar
to the descriptive power of {\L}ukasiewicz logic language, simplifying the
translation between symbolic and connectionist structures.
  This method is used in the reverse engineering problem of finding the formula
used on generation of a truth table for a multi-valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic.
For real data sets the method is particularly useful for attribute selection,
on binary classification problems defined using nominal attribute. After
attribute selection and possible data set completion in the resulting
connectionist model: neurons are directly representable using a disjunctive or
conjunctive formulas, in the {\L}ukasiewicz logic, or neurons are
interpretations which can be approximated by symbolic rules. This fact is
exemplified, extracting symbolic knowledge from connectionist models generated
for the data set Mushroom from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

 <dc:description>  Network steganography has been a well-known covert data channeling method for
over three decades. The basic set of techniques and implementation tools have
not changed significantly since their introduction in the early 1980's. In this
paper, we review the predominant methods of classical network steganography,
describing the detailed operations and resultant challenges involved in
embedding data in the network transport domain. We also consider the various
cyber threat vectors of network steganography and point out the major
differences between classical network steganography and the widely known
end-point multimedia embedding techniques, which focus exclusively on static
data modification for data hiding. We then challenge the security community by
introducing an entirely new network dat hiding methodology, which we refer to
as real-time network data steganography. Finally we provide the groundwork for
this fundamental change of covert network data embedding by forming a basic
framework for real-time network data operations that will open the path for
even further advances in computer network security.

 <dc:title>Knowledge Extraction and Knowledge Integration governed by

 <dc:subject>03D05, 03B52, 92B20</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The development of machine learning in particular and artificial intelligent
in general has been strongly conditioned by the lack of an appropriate
interface layer between deduction, abduction and induction. In this work we
extend traditional algebraic specification methods in this direction. Here we
assume that such interface for AI emerges from an adequate Neural-Symbolic
integration. This integration is made for universe of discourse described on a
Topos governed by a many-valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic. Sentences are integrated
in a symbolic knowledge base describing the problem domain, codified using a
graphic-based language, wherein every logic connective is defined by a neuron
in an artificial network. This allows the integration of first-order formulas
into a network architecture as background knowledge, and simplifies symbolic
rule extraction from trained networks. For the train of such neural networks we
changed the Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, restricting the knowledge
dissemination in the network structure using soft crystallization. This
procedure reduces neural network plasticity without drastically damaging the
learning performance, allowing the emergence of symbolic patterns. This makes
the descriptive power of produced neural networks similar to the descriptive
power of {\L}ukasiewicz logic language, reducing the information lost on
translation between symbolic and connectionist structures. We tested this
method on the extraction of knowledge from specified structures. For it, we
present the notion of fuzzy state automata, and we use automata behaviour to
infer its structure. We use this type of automata on the generation of models
for relations specified as symbolic background knowledge.

 <dc:title>Dual-Timescale Spectrum Management in Wireless Heterogeneous Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To attain the targeted data rates of next generation (5G) cellular networks
requires dense deployment of small cells in addition to macro cells which
provide wide coverage. Dynamic radio resource management (RRM) is crucial to
the success of such heterogeneous networks due to much more pronounced traffic
and interference variations in small cells. This work proposes a framework for
spectrum management organized according to two timescales, which includes 1)
centralized optimization on a second/minute timescale corresponding to typical
durations of user sessions, and 2) distributed spectrum allocation on a
millisecond timescale corresponding to typical latency requirements. The
dual-timescale allocation is formulated as an optimization problem in the
slower timescale with consideration of (distributed) opportunistic scheduling
on the faster timescale. We consider both fixed and fully flexible user
association. Iterative algorithms are developed to solve these optimization
problems efficiently for a small cluster of cells. Simulation results
demonstrate advantages of the dual-timescale RRM framework.

 <dc:title>Private Web Search with an Expected Constant Round</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Myungsun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Web searching is becoming an essential activity because it is often the most
effective and convenient way of finding information. However, a Web search can
be a threat to the privacy of the searcher because the queries may reveal
sensitive information about the searcher. Private Web search (PWS) solutions
allow users to find information on the Internet while preserving their privacy.
Here, privacy means maintaining the confidentiality of the identity of the
communicating users. According to their underlying technology, existing PWS
solutions can be divided into three types: proxy-based solutions,
obfuscation-based solutions, and cryptography-based solutions. Of these,
cryptography-based PWS (CB-PWS) systems are particularly interesting because
they provide strong privacy guarantees in the cryptographic sense. In this
paper, we present a round-efficient CB-PWS protocol that preserves
computational efficiency compared to other known CB-PWS systems. Assuming a
broadcast channel, our protocol is a \emph{four-round} cryptographic scheme
that requires $O(n)$ communication complexity. However, if only point-to-point
interaction is available, with the users emulating the broadcast channel, our
protocol requires an expected $O(1)$-round complexity and the same computation
and communication overhead. Further analyzing the efficiency of our protocol
shows that our proposal requires only $3n$ modular exponentiations for $n$
users. To evaluate the security of our protocol, we demonstrate that our
construction is secure in terms of a semi-honest model. We then discuss how to
enhance its security to render it secure in the presence of malicious
adversaries. We provide a specific protocol for managing users' groups, which
is also an advantage over existing systems.

 <dc:description>  Limits and colimits of diagrams, defined by maps between sets, are universal
constructions fundamental in different mathematical domains and key concepts in
theoretical computer science. Its importance in semantic modeling is described
by M. Makkai and R. Par\'e, where it is formally shown that every axiomatizable
theory in classical infinitary logic can be specified using diagrams defined by
maps between sets, and its models are structures characterized by the
commutativity, limit and colimit of those diagrams. Z. Diskin taking a more
practical perspective, presented an algebraic graphic-based framework for data
modeling and database design. The aim of our work is to study the possibility
of extending these algebraic frameworks to the specification of fuzzy
structures and to the description of fuzzy patterns on data. For that purpose,
in this paper we describe a conservative extension for the notions of diagram
commutativity, limit and colimit, when diagrams are constructed using relations
between fuzzy sets, evaluated in a multi-valued logic. These are used to
formalize what we mean by &quot;a relation $R$ is similar to a limit of diagram
$D$,&quot; &quot;a similarity relation $S$ is identical to a colimit of diagram $D$
colimit,&quot; and &quot;a diagram $D$ is almost commutative.&quot;

 <dc:description>  The integration of knowledge extracted from different models described by
domain experts or from models generated by machine learning algorithms is
strongly conditioned by the lack of an appropriated framework to specify and
integrate structures, learning processes, data transformations and data models
or data rules. In this work we extended algebraic specification methods to be
used in this type of framework. This methodology uses graphic structures
similar to Ehresmann's sketches interpreted on a fuzzy set universe. This
approach takes advantages of the sketches ability to integrate data
deterministic and nondeterministic structures. Selecting this strategy we also
try to take advantage on how the graphic languages, used in Category theory in
general and used for sketch definition in particular, are suited to reasoning
about problems, to structural description and to task specification and task
decomposition.

 <dc:description>  Most prior algorithms for influence maximization focused are designed for
Online Social Networks (OSNs) and require centralized computation. Directly
deploying the above algorithms in distributed Mobile Social Networks (MSNs)
will overwhelm the networks due to an enormous number of messages required for
seed selection. In this paper, therefore, we design a new cross-layer strategy
to jointly examine MSN and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) to facilitate
efficient seed selection, by extracting a subset of nodes as agents to
represent nearby friends during the distributed computation. Specifically, we
formulate a new optimization problem, named Agent Selection Problem (ASP), to
minimize the message overhead transmitted in MANET. We prove that ASP is
NP-Hard and design an effectively distributed algorithm. Simulation results in
real and synthetic datasets manifest that the message overhead can be
significantly reduced compared with the existing approaches.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new technique for embedding data into an image coupled with compression has
been proposed in this paper. A fast and efficient coding algorithms are needed
for effective storage and transmission, due to the popularity of telemedicine
and the use of digital medical images. Medical images are produced and
transferred between hospitals for review by physicians who are geographically
apart. Such image data need to be stored for future reference of patients as
well. This necessitates compact storage of medical images before being
transmitted over Internet. Moreover, as the patient information is also
embedded within the medical images, it is very important to maintain the
confidentiality of patient data. Hence, this article aims at hiding patient
information as well, within the medical image followed by joint compression.
The hidden data and the host image are absolutely recoverable from the embedded
image without any loss.

 <dc:description>  We present an end-to-end system for reconstructing complete watertight and
textured models of moving subjects such as clothed humans and animals, using
only three or four handheld sensors. The heart of our framework is a new
pairwise registration algorithm that minimizes, using a particle swarm
strategy, an alignment error metric based on mutual visibility and occlusion.
We show that this algorithm reliably registers partial scans with as little as
15% overlap without requiring any initial correspondences, and outperforms
alternative global registration algorithms. This registration algorithm allows
us to reconstruct moving subjects from free-viewpoint video produced by
consumer-grade sensors, without extensive sensor calibration, constrained
capture volume, expensive arrays of cameras, or templates of the subject
geometry.

show that co-existence of NLOS and LOS transmissions has a significant impact
on network performance. We find in urban areas, that deploying more BSs in

 <dc:description>  Prior work has established that all problems in NP admit classical
zero-knowledge proof systems, and under reasonable hardness assumptions for
quantum computations, these proof systems can be made secure against quantum
attacks. We prove a result representing a further quantum generalization of
this fact, which is that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a
quantum zero-knowledge proof system. More specifically, assuming the existence
of an unconditionally binding and quantum computationally concealing commitment
scheme, we prove that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum
interactive proof system that is zero-knowledge with respect to efficient
quantum computations.
  Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers, but only
requires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations,
provided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA
problem under consideration. The proof system relies on a new variant of the
QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem in which the local terms are described
by Clifford operations and standard basis measurements. We believe that the
QMA-completeness of this problem may have other uses in quantum complexity.

 <dc:description>  Recent approaches in depth-based human activity analysis achieved outstanding
performance and proved the effectiveness of 3D representation for
classification of action classes. Currently available depth-based and
RGB+D-based action recognition benchmarks have a number of limitations,
including the lack of training samples, distinct class labels, camera views and
variety of subjects. In this paper we introduce a large-scale dataset for RGB+D
human action recognition with more than 56 thousand video samples and 4 million
frames, collected from 40 distinct subjects. Our dataset contains 60 different
action classes including daily, mutual, and health-related actions. In
addition, we propose a new recurrent neural network structure to model the
long-term temporal correlation of the features for each body part, and utilize
them for better action classification. Experimental results show the advantages
of applying deep learning methods over state-of-the-art hand-crafted features
on the suggested cross-subject and cross-view evaluation criteria for our
dataset. The introduction of this large scale dataset will enable the community
to apply, develop and adapt various data-hungry learning techniques for the
task of depth-based and RGB+D-based human activity analysis.

 <dc:title>Beyond Brightness Constancy: Learning Noise Models for Optical Flow</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rosenbaum, Dan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Weiss, Yair</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Optical flow is typically estimated by minimizing a &quot;data cost&quot; and an
optional regularizer. While there has been much work on different regularizers
many modern algorithms still use a data cost that is not very different from
the ones used over 30 years ago: a robust version of brightness constancy or
gradient constancy. In this paper we leverage the recent availability of
ground-truth optical flow databases in order to learn a data cost. Specifically
we take a generative approach in which the data cost models the distribution of
noise after warping an image according to the flow and we measure the
&quot;goodness&quot; of a data cost by how well it matches the true distribution of flow
warp error. Consistent with current practice, we find that robust versions of
gradient constancy are better models than simple brightness constancy but a
learned GMM that models the density of patches of warp error gives a much
better fit than any existing assumption of constancy. This significant
advantage of the GMM is due to an explicit modeling of the spatial structure of
warp errors, a feature which is missing from almost all existing data costs in
optical flow. Finally, we show how a good density model of warp error patches
can be used for optical flow estimation on whole images. We replace the data
cost by the expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL), and show how this cost can be
optimized iteratively using an additional step of denoising the warp error
image. The results of our experiments are promising and show that patch models
with higher likelihood lead to better optical flow estimation.

 <dc:description>  Technology is moving towards space division multiplexing in optical fiber to
keep up the trend in rate increase over time and to avoid an imminent capacity
crunch. Thus, it is of paramount interest to estimate the potential gains of
this approach. As more spatial channels are being packed into a single fiber,
the increased crosstalk necessitates the use of MIMO to guarantee reliable
operation. In this paper, we exploit the analogy between an optical fiber and a
model from mesoscopic physics - a chaotic cavity - to obtain a novel channel
model for the optical fiber. The model captures both random distributed
crosstalk and modedependent loss, which are described within the framework of
scattering theory. Using tools from replica theory and random matrix theory, we
derive the capacity of the fiber optical MIMO channel model.

We show that generalized (hyper)bent functions from $F_{2^n}$ to $Z_{2^k}$
consist of components which are generalized (hyper)bent functions from
$F_{2^n}$ to $Z_{2^{k^\prime}}$ for some $k^\prime &lt; k$. For odd $n$, we show
that the Boolean functions associated to a generalized bent function form an
affine space of semibent functions. This complements a recent result for even
$n$, where the associated Boolean functions are bent.

proposed to reduce the overall need of communication and system updates. It is
proved that these self-triggered rules realize consensus exponentially if the
network topologies have a spanning tree and the quantization function is
uniform. Numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm that enumerates all the minimal triangulations of a
graph in incremental polynomial time. Consequently, we get an algorithm for
enumerating all the proper tree decompositions, in incremental polynomial time,
where &quot;proper&quot; means that the tree decomposition cannot be improved by removing
or splitting a bag.

 <dc:description>  We propose an efficient solution to peer-to-peer localization in a wireless
sensor network which works in two stages. At the first stage the optimization
problem is relaxed into a convex problem, given in the form recently proposed
by Soares, Xavier, and Gomes. The convex problem is efficiently solved in a
distributed way by an ADMM approach, which provides a significant improvement
in speed with respect to the original solution. In the second stage, a soft
transition to the original, non-convex, non relaxed formulation is applied in
such a way to force the solution towards a local minimum. The algorithm is
built in such a way to be fully distributed, and it is tested in meaningful
situations, showing its effectiveness in localization accuracy and speed of
convergence, as well as its inner robustness.

 <dc:description>  Person knowledge extraction is the foundation of the Tibetan knowledge graph
construction, which provides support for Tibetan question answering system,
information retrieval, information extraction and other researches, and
promotes national unity and social stability. This paper proposes a SVM and
template based approach to Tibetan person knowledge extraction. Through
constructing the training corpus, we build the templates based the shallow
parsing analysis of Tibetan syntactic, semantic features and verbs. Using the
training corpus, we design a hierarchical SVM classifier to realize the entity
knowledge extraction. Finally, experimental results prove the method has
greater improvement in Tibetan person knowledge extraction.

 <dc:title>Breadth First Search Vectorization on the Intel Xeon Phi</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Breadth First Search (BFS) is a building block for graph algorithms and has
recently been used for large scale analysis of information in a variety of
applications including social networks, graph databases and web searching. Due
to its importance, a number of different parallel programming models and
architectures have been exploited to optimize the BFS. However, due to the
irregular memory access patterns and the unstructured nature of the large
graphs, its efficient parallelization is a challenge. The Xeon Phi is a
massively parallel architecture available as an off-the-shelf accelerator,
which includes a powerful 512 bit vector unit with optimized scatter and gather
functions. Given its potential benefits, work related to graph traversing on
this architecture is an active area of research.
  We present a set of experiments in which we explore architectural features of
the Xeon Phi and how best to exploit them in a top-down BFS algorithm but the
techniques can be applied to the current state-of-the-art hybrid, top-down plus
bottom-up, algorithms.
  We focus on the exploitation of the vector unit by developing an improved
highly vectorized OpenMP parallel algorithm, using vector intrinsics, and
understanding the use of data alignment and prefetching. In addition, we
investigate the impact of hyperthreading and thread affinity on performance, a
topic that appears under researched in the literature. As a result, we achieve
what we believe is the fastest published top-down BFS algorithm on the version
of Xeon Phi used in our experiments. The vectorized BFS top-down source code
presented in this paper can be available on request as free-to-use software.

 <dc:description>  We present SymNet, a network static analysis tool based on symbolic
execution. SymNet quickly analyzes networks by injecting symbolic packets and
tracing their path through the network. Our key novelty is SEFL, a language we
designed for network processing that is symbolic-execution friendly.
  SymNet is easy to use: we have developed parsers that automatically generate
SEFL models from router and switch tables, firewall configurations and
arbitrary Click modular router configurations. Most of our models are exact and
have optimal branching factor. Finally, we built a testing tool that checks
SEFL models conform to the real implementation. SymNet can check networks
containing routers with hundreds of thousands of prefixes and NATs in seconds,
while ensuring packet header memory-safety and capturing network functionality
such as dynamic tunneling, stateful processing and encryption. We used SymNet
to debug middlebox interactions documented in the literature, to check our
department's network and the Stanford backbone network. Results show that
symbolic execution is fast and more accurate than existing static analysis
tools.

 <dc:description>  Full-duplex (FD) communications with bidirectional transmitting and receiving
at the same time and frequency radio resource have long been deemed a promising
way to boost spectrum efficiency, but hindered by the techniques for
self-interference cancellation (SIC). Recent breakthroughs in analog and
digital signal processing yield the feasibility of beyond $100$ dB SIC
capability and make it possible for FD communications to demonstrate nearly
doubled spectrum efficiency for point-to-point links. Now it is time to shift
at least partial of our focus to full duplex networking, such as in cellular
networks, since it is not straightforward but demanding novel and more
complicated interference management techniques. Before putting FD networking
into practice, we need to understand that what scenarios FD communications
should be applied in under the current technology maturity, how bad the
performance will be if we do nothing to deal with the newly introduced
interference, and most importantly, how much improvement could be achieved
after applying advanced solutions. This article will shed light on these
questions.

 <dc:description>  Recognising human activities from streaming videos poses unique challenges to
learning algorithms: predictive models need to be scalable, incrementally
trainable, and must remain bounded in size even when the data stream is
arbitrarily long. Furthermore, as parameter tuning is problematic in a
streaming setting, suitable approaches should be parameterless, and make no
assumptions on what class labels may occur in the stream. We present here an
approach to the recognition of human actions from streaming data which meets
all these requirements by: (1) incrementally learning a model which adaptively
covers the feature space with simple local classifiers; (2) employing an active
learning strategy to reduce annotation requests; (3) achieving promising
accuracy within a fixed model size. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art
non-incremental methods, and outperforms the existing active incremental
baselines.

and/or $r$ tend to infinity. We connect these results with the question of

 <dc:description>  Face detection and alignment in unconstrained environment are challenging due
to various poses, illuminations and occlusions. Recent studies show that deep
learning approaches can achieve impressive performance on these two tasks. In
this paper, we propose a deep cascaded multi-task framework which exploits the
inherent correlation between them to boost up their performance. In particular,
our framework adopts a cascaded structure with three stages of carefully
designed deep convolutional networks that predict face and landmark location in
a coarse-to-fine manner. In addition, in the learning process, we propose a new
online hard sample mining strategy that can improve the performance
automatically without manual sample selection. Our method achieves superior
accuracy over the state-of-the-art techniques on the challenging FDDB and WIDER
FACE benchmark for face detection, and AFLW benchmark for face alignment, while
keeps real time performance.

 <dc:description>  Online Social Networking may be a way to support health professionals' need
for continuous learning through interaction with peers and experts.
Understanding and evaluating such learning is important but difficult, and
Social Network Analysis (SNA) offers a solution. This paper demonstrates how
SNA can be used to study levels of participation as well as the patterns of
interactions that take place among health professionals in a large online
professional learning network. Our analysis has shown that their learning
network is highly centralised and loosely connected. The level of participation
is low in general, and most interactions are structured around a small set of
users consisting of moderators and core members. The structural patterns of
interaction indicates there is a chance of small group learning occurring and
requires further investigation to identify those potential learning groups.
This first stage of analysis, to be followed by longitudinal study of the
dynamics of interaction and complemented by content analysis of their
discussion, may contribute to greater sophistication in the analysis and
utilisation of new environments for health professional learning.

 <dc:description>  We propose an approach for dense semantic 3D reconstruction which uses a data
term that is defined as potentials over viewing rays, combined with continuous
surface area penalization. Our formulation is a convex relaxation which we
augment with a crucial non-convex constraint that ensures exact handling of
visibility. To tackle the non-convex minimization problem, we propose a
majorize-minimize type strategy which converges to a critical point. We
demonstrate the benefits of using the non-convex constraint experimentally. For
the geometry-only case, we set a new state of the art on two datasets of the
commonly used Middlebury multi-view stereo benchmark. Moreover, our
general-purpose formulation directly reconstructs thin objects, which are
usually treated with specialized algorithms. A qualitative evaluation on the
dense semantic 3D reconstruction task shows that we improve significantly over
previous methods.

 <dc:description>  We study linear-time temporal logics interpreted over data words with
multiple attributes. We restrict the atomic formulas to equalities of attribute
values in successive positions and to repetitions of attribute values in the
future or past. We demonstrate correspondences between satisfiability problems
for logics and reachability-like decision problems for counter systems. We show
that allowing/disallowing atomic formulas expressing repetitions of values in
the past corresponds to the reachability/coverability problem in Petri nets.
This gives us 2EXPSPACE upper bounds for several satisfiability problems. We
prove matching lower bounds by reduction from a reachability problem for a
newly introduced class of counter systems. This new class is a succinct version
of vector addition systems with states in which counters are accessed via
pointers, a potentially useful feature in other contexts. We strengthen further
the correspondences between data logics and counter systems by characterizing
the complexity of fragments, extensions and variants of the logic. For
instance, we precisely characterize the relationship between the number of
attributes allowed in the logic and the number of counters needed in the
counter system.

 <dc:description>  Technology-sustained pervasive games, contrary to technology-supported
pervasive games, can be understood as computer games interfacing with the
physical world. Pervasive games are known to make use of 'non-standard input
devices' and with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), pervasive
applications can be expected to move beyond games. This dissertation is
requirements- and development-focused Design Science research for distributed
technology-sustained pervasive applications, incorporating knowledge from the
domains of Distributed Computing, Mixed Reality, Context-Aware Computing,
Geographical Information Systems and IoT. Computer video games have existed for
decades, with a reusable game engine to drive them. If pervasive games can be
understood as computer games interfacing with the physical world, can computer
game engines be used to stage pervasive games? Considering the use of
non-standard input devices in pervasive games and the rise of IoT, how will
this affect the architectures supporting the broader set of pervasive
applications? The use of a game engine can be found in some existing pervasive
game projects, but general research into how the domain of pervasive games
overlaps with that of video games is lacking. When an engine is used, a
discussion of, what type of engine is most suitable and what properties are
being fulfilled by the engine, is often not part of the discourse. This
dissertation uses multiple iterations of the method framework for Design
Science for the design and development of three software system architectures.
In the face of IoT, the problem of extending pervasive games into a fourth
software architecture, accommodating a broader set of pervasive applications,
is explicated. The requirements, for technology-sustained pervasive games, are
verified through the design, development and demonstration of the three
software system architectures. The ...

 <dc:title>Sparse Coding for Alpha Matting</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Existing color sampling based alpha matting methods use the compositing
equation to estimate alpha at a pixel from pairs of foreground (F) and
background (B) samples. The quality of the matte depends on the selected (F,B)
pairs. In this paper, the matting problem is reinterpreted as a sparse coding
of pixel features, wherein the sum of the codes gives the estimate of the alpha
matte from a set of unpaired F and B samples. A non-parametric probabilistic
segmentation provides a certainty measure on the pixel belonging to foreground
or background, based on which a dictionary is formed for use in sparse coding.
By removing the restriction to conform to (F,B) pairs, this method allows for
better alpha estimation from multiple F and B samples. The same framework is
extended to videos, where the requirement of temporal coherence is handled
effectively. Here, the dictionary is formed by samples from multiple frames. A
multi-frame graph model, as opposed to a single image as for image matting, is
proposed that can be solved efficiently in closed form. Quantitative and
qualitative evaluations on a benchmark dataset are provided to show that the
proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art in image and video
matting.

 <dc:description>  We consider the discrete memoryless asymmetric broadcast channels. We prove
that the error probability of decoding tends to one exponentially for rates
outside the capacity region and derive an explicit lower bound of this exponent

 <dc:title>Statistics of RGBD Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rosenbaum, Dan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cameras that can measure the depth of each pixel in addition to its color
have become easily available and are used in many consumer products worldwide.
Often the depth channel is captured at lower quality compared to the RGB
channels and different algorithms have been proposed to improve the quality of
the D channel given the RGB channels. Typically these approaches work by
assuming that edges in RGB are correlated with edges in D.
  In this paper we approach this problem from the standpoint of natural image
statistics. We obtain examples of high quality RGBD images from a computer
graphics generated movie (MPI-Sintel) and we use these examples to compare
different probabilistic generative models of RGBD image patches. We then use
the generative models together with a degradation model and obtain a Bayes
Least Squares (BLS) estimator of the D channel given the RGB channels. Our
results show that learned generative models outperform the state-of-the-art in
improving the quality of depth channels given the color channels in natural
images even when training is performed on artificially generated images.

 <dc:title>The vulnerability of the diameter of enhanced hypercubes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For an interconnection network $G$, the {\it $\omega$-wide diameter}
$d_\omega(G)$ is the least $\ell$ such that any two vertices are joined by
$\omega$ internally-disjoint paths of length at most $\ell$, and the {\it
$(\omega-1)$-fault diameter} $D_{\omega}(G)$ is the maximum diameter of a
subgraph obtained by deleting fewer than $\omega$ vertices of $G$.
  The enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,k}$ is a variant of the well-known hypercube.
Yang, Chang, Pai, and Chan gave an upper bound for $d_{n+1}(Q_{n,k})$ and
$D_{n+1}(Q_{n,k})$ and posed the problem of finding the wide diameters and
fault diameters of $Q_{n,k}$. By constructing internally disjoint paths between
any two vertices in the enhanced hypercube, for $n\ge3$ and $2\le k\le n$ we
prove $$ D_\omega(Q_{n,k})=d_\omega(Q_{n,k})=\begin{cases} d(Q_{n,k}) &amp;
\textrm{for $1 \leq \omega &lt; n-\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor$;}\\ d(Q_{n,k})+1 &amp;
\textrm{for $n-\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor \leq \omega \leq n+1$.} \end{cases} $$
where $d(Q_{n,k})$ is the diameter of $Q_{n,k}$. These results mean that
interconnection networks modelled by enhanced hypercubes are extremely robust.

 <dc:title>Modeling and predicting measured response time of cloud-based web

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Predicting cloud performance from user's perspective is a complex task,
because of several factors involved in providing the service to the consumer.
In this work, the response time of 10 real-world services is analyzed. We have
observed long memory in terms of the measured response time of the
CPU-intensive services and statistically verified this observation using
estimators of the Hurst exponent. Then, na\&quot;ive, mean, autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA) and autoregressive fractionally integrated
moving average (ARFIMA) methods are used to forecast the future values of
quality of service (QoS) at runtime. Results of the cross-validation over the
10 datasets show that the long-memory ARFIMA model provides the mean of 37.5 %
and the maximum of 57.8 % reduction in the forecast error when compared to the
short-memory ARIMA model according to the standard error measure of mean
absolute percentage error. Our work implies that consideration of the
long-range dependence in QoS data can help to improve the selection of services
according to their possible future QoS values.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces two recurrent neural network structures called Simple
Gated Unit (SGU) and Deep Simple Gated Unit (DSGU), which are general
structures for learning long term dependencies. Compared to traditional Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both structures
require fewer parameters and less computation time in sequence classification
tasks. Unlike GRU and LSTM, which require more than one gates to control
information flow in the network, SGU and DSGU only use one multiplicative gate
to control the flow of information. We show that this difference can accelerate
the learning speed in tasks that require long dependency information. We also
show that DSGU is more numerically stable than SGU. In addition, we also
propose a standard way of representing inner structure of RNN called RNN
Conventional Graph (RCG), which helps analyzing the relationship between input
units and hidden units of RNN.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach for supervised domain adaptation that is based
upon the probabilistic framework of Gaussian processes (GPs). Specifically, we
introduce domain-specific GPs as local experts for facial expression
classification from face images. The adaptation of the classifier is
facilitated in probabilistic fashion by conditioning the target expert on
multiple source experts. Furthermore, in contrast to existing adaptation
approaches, we also learn a target expert from available target data solely.
Then, a single and confident classifier is obtained by combining the
predictions from multiple experts based on their confidence. Learning of the
model is efficient and requires no retraining/reweighting of the source
classifiers. We evaluate the proposed approach on two publicly available
datasets for multi-class (MultiPIE) and multi-label (DISFA) facial expression
classification. To this end, we perform adaptation of two contextual factors:
'where' (view) and 'who' (subject). We show in our experiments that the
proposed approach consistently outperforms both source and target classifiers,
while using as few as 30 target examples. It also outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches for supervised domain adaptation.

 <dc:title>Multicarrier PAPR Reduction by Iteratively Shifting and Concentrating
  the Probability Measure</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Afrasiabi-Gorgani, Saeed</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wunder, Gerhard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The peak power problem in multicarrier waveforms is well-known and imposes
substantial limitations on wireless communications. As the quest for
investigation of enabling technologies for the next generation of wireless
communication systems 5G is at its peak, the problem is re-emerging in a much
broader range of technologies. However, despite numerous publications on the
topic, there is no well-established structure available for the problem, which
motivates a boost in research. In this paper, a novel peak power reduction
algorithm is proposed which offers a substantial Peak-to-Average Power Ratio
(PAPR) reduction and exhibits high potential for further refinements.
Mathematical tractability of the algorithm is expected to be of particular
importance to this end. A remarkable early observation is a PAPR reduction of
about 4.5 dB for 64 subcarriers with a rate loss of 0.5 bits per complex data
symbol in an OFDM scheme, which is half the rate loss that other methods
require in this class of algorithms.

 <dc:title>Solving Optimization Problems by the Public Goods Game</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a method based on the Public Goods Game for solving optimization
tasks. In particular, we focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem, i.e. a
NP-hard problem whose search space exponentially grows increasing the number of
cities. The proposed method considers a population whose agents are provided
with a random solution to the given problem. In doing so, agents interact by
playing the Public Goods Game using the fitness of their solution as currency
of the game. Notably, agents with better solutions provide higher
contributions, while those with lower ones tend to imitate the solution of
richer agents for increasing their fitness. Numerical simulations show that the
proposed method allows to compute exact solutions, and suboptimal ones, in the
considered search spaces. As result, beyond to propose a new heuristic for
combinatorial optimization problems, our work aims to highlight the
potentiality of evolutionary game theory beyond its current horizons.

setup. It explores possible origins of Physical Human-Human communication, more
precisely, the hypothesis of a time based communication. To explore if the
communication is correlated to time a statistical state machine model based on

 <dc:description>  The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) is an attractive variant of the Vehicle
Routing Problem (VRP). The aim is to select customers and at the same time
organize the visits for a vehicle fleet so as to maximize the collected profits
and subject to a travel time restriction on each vehicle. In this paper, we
investigate the effective use of a linear formulation with polynomial number of
variables to solve TOP. Cutting planes are the core components of our solving
algorithm. It is first used to solve smaller and intermediate models of the
original problem by considering fewer vehicles. Useful information are then
retrieved to solve larger models, and eventually reaching the original problem.
Relatively new and dedicated methods for TOP, such as identification of
irrelevant arcs and mandatory customers, clique and independent-set cuts based
on the incompatibilities, and profit/customer restriction on subsets of
vehicles, are introduced. We evaluated our algorithm on the standard benchmark
of TOP. The results show that the algorithm is competitive and is able to prove
the optimality for 12 instances previously unsolved.

 <dc:title>Adding Semantic Information into Data Models by Learning Domain

 <dc:description>  Interactive visual analytic systems enable users to discover insights from
complex data. Users can express and test hypotheses via user interaction,
leveraging their domain expertise and prior knowledge to guide and steer the
analytic models in the system. For example, semantic interaction techniques
enable systems to learn from the user's interactions and steer the underlying
analytic models based on the user's analytical reasoning. However, an open
challenge is how to not only steer models based on the dimensions or features
of the data, but how to add dimensions or attributes to the data based on the
domain expertise of the user. In this paper, we present a technique for
inferring and appending dimensions onto the dataset based on the prior
expertise of the user expressed via user interactions. Our technique enables
users to directly manipulate a spatial organization of data, from which both
the dimensions of the data are weighted, and also dimensions created to
represent the prior knowledge the user brings to the system. We describe this
technique and demonstrate its utility via a use case.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the analysis on the influence of distance mismatches on
the standard gradient-based rigid formation control for second-order agents. It
is shown that, similar to the first-order case as recently discussed in the
literature, these mismatches introduce two undesired group behaviors: a
distorted final shape and a steady-state motion of the group formation. We show
that such undesired behaviors can be eliminated by combining the standard
formation control law with distributed estimators. Finally, we show how the
mismatches can be effectively employed as design parameters in order to control
a combined translational and rotational motion of the formation.

 <dc:title>Kernel-based Sensor Fusion with Application to Audio-Visual Voice
  Activity Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of multiple view data fusion in the
presence of noise and interferences. Recent studies have approached this
problem using kernel methods, by relying particularly on a product of kernels
constructed separately for each view. From a graph theory point of view, we
analyze this fusion approach in a discrete setting. More specifically, based on
a statistical model for the connectivity between data points, we propose an
algorithm for the selection of the kernel bandwidth, a parameter, which, as we
show, has important implications on the robustness of this fusion approach to
interferences. Then, we consider the fusion of audio-visual speech signals
measured by a single microphone and by a video camera pointed to the face of
the speaker. Specifically, we address the task of voice activity detection,
i.e., the detection of speech and non-speech segments, in the presence of
structured interferences such as keyboard taps and office noise. We propose an
algorithm for voice activity detection based on the audio-visual signal.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing
fusion and voice activity detection approaches. In addition, we demonstrate
that a proper selection of the kernel bandwidth indeed leads to improved
performance.

 <dc:title>High Dimensional Random Walks and Colorful Expansion</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kaufman, Tali</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Random walks on bounded degree expander graphs have numerous applications,
both in theoretical and practical computational problems. A key property of
these walks is that they converge rapidly to their stationary distribution.
  In this work we {\em define high order random walks}: These are
generalizations of random walks on graphs to high dimensional simplicial
complexes, which are the high dimensional analogues of graphs. A simplicial
complex of dimension $d$ has vertices, edges, triangles, pyramids, up to
$d$-dimensional cells. For any $0 \leq i &lt; d$, a high order random walk on
dimension $i$ moves between neighboring $i$-faces (e.g., edges) of the complex,
where two $i$-faces are considered neighbors if they share a common
$(i+1)$-face (e.g., a triangle). The case of $i=0$ recovers the well studied
random walk on graphs.
  We provide a {\em local-to-global criterion} on a complex which implies {\em
rapid convergence of all high order random walks} on it. Specifically, we prove
that if the $1$-dimensional skeletons of all the links of a complex are
spectral expanders, then for {\em all} $0 \le i &lt; d$ the high order random walk
on dimension $i$ converges rapidly to its stationary distribution.
  We derive our result through a new notion of high dimensional combinatorial
expansion of complexes which we term {\em colorful expansion}. This notion is a
natural generalization of combinatorial expansion of graphs and is strongly
related to the convergence rate of the high order random walks.
  We further show an explicit family of {\em bounded degree} complexes which
satisfy this criterion. Specifically, we show that Ramanujan complexes meet
this criterion, and thus form an explicit family of bounded degree high
dimensional simplicial complexes in which all of the high order random walks
converge rapidly to their stationary distribution.

 <dc:title>Unified Stochastic Geometry Model for MIMO Cellular Networks with

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a unified mathematical paradigm, based on stochastic
geometry, for downlink cellular networks with multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO) base stations (BSs). The developed paradigm accounts for signal
retransmission upon decoding errors, in which the temporal correlation among
the signal-to-interference plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of the original and
retransmitted signals is captured. In addition to modeling the effect of
retransmission on the network performance, the developed mathematical model
presents twofold analysis unification for MIMO cellular networks literature.
First, it integrates the tangible decoding error probability and the abstracted
(i.e., modulation scheme and receiver type agnostic) outage probability
analysis, which are largely disjoint in the literature. Second, it unifies the
analysis for different MIMO configurations. The unified MIMO analysis is
achieved by abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering
signals by Gaussian signaling approximation along with an equivalent SISO
representation for the per-data stream SINR in MIMO cellular networks. We show
that the proposed unification simplifies the analysis without sacrificing the
model accuracy. To this end, we discuss the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
imposed by different MIMO schemes and shed light on the diversity loss due to
the temporal correlation among the SINRs of the original and retransmitted
signals. Finally, several design insights are highlighted.

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of cloud providers has brought substantial interoperability
complexity to the public cloud market, in which cloud brokering has been
playing an important role. However, energy-related issues for public clouds
have not been well addressed in the literature. In this paper, we claim that
the broker is also situated in a perfect position where necessary actions can
be taken to achieve energy efficiency for public cloud systems, particularly
through job assignment and scheduling. We formulate the problem by a mixed
integer program and prove its NP-hardness. Based on the complexity analysis, we
simplify the problem by introducing admission control on jobs. In the sequel,
optimal job assignment can be done straightforwardly and the problem is
transformed into improving job admission rate by scheduling on two coupled
phases: data transfer and job execution. The two scheduling phases are further
decoupled and we develop efficient scheduling algorithm for each of them.
Experimental results show that the proposed solution can achieve significant
reduction on energy consumption with admission rates improved as well, even in
large-scale public cloud systems.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel Coupled Projection multi-task Metric Learning (CP-mtML)
method for large scale face retrieval. In contrast to previous works which were
limited to low dimensional features and small datasets, the proposed method
scales to large datasets with high dimensional face descriptors. It utilises
pairwise (dis-)similarity constraints as supervision and hence does not require
exhaustive class annotation for every training image. While, traditionally,
multi-task learning methods have been validated on same dataset but different
tasks, we work on the more challenging setting with heterogeneous datasets and
different tasks. We show empirical validation on multiple face image datasets
of different facial traits, e.g. identity, age and expression. We use classic
Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptors along with the recent Deep Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) features. The experiments clearly demonstrate the
scalability and improved performance of the proposed method on the tasks of
identity and age based face image retrieval compared to competitive existing
methods, on the standard datasets and with the presence of a million distractor
face images.

 <dc:description>  Our lives have been immensely improved by decades of automation research --
we are more comfortable, more productive and safer than ever before. Just
imagine a world where familiar automation technologies have failed. In that
world, thermostats don't work -- you have to monitor your home heating system
manually. Cruise control for your car doesn't exist. Every elevator has to have
a human operator to hit the right floor, most manufactured products are
assembled by hand, and you have to wash your own dishes. Who would willingly
adopt that world -- the world of last century -- today? Physical systems --
elevators, cars, home appliances, manufacturing equipment -- were more
troublesome, ore time consuming, less safe, and far less convenient. Now,
suppose we put ourselves in the place someone 20 years in the future, a future
of autonomous systems. A future where transportation is largely autonomous,
more efficient, and far safer; a future where dangerous occupations like mining
or disaster response are performed by autonomous systems supervised remotely by
humans; a future where manufacturing and healthcare are twice as productive per
person-hour by having smart monitoring and readily re-tasked autonomous
physical agents; a future where the elderly and infirm have 24 hour in-home
autonomous support for the basic activities, both physical and social, of daily
life. In a future world where these capabilities are commonplace, why would
someone come back to today's world where someone has to put their life at risk
to do a menial job, we lose time to mindless activities that have no intrinsic
value, or be consumed with worry that a loved one is at risk in their own home?
In what follows, and in a series of associated essays, we expand on these
ideas, and frame both the opportunities and challenges posed by autonomous
physical systems.

 <dc:description>  A recent McKinsey report estimates the economic impact of the Internet of
Things (IoT) to be between $3.9 to $11 trillion dollars by 20251 . IoT has the
potential to have a profound impact on our daily lives, including technologies
for the home, for health, for transportation, and for managing our natural
resources. The Internet was largely driven by information and ideas generated
by people, but advances in sensing and hardware have enabled computers to more
easily observe the physical world. Coupling this additional layer of
information with advances in machine learning brings dramatic new capabilities
including the ability to capture and process tremendous amounts of data; to
predict behaviors, activities, and the future in uncanny ways; and to
manipulate the physical world in response. This trend will fundamentally change
how people interact with physical objects and the environment. Success in
developing value-added capabilities around IoT requires a broad approach that
includes expertise in sensing and hardware, machine learning, networked
systems, human-computer interaction, security, and privacy. Strategies for
making IoT practical and spurring its ultimate adoption also require a
multifaceted approach that often transcends technology, such as with concerns
over data security, privacy, public policy, and regulatory issues. In this
paper we argue that existing best practices in building robust and secure
systems are insufficient to address the new challenges that IoT systems will
present. We provide recommendations regarding investments in research areas
that will help address inadequacies in existing systems, practices, tools, and
policies.

 <dc:description>  Keeler, Ross and Xia (2016) recently derived approximation and convergence
results, which imply that the point process formed from the signal strengths
received by an observer in a wireless network under a general statistical
propagation model can be modelled by an inhomogeneous Poisson point process on
the positive real line. The basic requirement for the results to apply is that
there must be a large number of transmitters with different locations and
random propagation effects.The aim of this note is to apply some of the main
results of Keeler, Ross and Xia (2016) in a less general but more easily
applicable form to illustrate how the results can be applied in practice. New
results are derived that show that it is the strongest signals, after being
weakened by random propagation effects, that behave like a Poisson process,
which supports recent experimental work.

 <dc:description>  There is a small but growing body of research on statistical scripts, models
of event sequences that allow probabilistic inference of implicit events from
documents. These systems operate on structured verb-argument events produced by
an NLP pipeline. We compare these systems with recent Recurrent Neural Net
models that directly operate on raw tokens to predict sentences, finding the
latter to be roughly comparable to the former in terms of predicting missing
events in documents.

 <dc:description>  This work studies problems in data reconstruction, an important area with
numerous applications. In particular, we examine the reconstruction of binary
and non-binary sequences from synchronization (insertion/deletion-correcting)
codes. These sequences have been corrupted by a fixed number of symbol
insertions (larger than the minimum edit distance of the code), yielding a
number of distinct traces to be used for reconstruction. We wish to know the
minimum number of traces needed for exact reconstruction. This is a general
version of a problem tackled by Levenshtein for uncoded sequences.
  We introduce an exact formula for the maximum number of common supersequences
shared by sequences at a certain edit distance, yielding an upper bound on the
number of distinct traces necessary to guarantee exact reconstruction. Without
specific knowledge of the codewords, this upper bound is tight. We apply our
results to the famous single deletion/insertion-correcting Varshamov-Tenengolts
(VT) codes and show that a significant number of VT codeword pairs achieve the
worst-case number of outputs needed for exact reconstruction. We also consider
extensions to other channels, such as adversarial deletion and
insertion/deletion channels and probabilistic channels.

 <dc:description>  How to achieve differential privacy in the distributed setting, where the
dataset is distributed among the distrustful parties, is an important problem.
We consider in what condition can a protocol inherit the differential privacy
property of a function it computes. The heart of the problem is the secure
multiparty computation of randomized function. A notion \emph{obliviousness} is
introduced, which captures the key security problems when computing a
randomized function from a deterministic one in the distributed setting. By
this observation, a sufficient and necessary condition about computing a
randomized function from a deterministic one is given. The above result can not
only be used to determine whether a protocol computing differentially private
function is secure, but also be used to construct secure one. Then we prove
that the differential privacy property of a function can be inherited by the
protocol computing it if the protocol privately computes it. A composition
theorem of differentially private protocols is also presented. We also
construct some protocols to generate random variate in the distributed setting,
such as the uniform random variates and the inversion method. By using these
fundamental protocols, we construct protocols of the Gaussian mechanism, the
Laplace mechanism and the Exponential mechanism. Importantly, all these
protocols satisfy obliviousness and so can be proved to be secure in a
simulation based manner. We also provide a complexity bound of computing
randomized function in the distribute setting. Finally, to show that our
results are fundamental and powerful to multiparty differential privacy, we
construct a differentially private empirical risk minimization protocol.

 <dc:description>  We address the global stabilization of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems
when the magnitude of the control input and its successive time derivatives, up
to an order $p\in\mathbb N$, are bounded by prescribed values. We propose a
static state feedback that solves this problem for any admissible LTI systems,
namely for stabilizable systems whose internal dynamics has no eigenvalue with
positive real part. This generalizes previous work done for single-input chains
of integrators and rotating dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Estimating mutual information from i.i.d. samples drawn from an unknown joint
density function is a basic statistical problem of broad interest with
multitudinous applications. The most popular estimator is one proposed by
Kraskov and St\&quot;ogbauer and Grassberger (KSG) in 2004, and is nonparametric and
based on the distances of each sample to its $k^{\rm th}$ nearest neighboring
sample, where $k$ is a fixed small integer. Despite its widespread use (part of
scientific software packages), theoretical properties of this estimator have
been largely unexplored. In this paper we demonstrate that the estimator is
consistent and also identify an upper bound on the rate of convergence of the
bias as a function of number of samples. We argue that the superior performance
benefits of the KSG estimator stems from a curious &quot;correlation boosting&quot;
effect and build on this intuition to modify the KSG estimator in novel ways to
construct a superior estimator. As a byproduct of our investigations, we obtain
nearly tight rates of convergence of the $\ell_2$ error of the well known fixed
$k$ nearest neighbor estimator of differential entropy by Kozachenko and
Leonenko.

 <dc:description>  In phylogenetics, a central problem is to infer the evolutionary
relationships between a set of species $X$; these relationships are often
depicted via a phylogenetic tree -- a tree having its leaves univocally labeled
by elements of $X$ and without degree-2 nodes -- called the &quot;species tree&quot;. One
common approach for reconstructing a species tree consists in first
constructing several phylogenetic trees from primary data (e.g. DNA sequences
originating from some species in $X$), and then constructing a single
phylogenetic tree maximizing the &quot;concordance&quot; with the input trees. The
so-obtained tree is our estimation of the species tree and, when the input
trees are defined on overlapping -- but not identical -- sets of labels, is
called &quot;supertree&quot;. In this paper, we focus on two problems that are central
when combining phylogenetic trees into a supertree: the compatibility and the
strict compatibility problems for unrooted phylogenetic trees. These problems
are strongly related, respectively, to the notions of &quot;containing as a minor&quot;
and &quot;containing as a topological minor&quot; in the graph community. Both problems
are known to be fixed-parameter tractable in the number of input trees $k$, by
using their expressibility in Monadic Second Order Logic and a reduction to
graphs of bounded treewidth. Motivated by the fact that the dependency on $k$
of these algorithms is prohibitively large, we give the first explicit dynamic
programming algorithms for solving these problems, both running in time
$2^{O(k^2)} \cdot n$, where $n$ is the total size of the input.

 <dc:description>  We consider \textsc{Persistence}, a new online problem concerning optimizing
weighted observations in a stream of data when the observer has limited buffer
capacity. A stream of weighted items arrive one at a time at the entrance of a
buffer with two holding locations. A processor (or observer) can process
(observe) an item at the buffer location it chooses, deriving this way the
weight of the observed item as profit. The main constraint is that the
processor can only move {\em synchronously} with the item stream; as a result,
moving from the end of the buffer to the entrance, it crosses paths with the
item already there, and will never have the chance to process or even identify
it. \textsc{Persistence}\ is the online problem of scheduling the processor
movements through the buffer so that its total derived value is maximized under
this constraint.
  We study the performance of the straight-forward heuristic {\em Threshold},
i.e., forcing the processor to &quot;follow&quot; an item through the whole buffer only
if its value is above a threshold. We analyze both the optimal offline and
Threshold algorithms in case the input stream is a random permutation, or its
items are iid valued. We show that in both cases the competitive ratio achieved
by the Threshold algorithm is at least $2/3$ when the only statistical
knowledge of the items is the median of all possible values. We generalize our
results by showing that Threshold, equipped with some minimal statistical
advice about the input, achieves competitive ratios in the whole spectrum
between $2/3$ and $1$, following the variation of a newly defined density-like
measure of the input. This result is a significant improvement over the case of
arbitrary input streams, since in this case we show that no online algorithm
can achieve a competitive ratio better than $1/2$.

 <dc:title>Semi-supervised learning of local structured output predictors</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Du, Xin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of semi-supervised structured output
prediction, which aims to learn predictors for structured outputs, such as
sequences, tree nodes, vectors, etc., from a set of data points of both
input-output pairs and single inputs without outputs. The traditional methods
to solve this problem usually learns one single predictor for all the data
points, and ignores the variety of the different data points. Different parts
of the data set may have different local distributions, and requires different
optimal local predictors. To overcome this disadvantage of existing methods, we
propose to learn different local predictors for neighborhoods of different data
points, and the missing structured outputs simultaneously. In the neighborhood
of each data point, we proposed to learn a linear predictor by minimizing both
the complexity of the predictor and the upper bound of the structured
prediction loss. The minimization is conducted by gradient descent algorithms.
Experiments over four benchmark data sets, including DDSM mammography medical
images, SUN natural image data set, Cora research paper data set, and Spanish
news wire article sentence data set, show the advantages of the proposed
method.

equipment, focusing on the robustness of using ISC for subjects experiencing
naturalistic stimuli. The present data shows that stimulus-evoked neural
responses, known to be modulated by attention, can be tracked in for groups of
students with synchronized EEG acquisition. This is a step towards real-time
inference of engagement in the classroom.

 <dc:title>Linearly Typed Dyadic Group Sessions for Building Multiparty Sessions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditionally, each party in a (dyadic or multiparty) session implements
exactly one role specified in the type of the session. We refer to this kind of
session as an individual session (i-session). As a generalization of i-session,
a group session (g-session) is one in which each party may implement a group of
roles based on one channel. In particular, each of the two parties involved in
a dyadic g-session implements either a group of roles or its complement. In
this paper, we present a formalization of g-sessions in a multi-threaded
lambda-calculus (MTLC) equipped with a linear type system, establishing for the
MTLC both type preservation and global progress. As this formulated MTLC can be
readily embedded into ATS, a full-fledged language with a functional
programming core that supports both dependent types (of DML-style) and linear
types, we obtain a direct implementation of linearly typed g-sessions in ATS.
The primary contribution of the paper lies in both of the identification of
g-sessions as a fundamental building block for multiparty sessions and the
theoretical development in support of this identification.

 <dc:description>  We prove several trace inequalities that extend the Golden-Thompson and the
Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality to arbitrarily many matrices. In particular, we
strengthen Lieb's triple matrix inequality. As an example application of our
four matrix extension of the Golden-Thompson inequality, we prove remainder
terms for the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy and strong
sub-additivity of the von Neumann entropy in terms of recoverability. We find
the first explicit remainder terms that are tight in the commutative case. Our
proofs rely on complex interpolation theory as well as asymptotic spectral
pinching, providing a transparent approach to treat generic multivariate trace
inequalities.

 <dc:title>Mapping Out Narrative Structures and Dynamics Using Networks and Textual
  Information</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Human communication is often executed in the form of a narrative, an account
of connected events composed of characters, actions, and settings. A coherent
narrative structure is therefore a requisite for a well-formulated narrative --
be it fictional or nonfictional -- for informative and effective communication,
opening up the possibility of a deeper understanding of a narrative by studying
its structural properties. In this paper we present a network-based framework
for modeling and analyzing the structure of a narrative, which is further
expanded by incorporating methods from computational linguistics to utilize the
narrative text. Modeling a narrative as a dynamically unfolding system, we
characterize its progression via the growth patterns of the character network,
and use sentiment analysis and topic modeling to represent the actual content
of the narrative in the form of interaction maps between characters with
associated sentiment values and keywords. This is a network framework advanced
beyond the simple occurrence-based one most often used until now, allowing one
to utilize the unique characteristics of a given narrative to a high degree.
Given the ubiquity and importance of narratives, such advanced network-based
representation and analysis framework may lead to a more systematic modeling
and understanding of narratives for social interactions, expression of human
sentiments, and communication.

 <dc:title>Amortized Dynamic Cell-Probe Lower Bounds from Four-Party Communication</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weinstein, Omri</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Huacheng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper develops a new technique for proving amortized, randomized
cell-probe lower bounds on dynamic data structure problems. We introduce a new
randomized nondeterministic four-party communication model that enables
&quot;accelerated&quot;, error-preserving simulations of dynamic data structures.
  We use this technique to prove an $\Omega(n(\log n/\log\log n)^2)$ cell-probe
lower bound for the dynamic 2D weighted orthogonal range counting problem
(2D-ORC) with $n/\mathrm{poly}\log n$ updates and $n$ queries, that holds even
for data structures with $\exp(-\tilde{\Omega}(n))$ success probability. This
result not only proves the highest amortized lower bound to date, but is also
tight in the strongest possible sense, as a matching upper bound can be
obtained by a deterministic data structure with worst-case operational time.
This is the first demonstration of a &quot;sharp threshold&quot; phenomenon for dynamic
data structures.
  Our broader motivation is that cell-probe lower bounds for exponentially
small success facilitate reductions from dynamic to static data structures. As
a proof-of-concept, we show that a slightly strengthened version of our lower
bound would imply an $\Omega((\log n /\log\log n)^2)$ lower bound for the
static 3D-ORC problem with $O(n\log^{O(1)}n)$ space. Such result would give a
near quadratic improvement over the highest known static cell-probe lower
bound, and break the long standing $\Omega(\log n)$ barrier for static data
structures.

 <dc:description>  To process data that do not fit in RAM, conventional wisdom would suggest
using distributed approaches. However, recent research has demonstrated virtual
memory's strong potential in scaling up graph mining algorithms on a single
machine. We propose to use a similar approach for general machine learning. We
contribute: (1) our latest finding that memory mapping is also a feasible
technique for scaling up general machine learning algorithms like logistic
regression and k-means, when data fits in or exceeds RAM (we tested datasets up
to 190GB); (2) an approach, called M3, that enables existing machine learning
algorithms to work with out-of-core datasets through memory mapping, achieving
a speed that is significantly faster than a 4-instance Spark cluster, and
comparable to an 8-instance cluster.

 <dc:description>  There is compelling evidence that coreference prediction would benefit from
modeling global information about entity-clusters. Yet, state-of-the-art
performance can be achieved with systems treating each mention prediction
independently, which we attribute to the inherent difficulty of crafting
informative cluster-level features. We instead propose to use recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) to learn latent, global representations of entity clusters
directly from their mentions. We show that such representations are especially
useful for the prediction of pronominal mentions, and can be incorporated into
an end-to-end coreference system that outperforms the state of the art without
requiring any additional search.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we analyze how user generated content (UGC) is created,
challenging the well known {\it wisdom of crowds} concept. Although it is known
that user activity in most settings follow a power law, that is, few people do
a lot, while most do nothing, there are few studies that characterize well this
activity. In our analysis of datasets from two different social networks,
Facebook and Twitter, we find that a small percentage of active users and much
less of all users represent 50\% of the UGC. We also analyze the dynamic
behavior of the generation of this content to find that the set of most active
users is quite stable in time. Moreover, we study the social graph, finding
that those active users are highly connected among them. This implies that most
of the wisdom comes from a few users, challenging the independence assumption
needed to have a wisdom of crowds. We also address the content that is never
seen by any people, which we call digital desert, that challenges the
assumption that the content of every person should be taken in account in a
collective decision. We also compare our results with Wikipedia data and we
address the quality of UGC content using an Amazon dataset. At the end our
results are not surprising, as the Web is a reflection of our own society,
where economical or political power also is in the hands of minorities.

 <dc:description>  Channel estimation for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO with hybrid
precoding is challenging, since the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is
usually much smaller than that of antennas. To date, several channel estimation
schemes have been proposed for mmWave massive MIMO over narrow-band channels,
while practical mmWave channels exhibit the frequency-selective fading (FSF).
To this end, this letter proposes a multi-user uplink channel estimation scheme
for mmWave massive MIMO over FSF channels. Specifically, by exploiting the
angle-domain structured sparsity of mmWave FSF channels, a distributed
compressive sensing (DCS)-based channel estimation scheme is proposed.
Moreover, by using the grid matching pursuit strategy with adaptive measurement
matrix, the proposed algorithm can solve the power leakage problem caused by
the continuous angles of arrival or departure (AoA/AoD). Simulation results
verify that the good performance of the proposed solution.

 <dc:subject>B.8.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a first of its kind framework which overcomes a major challenge in
the design of digital systems that are resilient to reliability failures:
achieve desired resilience targets at minimal costs (energy, power, execution
time, area) by combining resilience techniques across various layers of the
system stack (circuit, logic, architecture, software, algorithm). This is also
referred to as cross-layer resilience. In this paper, we focus on
radiation-induced soft errors in processor cores. We address both single-event
upsets (SEUs) and single-event multiple upsets (SEMUs) in terrestrial
environments. Our framework automatically and systematically explores the large
space of comprehensive resilience techniques and their combinations across
various layers of the system stack (586 cross-layer combinations in this
paper), derives cost-effective solutions that achieve resilience targets at
minimal costs, and provides guidelines for the design of new resilience
techniques. We demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our framework
using two diverse designs: a simple, in-order processor core and a complex,
out-of-order processor core. Our results demonstrate that a carefully optimized
combination of circuit-level hardening, logic-level parity checking, and
micro-architectural recovery provides a highly cost-effective soft error
resilience solution for general-purpose processor cores. For example, a 50x
improvement in silent data corruption rate is achieved at only 2.1% energy cost
for an out-of-order core (6.1% for an in-order core) with no speed impact.
However, selective circuit-level hardening alone, guided by a thorough analysis
of the effects of soft errors on application benchmarks, provides a
cost-effective soft error resilience solution as well (with ~1% additional
energy cost for a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate).

 <dc:title>Fast Computation of Isomorphisms Between Finite Fields Using Elliptic

 <dc:description>  We propose a randomized algorithm to compute isomorphisms between finite
fields using elliptic curves. To compute an isomorphism between two fields of
cardinality $q^n$, our algorithm takes $\widetilde{O}\left(n \log^2 q +
\max_{\ell} (\ell^{n_\ell + 1} \log^2 q + \ell \log^5q)\right)$ time, where
$\ell$ runs through primes dividing $n$ but not $q(q-1)$ and $n_\ell$ denotes
the highest power of $\ell$ dividing $n$. Prior to this work, the best known
run time dependence on $n$ was quadratic. Our run time dependence on $n$ is at
worst quadratic but is subquadratic if $n$ has no large prime factor. In
particular, the $n$ for which our run time is linear in $n$ have natural
density at least $3/10$.The crux of our approach is finding preimages under the
Lang map on elliptic curves over finite fields. We formulate a computational
problem concerning Lang maps whose resolution would solve the finite field
isomorphism problem with run time linear in $n$.

 <dc:title>Reservoir computing for spatiotemporal signal classification without

 <dc:description>  Reservoir computing is a recently introduced machine learning paradigm that
has been shown to be well-suited for the processing of spatiotemporal data.
Rather than training the network node connections and weights via
backpropagation in traditional recurrent neural networks, reservoirs instead
have fixed connections and weights among the `hidden layer' nodes, and
traditionally only the weights to the output layer of neurons are trained using
linear regression. We claim that for signal classification tasks one may forgo
the weight training step entirely and instead use a simple supervised
clustering method based upon principal components of norms of reservoir states.
The proposed method is mathematically analyzed and explored through numerical
experiments on real-world data. The examples demonstrate that the proposed may
outperform the traditional trained output weight approach in terms of
classification accuracy and sensitivity to reservoir parameters.

 <dc:title>Fully-Automatic Synapse Prediction and Validation on a Large Data Set</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Extracting a connectome from an electron microscopy (EM) data set requires
identification of neurons and determination of synapses between neurons. As
manual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been
extensive research effort to automatically segment the neurons to help guide
and eventually replace manual tracing. Until recently, there has been
comparatively less research on automatically detecting the actual synapses
between neurons. This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several
factors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a
connectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating
synapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in
determining connections.
  However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a
sufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has
improved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more
significant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get
worse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we
address this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect
pre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,
pre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive
Network, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features
conditioned on the local segmentation.
  This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages
advances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for
polyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our
algorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. These metrics demonstrate that
complete automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most
connectivity correctly.

 <dc:description>  Aptamers, short synthetic RNA/DNA molecules binding specific targets with
high affinity and specificity, are utilized in an increasing spectrum of
bio-medical applications. Aptamers are identified in vitro via the Systematic
Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) protocol. SELEX selects
binders through an iterative process that, starting from a pool of random
ssDNA/RNA sequences, amplifies target-affine species through a series of
selection cycles. HT-SELEX, which combines SELEX with high throughput
sequencing, has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the
field to even more applications. HT-SELEX is capable of generating over half a
billion data points, challenging computational scientists with the task of
identifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine
binding. While currently available motif finding approaches suggest partial
solutions to this question, none possess the generality or scalability required
for HT-SELEX data, and they do not take advantage of important properties of
the experimental procedure.
  We present AptaTRACE, a novel approach for the identification of
sequence-structure binding motifs in HT-SELEX derived aptamers. Our approach
leverages the experimental design of the SELEX protocol and identifies
sequence-structure motifs that show a signature of selection. Because of its
unique approach, AptaTRACE can uncover motifs even when these are present in
only a minuscule fraction of the pool. Due to these features, our method can
help to reduce the number of selection cycles required to produce aptamers with
the desired properties, thus reducing cost and time of this rather expensive
procedure. The performance of the method on simulated and real data indicates
that AptaTRACE can detect sequence-structure motifs even in highly challenging
data.

 <dc:description>  Received signal strength based radio tomographic imaging is a popular
device-free indoor localization method which reconstructs the spatial loss
field of the environment using measurements from a dense wireless network.
Existing methods solve an associated inverse problem using algebraic or
compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms. We propose an alternative imaging
method that reconstructs spatial field of occupancy using a back-projection
based reconstruction algorithm. The introduced system has the following
advantages over the other imaging based methods: i.) significantly lower
computational complexity such that no floating point multiplication is
required; ii.) each link's measured data is compressed to a single bit,
providing improved scalability; iii.) physically significant and repeatable
parameters. The proposed method is validated using measurement data. Results
show that the proposed method achieves the above advantages without loss of
accuracy compared to the other available methods.

 <dc:description>  We prove that with high probability over the choice of a random graph $G$
from the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi distribution $G(n,1/2)$, the $n^{O(d)}$-time degree
$d$ Sum-of-Squares semidefinite programming relaxation for the clique problem
will give a value of at least $n^{1/2-c(d/\log n)^{1/2}}$ for some constant
$c&gt;0$. This yields a nearly tight $n^{1/2 - o(1)}$ bound on the value of this
program for any degree $d = o(\log n)$. Moreover we introduce a new framework
that we call \emph{pseudo-calibration} to construct Sum of Squares lower
bounds. This framework is inspired by taking a computational analog of Bayesian
probability theory. It yields a general recipe for constructing good
pseudo-distributions (i.e., dual certificates for the Sum-of-Squares
semidefinite program), and sheds further light on the ways in which this
hierarchy differs from others.

 <dc:title>Different quantum f-divergences and the reversibility of quantum

 <dc:description>  The concept of classical $f$-divergences gives a unified framework to
construct and study measures of dissimilarity of probability distributions;
special cases include the relative entropy and the R\'enyi divergences. Various
quantum versions of this concept, and more narrowly, the concept of R\'enyi
divergences, have been introduced in the literature with applications in
quantum information theory; most notably Petz' quasi-entropies (standard
$f$-divergences), Matsumoto's maximal $f$-divergences, measured
$f$-divergences, and sandwiched and $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences.
  In this paper we give a systematic overview of the various concepts of
quantum $f$-divergences with a main focus on their monotonicity under quantum
operations, and the implications of the preservation of a quantum
$f$-divergence by a quantum operation. In particular, we compare the standard
and the maximal $f$-divergences regarding their ability to detect the
reversibility of quantum operations. We also show that these two quantum
$f$-divergences are strictly different for non-commuting operators unless $f$
is a polynomial, and obtain some analogous partial results for the relation
between the measured and the standard $f$-divergences.
  We also study the monotonicity of the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences under
the special class of bistochastic maps that leave one of the arguments of the
R\'enyi divergence invariant, and determine domains of the parameters
$\alpha,z$ where monotonicity holds, and where the preservation of the
$\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergence implies the reversibility of the quantum
operation.

 <dc:description>  The development of machine learning in particular and artificial intelligent
in general has been strongly conditioned by the lack of an appropriated
framework to specify and integrate learning processes, data transformation
processes and data models. In this work we extend traditional algebraic
specification methods to this type of framework. Limits and colimits of
diagrams are universal constructions fundamental in different mathematical
domains importance in semantic modeling. The aim of our work is to study the
possibility of extending these algebraic frameworks to the specification of
vague structures and to the description of vague patterns on data.

 <dc:description>  This work describes a methodology that combines logic-based systems and
connectionist systems. Our approach uses finite truth-valued {\L}ukasiewicz
logic, wherein every connective can be defined by a neuron in an artificial
network. This allowed the injection of first-order formulas into a network
architecture, and also simplified symbolic rule extraction. For that we trained
a neural networks using the Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, where we restricted
the knowledge dissemination in the network structure. This procedure reduces
neural network plasticity without drastically damaging the learning
performance, thus making the descriptive power of produced neural networks
similar to the descriptive power of {\L}ukasiewicz logic language and
simplifying the translation between symbolic and connectionist structures. We
used this method for reverse engineering truth table and in extraction of
formulas from real data sets.

 <dc:description>  Public debates are a common platform for presenting and juxtaposing diverging
views on important issues. In this work we propose a methodology for tracking
how ideas flow between participants throughout a debate. We use this approach
in a case study of Oxford-style debates---a competitive format where the winner
is determined by audience votes---and show how the outcome of a debate depends
on aspects of conversational flow. In particular, we find that winners tend to
make better use of a debate's interactive component than losers, by actively
pursuing their opponents' points rather than promoting their own ideas over the
course of the conversation.

 <dc:description>  The social conventions and expectations around the appropriate use of imaging
and video has been transformed by the availability of video cameras in our
pockets. The impact on law enforcement can easily be seen by watching the
nightly news; more and more arrests, interventions, or even routine stops are
being caught on cell phones or surveillance video, with both positive and
negative consequences. This proliferation of the use of video has led law
enforcement to look at the potential benefits of incorporating video capture
systematically in their day to day operations. At the same time, recognition of
the inevitability of widespread use of video for police operations has caused a
rush to deploy all types of cameras, including body worn cameras. However, the
vast majority of police agencies have limited experience in utilizing video to
its full advantage, and thus do not have the capability to fully realize the
value of expanding their video capabilities. In this white paper, we highlight
some of the technology needs and challenges of body-worn cameras, and we relate
these needs to the relevant state of the art in computer vision and multimedia
research. We conclude with a set of recommendations.

 <dc:description>  Efficient text indexing data structures have enabled large-scale genomic
sequence analysis and are used to help solve problems ranging from assembly to
read mapping. However, these data structures typically assume that the
underlying reference text is static and will not change over the course of the
queries being made. Some progress has been made in exploring how certain text
indices, like the suffix array, may be updated, rather than rebuilt from
scratch, when the underlying reference changes. Yet, these update operations
can be complex in practice, difficult to implement, and give fairly pessimistic
worst-case bounds. We present a novel data structure, SkipPatch, for
maintaining a k-mer-based index over a dynamically changing genome. SkipPatch
pairs a hash-based k-mer index with an indexable skip list that is used to
efficiently maintain the set of edits that have been applied to the original
genome. SkipPatch is practically fast, significantly outperforming the dynamic
extended suffix array in terms of update and query speed.

 <dc:description>  In this study, the problem of shallow parsing of Hindi-English code-mixed
social media text (CSMT) has been addressed. We have annotated the data,
developed a language identifier, a normalizer, a part-of-speech tagger and a
shallow parser. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt
shallow parsing on CSMT. The pipeline developed has been made available to the
research community with the goal of enabling better text analysis of Hindi
English CSMT. The pipeline is accessible at http://bit.ly/csmt-parser-api .

 <dc:title>Optimal Binary Coding for $q^+$ -state Data Embedding</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Han-Zhou</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In steganography, we always hope to maximize the embedding payload subject to
an upper-bounded distortion. We need suitable distortion measurement to
evaluate the embedding impact. However, different distortion functions exposes
different levels of distortion evaluation, implying that we have different
optimization distributions by applying different distortion functions. In
applications, the embedding distortion is caused by a certain number of
embedding operations. Instead of a predefined distortion, we actually utilize a
number of modifications to embed as many message bits as possible as long as
the modifications are acceptable. This paper focuses on the design of optimal
binary codewords for data embedding with a limited number of modification
candidates. We have proved the optimality of the designed codewords, and
proposed the way to construct the optimal binary codewords. It is pointed out
that the optimal binary code is not unique, and an optimal code can be computed
within a low computational cost.

 <dc:description>  Data sparsity, that is a common problem in neighbor-based collaborative
filtering domain, usually complicates the process of item recommendation. This
problem is more serious in collaborative ranking domain, in which calculating
the users similarities and recommending items are based on ranking data. Some
graph-based approaches have been proposed to address the data sparsity problem,
but they suffer from two flaws. First, they fail to correctly model the users
priorities, and second, they cannot be used when the only available data is a
set of ranking instead of rating values. In this paper, we propose a novel
graph-based approach, called GRank, that is designed for collaborative ranking
domain. GRank can correctly model users priorities in a new tripartite graph
structure, and analyze it to directly infer a recommendation list. The
experimental results show a significant improvement in recommendation quality
compared to the state of the art graph-based recommendation algorithms and
other collaborative ranking techniques.

 <dc:title>Phase Transitions and a Model Order Selection Criterion for Spectral

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the longstanding open problems in spectral graph clustering (SGC) is
the so-called model order selection problem: automated selection of the correct
number of clusters. This is equivalent to the problem of finding the number of
connected components or communities in an undirected graph. We propose
automated model order selection (AMOS), a solution to the SGC model selection
problem under a random interconnection model (RIM) using a novel selection
criterion that is based on an asymptotic phase transition analysis. AMOS can
more generally be applied to discovering hidden block diagonal structure in
symmetric non-negative matrices. Numerical experiments on simulated graphs
validate the phase transition analysis, and real-world network data is used to
validate the performance of the proposed model selection procedure.

 <dc:description>  Great advances in computing and communication technology are bringing many
benefits to society, with transformative changes and financial opportunities
being created in health care, transportation, education, law enforcement,
national security, commerce, and social interactions. Many of these benefits,
however, involve the use of sensitive personal data, and thereby raise concerns
about privacy. Failure to address these concerns can lead to a loss of trust in
the private and public institutions that handle personal data, and can stifle
the independent thought and expression that is needed for our democracy to
flourish.
  This report, sponsored by the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), suggests
a roadmap for privacy research over the next decade, aimed at enabling society
to appropriately control threats to privacy while enjoying the benefits of
information technology and data science. We hope that it will be useful to the
agencies of the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and
Development (NITRD) Program as they develop a joint National Privacy Research
Strategy over the coming months. The report synthesizes input drawn from the
privacy and computing communities submitted to both the CCC and NITRD, as well
as past reports on the topic.

 <dc:description>  High computational complexity hinders the widespread usage of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), especially in mobile devices. Hardware accelerators are
arguably the most promising approach for reducing both execution time and power
consumption. One of the most important steps in accelerator development is
hardware-oriented model approximation. In this paper we present Ristretto, a
model approximation framework that analyzes a given CNN with respect to
numerical resolution used in representing weights and outputs of convolutional
and fully connected layers. Ristretto can condense models by using fixed point
arithmetic and representation instead of floating point. Moreover, Ristretto
fine-tunes the resulting fixed point network. Given a maximum error tolerance
of 1%, Ristretto can successfully condense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit.
The code for Ristretto is available.

 <dc:description>  Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid
identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of
the necessary infrastructure. The combination of increasing global smartphone
penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep
learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a
public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected
under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to
identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained
model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the
feasibility of this approach. When testing the model on a set of images
collected from trusted online sources - i.e. taken under conditions different
from the images used for training - the model still achieves an accuracy of
31.4%. While this accuracy is much higher than the one based on random
selection (2.6%), a more diverse set of training data is needed to improve the
general accuracy. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on
increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path
towards smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.

 <dc:description>  We present a general framework for proving polynomial sample complexity
bounds for the problem of learning from samples the best auction in a class of
&quot;simple&quot; auctions. Our framework captures all of the most prominent examples of
&quot;simple&quot; auctions, including anonymous and non-anonymous item and bundle
pricings, with either a single or multiple buyers. The technique we propose is
to break the analysis of auctions into two natural pieces. First, one shows
that the set of allocation rules have large amounts of structure; second,
fixing an allocation on a sample, one shows that the set of auctions agreeing
with this allocation on that sample have revenue functions with low
dimensionality. Our results effectively imply that whenever it's possible to
compute a near-optimal simple auction with a known prior, it is also possible
to compute such an auction with an unknown prior (given a polynomial number of
samples).

 <dc:title>Adaptive Caching Networks with Optimality Guarantees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ioannidis, Stratis</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of optimal content placement over a network of caches, a
problem naturally arising in several networking applications, including ICNs,
CDNs, and P2P systems. Given a demand of content request rates and paths
followed, we wish to determine the content placement that maximizes the
expected caching gain, i.e., the reduction of routing costs due to intermediate
caching. The offline version of this problem is NP-hard and, in general, the
demand and topology may be a priori unknown. Hence, a distributed, adaptive,
constant approximation content placement algorithm is desired. We show that
path replication, a simple algorithm frequently encountered in literature, can
be arbitrarily suboptimal when combined with traditional eviction policies,
like LRU, LFU, or FIFO. We propose a distributed, adaptive algorithm that
performs stochastic gradient ascent on a concave relaxation of the expected
caching gain, and constructs a probabilistic content placement within 1-1/e
factor from the optimal, in expectation. Motivated by our analysis, we also
propose a novel greedy eviction policy to be used with path replication, and
show through numerical evaluations that both algorithms significantly
outperform path replication with traditional eviction policies over a broad
array of network topologies.

 <dc:description>  Peer grading systems work well only if users have incentives to grade
truthfully. An example of non-truthful grading, that we observed in classrooms,
consists in students assigning the maximum grade to all submissions. With a
naive grading scheme, such as averaging the assigned grades, all students would
receive the maximum grade. In this paper, we develop three grading schemes that
provide incentives for truthful peer grading. In the first scheme, the
instructor grades a fraction p of the submissions, and penalizes students whose
grade deviates from the instructor grade. We provide lower bounds on p to
ensure truthfulness, and conclude that these schemes work only for moderate
class sizes, up to a few hundred students. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a hierarchical extension of this supervised scheme, and we show that it
can handle classes of any size with bounded (and little) instructor work, and
is therefore applicable to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Finally, we
propose unsupervised incentive schemes, in which the student incentive is based
on statistical properties of the grade distribution, without any grading
required by the instructor. We show that the proposed unsupervised schemes
provide incentives to truthful grading, at the price of being possibly unfair
to individual students.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two realizations of linear quantum systems for covariance
assignment corresponding to pure Gaussian states. The first one is called a
cascade realization; given any covariance matrix corresponding to a pure
Gaussian state, we can construct a cascaded quantum system generating that
state. The second one is called a locally dissipative realization; given a
covariance matrix corresponding to a pure Gaussian state, if it satisfies
certain conditions, we can construct a linear quantum system that has only
local interactions with its environment and achieves the assigned covariance
matrix. Both realizations are illustrated by examples from quantum optics.

 <dc:description>  This tutorial is intended as an accessible but rigorous first reference for
someone interested in learning how to model and analyze cellular network
performance using stochastic geometry. In particular, we focus on computing the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution, which can be
characterized by the coverage probability (the SINR CCDF) or the outage
probability (its CDF). We model base stations (BSs) in the network as a
realization of a homogeneous Poisson point process of density $\lambda$, and
compute the SINR for three main cases: the downlink, uplink, and finally the
multi-tier downlink, which is characterized by having $k$ tiers of BSs each
with a unique density $\lambda_i$ and transmit power $p_i$. These three
baseline results have been extensively extended to many different scenarios,
and we conclude with a brief summary of some of those extensions.

 <dc:description>  The requirements elicited from stakeholders suffer from various afflictions,
including informality, incompleteness, ambiguity, vagueness, inconsistencies,
and more. It is the task of requirements engineering (RE) processes to derive
from these an eligible (formal, complete enough, unambiguous, consistent,
measurable, satisfiable, modifiable and traceable) requirements specification
that truly captures stakeholder needs.
  We propose Desiree, a refinement calculus for systematically transforming
stakeholder require-ments into an eligible specification. The core of the
calculus is a rich set of requirements operators that iteratively transform
stakeholder requirements by strengthening or weakening them, thereby reducing
incompleteness, removing ambiguities and vagueness, eliminating unattainability
and conflicts, turning them into an eligible specification. The framework also
includes an ontology for modeling and classifying requirements, a
description-based language for representing requirements, as well as a
systematic method for applying the concepts and operators. In addition, we
define the semantics of the requirements concepts and operators, and develop a
graphical modeling tool in support of the entire framework.
  To evaluate our proposal, we have conducted a series of empirical
evaluations, including an ontology evaluation by classifying a large public
requirements set, a language evaluation by rewriting the large set of
requirements using our description-based syntax, a method evaluation through a
realistic case study, and an evaluation of the entire framework through three
controlled experiments. The results of our evaluations show that our ontology,
language, and method are adequate in capturing requirements in practice, and
offer strong evidence that with sufficient training, our framework indeed helps
people conduct more effective requirements engineering.

 <dc:description>  The second-order statistics (SOS) can be applied in estimation of the pure
spectra of chemical components from the spectrum of their mixture, when SOS
seems to be good at estimation of spectral patterns, but their peak directions
are opposite in some cases. In this paper, one method for judgment of the peak
direction of the pure spectra was proposed, where the base line of the pure
spectra was drawn by using their histograms and the peak directions were chosen
so as to make all of the pure spectra located upwards over the base line.
Results of the SOS analysis on the visible hyperspectral images of the mixture
composed of two or three chemical components showed that the present method
offered the reasonable shape and direction of the pure spectra of its
components.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the optimal control of multibody systems being actuated
with control forces in order to find a dynamically feasible minimum-energy
trajectory of the system. The optimal control problem and its constraints are
integrated in a discrete version of the equation of motion allowing the
minimization of system energy with respect to a discrete state and control
trajectory. The work is centred on a specific type of open-chain multibody
system, with strong local propensity, where the overall system kinematics is
described essentially by the torsion around the links that connect rigid
bodies. The coupling between the rigid body motion, and the optimal
conformation is described as an elastic band of replicas of the original system
with different conformations. The band forces are used to control system's
motion directly, reflecting the influence of the system energy field on its
conformation, using for that the Nudged-Elastic Band method. Here the equation
of motion of the multibody grid are solved by using the augmented Lagrangean
method. In this context, if a feasible minimum-energy trajectory of the
original system exists it is a stationary state of the extended system. This
approach is applied to the folding of a single chain protein.

 <dc:description>  Privacy protection from surreptitious video recordings is an important
societal challenge. We desire a computer vision system (e.g., a robot) that can
recognize human activities and assist our daily life, yet ensure that it is not
recording video that may invade our privacy. This paper presents a fundamental
approach to address such contradicting objectives: human activity recognition
while only using extreme low-resolution (e.g., 16x12) anonymized videos. We
introduce the paradigm of inverse super resolution (ISR), the concept of
learning the optimal set of image transformations to generate multiple
low-resolution (LR) training videos from a single video. Our ISR learns
different types of sub-pixel transformations optimized for the activity
classification, allowing the classifier to best take advantage of existing
high-resolution videos (e.g., YouTube videos) by creating multiple LR training
videos tailored for the problem. We experimentally confirm that the paradigm of
inverse super resolution is able to benefit activity recognition from extreme
low-resolution videos.

 <dc:description>  Imaging methods used in modern neuroscience experiments are quickly producing
large amounts of data capable of providing increasing amounts of knowledge
about neuroanatomy and function. A great deal of information in these datasets
is relatively unexplored and untapped. One of the bottlenecks in knowledge
extraction is that often there is no feedback loop between the knowledge
produced (e.g., graph, density estimate, or other statistic) and the earlier
stages of the pipeline (e.g., acquisition). We thus advocate for the
development of sample-to-knowledge discovery pipelines that one can use to
optimize acquisition and processing steps with a particular end goal (i.e.,
piece of knowledge) in mind. We therefore propose that optimization takes place
not just within each processing stage but also between adjacent (and
non-adjacent) steps of the pipeline. Furthermore, we explore the existing
categories of knowledge representation and models to motivate the types of
experiments and analysis needed to achieve the ultimate goal. To illustrate
this approach, we provide an experimental paradigm to answer questions about
large-scale synaptic distributions through a multimodal approach combining
X-ray microtomography and electron microscopy.

 <dc:description>  We present a method for the classification of multi-labelled text documents
explicitly designed for data stream applications that require to process a
virtually infinite sequence of data using constant memory and constant
processing time. Our method is composed of an online procedure used to
efficiently map text into a low-dimensional feature space and a partition of
this space into a set of regions for which the system extracts and keeps
statistics used to predict multi-label text annotations. Documents are fed into
the system as a sequence of words, mapped to a region of the partition, and
annotated using the statistics computed from the labelled instances colliding
in the same region. This approach is referred to as clashing. We illustrate the
method in real-world text data, comparing the results with those obtained using
other text classifiers. In addition, we provide an analysis about the effect of
the representation space dimensionality on the predictive performance of the
system. Our results show that the online embedding indeed approximates the
geometry of the full corpus-wise TF and TF-IDF space. The model obtains
competitive F measures with respect to the most accurate methods, using
significantly fewer computational resources. In addition, the method achieves a
higher macro-averaged F measure than methods with similar running time.
Furthermore, the system is able to learn faster than the other methods from
partially labelled streams.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the capacity region of the general distributed index
coding. In contrast to the traditional centralized index coding where a single
server contains all $n$ messages requested by the receivers, in the distributed
index coding there are $2^n-1$ servers, each containing a unique non-empty
subset $J$ of the messages and each is connected to all receivers via a
noiseless independent broadcast link with an arbitrary capacity $C_J \ge 0$.
First, we generalize the existing polymatroidal outer bound on the capacity
region of the centralized problem to the distributed case. Next, building upon
the existing centralized composite coding scheme, we propose three distributed
composite coding schemes and derive the corresponding inner bounds on the
capacity region. We present a number of interesting numerical examples, which
highlight the subtleties and challenges of dealing with the distributed index
coding, even for very small problem sizes of $n=3$ and $n=4$.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new approach for disfluency detection using a Bidirectional
Long-Short Term Memory neural network (BLSTM). In addition to the word
sequence, the model takes as input pattern match features that were developed
to reduce sensitivity to vocabulary size in training, which lead to improved
performance over the word sequence alone. The BLSTM takes advantage of explicit
repair states in addition to the standard reparandum states. The final output
leverages integer linear programming to incorporate constraints of disfluency
structure. In experiments on the Switchboard corpus, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance for both the standard disfluency detection task
and the correction detection task. Analysis shows that the model has better
detection of non-repetition disfluencies, which tend to be much harder to
detect.

 <dc:description>  There are billions of lines of sequential code inside nowadays' software
which do not benefit from the parallelism available in modern multicore
architectures. Automatically parallelizing sequential code, to promote an
efficient use of the available parallelism, has been a research goal for some
time now. This work proposes a new approach for achieving such goal. We created
a new parallelizing compiler that analyses the read and write instructions, and
control-flow modifications in programs to identify a set of dependencies
between the instructions in the program. Afterwards, the compiler, based on the
generated dependencies graph, rewrites and organizes the program in a
task-oriented structure. Parallel tasks are composed by instructions that
cannot be executed in parallel. A work-stealing-based parallel runtime is
responsible for scheduling and managing the granularity of the generated tasks.
Furthermore, a compile-time granularity control mechanism also avoids creating
unnecessary data-structures. This work focuses on the Java language, but the
techniques are general enough to be applied to other programming languages. We
have evaluated our approach on 8 benchmark programs against OoOJava, achieving
higher speedups. In some cases, values were close to those of a manual
parallelization. The resulting parallel code also has the advantage of being
readable and easily configured to improve further its performance manually.

 <dc:description>  Web service composition has been one of the most researched topics of the
past decade. Novel methods of web service composition are being proposed in the
literature include Semantics-based composition, WSDLbased composition. Although
these methods provide promising results for composition, search and discovery
of web service based on QoS parameter of network and semantics or ontology
associated with WSDL, they do not address composition based on usage of web
service. Web Service usage logs capture time series data of web service
invocation by business objects, which innately captures patterns or workflows
associated with business operations. Web service composition based on such
patterns and workflows can greatly streamline the business operations. In this
research work, we try to explore and implement methods of mining web service
usage logs. Main objectives include Identifying usage association of services.

 <dc:description>  Data integration is the process of collecting data from different data
sources and providing user with unified view of answers that meet his
requirements. The quality of query answers can be improved by identifying the
quality of data sources according to some quality measures and retrieving data
from only significant ones. Query answers that returned from significant data
sources can be ranked according to quality requirements that specified in user
query and proposed queries types to return only top-k query answers. In this
paper, Data integration framework called data integration to return ranked
alternatives (DIRA) will be introduced depending on data quality assessment
module that will use data sources quality to choose the significant ones and
ranking algorithm to return top-k query answers according to different queries
types.

 <dc:description>  The evaluation of journals based on their influence is of interest for
numerous reasons. Various methods of computing a score have been proposed for
measuring the scientific influence of scholarly journals. Typically the
computation of any of these scores involves compiling the citation information
pertaining to the journal under consideration. This involves significant
overhead since the article citation information of not only the journal under
consideration but also that of other journals for the recent few years need to
be stored. Our work is motivated by the idea of developing a computationally
lightweight approach that does not require any data storage, yet yields a score
which is useful for measuring the importance of journals. In this paper, a
regression analysis based method is proposed to calculate Journal Influence
Score. Proposed model is validated using historical data from the SCImago
portal. The results show that the error is small between rankings obtained
using the proposed method and the SCImago Journal Rank, thus proving that the
proposed approach is a feasible and effective method of calculating scientific

 <dc:description>  Advances in multimedia and ad-hoc networking have urged a wealth of research
in multimedia delivery over ad-hoc networks. This comes as no surprise, as
those networks are versatile and beneficial to a plethora of applications where
the use of fully wired network has proved intricate if not impossible, such as
prompt formation of networks during conferences, disaster relief in case of
flood and earthquake, and also in war activities. It this paper, we aim to
investigate the combined impact of network sparsity and network node density on
the Peak Signal Noise to Ratio (PSNR) and jitter performance of proactive and
reactive routing protocols in ad-hoc networks. We also shed light onto the
combined effect of mobility and sparsity on the performance of these protocols.
We validate our results through the use of an integrated Simulator-Evaluator
environment consisting of the Network Simulator NS2, and the Video Evaluation
Framework Evalvid.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a new variant of the blossom, the $(p,q)$-blossom, is
introduced, by altering the diagonal property of the standard blossom. This
$(p,q)$-blossom has been adapted for developing identities and algorithms for
$(p,q)$-Bernstein bases and $(p,q)$-B$\acute{e}$zier curves. We generate
several new identities including an explicit formula representing the monomials
in terms of the $(p,q)$-Bernstein basis functions and a $(p,q)$-variant of
Marsden's identity by applying the $(p,q)$-blossom. We also derive for each
$(p,q)$-B$\acute{e}$zier curve of degree $n,$ a collection of $n!$ new, affine
invariant, recursive evaluation algorithms. Using two of these new recursive
evaluation algorithms, we construct a recursive subdivision algorithm for
$(p,q)$-B$\acute{e}$zier curves.

 <dc:title>Leveraging Network Dynamics for Improved Link Prediction</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The aim of link prediction is to forecast connections that are most likely to
occur in the future, based on examples of previously observed links. A key
insight is that it is useful to explicitly model network dynamics, how
frequently links are created or destroyed when doing link prediction. In this
paper, we introduce a new supervised link prediction framework, RPM (Rate
Prediction Model). In addition to network similarity measures, RPM uses the
predicted rate of link modifications, modeled using time series data; it is
implemented in Spark-ML and trained with the original link distribution, rather
than a small balanced subset. We compare the use of this network dynamics model
to directly creating time series of network similarity measures. Our
experiments show that RPM, which leverages predicted rates, outperforms the use
of network similarity measures, either individually or within a time series.

 <dc:description>  Power quality standards (IEEE-519) require to limit the total harmonic
distortion within satisfactory range caused by power electronic based devices.
Our work deals with the design of hybrid active filter to reduce current
perturbations produced by power electronics based devices. The Instantaneous
Active and Reactive Power Method (pq) is used to perform the identification of
disturbing currents. The pq algorithm creates a reference current, whereas,
this reference current is tracked by the current of the voltage source
converter. The currents of the voltage source converter are controlled by
hysteresis controller. Simulation results showed that the hybrid active filter
can compensate the harmonic currents effectively and improve power quality.

 <dc:description>  Facial expressions are widely used in the behavioral interpretation of
emotions, cognitive science, and social interactions. In this paper, we present
a novel method for fully automatic facial expression recognition in facial
image sequences. As the facial expression evolves over time facial landmarks
are automatically tracked in consecutive video frames, using displacements
based on elastic bunch graph matching displacement estimation. Feature vectors
from individual landmarks, as well as pairs of landmarks tracking results are
extracted, and normalized, with respect to the first frame in the sequence. The
prototypical expression sequence for each class of facial expression is formed,
by taking the median of the landmark tracking results from the training facial
expression sequences. Multi-class AdaBoost with dynamic time warping similarity
distance between the feature vector of input facial expression and prototypical
facial expression, is used as a weak classifier to select the subset of
discriminative feature vectors. Finally, two methods for facial expression
recognition are presented, either by using multi-class AdaBoost with dynamic
time warping, or by using support vector machine on the boosted feature
vectors. The results on the Cohn-Kanade (CK+) facial expression database show a
recognition accuracy of 95.17% and 97.35% using multi-class AdaBoost and
support vector machines, respectively.

 <dc:description>  Main-memory database management systems (DBMS) can achieve excellent
performance when processing massive volume of on-line transactions on modern
multi-core machines. But existing durability schemes, namely, tuple-level and
transaction-level logging-and-recovery mechanisms, either degrade the
performance of transaction processing or slow down the process of failure
recovery. In this paper, we show that, by exploiting application semantics, it
is possible to achieve speedy failure recovery without introducing any costly
logging overhead to the execution of concurrent transactions. We propose
PACMAN, a parallel database recovery mechanism that is specifically designed
for lightweight, coarse-grained transaction-level logging. PACMAN leverages a
combination of static and dynamic analyses to parallelize the log recovery: at
compile time, PACMAN decomposes stored procedures by carefully analyzing
dependencies within and across programs; at recovery time, PACMAN exploits the
availability of the runtime parameter values to attain an execution schedule
with a high degree of parallelism. As such, recovery performance is remarkably
increased. We evaluated PACMAN in a fully-fledged main-memory DBMS running on a
40-core machine. Compared to several state-of-the-art database recovery
mechanisms, PACMAN can significantly reduce recovery time without compromising
the efficiency of transaction processing.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional-deconvolution networks can be adopted to perform end-to-end
saliency detection. But, they do not work well with objects of multiple scales.
To overcome such a limitation, in this work, we propose a recurrent attentional
convolutional-deconvolution network (RACDNN). Using spatial transformer and
recurrent network units, RACDNN is able to iteratively attend to selected image
sub-regions to perform saliency refinement progressively. Besides tackling the
scale problem, RACDNN can also learn context-aware features from past
iterations to enhance saliency refinement in future iterations. Experiments on
several challenging saliency detection datasets validate the effectiveness of
RACDNN, and show that RACDNN outperforms state-of-the-art saliency detection
methods.

 <dc:title>Efficient Parallel Algorithms for k-Center Clustering</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The k-center problem is one of several classic NP-hard clustering questions.
For contemporary massive data sets, RAM-based algorithms become impractical.
And although there exist good sequential algorithms for k-center, they are not
easily parallelizable.
  In this paper, we design and implement parallel approximation algorithms for
this problem. We observe that Gonzalez's greedy algorithm can be efficiently
parallelized in several MapReduce rounds; in practice, we find that two rounds
are sufficient, leading to a 4-approximation. We contrast this with an existing
parallel algorithm for k-center that runs in a constant number of rounds, and
offers a 10-approximation. In depth runtime analysis reveals that this scheme
is often slow, and that its sampling procedure only runs if k is sufficiently
small, relative to the input size. To trade off runtime for approximation
guarantee, we parameterize this sampling algorithm, and find in our experiments
that the algorithm is not only faster, but sometimes more effective. Yet the
parallel version of Gonzalez is about 100 times faster than both its sequential
version and the parallel sampling algorithm, barely compromising solution
quality.

 <dc:title>Hippo: A Fast, yet Scalable, Database Indexing Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Even though existing database indexes (e.g., B+-Tree) speed up the query
execution, they suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) A database index usually
yields 5% to 15% additional storage overhead which results in non-ignorable
dollar cost in big data scenarios especially when deployed on modern storage
devices like Solid State Disk (SSD) or Non-Volatile Memory (NVM). (2)
Maintaining a database index incurs high latency because the DBMS has to find
and update those index pages affected by the underlying table changes. This
paper proposes Hippo a fast, yet scalable, database indexing approach. Hippo
only stores the pointers of disk pages along with light weight histogram-based
summaries. The proposed structure significantly shrinks index storage and
maintenance overhead without compromising much on query execution performance.
Experiments, based on real Hippo implementation inside PostgreSQL 9.5, using
the TPC-H benchmark show that Hippo achieves up to two orders of magnitude less
storage space and up to three orders of magnitude less maintenance overhead
than traditional database indexes, i.e., B+-Tree. Furthermore, the experiments
also show that Hippo achieves comparable query execution performance to that of
the B+-Tree for various selectivity factors.

 <dc:description>  The different Wikipedia language editions vary dramatically in how
comprehensive they are. As a result, most language editions contain only a
small fraction of the sum of information that exists across all Wikipedias. In
this paper, we present an approach to filling gaps in article coverage across
different Wikipedia editions. Our main contribution is an end-to-end system for
recommending articles for creation that exist in one language but are missing
in another. The system involves identifying missing articles, ranking the
missing articles according to their importance, and recommending important
missing articles to editors based on their interests. We empirically validate
our models in a controlled experiment involving 12,000 French Wikipedia
editors. We find that personalizing recommendations increases editor engagement
by a factor of two. Moreover, recommending articles increases their chance of
being created by a factor of 3.2. Finally, articles created as a result of our
recommendations are of comparable quality to organically created articles.
Overall, our system leads to more engaged editors and faster growth of
Wikipedia with no effect on its quality.

 <dc:description>  Object detection is a fundamental problem in image understanding. One popular
solution is the R-CNN framework and its fast versions. They decompose the
object detection problem into two cascaded easier tasks: 1) generating object
proposals from images, 2) classifying proposals into various object categories.
Despite that we are handling with two relatively easier tasks, they are not
solved perfectly and there's still room for improvement. In this paper, we push
the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; solution even further by dividing each task into two
sub-tasks. We call the proposed method &quot;CRAFT&quot; (Cascade Region-proposal-network
And FasT-rcnn), which tackles each task with a carefully designed network
cascade. We show that the cascade structure helps in both tasks: in proposal
generation, it provides more compact and better localized object proposals; in
object classification, it reduces false positives (mainly between ambiguous
categories) by capturing both inter- and intra-category variances. CRAFT
achieves consistent and considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art on
object detection benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 07/12 and ILSVRC.

 <dc:description>  Individuals change their behavior during an epidemic in response to whether
they and/or those they interact with are healthy or sick. Healthy individuals
are concerned about contracting a disease from their sick contacts and may
utilize protective measures. Sick individuals may be concerned with spreading
the disease to their healthy contacts and adopt preemptive measures. Yet, in
practice both protective and preemptive changes in behavior come with costs.
This paper proposes a stochastic network disease game model that captures the
self-interests of individuals during the spread of a
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) disease where individuals react to
current risk of disease spread, and their reactions together with the current
state of the disease stochastically determine the next stage of the disease. We
show that there is a critical level of concern, i.e., empathy, by the sick
individuals above which disease is eradicated fast. Furthermore, we find that
if the network and disease parameters are above the epidemic threshold, the
risk averse behavior by the healthy individuals cannot eradicate the disease
without the preemptive measures of the sick individuals. This imbalance in the
role played by the response of the infected versus the susceptible individuals
in disease eradication affords critical policy insights.

 <dc:description>  We study the complexity of the problem of searching for a set of patterns
that separate two given sets of strings. This problem has applications in a
wide variety of areas, most notably in data mining, computational biology, and
in understanding the complexity of genetic algorithms. We show that the basic
problem of finding a small set of patterns that match one set of strings but do
not match any string in a second set is difficult (NP-complete, W[2]-hard when
parameterized by the size of the pattern set, and APX-hard). We then perform a
detailed parameterized analysis of the problem, separating tractable and
intractable variants. In particular we show that parameterizing by the size of
pattern set and the number of strings, and the size of the alphabet and the
number of strings give FPT results, amongst others.

 <dc:description>  Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, providing a comprehensive
landscape of protein interacting patterns, enable us to explore biological
processes and cellular components at multiple resolutions. For a biological
process, a number of proteins need to work together to perform the job.
Proteins densely interact with each other, forming large molecular machines or
cellular building blocks. Identification of such densely interconnected
clusters or protein complexes from PPI networks enables us to obtain a better
understanding of the hierarchy and organization of biological processes and
cellular components. Most existing methods apply efficient graph clustering
algorithms on PPI networks, often failing to detect possible densely connected
subgraphs and overlapped subgraphs. Besides clustering-based methods, dense
subgraph enumeration methods have also been used, which aim to find all densely
connected protein sets. However, such methods are not practically tractable
even on a small yeast PPI network, due to high computational complexity. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approximate algorithm to efficiently enumerate
putative protein complexes from biological networks. The key insight of our
algorithm is that we do not need to enumerate all dense subgraphs. Instead we
only need to find a small subset of subgraphs that cover as many proteins as
possible. The problem is formulated as finding a diverse set of dense
subgraphs, where we develop highly effective pruning techniques to guarantee
efficiency. To handle large networks, we take a divide-and-conquer approach to
speed up the algorithm in a distributed manner. By comparing with existing
clustering and dense subgraph-based algorithms on several human and yeast PPI
networks, we demonstrate that our method can detect more putative protein
complexes and achieves better prediction accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has been recognized as a promising
technique to offload the traffic for the evolved Node B (eNB). However, the D2D
transmission as an underlay causes severe interference to both the cellular and
other D2D links, which imposes a great technical challenge to radio resource
allocation. Conventional graph based resource allocation methods typically
consider the interference between two user equipments (UEs), but they cannot
model the interference from multiple UEs to completely characterize the
interference. In this paper, we study channel allocation using hypergraph
theory to coordinate the interference between D2D pairs and cellular UEs, where
an arbitrary number of D2D pairs are allowed to share the uplink channels with
the cellular UEs. Hypergraph coloring is used to model the cumulative
interference from multiple D2D pairs, and thus, eliminate the mutual
interference. Simulation results show that the system capacity is significantly
improved using the proposed hypergraph method in comparison to the conventional
graph based one.

 <dc:title>Thesis: Multiple Kernel Learning for Object Categorization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Govindaraj, Dinesh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Object Categorization is a challenging problem, especially when the images
have clutter background, occlusions or different lighting conditions. In the
past, many descriptors have been proposed which aid object categorization even
in such adverse conditions. Each descriptor has its own merits and de-merits.
Some descriptors are invariant to transformations while the others are more
discriminative. Past research has shown that, employing multiple descriptors
rather than any single descriptor leads to better recognition. The problem of
learning the optimal combination of the available descriptors for a particular
classification task is studied. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework has
been developed for learning an optimal combination of descriptors for object
categorization. Existing MKL formulations often employ block l-1 norm
regularization which is equivalent to selecting a single kernel from a library
of kernels. Since essentially a single descriptor is selected, the existing
formulations maybe sub- optimal for object categorization. A MKL formulation
based on block l-infinity norm regularization has been developed, which chooses
an optimal combination of kernels as opposed to selecting a single kernel. A
Composite Multiple Kernel Learning(CKL) formulation based on mixed l-infinity
and l-1 norm regularization has been developed. These formulations end in
Second Order Cone Programs(SOCP). Other efficient alter- native algorithms for
these formulation have been implemented. Empirical results on benchmark
datasets show significant improvement using these new MKL formulations.

 <dc:description>  In many data classification problems, there is no linear relationship between
an explanatory and the dependent variables. Instead, there may be ranges of the
input variable for which the observed outcome is signficantly more or less
likely. This paper describes an algorithm for automatic detection of such
thresholds, called the Univariate Flagging Algorithm (UFA). The algorithm
searches for a separation that optimizes the difference between separated areas
while providing the maximum support. We evaluate its performance using three
examples and demonstrate that thresholds identified by the algorithm align well
with visual inspection and subject matter expertise. We also introduce two
classification approaches that use UFA and show that the performance attained
on unseen test data is equal to or better than that of more traditional
classifiers. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust against
missing data and noise, is scalable, and is easy to interpret and visualize. It
is also well suited for problems where incidence of the target is low.

 <dc:description>  Impressive progress has been made in the fields of computer vision and
natural language processing. However, it remains a challenge to find the best
point of interaction for these very different modalities. In this chapter we
discuss how attributes allow us to exchange information between the two
modalities and in this way lead to an interaction on a semantic level.
Specifically we discuss how attributes allow using knowledge mined from
language resources for recognizing novel visual categories, how we can generate
sentence description about images and video, how we can ground natural language
in visual content, and finally, how we can answer natural language questions
about images.

 <dc:description>  Motivation: De novo transcriptome assembly of non-model organisms is the
first major step for many RNA-seq analysis tasks. Current methods for de novo
assembly often report a large number of contiguous sequences (contigs), which
may be fractured and incomplete sequences instead of full-length transcripts.
Dealing with a large number of such contigs can slow and complicate downstream
analysis.
  Results :We present a method for clustering contigs from de novo
transcriptome assemblies based upon the relationships exposed by multi-mapping
sequencing fragments. Specifically, we cast the problem of clustering contigs
as one of clustering a sparse graph that is induced by equivalence classes of
fragments that map to subsets of the transcriptome. Leveraging recent
developments in efficient read mapping and transcript quantification, we have
developed RapClust, a tool implementing this approach that is capable of
accurately clustering most large de novo transcriptomes in a matter of minutes,
while simultaneously providing accurate estimates of expression for the
resulting clusters. We compare RapClust against a number of tools commonly used
for de novo transcriptome clustering. Using de novo assemblies of organisms for
which reference genomes are available, we assess the accuracy of these
different methods in terms of the quality of the resulting clusterings, and the
concordance of differential expression tests with those based on ground truth
clusters. We find that RapClust produces clusters of comparable or better
quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches, and does so substantially
faster. RapClust also confers a large benefit in terms of space usage, as it
produces only succinct intermediate files - usually on the order of a few
megabytes - even when processing hundreds of millions of reads.

 <dc:description>  3D shape models are becoming widely available and easier to capture, making
available 3D information crucial for progress in object classification. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on CNNs to address this problem. Recently, we
witness two types of CNNs being developed: CNNs based upon volumetric
representations versus CNNs based upon multi-view representations. Empirical
results from these two types of CNNs exhibit a large gap, indicating that
existing volumetric CNN architectures and approaches are unable to fully
exploit the power of 3D representations. In this paper, we aim to improve both
volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs according to extensive analysis of existing
approaches. To this end, we introduce two distinct network architectures of
volumetric CNNs. In addition, we examine multi-view CNNs, where we introduce
multi-resolution filtering in 3D. Overall, we are able to outperform current
state-of-the-art methods for both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs. We
provide extensive experiments designed to evaluate underlying design choices,
thus providing a better understanding of the space of methods available for
object classification on 3D data.

predefined risk-driven grouping of stocks. Our procedure uses online convex
optimization to control capital allocation to underlying investment algorithms
while encouraging non-sparsity over the given grouping. We prove a logarithmic
regret for this procedure with respect to the best-in-hindsight ensemble. We
applied the procedure with known mean-reversion portfolio selection algorithms
using the standard GICS industry sector grouping. Empirical Experimental
results showed an impressive percentage increase of risk-adjusted return

 <dc:description>  We study the new concept of relative coobservability in decentralized
supervisory control of discrete-event systems under partial observation. This
extends our previous work on relative observability from a centralized setup to
a decentralized one. A fundamental concept in decentralized supervisory control
is coobservability (and its several variations); this property is not, however,
closed under set union, and hence there generally does not exist the supremal
element. Our proposed relative coobservability, although stronger than
coobservability, is algebraically well-behaved, and the supremal relatively
coobservable sublanguage of a given language exists. We present an algorithm to
compute this supremal sublanguage. Moreover, relative coobservability is weaker
than conormality, which is also closed under set union; unlike conormality,
relative coobservability imposes no constraint on disabling unobservable
controllable events.

 <dc:description>  The simplest example of an infinite Burnside group arises in the class of
automaton groups. However there is no known example of such a group generated
by a reversible Mealy automaton. It has been proved that, for a connected
automaton of size at most~3, or when the automaton is not bireversible, the
generated group cannot be Burnside infinite. In this paper, we extend these
results to automata with bigger stateset, proving that, if a connected
reversible automaton has a prime number of states, it cannot generate an
infinite Burnside group.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study several microphone channel selection and weighting
methods for robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy conditions. For
channel selection, we investigate two methods based on the maximum likelihood
(ML) criterion and minimum autoencoder reconstruction criterion, respectively.
For channel weighting, we produce enhanced log Mel filterbank coefficients as a
weighted sum of the coefficients of all channels. The weights of the channels
are estimated by using the ML criterion with constraints. We evaluate the
proposed methods on the CHiME-3 noisy ASR task. Experiments show that channel
weighting significantly outperforms channel selection due to its higher
flexibility. Furthermore, on real test data in which different channels have
different gains of the target signal, the channel weighting method performs
equally well or better than the MVDR beamforming, despite the fact that the
channel weighting does not make use of the phase delay information which is
normally used in beamforming.

 <dc:description>  The most common representation in evolutionary computation are bit strings.
This is ideal to model binary decision variables, but less useful for variables
taking more values. With very little theoretical work existing on how to use
evolutionary algorithms for such optimization problems, we study the run time
of simple evolutionary algorithms on some OneMax-like functions defined over
$\Omega = \{0, 1, \dots, r-1\}^n$. More precisely, we regard a variety of
problem classes requesting the component-wise minimization of the distance to
an unknown target vector $z \in \Omega$. For such problems we see a crucial
difference in how we extend the standard-bit mutation operator to these
multi-valued domains. While it is natural to select each position of the
solution vector to be changed independently with probability $1/n$, there are
various ways to then change such a position. If we change each selected
position to a random value different from the original one, we obtain an
expected run time of $\Theta(nr \log n)$. If we change each selected position
by either $+1$ or $-1$ (random choice), the optimization time reduces to
$\Theta(nr + n\log n)$. If we use a random mutation strength $i \in
\{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}^n$ with probability inversely proportional to $i$ and change
the selected position by either $+i$ or $-i$ (random choice), then the
optimization time becomes $\Theta(n \log(r)(\log(n)+\log(r)))$, bringing down
the dependence on $r$ from linear to polylogarithmic. One of our results
depends on a new variant of the lower bounding multiplicative drift theorem.

 <dc:title>Confidence Decision Trees via Online and Active Learning for Streaming
  (BIG) Data</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Decision tree classifiers are a widely used tool in data stream mining. The
use of confidence intervals to estimate the gain associated with each split
leads to very effective methods, like the popular Hoeffding tree algorithm.
From a statistical viewpoint, the analysis of decision tree classifiers in a
streaming setting requires knowing when enough new information has been
collected to justify splitting a leaf. Although some of the issues in the
statistical analysis of Hoeffding trees have been already clarified, a general
and rigorous study of confidence intervals for splitting criteria is missing.
We fill this gap by deriving accurate confidence intervals to estimate the
splitting gain in decision tree learning with respect to three criteria:
entropy, Gini index, and a third index proposed by Kearns and Mansour. Our
confidence intervals depend in a more detailed way on the tree parameters. We
also extend our confidence analysis to a selective sampling setting, in which
the decision tree learner adaptively decides which labels to query in the
stream. We furnish theoretical guarantee bounding the probability that the
classification is non-optimal learning the decision tree via our selective
sampling strategy. Experiments on real and synthetic data in a streaming
setting show that our trees are indeed more accurate than trees with the same
number of leaves generated by other techniques and our active learning module
permits to save labeling cost. In addition, comparing our labeling strategy
with recent methods, we show that our approach is more robust and consistent
respect all the other techniques applied to incremental decision trees.

 <dc:title>Optimal Content Placement for Offloading in Cache-enabled Heterogeneous

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Caching at base stations (BSs) is a promising way to offload traffic and
eliminate backhaul bottleneck in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). In this
paper, we investigate the optimal content placement maximizing the successful
offloading probability in a cache-enabled HetNet where a tier of multi-antenna
macro BSs (MBSs) is overlaid with a tier of helpers with caches. Based on
probabilistic caching framework, we resort to stochastic geometry theory to
derive the closed-form successful offloading probability and formulate the
caching probability optimization problem, which is not concave in general. In
two extreme cases with high and low user-to-helper density ratios, we obtain
the optimal caching probability and analyze the impacts of BS density and
transmit power of the two tiers and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) threshold. In general case, we obtain the optimal caching probability
that maximizes the lower bound of successful offloading probability and analyze
the impact of user density. Simulation and numerical results show that when the
ratios of MBS-to-helper density, MBS-to-helper transmit power and
user-to-helper density, and the SINR threshold are large, the optimal caching
policy tends to cache the most popular files everywhere.

 <dc:description>  We present an attention-based model for end-to-end handwriting recognition.
Our system does not require any segmentation of the input paragraph. The model
is inspired by the differentiable attention models presented recently for
speech recognition, image captioning or translation. The main difference is the
covert and overt attention, implemented as a multi-dimensional LSTM network.
Our principal contribution towards handwriting recognition lies in the
automatic transcription without a prior segmentation into lines, which was
crucial in previous approaches. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
successful attempt of end-to-end multi-line handwriting recognition. We carried
out experiments on the well-known IAM Database. The results are encouraging and
bring hope to perform full paragraph transcription in the near future.

 <dc:title>Vector Network Coding Based on Subspace Codes Outperforms Scalar Linear

 <dc:creator>Wachter-Zeh, Antonia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers vector network coding based on rank-metric codes and
subspace codes. Our main result is that vector network coding can significantly
reduce the required field size compared to scalar linear network coding in the
same multicast network. The achieved gap between the field size of scalar and
vector network coding is in the order of $q^{(\ell-1)t^2/\ell}-q^t$, for any $q
\geq 2$, where $t$ denotes the dimension of the vector solution, and the number
of messages is $2 \ell$, ${\ell \geq 2}$. Previously, only a gap of constant
size had been shown. This implies also the same gap between the field size in
linear and non-linear scalar network coding for multicast networks. Similar
results are given for any number of odd messages greater than two. The results
are obtained by considering several multicast networks which are variations of
the well-known combination network.

 <dc:description>  To relax power consumption requirements in multigigabit/s communications
systems low resolution quantization can be used. Information-theoretic results
have shown that systems employing 1-bit quantization and oversampling are a
viable option for this. This work investigates such a structure under the
influence of additive Gaussian noise and two matched pulse shaping filters. It
is described how a BCJR algorithm, based on a finite-state channel assumption,
can be used to reconstruct symbols of higher order modulation schemes that
allow the transmission of more than one bit per symbol. Furthermore, it is
shown how symbol sources that are fitted to the 1-bit constraint can
significantly improve the error rate performance of the system.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the estimation of channel coefficients and
frequency offsets for LOS MIMO systems. We propose that by exploiting the
structure of the channel matrix, which is present due to the geometrical nature
of the channel, the estimation process can be enhanced. If a single oscillator
setup is used at transmitter and receiver, respectively, this structure is
preserved and can be exploited. Some methods using this fact are discussed and
their performance is evaluated with respect to estimation accuracy, revealing
that with relatively short training sequences, estimation results close to the
fundamental bounds can be achieved.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a solution to Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) large
scale route planning and task assignment joint problem. Given a set of
constraints (e.g., time) and a set of task priority values, the goal is to find
the optimal route for underwater mission that maximizes the sum of the
priorities and minimizes the total risk percentage while meeting the given
constraints. Making use of the heuristic nature of genetic and swarm
intelligence algorithms in solving NP-hard graph problems, Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are employed to find the optimum
solution, where each individual in the population is a candidate solution
(route). To evaluate the robustness of the proposed methods, the performance of
the all PS and GA algorithms are examined and compared for a number of Monte
Carlo runs. Simulation results suggest that the routes generated by both
algorithms are feasible and reliable enough, and applicable for underwater
motion planning. However, the GA-based route planner produces superior results
comparing to the results obtained from the PSO based route planner.

attention in recent years as a natural extension of orthogonal matching
pursuit. It is used to recover sparse signals in compressive sensing. In this
paper, a new bound is obtained for the exact reconstruction of every $K$-sparse
signal via the gOMP algorithm in the noiseless case. That is, if the restricted
isometry constant (RIC) $\delta_{NK+1}$ of the sensing matrix $A$ satisfies
\begin{eqnarray*} \delta_{NK+1}&lt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{K}{N}+1}}, \end{eqnarray*}
then the gOMP can perfectly recover every $K$-sparse signal $x$ from $y=Ax$.
Furthermore, the bound is proved to be sharp in the following sense. For any
given positive integer $K$, we construct a matrix $A$ with the RIC
\begin{eqnarray*} \delta_{NK+1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{K}{N}+1}} \end{eqnarray*}
such that the gOMP may fail to recover some $K$-sparse signal $x$.
  In the noise case, an extra condition on the minimum magnitude of the nonzero
components of every $K-$sparse signal combining with the above bound on RIC of
the sensing matrix $A$ is sufficient to recover the true support of every
$K$-sparse signal by the gOMP.

 <dc:description>  Expansion of today's underwater scenarios and missions necessitates the
requestion for robust decision making of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
(AUV); hence, design an efficient decision making framework is essential for
maximizing the mission productivity in a restricted time. This paper focuses on
developing a deliberative conflict-free-task assignment architecture
encompassing a Global Route Planner (GRP) and a Local Path Planner (LPP) to
provide consistent motion planning encountering both environmental dynamic
changes and a priori knowledge of the terrain, so that the AUV is reactively
guided to the target of interest in the context of an unknown underwater
environment. The architecture involves three main modules: The GRP module at
the top level deals with the task priority assignment, mission time management,
and determination of a feasible route between start and destination point in a
large scale environment. The LPP module at the lower level deals with safety
considerations and generates collision-free optimal trajectory between each
specific pair of waypoints listed in obtained global route. Re-planning module
tends to promote robustness and reactive ability of the AUV with respect to the
environmental changes. The experimental results for different simulated
missions, demonstrate the inherent robustness and drastic efficiency of the
proposed scheme in enhancement of the vehicles autonomy in terms of mission
productivity, mission time management, and vehicle safety.

 <dc:title>Attacks on Fitness Trackers Revisited: A Case-Study of Unfit Firmware
  Security</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rieck, Jakob</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Fitness trackers - wearables that continuously record a wearer's step count
and related activity data - are quickly gaining in popularity. Apart from being
useful for individuals seeking a more healthy lifestyle, their data is also
being used in court and by insurance companies to adjust premiums. For these
use cases, it is essential to ensure authenticity and integrity of data. Here
we demonstrate a flaw in the way firmware for Withings' Activit\'e is verified,
allowing an adversary to compromise the tracker itself. This type of attack has
so far not been applied to fitness trackers. Vendors have started mitigating
previous attacks, which manipulated data by interfering with wireless channels,
or by physically moving the tracker to fool sensors. Hardware similarities
amongst different trackers suggest findings can be transferred to other tracker
as well.

 <dc:description>  The holy Quran is the holy book of the Muslims. It contains information about
many domains. Often people search for particular concepts of holy Quran based
on the relations among concepts. An ontological modeling of holy Quran can be
useful in such a scenario. In this paper, we have modeled nature related
concepts of holy Quran using OWL (Web Ontology Language) / RDF (Resource
Description Framework). Our methodology involves identifying nature related
concepts mentioned in holy Quran and identifying relations among those
concepts. These concepts and relations are represented as classes/instances and
properties of an OWL ontology. Later, in the result section it is shown that,
using the Ontological model, SPARQL queries can retrieve verses and concepts of
interest. Thus, this modeling helps semantic search and query on the holy
Quran. In this work, we have used English translation of the holy Quran by
Sahih International, Protege OWL Editor and for querying we have used SPARQL.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we address the prospects and key enabling technologies for
highly efficient and accurate device positioning and tracking in 5G radio
access networks. Building on the premises of ultra-dense networks as well as on
the adoption of multicarrier waveforms and antenna arrays in the access nodes
(ANs), we first formulate extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solutions for
computationally efficient joint estimation and tracking of the time of arrival
(ToA) and direction of arrival (DoA) of the user nodes (UNs) using uplink
reference signals. Then, a second EKF stage is proposed in order to fuse the
individual DoA/ToA estimates from one or several ANs into a UN position
estimate. Since all the processing takes place at the network side, the
computing complexity and energy consumption at the UN side are kept to a
minimum. The cascaded EKFs proposed in this article also take into account the
unavoidable relative clock offsets between UNs and ANs, such that reliable
clock synchronization of the access-link is obtained as a valuable by-product.
The proposed cascaded EKF scheme is then revised and extended to more general
and challenging scenarios where not only the UNs have clock offsets against the
network time, but also the ANs themselves are not mutually synchronized in
time. Finally, comprehensive performance evaluations of the proposed solutions
on a realistic 5G network setup, building on the METIS project based outdoor
Madrid map model together with complete ray tracing based propagation modeling,
are provided. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that by using the
developed methods, sub-meter scale positioning and tracking accuracy of moving
devices is indeed technically feasible in future 5G radio access networks
operating at sub-6GHz frequencies, despite the realistic assumptions related to
clock offsets and potentially even under unsynchronized network elements.

 <dc:description>  Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA), in which attackers emulate primary user
signals causing restriction of secondary access on the attacked channels, is a
serious security problem in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). An user performing
a PUEA for selfishly occupying more channels is called a selfish PUEA attacker.
Network managers could adopt a surveillance process on disallowed channels for
identifying illegal channel occupation of selfish PUEA attackers and hence
mitigating selfish PUEA. Determining surveillance strategies, particularly in
multi-channel context, is necessary for ensuring network operation fairness. In
this paper, we formulate a game, called multi-channel surveillance game,
between the selfish attack and the surveillance process in multi-channel CRNs.
The sequence-form representation method is adopted to determine the Nash
Equilibrium (NE) of the game. We show that performing the obtained NE
surveillance strategy significantly mitigates selfish PUEA.

 <dc:description>  We propose a mobility-assisted on-demand routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc
networks in the presence of location errors. Location awareness enables mobile
nodes to predict their mobility and enhances routing performance by estimating
link duration and selecting reliable routes. However, measured locations
intrinsically include errors in measurement. Such errors degrade mobility
prediction and have been ignored in previous work. To mitigate the impact of
location errors on routing, we propose an on-demand routing algorithm taking
into account location errors. To that end, we adopt the Kalman filter to
estimate accurate locations and consider route confidence in discovering
routes. Via simulations, we compare our algorithmand previous algorithms in
various environments. Our proposed mobility prediction is robust to the
location errors.

 <dc:description>  Discriminative methods often generate hand poses kinematically implausible,
then generative methods are used to correct (or verify) these results in a
hybrid method. Estimating 3D hand pose in a hierarchy, where the
high-dimensional output space is decomposed into smaller ones, has been shown
effective. Existing hierarchical methods mainly focus on the decomposition of
the output space while the input space remains almost the same along the
hierarchy. In this paper, a hybrid hand pose estimation method is proposed by
applying the kinematic hierarchy strategy to the input space (as well as the
output space) of the discriminative method by a spatial attention mechanism and
to the optimization of the generative method by hierarchical Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO). The spatial attention mechanism integrates cascaded and
hierarchical regression into a CNN framework by transforming both the input(and
feature space) and the output space, which greatly reduces the viewpoint and
articulation variations. Between the levels in the hierarchy, the hierarchical
PSO forces the kinematic constraints to the results of the CNNs. The
experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms four
state-of-the-art methods and three baselines on three public benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a notion of algorithmic stability called typical
stability. When our goal is to release real-valued queries (statistics)
computed over a dataset, this notion does not require the queries to be of
bounded sensitivity -- a condition that is generally assumed under differential
privacy [DMNS06, Dwork06] when used as a notion of algorithmic stability
[DFHPRR15a, DFHPRR15b, BNSSSU16] -- nor does it require the samples in the
dataset to be independent -- a condition that is usually assumed when
generalization-error guarantees are sought. Instead, typical stability requires
the output of the query, when computed on a dataset drawn from the underlying
distribution, to be concentrated around its expected value with respect to that
distribution.
  We discuss the implications of typical stability on the generalization error
(i.e., the difference between the value of the query computed on the dataset
and the expected value of the query with respect to the true data
distribution). We show that typical stability can control generalization error
in adaptive data analysis even when the samples in the dataset are not
necessarily independent and when queries to be computed are not necessarily of
bounded-sensitivity as long as the results of the queries over the dataset
(i.e., the computed statistics) follow a distribution with a &quot;light&quot; tail.
Examples of such queries include, but not limited to, subgaussian and
subexponential queries.
  We also discuss the composition guarantees of typical stability and prove
composition theorems that characterize the degradation of the parameters of
typical stability under $k$-fold adaptive composition. We also give simple
noise-addition algorithms that achieve this notion. These algorithms are
similar to their differentially private counterparts, however, the added noise
is calibrated differently.

 <dc:description>  This paper establishes for the first time the predictive performance of speed
priors and their computational complexity. A speed prior is essentially a
probability distribution that puts low probability on strings that are not
efficiently computable. We propose a variant to the original speed prior
(Schmidhuber, 2002), and show that our prior can predict sequences drawn from
probability measures that are estimable in polynomial time. Our speed prior is
computable in doubly-exponential time, but not in polynomial time. On a
polynomial time computable sequence our speed prior is computable in
exponential time. We show better upper complexity bounds for Schmidhuber's
speed prior under the same conditions, and that it predicts deterministic
sequences that are computable in polynomial time; however, we also show that it
is not computable in polynomial time, and the question of its predictive
properties for stochastic sequences remains open.

 <dc:description>  We consider training-based channel estimation for a cloud radio access
network (CRAN), in which a large amount of remote radio heads (RRHs) and users
are randomly scattered over the service area. In this model, assigning
orthogonal training sequences to all users will incur a substantial overhead to
the overall network, and is even impossible when the number of users is large.
Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the notion of local orthogonality, under
which the training sequence of a user is orthogonal to those of the other users
in its neighborhood. We model the design of locally orthogonal training
sequences as a graph coloring problem. Then, based on the theory of random
geometric graph, we show that the minimum training length scales in the order
of $\ln K$, where $K$ is the number of users covered by a CRAN. This indicates
that the proposed training design yields a scalable solution to sustain the
need of large-scale cooperation in CRANs. Numerical results show that the
proposed scheme outperforms other reference schemes.

 <dc:title>Optimal Margin Distribution Machine</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Support vector machine (SVM) has been one of the most popular learning
algorithms, with the central idea of maximizing the minimum margin, i.e., the
smallest distance from the instances to the classification boundary. Recent
theoretical results, however, disclosed that maximizing the minimum margin does
not necessarily lead to better generalization performances, and instead, the
margin distribution has been proven to be more crucial. Based on this idea, we
propose a new method, named Optimal margin Distribution Machine (ODM), which
tries to achieve a better generalization performance by optimizing the margin
distribution. We characterize the margin distribution by the first- and
second-order statistics, i.e., the margin mean and variance. The proposed
method is a general learning approach which can be used in any place where SVM
can be applied, and their superiority is verified both theoretically and
empirically in this paper.

 <dc:description>  Recent work has shown good recognition results in 3D object recognition using
3D convolutional networks. In this paper, we show that the object orientation
plays an important role in 3D recognition. More specifically, we argue that
objects induce different features in the network under rotation. Thus, we
approach the category-level classification task as a multi-task problem, in
which the network is trained to predict the pose of the object in addition to
the class label as a parallel task. We show that this yields significant
improvements in the classification results. We test our suggested architecture
on several datasets representing various 3D data sources: LiDAR data, CAD
models, and RGB-D images. We report state-of-the-art results on classification
as well as significant improvements in precision and speed over the baseline on
3D detection.

 <dc:title>Vertex Coloring with Communication and Local Memory Constraints in
  Synchronous Broadcast Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The vertex coloring problem has received a lot of attention in the context of
synchronous round-based systems where, at each round, a process can send a
message to all its neighbors, and receive a message from each of them. Hence,
this communication model is particularly suited to point-to-point communication
channels. Several vertex coloring algorithms suited to these systems have been
proposed. They differ mainly in the number of rounds they require and the
number of colors they use. This paper considers a broadcast/receive
communication model in which message collisions and message conflicts can occur
(a collision occurs when, during the same round, messages are sent to the same
process by too many neighbors; a conflict occurs when a process and one of its
neighbors broadcast during the same round). This communication model is suited
to systems where processes share communication bandwidths. More precisely,the
paper considers the case where, during a round, a process may either broadcast
a message to its neighbors or receive a message from at most $m$ of them. This
captures communication-related constraints or a local memory constraint stating
that, whatever the number of neighbors of a process, its local memory allows it
to receive and store at most $m$ messages during each round. The paper defines
first the corresponding generic vertex multi-coloring problem (a vertex can
have several colors). It focuses then on tree networks, for which it presents a
lower bound on the number of colors $K$ that are necessary (namely,
$K=\lceil\frac{\Delta}{m}\rceil+1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximal degree of the
communication graph), and an ssociated coloring algorithm, which is optimal
with respect to $K$.

 <dc:title>Performance Evaluation of LOS MIMO Systems under the Influence of Phase

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To deal with the ever increasing data rate demand in wireless systems,
suitable backhaul solutions have to be found. One option is to use LOS MIMO
systems at mmWave frequencies, as high bandwidths and spectral efficiencies
will be able to fulfill this requirement. Several investigations have shown,
that phase noise can decimate the efficiency of such systems immensely and
needs to be adequately dealt with. In this work we investigate the system level
performance of LOS MIMO systems subject to this impairment and examine the
influence for various practical phase noise values. Furthermore, it is shown
how a simple phase noise compensation algorithm can be used to enhance the
performance of these systems in different scenarios.

 <dc:title>Straight Skeletons with Additive and Multiplicative Weights and Their
  Application to the Algorithmic Generation of Roofs and Terrains</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Held, Martin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Palfrader, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce additively-weighted straight skeletons as a new generalization
of straight skeletons. An additively-weighted straight skeleton is the result
of a wavefront-propagation process where, unlike in previous variants of
straight skeletons, wavefront edges do not necessarily start to move at the
begin of the propagation process but at later points in time. We analyze the
properties of additively-weighted straight skeletons and show how to compute
straight skeletons with both additive and multiplicative weights.
  We then show how to use additively-weighted and multiplicatively-weighted
straight skeletons to generate roofs and terrains for polygonal shapes such as
the footprints of buildings or river networks. As a result, we get an automated
generation of roofs and terrains where the individual facets have different
inclinations and may start at different heights.

 <dc:title>A Convex Surrogate Operator for General Non-Modular Loss Functions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Empirical risk minimization frequently employs convex surrogates to
underlying discrete loss functions in order to achieve computational
tractability during optimization. However, classical convex surrogates can only
tightly bound modular loss functions, sub-modular functions or supermodular
functions separately while maintaining polynomial time computation. In this
work, a novel generic convex surrogate for general non-modular loss functions
is introduced, which provides for the first time a tractable solution for loss
functions that are neither super-modular nor submodular. This convex surro-gate
is based on a submodular-supermodular decomposition for which the existence and
uniqueness is proven in this paper. It takes the sum of two convex surrogates
that separately bound the supermodular component and the submodular component
using slack-rescaling and the Lov{\'a}sz hinge, respectively. It is further
proven that this surrogate is convex , piecewise linear, an extension of the
loss function, and for which subgradient computation is polynomial time.
Empirical results are reported on a non-submodular loss based on the
S{{\o}}rensen-Dice difference function, and a real-world face track dataset
with tens of thousands of frames, demonstrating the improved performance,
efficiency, and scalabil-ity of the novel convex surrogate.

 <dc:title>Synchronization of linearly coupled reaction-diffusion neural networks

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the complete synchronization problem of linearly coupled
neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms and time-varying delays via
aperiodically intermittent pinning control is investigated. The coupling matrix
for the network can be asymmetric. Compared with state coupling in the
synchronization literature, we design a novel distributed coupling protocol by
using the reaction-diffusion coupling-spatial coupling, which can accelerate
the synchronization process. This can be regarded as the main difference
between this paper and previous works. Using the Lyapunov function and theories
in the aperiodically intermittent control, we present some criteria for the
complete synchronization with a static coupling strength. In this case, there
is no constraint on the bound of time-varying delays, so it can be larger than
the length of control span. On the other hand, for the network with an adaptive
coupling strength, we propose a simple adaptive rule for the coupling strength
and prove its effectiveness rigorously. In this case, the bound of time-varying
delay is required to be less than the infimum of the control time span.
Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical results.

encoder-decoder framework has been recently applied for the generation of video
and image descriptions. The combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural
Networks in these models has proven to outperform the previous state of the
art, obtaining more accurate video descriptions. In this work we propose
pushing further this model by introducing two contributions into the encoding
stage. First, producing richer image representations by combining object and
location information from Convolutional Neural Networks and second, introducing
Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks for capturing both forward and backward
temporal relationships in the input frames.

 <dc:description>  Speech recognition in adverse real-world environments is highly affected by
reverberation and nonstationary background noise. A well-known strategy to
reduce such undesired signal components in multi-microphone scenarios is
spatial filtering of the microphone signals. In this article, we demonstrate
that an additional coherence-based postfilter, which is applied to the
beamformer output signal to remove diffuse interference components from the
latter, is an effective means to further improve the recognition accuracy of
modern deep learning speech recognition systems. To this end, the recently
updated 3rd CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge (CHiME-3)
baseline speech recognition system is extended by a coherence-based postfilter
and the postfilter's impact on the word error rates is investigated for the
noisy environments provided by CHiME-3. To determine the time- and
frequency-dependent postfilter gains, we use a Direction-of-Arrival
(DOA)-dependent and a DOA-independent estimator of the coherent-to-diffuse
power ratio as an approximation of the short-time signal-to-noise ratio. Our
experiments show that incorporating coherence-based postfiltering into the
CHiME-3 baseline speech recognition system leads to a significant reduction of
the word error rate scores for the noisy and reverberant environments provided
as part of CHiME-3.

 <dc:title>Avoiding the Flip Ambiguities in 2D Wireless Sensor Localization by
  Using Unit Disk Graph Property</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cagirici, Onur</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a range-based localization algorithm to localize a
wireless sensor network (WSN) in 2D. A widely used algorithm to localize a WSN
in 2D is trilateration, which runs in polynomial time. Trilateration uses three
distance measurements to localize a node. In some cases, the lack of
connectivity leads to a low percentage of localized nodes since a node's
position can be fixed using three distance measurements. We propose an
algorithm that finds the position of a node by using the absence of a distance
measurement in addition to a third distance measurement. If two nodes are not
able to sense each other, that means the distance between them is more than the
sensing range. Therefore, our algorithm checks if the possible positions of an
unlocalized node $u$ is inside the sensing range of a localized node $\ell$
that is not the neighbor of $u$. In such case, we eliminate one of the possible
positions.

 <dc:description>  GPUs are popular devices for accelerating scientific calculations. However,
as GPU code is usually written in low-level languages, it breaks the
abstractions of high-level languages popular with scientific programmers. To
overcome this, we present a framework for CUDA GPU programming in the
high-level Julia programming language. This framework compiles Julia source
code for GPU execution, and takes care of the necessary low-level interactions
using modern code generation techniques to avoid run-time overhead.
  Evaluating the framework and its APIs on a case study comprising the trace
transform from the field of image processing, we find that the impact on
performance is minimal, while greatly increasing programmer productivity. The
metaprogramming capabilities of the Julia language proved invaluable for
enabling this. Our framework significantly improves usability of GPUs, making
them accessible for a wide range of programmers. It is available as free and
open-source software licensed under the MIT License.

 <dc:description>  We propose a formalism to model database-driven systems, called database
manipulating systems (DMS). The actions of a DMS modify the current instance of
a relational database by adding new elements into the database, deleting tuples
from the relations and adding tuples to the relations. The elements which are
modified by an action are chosen by (full) first-order queries. DMS is a highly
expressive model and can be thought of as a succinct representation of an
infinite state relational transition system, in line with similar models
proposed in the literature. We propose monadic second order logic (MSO-FO) to
reason about sequences of database instances appearing along a run.
Unsurprisingly, the linear-time model checking problem of DMS against MSO-FO is
undecidable. Towards decidability, we propose under-approximate model checking
of DMS, where the under-approximation parameter is the &quot;bound on recency&quot;. In a
$k$-recency-bounded run, only the most recent $k$ elements in the current
active domain may be modified by an action. More runs can be verified by
increasing the bound on recency. Our main result shows that recency-bounded
model checking of DMS against MSO-FO is decidable, by a reduction to the
satisfiability problem of MSO over nested words.

 <dc:description>  In a multivariable servomechanism design, it is required that the output
vector tracks a certain reference vector while satisfying some desired
transient specifications, for this purpose a 2DOF control law consisting of
state feedback gain and feedforward scaling gain is proposed. The control law
is designed using block pole placement technique by assigning a set of desired
Block poles in different canonical forms. The resulting control is simulated
for linearized model of the HAVE DASH II BTT missile, numerical results are
analyzed and compared in terms of transient response, gain magnitude,
performance robustness, stability robustness and tracking. The suitable
structure for this case study is then selected.

 <dc:title>Embedding AC Power Flow in the Complex Plane Part I: Modelling and
  Mathematical Foundation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Baghsorkhi, Sina Sadeghi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Suetin, Sergey Pavlovich</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Part I of this paper embeds the AC power flow problem with voltage control
and exponential load model in the complex plane. Modeling the action of network
controllers that regulate the magnitude of voltage phasors is a challenging
task in the complex plane as it has to preserve the framework of holomorphicity
for obtention of these complex variables with fixed magnitude. The paper
presents two distinct approaches to modelling the voltage control of generator
nodes. Exponential (or voltage-dependent) load models are crucial for accurate
power flow studies under stressed conditions. This new framework for power flow
studies exploits the theory of analytic continuation, especially the monodromy
theorem for resolving issues that have plagued conventional numerical methods
for decades. Here the focus is on the indispensable role of Pade approximants
for analytic continuation of complex functions, expressed as power series,
beyond the boundary of convergence of the series. The zero-pole distribution of
these rational approximants serves as a proximity index to voltage collapse.
Finally the mathematical underpinnings of this framework, namely the Stahl's
theory and the rate of convergence of Pade approximants are explained.

 <dc:description>  Heavy sweep distortion induced by alignments and inter-reflections of layers
of a sample is a major burden in recovering 2D and 3D information in time
resolved spectral imaging. This problem cannot be addressed by conventional
denoising and signal processing techniques as it heavily depends on the physics
of the acquisition. Here we propose and implement an algorithmic framework
based on low-rank matrix recovery and alternating minimization that exploits
the forward model for THz acquisition. The method allows recovering the
original signal in spite of the presence of temporal-spatial distortions. We
address a blind-demodulation problem, where based on several observations of
the sample texture modulated by an undesired sweep pattern, the two classes of
signals are separated. The performance of the method is examined in both
synthetic and experimental data, and the successful reconstructions are
demonstrated. The proposed general scheme can be implemented to advance
inspection and imaging applications in THz and other time-resolved sensing
modalities.

 <dc:description>  We study the relationship between the sentiment levels of Twitter users and
the evolving network structure that the users created by @-mentioning each
other. We use a large dataset of tweets to which we apply three sentiment
scoring algorithms, including the open source SentiStrength program.
Specifically we make three contributions. Firstly we find that people who have
potentially the largest communication reach (according to a dynamic centrality
measure) use sentiment differently than the average user: for example they use
positive sentiment more often and negative sentiment less often. Secondly we
find that when we follow structurally stable Twitter communities over a period
of months, their sentiment levels are also stable, and sudden changes in
community sentiment from one day to the next can in most cases be traced to
external events affecting the community. Thirdly, based on our findings, we
create and calibrate a simple agent-based model that is capable of reproducing
measures of emotive response comparable to those obtained from our empirical
dataset.

 <dc:title>Fundamental Limits of Simultaneous Energy and Information Transmission</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, existing results regarding the fundamental limits of
simultaneous energy and information transmission in wireless networks are
reviewed. In point-to-point channels, the fundamental limits on the information
rate given a minimum energy rate constraint are fully characterized by the
notion of information-energy capacity function introduced by Varshney in 2008.
In a centralized multi-user channel, the fundamental limits on the information
rates given a minimum energy rate constraint are described by the notion of
information-energy capacity region introduced by Fouladgar and Simeone in 2012.
Alternatively, in a decentralized multi-user channel, the authors have recently
introduced the notion of information-energy Nash region to describe these
fundamental limits. All these fundamental limits reveal the intrinsic trade-off
between the two conflicting tasks of information and energy transmission.

underwater RF wireless sensor networks, including propagation impairments
(e.g., noise, interference), radio hardware (e.g., modulation scheme,
bandwidth, transmit power), hardware limitations (e.g., clock drift,

 <dc:description>  Effective and accurate diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), as well as its
early stage Impaired Glucose Regulation (IGR), has attracted much attention
recently. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [3], [5] etc. has proved that
tongue, face and sublingual diagnosis as a noninvasive method is a reasonable
way for disease detection. However, most previous works only focus on a single
modality (tongue, face or sublingual) for diagnosis, although different
modalities may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of DM and
IGR. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal classification method to
discriminate between DM (or IGR) and healthy controls. Specially, the tongue,
facial and sublingual images are first collected by using a non-invasive
capture device. The color, texture and geometry features of these three types
of images are then extracted, respectively. Finally, our so-called multi-modal
similar and specific learning (MMSSL) approach is proposed to combine features
of tongue, face and sublingual, which not only exploits the correlation but
also extracts individual components among them. Experimental results on a
dataset consisting of 192 Healthy, 198 DM and 114 IGR samples (all samples were
obtained from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine)
substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method for the
diagnosis of DM and IGR, compared to the case of using a single modality.

 <dc:description>  Interest in computer science is growing. As a result, computer science (CS)
and related departments are experiencing an explosive increase in undergraduate
enrollments and unprecedented demand from other disciplines for learning
computing. According to the 2014 CRA Taulbee Survey, the number of
undergraduates declaring a computing major at Ph.D. granting departments in the
US has increased 60% from 2011-2014 and the number of degrees granted has
increased by 34% from 2008-2013. However, this growth is not limited to higher
education. New York City, San Francisco and Oakland public schools will soon be
offering computer science to all students at all schools from preschool to 12th
grade, although it will be an elective for high school students. This
unprecedented demand means that CS departments are likely to teach not only
more students in the coming decades, but more diverse students, with more
varied backgrounds, motivations, preparations, and abilities.
  This growth is an unparalleled opportunity to expand the reach of computing
education. However, this growth is also a unique research challenge, as we know
very little about how best to teach our current students, let alone the
students soon to arrive. The burgeoning field of Computing Education Research
(CER) is positioned to address this challenge by answering research questions
such as, how should we teach computer science, from programming to advanced
principles, to a broader and more diverse audience? We argue that computer
science departments should lead the way in establishing CER as a foundational
research area of computer science, discovering the best ways to teach CS, and
inventing the best technologies with which to teach it. This white paper
provides a snapshot of the current state of CER and makes actionable
recommendations for academic leaders to grow CER as a successful research area
in their departments.

 <dc:description>  The method described here performs blind deconvolution of the beamforming
output in the frequency domain. To provide accurate blind deconvolution,
sparsity priors are introduced with a smooth \ell_1/\ell_2 regularization term.
As the mean of the noise in the power spectrum domain is dependent on its
variance in the time domain, the proposed method includes a variance estimation
step, which allows more robust blind deconvolution. Validation of the method on
both simulated and real data, and of its performance, are compared with two
well-known methods from the literature: the deconvolution approach for the
mapping of acoustic sources, and sound density modeling.

 <dc:description>  Software as a service (SaaS) has recently enjoyed much attention as it makes
the use of software more convenient and cost-effective. At the same time, the
arising of users' expectation for high quality service such as real-time
information or functionality provisioning brings about new challenges: to
satisfy such (near) real-time requirements, real-time monitoring and effective
processing of streaming data is necessary. However, due to the composition
structure and multi-instance property of services, service data streams are
often distributed, hard to synchronize and aggregate. We tackles these
challenges by (1) proposing systematic associate strategies for relating
distributed data; (2) introducing a new small window array mechanism for
aggregating distributed data; (3) setting window parameters based on the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) method; and (4) modeling streaming
operators with queuing models for performance evaluation and prediction.
Experiments show that our approach has good accuracy, completeness and
acceptable performance measurement in processing distributed service data
streams.

 <dc:description>  Detection of non-overlapping and overlapping communities are essentially the
same problem. However, current algorithms focus either on finding overlapping
or non-overlapping communities. We present a generalized framework that can
identify both non-overlapping and overlapping communities, without any prior
input about the network or its community distribution. To do so, we introduce a
vertex-based metric, GenPerm, that quantifies by how much a vertex belongs to
each of its constituent communities. Our community detection algorithm is based
on maximizing the GenPerm over all the vertices in the network. We demonstrate,
through experiments over synthetic and real-world networks, that GenPerm is
more effective than other metrics in evaluating community structure. Further,
we show that due to its vertex-centric property, GenPerm can be used to unfold
several inferences beyond community detection, such as core-periphery analysis
and message spreading. Our algorithm for maximizing GenPerm outperforms six
state-of-the-art algorithms in accurately predicting the ground-truth labels.
Finally, we discuss the problem of resolution limit in overlapping communities
and demonstrate that maximizing GenPerm can mitigate this problem.

 <dc:description>  Many analyses of resource-allocation problems employ simplistic models of the
population. Using the example of a resource-allocation problem of Marecek et
al. [arXiv:1406.7639], we introduce rather a general behavioural model, where
the evolution of a heterogeneous population of agents is governed by a Markov
chain. Still, we are able to show that the distribution of agents across
resources converges in distribution, for suitable means of information
provision, under certain assumptions. The model and proof techniques may have
wider applicability.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an algorithm for 3-SAT problems. First, logical formulas
are transformed into elementary algebraic formulas. Second, complex
trigonometric functions are assigned to the variables in the elementary
algebraic formulas, and the sums of the formulas are calculated. The algorithm
outputs the number of satisfying assignments. The computational complexity of
the algorithm is probably polynomial.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address planning problems in high-dimensional hybrid
configuration spaces, with a particular focus on manipulation planning problems
involving many objects. We present the hybrid backward-forward (HBF) planning
algorithm that uses a backward identification of constraints to direct the
sampling of the infinite action space in a forward search from the initial
state towards a goal configuration. The resulting planner is probabilistically
complete and can effectively construct long manipulation plans requiring both
prehensile and nonprehensile actions in cluttered environments.

 <dc:description>  In the past decade, cloud computing has emerged from a pursuit for a
service-driven information and communication technology (ICT), into a
signifcant fraction of the ICT market. Responding to the growth of the market,
many alternative cloud services and their underlying systems are currently
vying for the attention of cloud users and providers. Thus, benchmarking them
is needed, to enable cloud users to make an informed choice, and to enable
system DevOps to tune, design, and evaluate their systems. This requires
focusing on old and new system properties, possibly leading to the re-design of
classic benchmarking metrics, such as expressing performance as throughput and
latency (response time), and the design of new, cloud-specififc metrics.
Addressing this requirement, in this work we focus on four system properties:
(i) elasticity of the cloud service, to accommodate large variations in the
amount of service requested, (ii) performance isolation between the tenants of
shared cloud systems, (iii) availability of cloud services and systems, and the
(iv) operational risk of running a production system in a cloud
environment.Focusing on key metrics, for each of these properties we review the
state-of-the-art, then select or propose new metrics together with measurement
approaches. We see the presented metrics as a foundation towards upcoming,
industry-standard, cloud benchmarks.
  Keywords: Cloud Computing; Metrics; Measurement; Benchmarking; Elasticity;
Isolation; Performance; Service Level Objective; Availability; Operational

 <dc:title>Optimal Assumptions for Synthesis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brenguier, Romain</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Controller synthesis is the process of constructing a correct system
automatically from its specification. This often requires assumptions about the
behaviour of the environment. It is difficult for the designer to identify the
assumptions that ensures the existence of a correct controller, and doing so
manually can lead to assumptions that are stronger than necessary. As a
consequence the generated controllers are suboptimal in terms of generality and
robustness. In this work, given a specification, we identify the weakest
assumptions that ensures the existence of a controller. We also consider two
important classes of assumptions: the ones that can be ensured by the
environment and assumptions that speaks only about inputs of the systems. We
show that optimal assumptions correspond to strongly winning strategies,
admissible strategies and remorsefree strategies respectively. Based on this
correspondence, we propose an algorithm for computing optimal assumptions that
can be ensured by the environment.

 <dc:title>Joint alignment of multiple protein-protein interaction networks via
  convex optimization</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantitative Biology - Molecular Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivation: High-throughput experimental techniques have been producing more
and more protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. PPI network alignment greatly
benefits the understanding of evolutionary relationship among species, helps
identify conserved sub-networks and provides extra information for functional
annotations. Although a few methods have been developed for multiple PPI
network alignment, the alignment quality is still far away from perfect and
thus, new network alignment methods are needed. Result: In this paper, we
present a novel method, denoted as ConvexAlign, for joint alignment of multiple
PPI networks by convex optimization of a scoring function composed of sequence
similarity, topological score and interaction conservation score. In contrast
to existing methods that generate multiple alignments in a greedy or
progressive manner, our convex method optimizes alignments globally and
enforces consistency among all pairwise alignments, resulting in much better
alignment quality. Tested on both synthetic and real data, our experimental
results show that ConvexAlign outperforms several popular methods in producing
functionally coherent alignments. ConvexAlign even has a larger advantage over
the others in aligning real PPI networks. ConvexAlign also finds a few
conserved complexes among 5 species which cannot be detected by the other
methods.

 <dc:description>  Visual multimedia have become an inseparable part of our digital social
lives, and they often capture moments tied with deep affections. Automated
visual sentiment analysis tools can provide a means of extracting the rich
feelings and latent dispositions embedded in these media. In this work, we
explore how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a now de facto computational
machine learning tool particularly in the area of Computer Vision, can be
specifically applied to the task of visual sentiment prediction. We accomplish
this through fine-tuning experiments using a state-of-the-art CNN and via
rigorous architecture analysis, we present several modifications that lead to
accuracy improvements over prior art on a dataset of images from a popular
social media platform. We additionally present visualizations of local patterns
that the network learned to associate with image sentiment for insight into how
visual positivity (or negativity) is perceived by the model.

 <dc:description>  Fisher vector has been widely used in many multimedia retrieval and visual
recognition applications with good performance. However, the computation
complexity prevents its usage in real-time video monitoring. In this work, we
proposed and implemented GPU-FV, a fast Fisher vector extraction method with
the help of modern GPUs. The challenge of implementing Fisher vector on GPUs
lies in the data dependency in feature extraction and expensive memory access
in Fisher vector computing. To handle these challenges, we carefully designed
GPU-FV in a way that utilizes the computing power of GPU as much as possible,
and applied optimizations such as loop tiling to boost the performance. GPU-FV
is about 12 times faster than the CPU version, and 50\% faster than a
non-optimized GPU implementation. For standard video input (320*240), GPU-FV
can process each frame within 34ms on a model GPU. Our experiments show that
GPU-FV obtains a similar recognition accuracy as traditional FV on VOC 2007 and
Caltech 256 image sets. We also applied GPU-FV for realtime video monitoring
tasks and found that GPU-FV outperforms a number of previous works. Especially,
when the number of training examples are small, GPU-FV outperforms the recent
popular deep CNN features borrowed from ImageNet. The code can be downloaded
from the following link https://bitbucket.org/mawenjing/gpu-fv.

 <dc:description>  We are interested in counting the number of instances of object classes in
natural, everyday images. Previous counting approaches tackle the problem in
restricted domains such as counting pedestrians in surveillance videos. Counts
can also be estimated from outputs of other vision tasks like object detection.
In this work, we build dedicated models for counting designed to tackle the
large variance in counts, appearances, and scales of objects found in natural
scenes. Our approach is inspired by the phenomenon of subitizing - the ability
of humans to make quick assessments of counts given a perceptual signal, for
small count values. Given a natural scene, we employ a divide and conquer
strategy while incorporating context across the scene to adapt the subitizing
idea to counting. Our approach offers consistent improvements over numerous
baseline approaches for counting on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and COCO datasets.
Subsequently, we study how counting can be used to improve object detection. We
then show a proof of concept application of our counting methods to the task of
Visual Question Answering, by studying the `how many?' questions in the VQA and
COCO-QA datasets.

 <dc:description>  One of missions for personalization systems and recommender systems is to
show content items according to users' personal interests. In order to achieve
such goal, these systems are learning user interests over time and trying to
present content items tailoring to user profiles. Recommending items according
to users' preferences has been investigated extensively in the past few years,
mainly thanks for the popularity of Netflix competition. In a real setting,
users may be attracted by a subset of those items and interact with them, only
leaving partial feedbacks to the system to learn in the next cycle, which leads
to significant biases into systems and hence results in a situation where user
engagement metrics cannot be improved over time. The problem is not just for
one component of the system. The data collected from users is usually used in
many different tasks, including learning ranking functions, building user
profiles and constructing content classifiers. Once the data is biased, all
these downstream use cases would be impacted as well. Therefore, it would be
beneficial to gather unbiased data through user interactions. Traditionally,
unbiased data collection is done through showing items uniformly sampling from
the content pool. However, this simple scheme is not feasible as it risks user
engagement metrics and it takes long time to gather user feedbacks. In this
paper, we introduce a user-friendly unbiased data collection framework, by
utilizing methods developed in the exploitation and exploration literature. We
discuss how the framework is different from normal multi-armed bandit problems
and why such method is needed. We layout a novel Thompson sampling for
Bernoulli ranked-list to effectively balance user experiences and data
collection. The proposed method is validated from a real bucket test and we
show strong results comparing to old algorithms

 <dc:description>  Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is considered a model system for signal
transduction, the mechanism by which cells exchange chemical messages. Our
previous work calculated the Shannon capacity of a single cAMP receptor;
however, a typical cell may have thousands of receptors operating in parallel.
In this paper, we calculate the capacity of a cAMP signal transduction system
with an arbitrary number of independent, indistinguishable receptors. By
leveraging prior results on feedback capacity for a single receptor, we show
(somewhat unexpectedly) that the capacity is achieved by an IID input
distribution, and that the capacity for n receptors is n times the capacity for
a single receptor.

 <dc:description>  Detecting and analyzing dense groups or communities from social and
information networks has attracted immense attention over last one decade due
to its enormous applicability in different domains. Community detection is an
ill-defined problem, as the nature of the communities is not known in advance.
The problem has turned out to be even complicated due to the fact that
communities emerge in the network in various forms - disjoint, overlapping,
hierarchical etc. Various heuristics have been proposed depending upon the
application in hand. All these heuristics have been materialized in the form of
new metrics, which in most cases are used as optimization functions for
detecting the community structure, or provide an indication of the goodness of
detected communities during evaluation. There arises a need for an organized
and detailed survey of the metrics proposed with respect to community detection
and evaluation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive and structured
overview of the start-of-the-art metrics used for the detection and the
evaluation of community structure. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and
real-world networks to present a comparative analysis of these metrics in
measuring the goodness of the underlying community structure.

 <dc:title>Full Flow: Optical Flow Estimation By Global Optimization over Regular

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a global optimization approach to optical flow estimation. The
approach optimizes a classical optical flow objective over the full space of
mappings between discrete grids. No descriptor matching is used. The highly
regular structure of the space of mappings enables optimizations that reduce
the computational complexity of the algorithm's inner loop from quadratic to
linear and support efficient matching of tens of thousands of nodes to tens of
thousands of displacements. We show that one-shot global optimization of a
classical Horn-Schunck-type objective over regular grids at a single resolution
is sufficient to initialize continuous interpolation and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on challenging modern benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the satisfiability problem for Horn fragments of the
Halpern-Shoham interval temporal logic depending on the type (box or diamond)
of the interval modal operators, the type of the underlying linear order
(discrete or dense), and the type of semantics for the interval relations
(reflexive or irreflexive). For example, we show that satisfiability of Horn
formulas with diamonds is undecidable for any type of linear orders and
semantics. On the contrary, satisfiability of Horn formulas with boxes is
tractable over both discrete and dense orders under the reflexive semantics and
over dense orders under the irreflexive semantics, but becomes undecidable over
discrete orders under the irreflexive semantics. Satisfiability of binary Horn
formulas with both boxes and diamonds is always undecidable under the
irreflexive semantics.

 <dc:description>  Object localization is an important task in computer vision but requires a
large amount of computational power due mainly to an exhaustive multiscale
search on the input image. In this paper, we describe a near real-time
multiscale search on a deep CNN feature map that does not use region proposals.
The proposed approach effectively exploits local semantic information preserved
in the feature map of the outermost convolutional layer. A multi-scale search
is performed on the feature map by processing all the sub-regions of different
sizes using separate expert units of fully connected layers. Each expert unit
receives as input local semantic features only from the corresponding
sub-regions of a specific geometric shape. Therefore, it contains more nearly
optimal parameters tailored to the corresponding shape. This multi-scale and
multi-aspect ratio scanning strategy can effectively localize a potential
object of an arbitrary size. The proposed approach is fast and able to localize
objects of interest with a frame rate of 4 fps while providing improved
detection performance over the state-of-the art on the PASCAL VOC 12 and MSCOCO
data sets.

 <dc:description>  A novel template matching algorithm that can incorporate the concept of
deformable parts, is presented in this paper. Unlike the deformable part model
(DPM) employed in object recognition, the proposed template-matching approach
called Deformable Template Matching (DTM) does not require a training step.
Instead, deformation is achieved by a set of predefined basic rules (e.g. the
left sub-patch cannot pass across the right patch). Experimental evaluation of
this new method using the PASCAL VOC 07 dataset demonstrated substantial
performance improvement over conventional template matching algorithms.
Additionally, to confirm the applicability of DTM, the concept is applied to
the generation of a rotation-invariant SIFT descriptor. Experimental evaluation
employing deformable matching of SIFT features shows an increased number of
matching features compared to a conventional SIFT matching.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we describe a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
that is deeper and wider than other existing deep networks for hyperspectral
image classification. Unlike current state-of-the-art approaches in CNN-based
hyperspectral image classification, the proposed network, called contextual
deep CNN, can optimally explore local contextual interactions by jointly
exploiting local spatio-spectral relationships of neighboring individual pixel
vectors. The joint exploitation of the spatio-spectral information is achieved
by a multi-scale convolutional filter bank used as an initial component of the
proposed CNN pipeline. The initial spatial and spectral feature maps obtained
from the multi-scale filter bank are then combined together to form a joint
spatio-spectral feature map. The joint feature map representing rich spectral
and spatial properties of the hyperspectral image is then fed through a fully
convolutional network that eventually predicts the corresponding label of each
pixel vector. The proposed approach is tested on three benchmark datasets: the
Indian Pines dataset, the Salinas dataset and the University of Pavia dataset.
Performance comparison shows enhanced classification performance of the
proposed approach over the current state-of-the-art on the three datasets.

 <dc:description>  We propose an online spatiotemporal articulation model estimation framework
that estimates both articulated structure as well as a temporal prediction
model solely using passive observations. The resulting model can predict future
mo- tions of an articulated object with high confidence because of the spatial
and temporal structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictive
model by incorporating it within a standard simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM) pipeline for mapping and robot localization in previously
unexplored dynamic environments. Our method is able to localize the robot and
map a dynamic scene by explaining the observed motion in the world. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both simulated and
real-world dynamic environments.

 <dc:description>  Multi-task learning in Convolutional Networks has displayed remarkable
success in the field of recognition. This success can be largely attributed to
learning shared representations from multiple supervisory tasks. However,
existing multi-task approaches rely on enumerating multiple network
architectures specific to the tasks at hand, that do not generalize. In this
paper, we propose a principled approach to learn shared representations in
ConvNets using multi-task learning. Specifically, we propose a new sharing
unit: &quot;cross-stitch&quot; unit. These units combine the activations from multiple
networks and can be trained end-to-end. A network with cross-stitch units can
learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific representations. Our
proposed method generalizes across multiple tasks and shows dramatically
improved performance over baseline methods for categories with few training
examples.

 <dc:description>  The field of object detection has made significant advances riding on the
wave of region-based ConvNets, but their training procedure still includes many
heuristics and hyperparameters that are costly to tune. We present a simple yet
surprisingly effective online hard example mining (OHEM) algorithm for training
region-based ConvNet detectors. Our motivation is the same as it has always
been -- detection datasets contain an overwhelming number of easy examples and
a small number of hard examples. Automatic selection of these hard examples can
make training more effective and efficient. OHEM is a simple and intuitive
algorithm that eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in common use.
But more importantly, it yields consistent and significant boosts in detection
performance on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. Its effectiveness
increases as datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the
results on the MS COCO dataset. Moreover, combined with complementary advances
in the field, OHEM leads to state-of-the-art results of 78.9% and 76.3% mAP on
PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 respectively.

 <dc:description>  We consider a two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access
wiretap channel with $N$ antennas at each transmitter, $N$ antennas at the
legitimate receiver, and $K$ antennas at the eavesdropper. We determine the
optimal sum secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) for this model for all values
of $N$ and $K$. We subdivide our problem into several regimes based on the
values of $N$ and $K$, and provide achievable schemes based on real and vector
space alignment techniques for fixed and fading channel gains, respectively. To
prove the optimality of the achievable schemes, we provide matching converses
for each regime. Our results show how the number of eavesdropper antennas
affects the optimal sum s.d.o.f. of the multiple access wiretap channel.

 <dc:description>  A central concern of network operators is to estimate the probability of an
incident that affects a significant part and thus may yield to a breakdown. We
answer this question by modeling how a failure of either a node or an edge will
affect the rest of the network using percolation theory. Our model is general
in the sense that it only needs two inputs: the topology of the network and the
chances of failure of its components. These chances may vary to represent
different types of edges having different tendencies to fail. We illustrate the
approach by an example, for which we can even obtain closed form expressions
for the likelihood of an outbreak remaining bounded or spreading unlimitedly.

 <dc:description>  Today, ensuring and improving safety, productivity, quality, and
sustainability in construction, operation, and maintenance of national civil
infrastructure systems through advances in robotics and automation is a
national imperative. By &quot;national civil infrastructure&quot; we refer to the 4.5M
commercial buildings, 3.9M miles of public roads, 2M miles of oil and natural
gas pipelines, 600K bridges, 190K cell phone towers, 120K miles of major
railroads, 100K miles of levees, 84K dams, 50K miles of electrical power lines,
25K miles of commercially navigable waterways, and 5K public-use airports in
the United States, all of which are critical to our national economy and
society. By &quot;ensuring and improving safety, productivity, quality, and
sustainability&quot; we mean to guarantee performance across the entire life cycle
of civil infrastructure, from construction to operation and from maintenance to
disposal. By &quot;advances in robotics and automation&quot; we mean innovative research
and education that will provide tools for systematic and timely execution of
construction, and also collection, analysis, visualization, and operational use
of big data in built environments for project monitoring and control purposes.
In the following, we discuss the current state of construction and operation of
the national civil infrastructure systems in detail and present several
opportunities for improvements through research and education on robotics and
automation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
software framework that incorporates tiling, a well-known loop transformation.
Because the multiscale, multiphysics codes built in BoxLib are designed to
solve complex systems at high resolution, performance on current and next
generation architectures is essential. With the expectation of many more cores
per node on next generation architectures, the ability to effectively utilize
threads within a node is essential, and the current model for parallelization
will not be sufficient. We describe a new version of BoxLib in which the tiling
constructs are embedded so that BoxLib-based applications can easily realize
expected performance gains without extra effort on the part of the application
developer. We also discuss a path forward to enable future versions of BoxLib
to take advantage of NUMA-aware optimizations using the TiDA portable library.

 <dc:title>Robust Decentralized Voltage Control of DC-DC Converters with
  Applications to Power Sharing and Ripple Sharing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of output voltage regulation for multiple
DC-DC converters connected to a grid, and prescribes a robust scheme for
sharing power among different sources. Also it develops a method for sharing
120 Hz ripple among DC power sources in a prescribed proportion, which
accommodates the different capabilities of DC power sources to sustain the
ripple. We present a decentralized control architecture, where a nested
(inner-outer) control design is used at every converter. An interesting aspect
of the proposed design is that the analysis and design of the entire
multi-converter system can be done using an equivalent single converter system,
where the multi-converter system inherits the performance and robustness
achieved by a design for the single-converter system. Another key aspect of
this work is that the voltage regulation problem is addressed as a
disturbance-rejection problem, where {\em unknown} load current is viewed as an
external signal, and thus, no prior information is required on the nominal
loading conditions. The control design is obtained using robust optimal-control
framework. Case studies presented show the enhanced performance of prescribed
optimal controllers.

 <dc:description>  Data visualization is by far the most commonly used mechanism to explore
data, especially by novice data analysts and data scientists. And yet, current
visual analytics tools are rather limited in their ability to guide data
scientists to interesting or desired visualizations: the process of visual data
exploration remains cumbersome and time-consuming. We propose zenvisage, a
platform for effortlessly visualizing interesting patterns, trends, or insights
from large datasets. We describe zenvisage's general purpose visual query
language, ZQL (&quot;zee-quel&quot;) for specifying the desired visual trend, pattern, or
insight - ZQL draws from use-cases in a variety of domains, including biology,
mechanical engineering, climate science, and commerce. We formalize the
expressiveness of ZQL via a visual exploration algebra, and demonstrate that
ZQL is at least as expressive as that algebra. While analysts are free to use
ZQL directly, we also expose ZQL via a visual specification interface that we
describe in this paper. We then describe our architecture and optimizations,
preliminary experiments in supporting and optimizing for ZQL queries in our
initial zenvisage prototype, and a user study to evaluate whether data
scientists are able to effectively use zenvisage for real applications.

 <dc:description>  We provide the first theoretical analysis on the convergence rate of the
asynchronous stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) descent algorithm on
non-convex optimization. Recent studies have shown that the asynchronous
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based algorithms with variance reduction
converge with a linear convergent rate on convex problems. However, there is no
work to analyze asynchronous SGD with variance reduction technique on
non-convex problem. In this paper, we study two asynchronous parallel
implementations of SVRG: one is on a distributed memory system and the other is
on a shared memory system. We provide the theoretical analysis that both
algorithms can obtain a convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, and linear speed up is
achievable if the number of workers is upper bounded. V1,v2,v3 have been

 <dc:description>  The string graph for a collection of next-generation reads is a lossless data
representation that is fundamental for de novo assemblers based on the
overlap-layout-consensus paradigm. In this paper, we explore a novel approach
to compute the string graph, based on the FM-index and Burrows-Wheeler
Transform. We describe a simple algorithm that uses only the FM-index
representation of the collection of reads to construct the string graph,
without accessing the input reads. Our algorithm has been integrated into the
SGA assembler as a standalone module to construct the string graph.
  The new integrated assembler has been assessed on a standard benchmark,
showing that FSG is significantly faster than SGA while maintaining a moderate
use of main memory, and showing practical advantages in running FSG on multiple
threads.

 <dc:title>Community Detection with Node Attributes and its Generalization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Community detection algorithms are fundamental tools to understand
organizational principles in social networks. With the increasing power of
social media platforms, when detecting communities there are two possi- ble
sources of information one can use: the structure of social network and node
attributes. However structure of social networks and node attributes are often
interpreted separately in the research of community detection. When these two
sources are interpreted simultaneously, one common as- sumption shared by
previous studies is that nodes attributes are correlated with communities. In
this paper, we present a model that is capable of combining topology
information and nodes attributes information with- out assuming correlation.
This new model can recover communities with higher accuracy even when node
attributes and communities are uncorre- lated. We derive the detectability
threshold for this model and use Belief Propagation (BP) to make inference.
This algorithm is optimal in the sense that it can recover community all the
way down to the threshold. This new model is also with the potential to handle
edge content and dynamic settings.

 <dc:description>  How best to evaluate a saliency model's ability to predict where humans look
in images is an open research question. The choice of evaluation metric depends
on how saliency is defined and how the ground truth is represented. Metrics
differ in how they rank saliency models, and this results from how false
positives and false negatives are treated, whether viewing biases are accounted
for, whether spatial deviations are factored in, and how the saliency maps are
pre-processed. In this paper, we provide an analysis of 8 different evaluation
metrics and their properties. With the help of systematic experiments and
visualizations of metric computations, we add interpretability to saliency
scores and more transparency to the evaluation of saliency models. Building off
the differences in metric properties and behaviors, we make recommendations for
metric selections under specific assumptions and for specific applications.

 <dc:description>  Data processing systems roughly group into families such as relational,
array, graph, and key-value. Many data processing tasks exceed the capabilities
of any one family, require data stored across families, or run faster when
partitioned onto multiple families. Discovering ways to execute computation
among multiple available systems, let alone discovering an optimal execution
plan, is challenging given semantic differences between disparate families of
systems. In this paper we introduce a new algebra, Lara, which underlies and
unifies algebras representing the families above in order to facilitate
translation between systems. We describe the operations and objects of
Lara---union, join, and ext on associative tables---and show her properties and
equivalences to other algebras. Multi-system optimization has a bright future,
in which we proffer Lara for the role of universal connector.

networks. We first characterize the underwater channel for radio communications
and adjust a linear model with measurements of real transmissions. We propose
an algorithm where the sensor nodes collaboratively estimate their unknown
positions in the network. In this setting, we assume low connectivity of the
nodes, low data rates, and nonzero probability of lost packets in the
transmission. Finally, we consider the problem of a node estimating it's
position in underwater navigation. We also provide simulations illustrating the
previous proposals.

its efficiency with respect to social objective and which networks are stable.
Many work have already been there in this area. Players in network formation
game will incur some cost to form a link. In previous work, all player will
have same cost for forming a link int he network. Here we will the study the
optimal network and Nash equilibrium network when each player have different

Polar codes were introduced by Ar{\i}kan in 2008. In this letter, we show that
the binary polar codes are the same as the optimized codes for bitwise
multistage decoding (OCBM), which have been discovered before by Stolte in
2002. The equivalence between the techniques used for the constructions and
decodings of both codes is established.

 <dc:description>  Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field with $q$ elements and denote by $\theta
: \mathbb{F}_q\to\mathbb{F}_q$ an automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_q$. In this note,
we deal with skew constacyclic codes, i.e. linear codes of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$
which are invariant under the action of a semi-linear map
$T:\mathbb{F}_q^n\to\mathbb{F}_q^n$, defined by $T(a_0,...,a_{n-2},
a_{n-1}):=(\alpha a_{n-1},a_0,...,a_{n-2})$ for some
$\alpha\in\mathbb{F}_q-\{0\}$ and $n\geq 2$. In particular, we study some
algebraic and geometric properties of their dual codes and we give some Magma
Programs as applications of the main theoretical results.

However, little attention has been paid to the perception of privacy from the
perspective of technology users in the Middle East. In this paper, we delve
into interpretations of privacy from the approach of Arab Gulf citizens. We
consider how privacy is practiced and understood in technology-mediated
environments among this population, paying particular attention to the role of
Islam and cultural traditions in constructing norms around privacy. We then
offer culturally sensitive design principles and suggestions for future
research that incorporates previously unexplored characteristics of privacy,
which play a role in how users navigate social media.

 <dc:description>  Social botnets have become an important phenomenon on social media. There are
many ways in which social bots can disrupt or influence online discourse, such
as, spam hashtags, scam twitter users, and astroturfing. In this paper we
considered one specific social botnet in Twitter to understand how it grows
over time, how the content of tweets by the social botnet differ from regular
users in the same dataset, and lastly, how the social botnet may have
influenced the relevant discussions. Our analysis is based on a qualitative
coding for approximately 3000 tweets in Arabic and English from the Syrian
social bot that was active for 35 weeks on Twitter before it was shutdown. We
find that the growth, behavior and content of this particular botnet did not
specifically align with common conceptions of botnets. Further we identify
interesting aspects of the botnet that distinguish it from regular users.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a recurrent framework for Joint Unsupervised
LEarning (JULE) of deep representations and image clusters. In our framework,
successive operations in a clustering algorithm are expressed as steps in a
recurrent process, stacked on top of representations output by a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). During training, image clusters and representations are
updated jointly: image clustering is conducted in the forward pass, while
representation learning in the backward pass. Our key idea behind this
framework is that good representations are beneficial to image clustering and
clustering results provide supervisory signals to representation learning. By
integrating two processes into a single model with a unified weighted triplet
loss and optimizing it end-to-end, we can obtain not only more powerful
representations, but also more precise image clusters. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on image clustering
across a variety of image datasets. Moreover, the learned representations
generalize well when transferred to other tasks.

 <dc:description>  Methods for resolving the 3D microstructure of the brain typically start by
thinly slicing and staining the brain, and then imaging each individual section
with visible light photons or electrons. In contrast, X-rays can be used to
image thick samples, providing a rapid approach for producing large 3D brain
maps without sectioning. Here we demonstrate the use of synchrotron X-ray
microtomography ($\mu$CT) for producing mesoscale $(1~\mu m^3)$ resolution
brain maps from millimeter-scale volumes of mouse brain. We introduce a
pipeline for $\mu$CT-based brain mapping that combines methods for sample
preparation, imaging, automated segmentation of image volumes into cells and
blood vessels, and statistical analysis of the resulting brain structures. Our
results demonstrate that X-ray tomography promises rapid quantification of
large brain volumes, complementing other brain mapping and connectomics
efforts.

 <dc:description>  Peer review, evaluation, and selection is a fundamental aspect of modern
science. Funding bodies the world over employ experts to review and select the
best proposals of those submitted for funding. The problem of peer selection,
however, is much more general: a professional society may want to give a subset
of its members awards based on the opinions of all members; an instructor for a
MOOC or online course may want to crowdsource grading; or a marketing company
may select ideas from group brainstorming sessions based on peer evaluation. We
make three fundamental contributions to the study of procedures or mechanisms
for peer selection, a specific type of group decision-making problem, studied
in computer science, economics, and political science. First, we propose a
novel mechanism that is strategyproof, i.e., agents cannot benefit by reporting
insincere valuations. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism
by a comprehensive simulation-based comparison with a suite of mechanisms found
in the literature. Finally, our mechanism employs a randomized rounding
technique that is of independent interest, as it solves the apportionment
problem that arises in various settings where discrete resources such as
parliamentary representation slots need to be divided proportionally.

 <dc:description>  In this research, we proposes a new method for cooperation and underlay mode
selection in cognitive radio networks. We characterize the maximum achievable
throughput of our proposed method of hybrid spectrum sharing. Hybrid spectrum
sharing is assumed where the Secondary User (SU) can access the Primary User
(PU) channel in two modes, underlay mode or cooperative mode with admission
control. In addition to access the channel in the overlay mode, secondary user
is allowed to occupy the channel currently occupied by the primary user but
with small transmission power. Adding the underlay access modes attains more
opportunities to the secondary user to transmit data. It is proposed that the
secondary user can only exploits the underlay access when the channel of the
primary user direct link is good or predicted to be in non-outage state.
Therefore, the secondary user could switch between underlay spectrum sharing
and cooperation with the primary user. Hybrid access is regulated through
monitoring the state of the primary link. By observing the simulation results,
the proposed model attains noticeable improvement in the system performance in
terms of maximum secondary user throughput than the conventional cooperation
and non-cooperation schemes.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach to online multi-target tracking based on
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Tracking multiple objects in real-world
scenes involves many challenges, including a) an a-priori unknown and
time-varying number of targets, b) a continuous state estimation of all present
targets, and c) a discrete combinatorial problem of data association. Most
previous methods involve complex models that require tedious tuning of
parameters. Here, we propose for the first time, an end-to-end learning
approach for online multi-target tracking. Existing deep learning methods are
not designed for the above challenges and cannot be trivially applied to the
task. Our solution addresses all of the above points in a principled way.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data show promising results obtained at
~300 Hz on a standard CPU, and pave the way towards future research in this
direction.

 <dc:description>  The Amazon Picking Challenge (APC), held alongside the International
Conference on Robotics and Automation in May 2015 in Seattle, challenged
roboticists from academia and industry to demonstrate fully automated solutions
to the problem of picking objects from shelves in a warehouse fulfillment
scenario. Packing density, object variability, speed, and reliability are the
main complexities of the task. The picking challenge serves both as a
motivation and an instrument to focus research efforts on a specific
manipulation problem. In this document, we describe Team MIT's approach to the
competition, including design considerations, contributions, and performance,
and we compile the lessons learned. We also describe what we think are the main
remaining challenges.

 <dc:description>  We discuss relations between Residual Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) and the primate visual cortex. We begin with the observation
that a shallow RNN is exactly equivalent to a very deep ResNet with weight
sharing among the layers. A direct implementation of such a RNN, although
having orders of magnitude fewer parameters, leads to a performance similar to
the corresponding ResNet. We propose 1) a generalization of both RNN and ResNet
architectures and 2) the conjecture that a class of moderately deep RNNs is a
biologically-plausible model of the ventral stream in visual cortex. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the architectures by testing them on the
CIFAR-10 dataset.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic languages such as Ruby, Python, and JavaScript have many compelling
benefits, but the lack of static types means subtle errors can remain latent in
code for a long time. While many researchers have developed various systems to
bring some of the benefits of static types to dynamic languages, prior
approaches have trouble dealing with metaprogramming, which generates code as
the program executes. In this paper, we propose Hummingbird, a new system that
uses a novel technique, just-in-time static type checking, to type check Ruby
code even in the presence of metaprogramming. In Hummingbird, method type
signatures are gathered dynamically at run-time, as those methods are created.
When a method is called, Hummingbird statically type checks the method body
against current type signatures. Thus, Hummingbird provides thorough static
checks on a per-method basis, while also allowing arbitrarily complex
metaprogramming. For performance, Hummingbird memoizes the static type checking
pass, invalidating cached checks only if necessary. We formalize Hummingbird
using a core, Ruby-like language and prove it sound. To evaluate Hummingbird,
we applied it to six apps, including three that use Ruby on Rails, a powerful
framework that relies heavily on metaprogramming. We found that all apps
typecheck successfully using Hummingbird, and that Hummingbird's performance
overhead is reasonable. We applied Hummingbird to earlier versions of one Rails
app and found several type errors that had been introduced and then fixed.
Lastly, we demonstrate using Hummingbird in Rails development mode to typecheck
an app as live updates are applied to it.

 <dc:description>  The development of theories and techniques for big data analytics offers
tremendous flexibility for investigating large-scale events and patterns that
emerge over space and time. In this research, we utilize a unique open-access
dataset &quot;The Global Data on Events, Location and Tone&quot; (GDELT) to model the
image of China in mass media, specifically, how China has related to the rest
of the world and how this connection has evolved upon time based on an
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The results of this
research contribute both in methodological and empirical perspectives: We
examined the effectiveness of time series models in predicting trends in
long-term mass media data. In addition, we identified various types of
connection strength patterns between China and its top 15 related countries.
This study generates valuable input to interpret China's diplomatic and
regional relations based on mass media data, as well as providing
methodological references for investigating international relations in other
countries and regions in the big data era.

 <dc:description>  As 3D movie viewing becomes mainstream and Virtual Reality (VR) market
emerges, the demand for 3D contents is growing rapidly. Producing 3D videos,
however, remains challenging. In this paper we propose to use deep neural
networks for automatically converting 2D videos and images to stereoscopic 3D
format. In contrast to previous automatic 2D-to-3D conversion algorithms, which
have separate stages and need ground truth depth map as supervision, our
approach is trained end-to-end directly on stereo pairs extracted from 3D
movies. This novel training scheme makes it possible to exploit orders of
magnitude more data and significantly increases performance. Indeed, Deep3D
outperforms baselines in both quantitative and human subject evaluations.

 <dc:description>  We describe a new data structure for dynamic nearest neighbor queries in the
plane with respect to a general family of distance functions that includes
$L_p$-norms and additively weighted Euclidean distances, and for general
(convex, pairwise disjoint) sites that have constant description complexity
(line segments, disks, etc.). Our data structure has a polylogarithmic update
and query time, improving an earlier data structure of Agarwal, Efrat and
Sharir that required $O(n^\varepsilon)$ time for an update and $O(\log n)$ time
for a query. Our data structure has numerous applications, and in all of them
it gives faster algorithms, typically reducing an $O(n^\varepsilon)$ factor in
the bounds to polylogarithmic. To further demonstrate its power, we give here
two new applications: an efficient construction of a spanner in a disk
intersection graph, and a data structure for efficient connectivity queries in
a dynamic disk graph.

 <dc:description>  We consider the well-studied cake cutting problem in which the goal is to
find an envy-free allocation based on queries from $n$ agents. The problem has
received attention in computer science, mathematics, and economics. It has been
a major open problem whether there exists a discrete and bounded envy-free
protocol. We resolve the problem by proposing a discrete and bounded envy-free
protocol for any number of agents. The maximum number of queries required by
the protocol is $n^{n^{n^{n^{n^n}}}}$. We additionally show that even if we do
not run our protocol to completion, it can find in at most $n^3{(n^2)}^n$
queries a partial allocation of the cake that achieves proportionality (each
agent gets at least $1/n$ of the value of the whole cake) and envy-freeness.
Finally we show that an envy-free partial allocation can be computed in at most
$n^3{(n^2)}^n$ queries such that each agent gets a connected piece that gives
the agent at least $1/(3n)$ of the value of the whole cake.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a cooperative diffusion-based molecular communication system
is considered where distributed receivers collaboratively determine a
transmitter's signal. In this system, the receivers first make local hard
decisions about the current transmitted bit and then report these decisions to
a fusion center (FC). The FC combines the local hard decisions to make a global
decision using an N-out-of-K fusion rule. Asymmetric and symmetric topologies
are considered and for each topology, two reporting scenarios, namely, perfect
reporting and noisy reporting, are addressed. Closed-form analytical
expressions for the expected global error probability are derived for all
considered topologies and scenarios. Numerical and simulation results show that
system reliability can be greatly improved by combining the detection
information of distributed receivers.

 <dc:title>Sublinear Time Estimation of Degree Distribution Moments: The Degeneracy

 <dc:creator>Eden, Talya</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We revisit the classic problem of estimating the degree distribution moments
of an undirected graph. Consider an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$
vertices, and define (for $s &gt; 0$) $\mu_s = \frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum_{v \in V}
d^s_v$. Our aim is to estimate $\mu_s$ within a multiplicative error of
$(1+\epsilon)$ (for a given approximation parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$) in sublinear
time. We consider the sparse graph model that allows access to: uniform random
vertices, queries for the degree of any vertex, and queries for a neighbor of
any vertex. For the case of $s=1$ (the average degree),
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ queries suffice for any constant $\epsilon$ (Feige,
SICOMP 06 and Goldreich-Ron, RSA 08). Gonen-Ron-Shavitt (SIDMA 11) extended
this result to all integral $s &gt; 0$, by designing an algorithms that performs
$\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/(s+1)})$ queries.
  We design a new, significantly simpler algorithm for this problem. In the
worst-case, it exactly matches the bounds of Gonen-Ron-Shavitt, and has a much
simpler proof. More importantly, the running time of this algorithm is
connected to the degeneracy of $G$. This is (essentially) the maximum density
of an induced subgraph. For the family of graphs with degeneracy at most
$\alpha$, it has a query complexity of
$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{1-1/s}}{\mu^{1/s}_s} \Big(\alpha^{1/s} +
\min\{\alpha,\mu^{1/s}_s\}\Big)\right) =
\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/s}\alpha/\mu^{1/s}_s)$. Thus, for the class of bounded
degeneracy graphs (which includes all minor closed families and preferential
attachment graphs), we can estimate the average degree in $\widetilde{O}(1)$
queries, and can estimate the variance of the degree distribution in
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ queries. This is a major improvement over the
previous worst-case bounds. Our key insight is in designing an estimator for
$\mu_s$ that has low variance when $G$ does not have large dense subgraphs.

 <dc:description>  Recent approaches in robotics follow the insight that perception is
facilitated by interaction with the environment. These approaches are subsumed
under the term of Interactive Perception (IP). It provides the following
benefits: (i) interaction with the environment creates a rich sensory signal
that would otherwise not be present and (ii) knowledge of the regularity in the
combined space of sensory data and action parameters facilitate the prediction
and interpretation of the signal. In this survey we postulate this as a
principle and collect evidence in support by analyzing and categorizing
existing work in this area. We also provide an overview of the most important
applications of Interactive Perception. We close this survey by discussing
remaining open questions. Thereby, we hope to define a field and inspire future
work.

 <dc:description>  We show that some natural output conventions for error-free computation in
chemical reaction networks (CRN) lead to a common level of computational
expressivity. Our main results are that the standard consensus-based output
convention have equivalent computational power to (1) existence-based and (2)
democracy-based output conventions. The CRNs using the former output convention
have only &quot;yes&quot; voters, with the interpretation that the CRN's output is yes if
any voters are present and no otherwise. The CRNs using the latter output
convention define output by majority vote among &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; voters.
  Both results are proven via a generalized framework that simultaneously
captures several definitions, directly inspired by a Petri net result of
Esparza, Ganty, Leroux, and Majumder [CONCUR 2015]. These results support the
thesis that the computational expressivity of error-free CRNs is intrinsic, not
sensitive to arbitrary definitional choices.

 <dc:description>  Datasets representing the world around us are becoming ever more unwieldy as
data volumes grow. This is largely due to increased measurement and modelling
resolution, but the problem is often exacerbated when data are stored at
spuriously high precisions. In an effort to facilitate analysis of these
datasets, computationally intensive calculations are increasingly being
performed on specialised remote servers before the reduced data are transferred
to the consumer. Due to bandwidth limitations, this often means data are
displayed as simple 2D data visualisations, such as scatter plots or images. We
present here a novel way to efficiently encode and transmit 4D data fields
on-demand so that they can be locally visualised and interrogated. This nascent
&quot;4D video&quot; format allows us to more flexibly move the boundary between data
server and consumer client. However, it has applications beyond purely
scientific visualisation, in the transmission of data to virtual and augmented
reality.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a tutorial on stochastic geometry (SG) based analysis for
cellular networks. This tutorial is distinguished by its depth with respect to
wireless communication details and its focus on cellular networks. The paper
starts by modeling and analyzing the baseband interference in a basic cellular
network model. Then, it characterizes signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
(SINR) and its related performance metrics. In particular, a unified approach
to conduct error probability, outage probability, and rate analysis is
presented. Although the main focus of the paper is on cellular networks, the
presented unified approach applies for other types of wireless networks that
impose interference protection around receivers. The paper then extends the
baseline unified approach to capture cellular network characteristics (e.g.,
frequency reuse, multiple antenna, power control, etc.). It also presents
numerical examples associated with demonstrations and discussions. Finally, we
point out future research directions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an approach for robot learning of social affordance
from human activity videos. We consider the problem in the context of
human-robot interaction: Our approach learns structural representations of
human-human (and human-object-human) interactions, describing how body-parts of
each agent move with respect to each other and what spatial relations they
should maintain to complete each sub-event (i.e., sub-goal). This enables the
robot to infer its own movement in reaction to the human body motion, allowing
it to naturally replicate such interactions.
  We introduce the representation of social affordance and propose a generative
model for its weakly supervised learning from human demonstration videos. Our
approach discovers critical steps (i.e., latent sub-events) in an interaction
and the typical motion associated with them, learning what body-parts should be
involved and how. The experimental results demonstrate that our Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) based learning algorithm automatically discovers
semantically meaningful interactive affordance from RGB-D videos, which allows
us to generate appropriate full body motion for an agent.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a spatially common sparsity based adaptive channel
estimation and feedback scheme for frequency division duplex based massive
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, which adapts training overhead and
pilot design to reliably estimate and feed back the downlink channel state
information (CSI) with significantly reduced overhead. Specifically, a
non-orthogonal downlink pilot design is first proposed, which is very different
from standard orthogonal pilots. By exploiting the spatially common sparsity of
massive MIMO channels, a compressive sensing (CS) based adaptive CSI
acquisition scheme is proposed, where the consumed time slot overhead only
adaptively depends on the sparsity level of the channels. Additionally, a
distributed sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm is proposed to jointly
estimate the channels of multiple subcarriers. Furthermore, by exploiting the
temporal channel correlation, a closed-loop channel tracking scheme is
provided, which adaptively designs the non-orthogonal pilot according to the
previous channel estimation to achieve an enhanced CSI acquisition. Finally, we
generalize the results of the multiple-measurement-vectors case in CS and
derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the proposed scheme, which enlightens us
to design the non-orthogonal pilot signals for the improved performance.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms its
counterparts, and it is capable of approaching the performance bound.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a serially concatenated turbo-encoded
faster-than-Nyquist signaling (FTNS) transceiver that takes into account
FTNS-specific colored noise effects. The proposed low-complexity receiver
carries out soft-decision frequency-domain equalization with the aid of the
minimum-mean square error criterion while whitening the colored noise.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage-concatenated FTNS
system achieves a better error-ratio performance than previous systems that do
not consider colored noise effects in the high-symbol-packing FTNS regime.
Furthermore, as an explicit benefit of the proposed iterative decoder,
near-capacity performance is achieved with practical decoding complexity.

 <dc:description>  Many large-scale scientific computations require eigenvalue solvers in a
scaling regime where efficiency is limited by data movement. We introduce a
parallel algorithm for computing the eigenvalues of a dense symmetric matrix,
which performs asymptotically less communication than previously known
approaches. We provide analysis in the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model
with additional consideration for communication between a local memory and
cache. Given sufficient memory to store $c$ copies of the symmetric matrix, our
algorithm requires $\Theta(\sqrt{c})$ less interprocessor communication than
previously known algorithms, for any $c\leq p^{1/3}$ when using $p$ processors.
The algorithm first reduces the dense symmetric matrix to a banded matrix with
the same eigenvalues. Subsequently, the algorithm employs successive reduction
to $O(\log p)$ thinner banded matrices. We employ two new parallel algorithms
that achieve lower communication costs for the full-to-band and band-to-band
reductions. Both of these algorithms leverage a novel QR factorization
algorithm for rectangular matrices.

 <dc:description>  In the face of serious infectious diseases, governments endeavour to
implement containment measures such as public vaccination at a macroscopic
level. Meanwhile, individuals tend to protect themselves by avoiding contacts
with infections at a microscopic level. However, a comprehensive understanding
of how such combined strategy influences epidemic dynamics is still lacking. We
study a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with imperfect
vaccination on dynamic contact networks, where the macroscopic intervention is
represented by random vaccination of the population and the microscopic
protection is characterised by susceptible individuals rewiring contacts from
infective neighbours. In particular, the model is formulated both in
populations without and then with demographic effects. Using the pairwise
approximation and the probability generating function approach, we investigate
both dynamics of the epidemic and the underlying network. For populations
without demography, the emerging degree correlations, bistable states, and
oscillations demonstrate the combined effects of the public vaccination program
and individual protective behavior. Compared to either strategy in isolation,
the combination of public vaccination and individual protection is more
effective in preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases by
increasing both the invasion threshold and the persistence threshold. For
populations with additional demographic factors, the integration between
vaccination intervention and individual rewiring may promote epidemic spreading
due to the birth effect. Moreover, the degree distributions of both networks in
the steady state is closely related to the degree distribution of newborns,
which leads to uncorrelated connectivity. All the results demonstrate the
importance of both local protection and global intervention, as well as the
demographic effects.

 <dc:description>  This paper is about the efficient generation of dense, colored models of
city-scale environments from range data and in particular, stereo cameras.
Better maps make for better understanding; better understanding leads to better
robots, but this comes at a cost. The computational and memory requirements of
large dense models can be prohibitive. We provide the theory and the system
needed to create city-scale dense reconstructions. To do so, we apply a
regularizer over a compressed 3D data structure while dealing with the complex
boundary conditions this induces during the data-fusion stage. We show that
only with these considerations can we swiftly create neat, large, &quot;well
behaved&quot; reconstructions. We evaluate our system using the KITTI dataset and
provide statistics for the metric errors in all surfaces created compared to
those measured with 3D laser. Our regularizer reduces the median error by 40%
in 3.4 km of dense reconstructions with a median accuracy of 6 cm. For
subjective analysis, we provide a qualitative review of 6.1 km of our dense
reconstructions in an attached video. These are the largest dense
reconstructions from a single passive camera we are aware of in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Existing approaches to combine both additive and multiplicative neural units
either use a fixed assignment of operations or require discrete optimization to
determine what function a neuron should perform. However, this leads to an
extensive increase in the computational complexity of the training procedure.
  We present a novel, parameterizable transfer function based on the
mathematical concept of non-integer functional iteration that allows the
operation each neuron performs to be smoothly and, most importantly,
differentiablely adjusted between addition and multiplication. This allows the
decision between addition and multiplication to be integrated into the standard
backpropagation training procedure.

 <dc:title>Variational Bayesian Inference of Line Spectra</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of line spectral estimation
in a Bayesian framework. We target model order and parameter estimation via
variational inference in a probabilistic model in which the frequencies are
continuous-valued, i.e., not restricted to a grid; and the coefficients are
governed by a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior model turning model order selection into
binary sequence detection. Unlike earlier works which retain only point
estimates of the frequencies, we undertake a more complete Bayesian treatment
by estimating the posterior probability density functions (pdfs) of the
frequencies and computing expectations over them. Thus, we additionally capture
and operate with the uncertainty of the frequency estimates. Aiming to maximize
the model evidence, variational optimization provides analytic approximations
of the posterior pdfs and also gives estimates of the additional parameters. We
propose an accurate representation of the pdfs of the frequencies by mixtures
of von Mises pdfs, which yields closed-form expectations. We define the
algorithm VALSE in which the estimates of the pdfs and parameters are
iteratively updated. VALSE is a gridless, convergent method, does not require
parameter tuning, can easily include prior knowledge about the frequencies and
provides approximate posterior pdfs based on which the uncertainty in line
spectral estimation can be quantified. Simulation results show that accounting
for the uncertainty of frequency estimates, rather than computing just point
estimates, significantly improves the performance. The performance of VALSE is
superior to that of state-of-the-art methods and closely approaches the
Cram\'er-Rao bound computed for the true model order.

 <dc:description>  Traditional evolutionary game theory describes how certain strategy spreads
throughout the system where individual player imitates the most successful
strategy among its neighborhood. Accordingly, player doesn't have own authority
to change their state. However in the human society, peoples do not just follow
strategies of other people, they choose their own strategy. In order to see the
decision of each agent in timely basis and differentiate between network
structures, we conducted multi-agent based modeling and simulation. In this
paper, agent can decide its own strategy by payoff comparison and we name this
agent as &quot;Self-motivated agent&quot;. To explain the behavior of self-motivated
agent, prisoner's dilemma game with cooperator, defector, loner and punisher
are considered as an illustrative example. We performed simulation by
differentiating participation rate, mutation rate and the degree of network,
and found the special coexisting conditions.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of affordable depth sensors, 3D capture becomes more and more
ubiquitous and already has made its way into commercial products. Yet,
capturing the geometry or complete shapes of everyday objects using scanning
devices (e.g. Kinect) still comes with several challenges that result in noise
or even incomplete shapes. Recent success in deep learning has shown how to
learn complex shape distributions in a data-driven way from large scale 3D CAD
Model collections and to utilize them for 3D processing on volumetric
representations and thereby circumventing problems of topology and
tessellation. Prior work has shown encouraging results on problems ranging from
shape completion to recognition. We provide an analysis of such approaches and
discover that training as well as the resulting representation are strongly and
unnecessarily tied to the notion of object labels. Thus, we propose a full
convolutional volumetric auto encoder that learns volumetric representation
from noisy data by estimating the voxel occupancy grids. The proposed method
outperforms prior work on challenging tasks like denoising and shape
completion. We also show that the obtained deep embedding gives competitive
performance when used for classification and promising results for shape
interpolation.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation systems have been widely used by commercial service providers
for giving suggestions to users. Collaborative filtering (CF) systems, one of
the most popular recommendation systems, utilize the history of behaviors of
the aggregate user-base to provide individual recommendations and are effective
when almost all users faithfully express their opinions. However, they are
vulnerable to malicious users biasing their inputs in order to change the
overall ratings of a specific group of items. CF systems largely fall into two
categories - neighborhood-based and (matrix) factorization-based - and the
presence of adversarial input can influence recommendations in both categories,
leading to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Although the robustness
of different collaborative filtering algorithms has been extensively studied,
designing an efficient system that is immune to manipulation remains a
significant challenge. In this work we propose a novel &quot;hybrid&quot; recommendation
system with an adaptive graph-based user/item similarity-regularization -
&quot;Chiron&quot;. Chiron ties the performance benefits of dimensionality reduction
(through factorization) with the advantage of neighborhood clustering (through
regularization). We demonstrate, using extensive comparative experiments, that
Chiron is resistant to manipulation by large and lethal attacks.

 <dc:description>  In modern large-scale machine learning applications, the training data are
often partitioned and stored on multiple machines. It is customary to employ
the &quot;data parallelism&quot; approach, where the aggregated training loss is
minimized without moving data across machines. In this paper, we introduce a
novel distributed dual formulation for regularized loss minimization problems
that can directly handle data parallelism in the distributed setting. This
formulation allows us to systematically derive dual coordinate optimization
procedures, which we refer to as Distributed Alternating Dual Maximization
(DADM). The framework extends earlier studies described in (Boyd et al., 2011;
Ma et al., 2015a; Jaggi et al., 2014; Yang, 2013) and has rigorous theoretical
analyses. Moreover with the help of the new formulation, we develop the
accelerated version of DADM (Acc-DADM) by generalizing the acceleration
technique from (Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, 2014) to the distributed setting. We
also provide theoretical results for the proposed accelerated version and the
new result improves previous ones (Yang, 2013; Ma et al., 2015a) whose runtimes
grow linearly on the condition number. Our empirical studies validate our
theory and show that our accelerated approach significantly improves the
previous state-of-the-art distributed dual coordinate optimization algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) can effectively improve the spectrum efficiency
and alleviate the spectrum scarcity, by allowing unlicensed secondary users
(SUs) to access the licensed spectrum of primary users (PUs) opportunistically.
Cooperative spectrum sharing is a new promising paradigm to provide necessary
incentives for both PUs and SUs in dynamic spectrum access. The key idea is
that SUs relay the traffic of PUs in exchange for the access time on the PUs'
licensed spectrum. In this paper, we formulate the cooperative spectrum sharing
between multiple PUs and multiple SUs as a two-sided market, and study the
market equilibrium under both complete and incomplete information. First, we
characterize the sufficient and necessary conditions for the market
equilibrium. We analytically show that there may exist multiple market
equilibria, among which there is always a unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium for
PUs (called PU-Optimal-EQ), in which every PU achieves a utility no worse than
in any other equilibrium. Then, we show that under complete information, the
unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium PU-Optimal-EQ can always be achieved despite
the competition among PUs; whereas, under incomplete information, the
PU-Optimal-EQ may not be achieved due to the mis-representations of SUs (in
reporting their private information). Regarding this, we further study the
worse-case equilibrium for PUs, and characterize a Robust equilibrium for PUs
(called PU-Robust-EQ), which provides every PU a guaranteed utility under all
possible mis-representation behaviors of SUs. Numerical results show that in a
typical network where the number of PUs and SUs are different, the performance
gap between PU-Optimal-EQ and PU-Robust-EQ is quite small (e.g., less than 10%
in the simulations).

 <dc:description>  Electric boolean games are compact representations of games where the players
have qualitative objectives described by LTL formulae and have limited
resources. We study the complexity of several decision problems related to the
analysis of rationality in electric boolean games with LTL objectives. In
particular, we report that the problem of deciding whether a profile is a Nash
equilibrium in an iterated electric boolean game is no harder than in iterated
boolean games without resource bounds. We show that it is a PSPACE-complete
problem. As a corollary, we obtain that both rational elimination and rational
construction of Nash equilibria by a supervising authority are PSPACE-complete
problems.

 <dc:description>  The recently developed massively parallel satisfiability (SAT) solver
HordeSAT was designed in a modular way to allow the integration of any
sequential CDCL-based SAT solver in its core. We integrated the QCDCL-based
quantified Boolean formula (QBF) solver DepQBF in HordeSAT to obtain a
massively parallel QBF solver---HordeQBF. In this paper we describe the details
of this integration and report on results of the experimental evaluation of
HordeQBF's performance. HordeQBF achieves superlinear average and median
speedup on the hard application instances of the 2014 QBF Gallery.

 <dc:title>Extending Homotopy Type Theory with Strict Equality</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In homotopy type theory (HoTT), all constructions are necessarily stable
under homotopy equivalence. This has shortcomings: for example, it is believed
that it is impossible to define a type of semi-simplicial types. More
generally, it is difficult and often impossible to handle towers of coherences.
To address this, we propose a 2-level theory which features both strict and
weak equality. This can essentially be represented as two type theories: an
&quot;outer&quot; one, containing a strict equality type former, and an &quot;inner&quot; one,
which is some version of HoTT. Our type theory is inspired by Voevosky's
suggestion of a homotopy type system (HTS) which currently refers to a range of
ideas. A core insight of our proposal is that we no not need any form of
equality reflection in order to achieve what HTS was suggested for. Instead,
having unique identity proofs in the outer type theory is sufficient, and it
also has the meta-theoretical advantage of not breaking decidability of type
checking. The inner theory can be an easily justifiable extensions of HoTT,
allowing the construction of &quot;infinite structures&quot; which are considered
impossible in plain HoTT. Alternatively, we can set the inner theory to be
exactly the current standard formulation of HoTT, in which case our system can
be thought of as a type-theoretic framework for working with &quot;schematic&quot;
definitions in HoTT. As demonstrations, we define semi-simplicial types and
formalise constructions of Reedy fibrant diagrams.

 <dc:description>  MPSoCs are gaining popularity because of its potential to solve
computationally expensive applications. A multi-core processor combines two or
more independent cores (normally a CPU) into a single package composed of a
single integrated circuit (Chip). However, as the number of components on a
single chip and their performance continue to increase, a shift from
computation-based to communication-based design becomes mandatory. As a result,
the communication architecture plays a major role in the area, performance, and
energy consumption of the overall system. In this paper, multiple soft-cores
(IPs) such as Micro Blaze in an FPGA is used to study the effect of different
connection topologies on the performance of a parallel program.

 <dc:title>Analysis of a trunk reservation policy in the framework of fog computing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We analyze in this paper a system composed of two data centers with limited
capacity in terms of servers. When one request for a single server is blocked
at the first data center, this request is forwarded to the second one. To
protect the single server requests originally assigned to the second data
center, a trunk reservation policy is introduced (i.e., a redirected request is
accepted only if there is a sufficient number of free servers at the second
data center). After rescaling the system by assuming that there are many
servers in both data centers and high request arrival rates, we are led to
analyze a random walk in the quarter plane, which has the particularity of
having non constant reflecting conditions on one boundary of the quarter plane.
Contrary to usual reflected random walks, to compute the stationary
distribution of the presented random walk, we have to determine three unknown
functions, one polynomial and two infinite generating functions. We show that
the coefficients of the polynomial are solutions to a linear system. After
solving this linear system, we are able to compute the two other unknown
functions and the blocking probabilities at both data centers. Numerical
experiments are eventually performed to estimate the gain achieved by the trunk
reservation policy.

 <dc:title>Information-theoretically Secure Key Agreement over Partially Corrupted

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Key agreement is a fundamental cryptographic primitive. It has been proved
that key agreement protocols with security against computationally unbounded
adversaries cannot exist in a setting where Alice and Bob do not have dependent
variables and communication between them is fully public, or fully controlled
by the adversary. In this paper we consider this problem when the adversary can
&quot;partially&quot; control the channel. We motivate these adversaries by considering
adversarial corruptions at the physical layer of communication, give a
definition of adversaries that can &quot;partially&quot; eavesdrop and &quot;partially&quot;
corrupt the communication. We formalize security and reliability of key
agreement protocols, derive bounds on the rate of key agreement, and give
constructions that achieve the bound. Our results show that it is possible to
have secret key agreement as long as some of the communicated symbols remain
private and unchanged by the adversary. We relate our results to the previous
known results, and discuss future work.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the development of a passive infra-red sensor tower
platform along with a classification algorithm to distinguish between human
intrusion, animal intrusion and clutter arising from wind-blown vegetative
movement in an outdoor environment. The research was aimed at exploring the
potential use of wireless sensor networks as an early-warning system to help
mitigate human-wildlife conflicts occurring at the edge of a forest. There are
three important features to the development. Firstly, the sensor platform
employs multiple sensors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array to
give it a key spatial-resolution capability that aids in classification.
Secondly, given the challenges of collecting data involving animal intrusion,
an Animation-based Simulation tool for Passive Infra-Red sEnsor (ASPIRE) was
developed that simulates signals corresponding to human and animal intrusion
and some limited models of vegetative clutter. This speeded up the process of
algorithm development by allowing us to test different hypotheses in a
time-efficient manner. Finally, a chirplet-based model for intruder signal was
developed that significantly helped boost classification accuracy despite
drawing data from a smaller number of sensors. An SVM-based classifier was used
which made use of chirplet, energy and signal cross-correlation-based features.
The average accuracy obtained for intruder detection and classification on
real-world and simulated data sets was in excess of 97%.

 <dc:title>Reversible Image Merging for Low-level Machine Vision</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper a hierarchical model for pixel clustering and image
segmentation is developed. In the model an image is hierarchically structured.
The original image is treated as a set of nested images, which are capable to
reversibly merge with each other. An object is defined as a structural element
of an image, so that, an image is regarded as a maximal object. The simulating
of none-hierarchical optimal pixel clustering by hierarchical clustering is
studied. To generate a hierarchy of optimized piecewise constant image
approximations, estimated by the standard deviation of approximation from the
image, the conversion of any hierarchy of approximations into the hierarchy
described in relation to the number of intensity levels by convex sequence of
total squared errors is proposed.

 <dc:description>  Due to budgetary constraints and the high level of training required, digital
forensic analysts are in short supply in police forces the world over. This
inevitably leads to a prolonged time taken between an investigator sending the
digital evidence for analysis and receiving the analytical report back. In an
attempt to expedite this procedure, various process models have been created to
place the forensic analyst in the field conducting a triage of the digital
evidence. By conducting triage in the field, an investigator is able to act
upon pertinent information quicker, while waiting on the full report. The work
presented as part of this paper focuses on the training of front-line personnel
in the field triage process, without the need of a forensic analyst attending
the scene. The premise has been successfully implemented within
regular/non-digital forensics, i.e., crime scene investigation. In that field,
front-line members have been trained in specific tasks to supplement the
trained specialists. The concept of front-line members conducting triage of
digital evidence in the field is achieved through the development of a new
process model providing guidance to these members. To prove the model's
viability, an implementation of this new process model is presented and
evaluated. The results outlined demonstrate how a tiered response involving
digital evidence specialists and non-specialists can better deal with the
increasing number of investigations involving digital evidence.

 <dc:description>  An efficient key management system is required to support cryptography. Most
key management systems use either pre-installed shared keys or install initial
security parameters using out-of-band channels. These methods create an
additional burden for engineers who manage the devices in industrial plants.
Hence, device deployment in industrial plants becomes a challenging task in
order to achieve security. In this work, we present a device deployment
framework that can support key management using the existing trust towards
employees in a plant. This approach reduces the access to initial security
parameters by employees, rather it helps to bind the trust of the employee with
device commissioning. Thus, this approach presents a unique solution to the
device deployment problem. Further, through a proof-of-concept implementation
and security analysis using the AVISPA tool, we present that our framework is
feasible to implement and satisfies our security objectives.

 <dc:description>  Given the ever-increasing prevalence of technology in modern life, there is a
corresponding increase in the likelihood of digital devices being pertinent to
a criminal investigation or civil litigation. As a direct consequence, the
number of investigations requiring digital forensic expertise is resulting in
huge digital evidence backlogs being encountered by law enforcement agencies
throughout the world. It can be anticipated that the number of cases requiring
digital forensic analysis will greatly increase in the future. It is also
likely that each case will require the analysis of an increasing number of
devices including computers, smartphones, tablets, cloud-based services,
Internet of Things devices, wearables, etc. The variety of new digital evidence
sources pose new and challenging problems for the digital investigator from an
identification, acquisition, storage and analysis perspective. This paper
explores the current challenges contributing to the backlog in digital
forensics from a technical standpoint and outlines a number of future research
topics that could greatly contribute to a more efficient digital forensic
process.

 <dc:description>  Non-negative matrix factorization models based on a hierarchical
Gamma-Poisson structure capture user and item behavior effectively in extremely
sparse data sets, making them the ideal choice for collaborative filtering
applications. Hierarchical Poisson factorization (HPF) in particular has proved
successful for scalable recommendation systems with extreme sparsity. HPF,
however, suffers from a tight coupling of sparsity model (absence of a rating)
and response model (the value of the rating), which limits the expressiveness
of the latter. Here, we introduce hierarchical compound Poisson factorization
(HCPF) that has the favorable Gamma-Poisson structure and scalability of HPF to
high-dimensional extremely sparse matrices. More importantly, HCPF decouples
the sparsity model from the response model, allowing us to choose the most
suitable distribution for the response. HCPF can capture binary, non-negative
discrete, non-negative continuous, and zero-inflated continuous responses. We
compare HCPF with HPF on nine discrete and three continuous data sets and
conclude that HCPF captures the relationship between sparsity and response
better than HPF.

 <dc:title>Quantum network protocol for qudits with use of quantum repeaters and

 <dc:description>  In this chapter a quantum communication protocol with use of repeaters is
presented. The protocol is constructed for qudits i.e. the generalized quantum
information units. One-dit teleportation is based on the generalized Pauli-Z
(phase-flip) gate's correction. This approach avoids using Pauli-X and Hadamard
gates unlike in other known protocols based on quantum repeaters which were
constructed for qubits and qudits. It is also important to mention that the
repeaters based on teleportation protocol, described in this chapter, allow a
measurement in the standard base (what simplifies the measurement process) and
the use of teleportation causes only Pauli-Z operational errors.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address Approximate Agreement problem in the Mobile
Byzantine faults model. Our contribution is threefold. First, we propose the
the first mapping from the existing variants of Mobile Byzantine models to the
Mixed-Mode faults model.This mapping further help us to prove the correctness
of class MSR (Mean-Subsequence-Reduce) Approximate Agreement algorithms in the
Mobile Byzantine fault model, and is of independent interest. Secondly, we
prove lower bounds for solving Approximate Agreement under all existing Mobile
Byzantine faults models. Interestingly, these lower bounds are different from
the static bounds. Finally, we propose matching upper bounds. Our paper is the
first to link the Mobile Byzantine Faults models and the Mixed-Mode Faults
models, and we advocate that a similar approach can be adopted in order to
prove the correctness of other classical distributed building blocks (e.g.
agreement, clock synchronization, interactive consistency etc) under Mobile
Byzantine Faults model.

 <dc:description>  Consider two correlated sources $X$ and $Y$ generated from a joint
distribution $p_{X,Y}$. Their G\'acs-K\&quot;orner Common Information, a measure of
common information that exploits the combinatorial structure of the
distribution $p_{X,Y}$, leads to a source decomposition that exhibits the
latent common parts in $X$ and $Y$. Using this source decomposition we
construct an efficient distributed compression scheme, which can be efficiently
used in the network setting as well. Then, we relax the combinatorial
conditions on the source distribution, which results in an efficient scheme
with a helper node, which can be thought of as a front-end cache. This
relaxation leads to an inherent trade-off between the rate of the helper and
the rate reduction at the sources, which we capture by a notion of optimal
decomposition. We formulate this as an approximate G\'acs-K\&quot;orner
optimization. We then discuss properties of this optimization, and provide
connections with the maximal correlation coefficient, as well as an efficient
algorithm, both through the application of spectral graph theory to the induced
bipartite graph of $p_{X,Y}$.

 <dc:title>Detangling People: Individuating Multiple Close People and Their Body
  Parts via Region Assembly</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jiang, Hao</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Grauman, Kristen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Today's person detection methods work best when people are in common upright
poses and appear reasonably well spaced out in the image. However, in many real
images, that's not what people do. People often appear quite close to each
other, e.g., with limbs linked or heads touching, and their poses are often not
pedestrian-like. We propose an approach to detangle people in multi-person
images. We formulate the task as a region assembly problem. Starting from a
large set of overlapping regions from body part semantic segmentation and
generic object proposals, our optimization approach reassembles those pieces
together into multiple person instances. It enforces that the composed body
part regions of each person instance obey constraints on relative sizes, mutual
spatial relationships, foreground coverage, and exclusive label assignments
when overlapping. Since optimal region assembly is a challenging combinatorial
problem, we present a Lagrangian relaxation method to accelerate the lower
bound estimation, thereby enabling a fast branch and bound solution for the
global optimum. As output, our method produces a pixel-level map indicating
both 1) the body part labels (arm, leg, torso, and head), and 2) which parts
belong to which individual person. Our results on three challenging datasets
show our method is robust to clutter, occlusion, and complex poses. It
outperforms a variety of competing methods, including existing detector CRF
methods and region CNN approaches. In addition, we demonstrate its impact on a
proxemics recognition task, which demands a precise representation of &quot;whose
body part is where&quot; in crowded images.

 <dc:description>  Existing saliency models have been designed and evaluated for predicting the
saliency in distortion-free images. However, in practice, the image quality is
affected by a host of factors at several stages of the image processing
pipeline such as acquisition, compression and transmission. Several studies
have explored the effect of distortion on human visual attention; however, none
of them have considered the performance of visual saliency models in the
presence of distortion. Furthermore, given that one potential application of
visual saliency prediction is to aid pooling of objective visual quality
metrics, it is important to compare the performance of existing saliency models
on distorted images. In this paper, we evaluate several state-of-the-art visual
attention models over different databases consisting of distorted images with
various types of distortions such as blur, noise and compression with varying
levels of distortion severity. This paper also introduces new improved
performance evaluation metrics that are shown to overcome shortcomings in
existing performance metrics. We find that the performance of most models
improves with moderate and high levels of distortions as compared to the near
distortion-free case. In addition, model performance is also found to decrease
with an increase in image complexity.

 <dc:title>Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching: Improved Delivery Rate-Cache
  Capacity Trade-off</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Amiri, Mohammad Mohammadi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gunduz, Deniz</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A centralized coded caching system, consisting of a server delivering N
popular files, each of size F bits, to K users through an error-free shared
link, is considered. It is assumed that each user is equipped with a local
cache memory with capacity MF bits, and contents can be proactively cached into
these caches over a low traffic period; however, without the knowledge of the
user demands. During the peak traffic period each user requests a single file
from the server. The goal is to minimize the number of bits delivered by the
server over the shared link, known as the delivery rate, over all user demand
combinations. A novel coded caching scheme for the cache capacity of M= (N-1)/K
is proposed. It is shown that the proposed scheme achieves a smaller delivery
rate than the existing coded caching schemes in the literature when K &gt; N &gt;= 3.
Furthermore, we argue that the delivery rate of the proposed scheme is within a
constant multiplicative factor of 2 of the optimal delivery rate for cache
capacities 1/K &lt;= M &lt;= (N-1)/K, when K &gt; N &gt;= 3.

 <dc:title>Secure Communication through Wireless-Powered Friendly Jamming: Jointly
  Online Optimization over Geography, Energy and Time</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Exploring the interference-emitting friendly jammers to protect the sensitive
communications in the presence of eavesdroppers has increasingly being
investigated in literature. In parallel, scavenging energy from abient radio
signals for energy-constrained devices, namely \emph{wireless energy
harvesting} (WEH), has also drawn significant attention. Without relying on
external energy supply, the wireless-powered friendly jammer by WEH from
legitimate wireless devices is an effective approach to prolong their lifetime
and gain the flexibility in deployments. This paper studies the online
optimization of the placement and WEH of a set of friendly jammers in a
geographic location with the energy-efficiency (EE) consideration. We adopt a
simple &quot;time switching&quot; protocol where power transfer and jammer-assisted
secure communications occur in different time blocks when WEH requests are
launched. Our scheme has the following important advantages: 1) The proposed
online jammers placement and interfering power allocation to attack
eavesdroppers is the first distributed and scalable solutions within any
specified geographic region, 2) We model the WEH for jammers as a \emph{JAM-NET
lifetime maximization problem}, where online scheduling algorithms with
heterogeneous energy demands of each jammer (from energy sources) are designed,
3) Under our model, the problem of placing a minimum number of jammers with
distance-based power assignments is NP-hard, and near optimal PTAS
approximation algorithms are provided, 4) When durations of the eavesdropping
and legitimate communicating are available and the scenario is extended to the
multi-channels setting, our results are strengthened to see further improved EE
and reduced number of jammers. Simulations back up our theory.

introduce a new dataset &quot;Depth in the Wild&quot; consisting of images in the wild
annotated with relative depth between pairs of random points. We also propose a
new algorithm that learns to estimate metric depth using annotations of

 <dc:description>  Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) describes the problem of learning an
unknown reward function of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from observed
behavior of an agent. Since the agent's behavior originates in its policy and
MDP policies depend on both the stochastic system dynamics as well as the
reward function, the solution of the inverse problem is significantly
influenced by both. Current IRL approaches assume that if the transition model
is unknown, additional samples from the system's dynamics are accessible, or
the observed behavior provides enough samples of the system's dynamics to solve
the inverse problem accurately. These assumptions are often not satisfied. To
overcome this, we present a gradient-based IRL approach that simultaneously
estimates the system's dynamics. By solving the combined optimization problem,
our approach takes into account the bias of the demonstrations, which stems
from the generating policy. The evaluation on a synthetic MDP and a transfer
learning task shows improvements regarding the sample efficiency as well as the
accuracy of the estimated reward functions and transition models.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of removing and replacing clouds in satellite image
sequences, which has a wide range of applications in remote sensing. Our
approach first detects and removes the cloud-contaminated part of the image
sequences. It then recovers the missing scenes from the clean parts using the
proposed &quot;TECROMAC&quot; (TEmporally Contiguous RObust MAtrix Completion) objective.
The objective function balances temporal smoothness with a low rank solution
while staying close to the original observations. The matrix whose the rows are
pixels and columnsare days corresponding to the image, has low-rank because the
pixels reflect land-types such as vegetation, roads and lakes and there are
relatively few variations as a result. We provide efficient optimization
algorithms for TECROMAC, so we can exploit images containing millions of
pixels. Empirical results on real satellite image sequences, as well as
simulated data, demonstrate that our approach is able to recover underlying
images from heavily cloud-contaminated observations.

 <dc:title>Optimal Monotone Drawings of Trees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>He, Dayu</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A monotone drawing of a graph G is a straight-line drawing of G such that,
for every pair of vertices u,w in G, there exists abpath P_{uw} in G that is
monotone in some direction l_{uw}. (Namely, the order of the orthogonal
projections of the vertices of P_{uw} on l_{uw} is the same as the order they
appear in P_{uw}.)
  The problem of finding monotone drawings for trees has been studied in
several recent papers. The main focus is to reduce the size of the drawing.
Currently, the smallest drawing size is O(n^{1.205}) x O(n^{1.205}). In this
paper, we present an algorithm for constructing monotone drawings of trees on a
grid of size at most 12n x 12n. The smaller drawing size is achieved by a new
simple Path Draw algorithm, and a procedure that carefully assigns primitive
vectors to the paths of the input tree T.
  We also show that there exists a tree T_0 such that any monotone drawing of
T_0 must use a grid of size Omega(n) x Omega(n). So the size of our monotone
drawing of trees is asymptotically optimal.

 <dc:title>Max-Information, Differential Privacy, and Post-Selection Hypothesis

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we initiate a principled study of how the generalization
properties of approximate differential privacy can be used to perform adaptive
hypothesis testing, while giving statistically valid $p$-value corrections. We
do this by observing that the guarantees of algorithms with bounded approximate
max-information are sufficient to correct the $p$-values of adaptively chosen
hypotheses, and then by proving that algorithms that satisfy
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy have bounded approximate max
information when their inputs are drawn from a product distribution. This
substantially extends the known connection between differential privacy and
max-information, which previously was only known to hold for (pure)
$(\epsilon,0)$-differential privacy. It also extends our understanding of
max-information as a partially unifying measure controlling the generalization
properties of adaptive data analyses. We also show a lower bound, proving that
(despite the strong composition properties of max-information), when data is
drawn from a product distribution, $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private
algorithms can come first in a composition with other algorithms satisfying
max-information bounds, but not necessarily second if the composition is
required to itself satisfy a nontrivial max-information bound. This, in
particular, implies that the connection between
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy and max-information holds only for
inputs drawn from product distributions, unlike the connection between
$(\epsilon,0)$-differential privacy and max-information.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of canonical-correlation analysis (CCA)
(Hotelling, 1936) and, more broadly, the generalized eigenvector problem for a
pair of symmetric matrices. These are two fundamental problems in data analysis
and scientific computing with numerous applications in machine learning and
statistics (Shi and Malik, 2000; Hardoon et al., 2004; Witten et al., 2009).
  We provide simple iterative algorithms, with improved runtimes, for solving
these problems that are globally linearly convergent with moderate dependencies
on the condition numbers and eigenvalue gaps of the matrices involved.
  We obtain our results by reducing CCA to the top-$k$ generalized eigenvector
problem. We solve this problem through a general framework that simply requires
black box access to an approximate linear system solver. Instantiating this
framework with accelerated gradient descent we obtain a running time of
$O(\frac{z k \sqrt{\kappa}}{\rho} \log(1/\epsilon) \log
\left(k\kappa/\rho\right))$ where $z$ is the total number of nonzero entries,
$\kappa$ is the condition number and $\rho$ is the relative eigenvalue gap of
the appropriate matrices.
  Our algorithm is linear in the input size and the number of components $k$ up
to a $\log(k)$ factor. This is essential for handling large-scale matrices that
appear in practice. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such
algorithm with global linear convergence. We hope that our results prompt
further research and ultimately improve the practical running time for
performing these important data analysis procedures on large data sets.

 <dc:title>A traditional tree-style tableau for LTL</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reynolds, Mark</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Propositional linear time temporal logic (LTL) is the standard temporal logic
for computing applications and many reasoning techniques and tools have been
developed for it. Tableaux for deciding satisfiability have existed since the
1980s. However, the tableaux for this logic do not look like traditional
tree-shaped tableau systems and their processing is often quite complicated. We
present a new simple traditional-style tree-shaped tableau for LTL and prove
that it is sound and complete. As well as being simple to understand, to
introduce to students and to use manually, it also seems simple to implement
and promises to be competitive in its automation. It is particularly suitable
for parallel implementations.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the first dataset for sequential vision-to-language, and explore
how this data may be used for the task of visual storytelling. The first
release of this dataset, SIND v.1, includes 81,743 unique photos in 20,211
sequences, aligned to both descriptive (caption) and story language. We
establish several strong baselines for the storytelling task, and motivate an
automatic metric to benchmark progress. Modelling concrete description as well
as figurative and social language, as provided in this dataset and the
storytelling task, has the potential to move artificial intelligence from basic
understandings of typical visual scenes towards more and more human-like
understanding of grounded event structure and subjective expression.

 <dc:description>  Driver distraction strongly contributes to crash-risk. Therefore, assistance
systems that warn the driver if her distraction poses a hazard to road safety,
promise a great safety benefit. Current approaches either seek to detect
critical situations using environmental sensors or estimate a driver's
attention state solely from her behavior. However, this neglects that driving
situation, driver deficiencies and compensation strategies altogether determine
the risk of an accident. This work proposes to use inverse suboptimal control
to predict these aspects in visually distracted lane keeping. In contrast to
other approaches, this allows a situation-dependent assessment of the risk
posed by distraction. Real traffic data of seven drivers are used for
evaluation of the predictive power of our approach. For comparison, a baseline
was built using established behavior models. In the evaluation our method
achieves a consistently lower prediction error over speed and track-topology
variations. Additionally, our approach generalizes better to driving speeds
unseen in training phase.

 <dc:title>Theoretically-Grounded Policy Advice from Multiple Teachers in

 <dc:description>  Policy advice is a transfer learning method where a student agent is able to
learn faster via advice from a teacher. However, both this and other
reinforcement learning transfer methods have little theoretical analysis. This
paper formally defines a setting where multiple teacher agents can provide
advice to a student and introduces an algorithm to leverage both autonomous
exploration and teacher's advice. Our regret bounds justify the intuition that
good teachers help while bad teachers hurt. Using our formalization, we are
also able to quantify, for the first time, when negative transfer can occur
within such a reinforcement learning setting.

 <dc:title>Understanding How Image Quality Affects Deep Neural Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dodge, Samuel</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Image quality is an important practical challenge that is often overlooked in
the design of machine vision systems. Commonly, machine vision systems are
trained and tested on high quality image datasets, yet in practical
applications the input images can not be assumed to be of high quality.
Recently, deep neural networks have obtained state-of-the-art performance on
many machine vision tasks. In this paper we provide an evaluation of 4
state-of-the-art deep neural network models for image classification under
quality distortions. We consider five types of quality distortions: blur,
noise, contrast, JPEG, and JPEG2000 compression. We show that the existing
networks are susceptible to these quality distortions, particularly to blur and
noise. These results enable future work in developing deep neural networks that
are more invariant to quality distortions.

 <dc:title>Area/latency optimized early output asynchronous full adders and
  relative-timed ripple carry adders</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Balasubramanian, P</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yamashita, S</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article presents two area/latency optimized gate level asynchronous full
adder designs which correspond to early output logic. The proposed full adders
are constructed using the delay-insensitive dual-rail code and adhere to the
four-phase return-to-zero handshaking. For an asynchronous ripple carry adder
(RCA) constructed using the proposed early output full adders, the
relative-timing assumption becomes necessary and the inherent advantages of the
relative-timed RCA are: (1) computation with valid inputs, i.e., forward
latency is data-dependent, and (2) computation with spacer inputs involves a
bare minimum constant reverse latency of just one full adder delay, thus
resulting in the optimal cycle time. With respect to different 32-bit RCA
implementations, and in comparison with the optimized strong-indication,
weak-indication, and early output full adder designs, one of the proposed early
output full adders achieves respective reductions in latency by 67.8, 12.3 and
6.1 %, while the other proposed early output full adder achieves corresponding
reductions in area by 32.6, 24.6 and 6.9 %, with practically no power penalty.
Further, the proposed early output full adders based asynchronous RCAs enable
minimum reductions in cycle time by 83.4, 15, and 8.8 % when considering
carry-propagation over the entire RCA width of 32-bits, and maximum reductions
in cycle time by 97.5, 27.4, and 22.4 % for the consideration of a typical
carry chain length of 4 full adder stages, when compared to the least of the
cycle time estimates of various strong-indication, weak-indication, and early
output asynchronous RCAs of similar size. All the asynchronous full adders and
RCAs were realized using standard cells in a semi-custom design fashion based
on a 32/28 nm CMOS process technology.

 <dc:title>Balancing Between Over-Weighting and Under-Weighting in Supervised Term
  Weighting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Haibing</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gu, Xiaodong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Supervised term weighting could improve the performance of text
categorization. A way proven to be effective is to give more weight to terms
with more imbalanced distributions across categories. This paper shows that
supervised term weighting should not just assign large weights to imbalanced
terms, but should also control the trade-off between over-weighting and
under-weighting. Over-weighting, a new concept proposed in this paper, is
caused by the improper handling of singular terms and too large ratios between
term weights. To prevent over-weighting, we present three regularization
techniques: add-one smoothing, sublinear scaling and bias term. Add-one
smoothing is used to handle singular terms. Sublinear scaling and bias term
shrink the ratios between term weights. However, if sublinear functions scale
down term weights too much, or the bias term is too large, under-weighting
would occur and harm the performance. It is therefore critical to balance
between over-weighting and under-weighting. Inspired by this insight, we also
propose a new supervised term weighting scheme, regularized entropy (re). Our
re employs entropy to measure term distribution, and introduces the bias term
to control over-weighting and under-weighting. Empirical evaluations on topical
and sentiment classification datasets indicate that sublinear scaling and bias
term greatly influence the performance of supervised term weighting, and our re
enjoys the best results in comparison with existing schemes.

 <dc:description>  Internet-of-Things (IoTs) envisions to integrate, coordinate, communicate,
and collaborate real-world objects in order to perform daily tasks in a more
intelligent and efficient manner. To comprehend this vision, this paper studies
the design of a large scale IoT system for smart grid application, which
constitutes a large number of home users and has the requirement of fast
response time. In particular, we focus on the messaging protocol of a universal
IoT home gateway, where our cloud enabled system consists of a backend server,
unified home gateway (UHG) at the end users, and user interface for mobile
devices. We discuss the features of such IoT system to support a large scale
deployment with a UHG and real-time residential smart grid applications. Based
on the requirements, we design an IoT system using the XMPP protocol, and
implemented in a testbed for energy management applications. To show the
effectiveness of the designed testbed, we present some results using the
proposed IoT architecture.

 <dc:description>  Consider a stochastic process $\{X(t)\}$ on a finite state space $ {\sf
X}=\{1,\dots, d\}$. It is conditionally Markov, given a real-valued `input
process' $\{\zeta(t)\}$. This is assumed to be small, which is modeled through
the scaling, \[ \zeta_t = \varepsilon \zeta^1_t, \qquad 0\le \varepsilon \le
1\,, \] where $\{\zeta^1(t)\}$ is a bounded stationary process. The following
conclusions are obtained, subject to smoothness assumptions on the controlled
transition matrix and a mixing condition on $\{\zeta(t)\}$:
  (i) A stationary version of the process is constructed, that is coupled with
a stationary version of the Markov chain $\{X^\bullet$(t)\}obtained with
$\{\zeta(t)\}\equiv 0$. The triple $(\{X(t)\}, \{X^\bullet(t)\},\{\zeta(t)\})$
is a jointly stationary process satisfying \[ {\sf P}\{X(t) \neq X^\bullet(t)\}
= O(\varepsilon) \] Moreover, a second-order Taylor-series approximation is
obtained: \[ {\sf P}\{X(t) =i \} ={\sf P}\{X^\bullet(t) =i \} + \varepsilon^2
\varrho(i) + o(\varepsilon^2),\quad 1\le i\le d, \] with an explicit formula
for the vector $\varrho\in\mathbb{R}^d$.
  (ii) For any $m\ge 1$ and any function $f\colon \{1,\dots,d\}\times
\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^m$, the stationary stochastic process $Y(t) =
f(X(t),\zeta(t))$ has a power spectral density $\text{S}_f$ that admits a
second order Taylor series expansion: A function $\text{S}^{(2)}_f\colon
[-\pi,\pi] \to \mathbb{C}^{ m\times m}$ is constructed such that \[
\text{S}_f(\theta) = \text{S}^\bullet_f(\theta) + \varepsilon^2
\text{S}_f^{(2)}(\theta) + o(\varepsilon^2),\quad \theta\in [-\pi,\pi] . \] An
explicit formula for the function $\text{S}_f^{(2)}$ is obtained, based in part
on the bounds in (i).
  The results are illustrated using a version of the timing channel of
Anantharam and Verdu.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for text detec- tion in natural
images. Both local and global cues are taken into account for localizing text
lines in a coarse-to-fine pro- cedure. First, a Fully Convolutional Network
(FCN) model is trained to predict the salient map of text regions in a holistic
manner. Then, text line hypotheses are estimated by combining the salient map
and character components. Fi- nally, another FCN classifier is used to predict
the centroid of each character, in order to remove the false hypotheses. The
framework is general for handling text in multiple ori- entations, languages
and fonts. The proposed method con- sistently achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on three text detection benchmarks: MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015 and
ICDAR2013.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT) systems in two-way relaying (TWR) channels. Here, two source nodes
receive information and energy simultaneously via power splitting (PS) from the
signals sent by a multi-antenna relay node. Our objective is to maximize the
weighted sum of the harvested energy at two source nodes subject to quality of
service (QoS) constraints and the relay power constraints. Three well-known and
practical two-way relay strategies are considered, i.e., amplify-and-forward
(AF), bit level XOR based decode-and-forward (DF-XOR) and symbol level
superposition coding based DF (DF-SUP). For each relaying strategy, we
formulate the joint energy transmit beamforming and PS ratios optimization as a
nonconvex quadratically constrained problem. To find a closed-form solution of
the formulated problem, we decouple the primal problem into two subproblems. In
the first problem, we intend to optimize beamforming vector for a given PS
ratio. In the second subproblem, we optimize the PS ratio with a given
beamforming vector. It is worth noting that although the corresponding
subproblem are nonconvex, the optimal solution of each subproblem can still be
found by using certain techniques. We provide numerical results that
demonstrate the advantage of adapting the different relaying strategies and
weighted factors to harvest energy in two-way relaying channel.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we survey, analyze and criticize current art on automated
melanoma screening, reimplementing a baseline technique, and proposing two
novel ones. Melanoma, although highly curable when detected early, ends as one
of the most dangerous types of cancer, due to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
Its incidence is soaring, much faster than the number of trained professionals
able to diagnose it. Automated screening appears as an alternative to make the
most of those professionals, focusing their time on the patients at risk while
safely discharging the other patients. However, the potential of automated
melanoma diagnosis is currently unfulfilled, due to the emphasis of current
literature on outdated computer vision models. Even more problematic is the
irreproducibility of current art. We show how streamlined pipelines based upon
current Computer Vision outperform conventional models - a model based on an
advanced bags of words reaches an AUC of 84.6%, and a model based on deep
neural networks reaches 89.3%, while the baseline (a classical bag of words)
stays at 81.2%. We also initiate a dialog to improve reproducibility in our
community

 <dc:description>  Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with Kullback-Leibler Divergence
(NMF-KL) is one of the most significant NMF problems and equivalent to
Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI), which has been successfully
applied in many applications. For sparse count data, a Poisson distribution and
KL divergence provide sparse models and sparse representation, which describe
the random variation better than a normal distribution and Frobenius norm.
Specially, sparse models provide more concise understanding of the appearance
of attributes over latent components, while sparse representation provides
concise interpretability of the contribution of latent components over
instances. However, minimizing NMF with KL divergence is much more difficult
than minimizing NMF with Frobenius norm; and sparse models, sparse
representation and fast algorithms for large sparse datasets are still
challenges for NMF with KL divergence. In this paper, we propose a fast
parallel randomized coordinate descent algorithm having fast convergence for
large sparse datasets to archive sparse models and sparse representation. The
proposed algorithm's experimental results overperform the current studies' ones
in this problem.

 <dc:description>  With the advance of technology, entities can be observed in multiple views.
Multiple views containing different types of features can be used for
clustering. Although multi-view clustering has been successfully applied in
many applications, the previous methods usually assume the complete instance
mapping between different views. In many real-world applications, information
can be gathered from multiple sources, while each source can contain multiple
views, which are more cohesive for learning. The views under the same source
are usually fully mapped, but they can be very heterogeneous. Moreover, the
mappings between different sources are usually incomplete and partially
observed, which makes it more difficult to integrate all the views across
different sources. In this paper, we propose MMC (Multi-source Multi-view
Clustering), which is a framework based on collective spectral clustering with
a discrepancy penalty across sources, to tackle these challenges. MMC has
several advantages compared with other existing methods. First, MMC can deal
with incomplete mapping between sources. Second, it considers the disagreements
between sources while treating views in the same source as a cohesive set.
Third, MMC also tries to infer the instance similarities across sources to
enhance the clustering performance. Extensive experiments conducted on
real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Pushing is a motion primitive useful to handle objects that are too large,
too heavy, or too cluttered to be grasped. It is at the core of much of robotic
manipulation, in particular when physical interaction is involved. It seems
reasonable then to wish for robots to understand how pushed objects move.
  In reality, however, robots often rely on approximations which yield models
that are computable, but also restricted and inaccurate. Just how close are
those models? How reasonable are the assumptions they are based on? To help
answer these questions, and to get a better experimental understanding of
pushing, we present a comprehensive and high-fidelity dataset of planar pushing
experiments. The dataset contains timestamped poses of a circular pusher and a
pushed object, as well as forces at the interaction.We vary the push
interaction in 6 dimensions: surface material, shape of the pushed object,
contact position, pushing direction, pushing speed, and pushing acceleration.
An industrial robot automates the data capturing along precisely controlled
position-velocity-acceleration trajectories of the pusher, which give dense
samples of positions and forces of uniform quality.
  We finish the paper by characterizing the variability of friction, and
evaluating the most common assumptions and simplifications made by models of
frictional pushing in robotics.

 <dc:description>  Analysis and prediction of stock market time series data has attracted
considerable interest from the research community over the last decade. Rapid
development and evolution of sophisticated algorithms for statistical analysis
of time series data, and availability of high-performance hardware has made it
possible to process and analyze high volume stock market time series data
effectively, in real-time. Among many other important characteristics and
behavior of such data, forecasting is an area which has witnessed considerable
focus. In this work, we have used time series of the index values of the Auto
sector in India during January 2010 to December 2015 for a deeper understanding
of the behavior of its three constituent components, e.g., the trend, the
seasonal component, and the random component. Based on this structural
analysis, we have also designed five approaches for forecasting and also
computed their accuracy in prediction using suitably chosen training and test
data sets. Extensive results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed decomposition approaches of time series and the efficiency of our
forecasting techniques, even in presence of a random component and a sharply
changing trend component in the time-series.

 <dc:title>Deep Feature Based Contextual Model for Object Detection</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chu, Wenqing</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Object detection is one of the most active areas in computer vision, which
has made significant improvement in recent years. Current state-of-the-art
object detection methods mostly adhere to the framework of regions with
convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and only use local appearance features
inside object bounding boxes. Since these approaches ignore the contextual
information around the object proposals, the outcome of these detectors may
generate a semantically incoherent interpretation of the input image. In this
paper, we propose an ensemble object detection system which incorporates the
local appearance, the contextual information in term of relationships among
objects and the global scene based contextual feature generated by a
convolutional neural network. The system is formulated as a fully connected
conditional random field (CRF) defined on object proposals and the contextual
constraints among object proposals are modeled as edges naturally. Furthermore,
a fast mean field approximation method is utilized to inference in this CRF
model efficiently. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves a higher mean average precision (mAP) on PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets
compared to the baseline algorithm Faster R-CNN.

 <dc:description>  Deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance in
various vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and
semantic segmentation. For object detection, particularly in still images, the
performance has been significantly increased last year thanks to powerful deep
networks (e.g. GoogleNet) and detection frameworks (e.g. Regions with CNN
features (R-CNN)). The lately introduced ImageNet task on object detection from
video (VID) brings the object detection task into the video domain, in which
objects' locations at each frame are required to be annotated with bounding
boxes. In this work, we introduce a complete framework for the VID task based
on still-image object detection and general object tracking. Their relations
and contributions in the VID task are thoroughly studied and evaluated. In
addition, a temporal convolution network is proposed to incorporate temporal
information to regularize the detection results and shows its effectiveness for
the task.

 <dc:description>  We empirical study the signs' property in the directed signed social networks
of Slashdot and Epinions by using an reshuffled approach. Through calculating
the entropy $S_{out}$ and the giant component $G$, we find an interesting 90/10
phenomenon: each individual labels his/her neighbors as friends with $90\%$ or
foes with $10\%$ uniformly random from the macroscopic perspective. We also
find that the entropy $S_{out}$ is suppressed by the non-randomness of labeling
sign. Our present work can prove how do the randomness and the non-randomness
coexist in human behavior of labeling signs, qualitatively.

 <dc:description>  Sponsored Search Auctions (SSAs) arguably represent the problem at the
intersection of computer science and economics with the deepest applications in
real life. Within the realm of SSAs, the study of the effects that showing one
ad has on the other ads, a.k.a. externalities in economics, is of utmost
importance and has so far attracted the attention of much research. However,
even the basic question of modeling the problem has so far escaped a definitive
answer. The popular cascade model is arguably too idealized to really describe
the phenomenon yet it allows a good comprehension of the problem. Other models,
instead, describe the setting more adequately but are too complex to permit a
satisfactory theoretical analysis. In this work, we attempt to get the best of
both approaches: firstly, we define a number of general mathematical
formulations for the problem in the attempt to have a rich description of
externalities in SSAs and, secondly, prove a host of results drawing a nearly
complete picture about the computational complexity of the problem. We
complement these approximability results with some considerations about
mechanism design in our context.

notion of creativity tailored for humans.
  In this paper we introduce General Creativity, which extends that traditional
notion. General Creativity provides the basis for a formalised theoretical
framework, that allows one to univocally describe any creative agent, and their
behaviour within societies of creative systems. Given the growing number of AI
creative systems developed over recent years, it is of fundamental importance
to understand how they could influence each other as well as how to gauge their
impact on human society. In particular, in this paper we exploit the proposed
framework for (i) identifying different forms of creativity; (ii) describing
some typical creative agents behaviour, and (iii) analysing the dynamics of
societies in which both human and non-human creative systems coexist.

 <dc:description>  The marine environment is one of the most important sources for microbial
biodiversity on the planet. These microbes are drivers for many biogeochemical
processes, and their enormous genetic potential is still not fully explored or
exploited. Marine metagenomics (DNA shotgun sequencing), not only offers
opportunities for studying structure and function of microbial communities, but
also identification of novel biocatalysts and bioactive compounds. However,
data analysis, management, storage, processing and interpretation are
significant challenges in marine metagenomics due to the high diversity in
samples and the size of the marine flagship projects. We provide a new
pipeline, META-pipe, for marine metagenomics analysis. It offers pre-
processing, assembly, taxonomic classification and functional analysis. To
reduce the effort to develop and deploy it, we have integrated existing
biological analysis frameworks, and compute and storage infrastructure
resources. Our current META-pipe web service provides integration with identity
provider services, distributed storage, computation on a Supercomputer, Galaxy
workflows, and interactive data visualizations. We have evaluated the
scalability and performance of the analysis pipeline. Our results demonstrate
how to develop and deploy a pipeline on distributed compute and storage
resources, and discusses important challenges related to this process.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new framework for analyzing the performance of
preprocessing algorithms. Our framework builds on the notion of kernelization
from parameterized complexity. However, as opposed to the original notion of
kernelization, our definitions combine well with approximation algorithms and
heuristics. The key new definition is that of a polynomial size
$\alpha$-approximate kernel. Loosely speaking, a polynomial size
$\alpha$-approximate kernel is a polynomial time pre-processing algorithm that
takes as input an instance $(I,k)$ to a parameterized problem, and outputs
another instance $(I',k')$ to the same problem, such that $|I'|+k' \leq
k^{O(1)}$. Additionally, for every $c \geq 1$, a $c$-approximate solution $s'$
to the pre-processed instance $(I',k')$ can be turned in polynomial time into a
$(c \cdot \alpha)$-approximate solution $s$ to the original instance $(I,k)$.
  Our main technical contribution are $\alpha$-approximate kernels of
polynomial size for three problems, namely Connected Vertex Cover, Disjoint
Cycle Packing and Disjoint Factors. These problems are known not to admit any
polynomial size kernels unless $NP \subseteq coNP/poly$. Our approximate
kernels simultaneously beat both the lower bounds on the (normal) kernel size,
and the hardness of approximation lower bounds for all three problems. On the
negative side we prove that Longest Path parameterized by the length of the
path and Set Cover parameterized by the universe size do not admit even an
$\alpha$-approximate kernel of polynomial size, for any $\alpha \geq 1$, unless
$NP \subseteq coNP/poly$. In order to prove this lower bound we need to combine
in a non-trivial way the techniques used for showing kernelization lower bounds
with the methods for showing hardness of approximation

 <dc:description>  Very deep convolutional neural networks introduced new problems like
vanishing gradient and degradation. The recent successful contributions towards
solving these problems are Residual and Highway Networks. These networks
introduce skip connections that allow the information (from the input or those
learned in earlier layers) to flow more into the deeper layers. These very deep
models have lead to a considerable decrease in test errors, on benchmarks like
ImageNet and COCO. In this paper, we propose the use of exponential linear unit
instead of the combination of ReLU and Batch Normalization in Residual
Networks. We show that this not only speeds up learning in Residual Networks
but also improves the accuracy as the depth increases. It improves the test
error on almost all data sets, like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100

 <dc:title>Operational Semantics of Resolution and Productivity in Horn Clause

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a study of operational and type-theoretic properties of
different resolution strategies in Horn clause logic. We distinguish four
different kinds of resolution: resolution by unification (SLD-resolution),
resolution by term-matching, the recently introduced structural resolution, and
partial (or lazy) resolution. We express them all uniformly as abstract
reduction systems, which allows us to undertake a thorough comparative analysis
of their properties. To match this small-step semantics, we propose to take
Howard's System H as a type-theoretic semantic counterpart. Using System H, we
interpret Horn formulas as types, and a derivation for a given formula as the
proof term inhabiting the type given by the formula. We prove soundness of
these abstract reduction systems relative to System H, and we show completeness
of SLD-resolution and structural resolution relative to System H. We identify
conditions under which structural resolution is operationally equivalent to
SLD-resolution. We show correspondence between term-matching resolution for
Horn clause programs without existential variables and term rewriting.

 <dc:description>  Humans perceive their surroundings in great detail even though most of our
visual field is reduced to low-fidelity color-deprived (e.g. dichromatic) input
by the retina. In contrast, most deep learning architectures are
computationally wasteful in that they consider every part of the input when
performing an image processing task. Yet, the human visual system is able to
perform visual reasoning despite having only a small fovea of high visual
acuity. With this in mind, we wish to understand the extent to which
connectionist architectures are able to learn from and reason with low acuity,
distorted inputs. Specifically, we train autoencoders to generate full-detail
images from low-detail &quot;foveations&quot; of those images and then measure their
ability to reconstruct the full-detail images from the foveated versions. By
varying the type of foveation, we can study how well the architectures can cope
with various types of distortion. We find that the autoencoder compensates for
lower detail by learning increasingly global feature functions. In many cases,
the learnt features are suitable for reconstructing the original full-detail
image. For example, we find that the networks accurately perceive color in the
periphery, even when 75\% of the input is achromatic.

 <dc:description>  Robotic-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) can benefit from the
automation of common, repetitive or well-defined but ergonomically difficult
tasks. One such task is the scanning of a pick-up endomicroscopy probe over a
complex, undulating tissue surface in order to enhance the effective
field-of-view through video mosaicing. In this paper, the da Vinci surgical
robot, through the dVRK framework, is used for autonomous scanning and 2D
mosaicing over a user-defined region of interest. To achieve the level of
precision required for high quality large-area mosaic generation, which relies
on sufficient overlap between consecutive image frames, visual servoing is
performed using a tracking marker attached to the probe. The resulting
sub-millimetre accuracy of the probe motion allows for the generation of large
endomicroscopy mo- saics with minimal intervention from the surgeon. It also
allows the probe to be maintained in an orientation perpendicular to the local
tissue surface, providing optimal imaging results. Images are streamed from the
endomicroscope and overlaid live onto the surgeons view, while 2D mosaics are
generated in real-time, and fused into a 3D stereo reconstruction of the
surgical scene, thus providing intuitive visualisation and fusion of the
multi-scale images. The system therefore offers significant potential to
enhance surgical procedures, by providing the operator with cellular-scale
information over a larger area than could typically be achieved by manual
scanning.

 <dc:description>  Bat algorithm is a population metaheuristic proposed in 2010 which is based
on the echolocation or bio-sonar characteristics of microbats. Since its first
implementation, the bat algorithm has been used in a wide range of fields. In
this paper, we present a discrete version of the bat algorithm to solve the
well-known symmetric and asymmetric traveling salesman problems. In addition,
we propose an improvement in the basic structure of the classic bat algorithm.
To prove that our proposal is a promising approximation method, we have
compared its performance in 37 instances with the results obtained by five
different techniques: evolutionary simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, an
island based distributed genetic algorithm, a discrete firefly algorithm and an
imperialist competitive algorithm. In order to obtain fair and rigorous
comparisons, we have conducted three different statistical tests along the
paper: the Student's $t$-test, the Holm's test, and the Friedman test. We have
also compared the convergence behaviour shown by our proposal with the ones
shown by the evolutionary simulated annealing, and the discrete firefly
algorithm. The experimentation carried out in this study has shown that the
presented improved bat algorithm outperforms significantly all the other
alternatives in most of the cases.

 <dc:description>  A new class of applications based on visual search engines are emerging,
especially on smart-phones that have evolved into powerful tools for processing
images and videos. The state-of-the-art algorithms for large visual content
recognition and content based similarity search today use the &quot;Bag of Features&quot;
(BoF) or &quot;Bag of Words&quot; (BoW) approach. The idea, borrowed from text retrieval,
enables the use of inverted files. A very well known issue with this approach
is that the query images, as well as the stored data, are described with
thousands of words. This poses obvious efficiency problems when using inverted
files to perform efficient image matching. In this paper, we propose and
compare various techniques to reduce the number of words describing an image to
improve efficiency and we study the effects of this reduction on effectiveness
in landmark recognition and retrieval scenarios. We show that very relevant
improvement in performance are achievable still preserving the advantages of
the BoF base approach.

 <dc:description>  Visual representation is crucial for a visual tracking method's performances.
Conventionally, visual representations adopted in visual tracking rely on
hand-crafted computer vision descriptors. These descriptors were developed
generically without considering tracking-specific information. In this paper,
we propose to learn complex-valued invariant representations from tracked
sequential image patches, via strong temporal slowness constraint and stacked
convolutional autoencoders. The deep slow local representations are learned
offline on unlabeled data and transferred to the observational model of our
proposed tracker. The proposed observational model retains old training samples
to alleviate drift, and collect negative samples which are coherent with
target's motion pattern for better discriminative tracking. With the learned
representation and online training samples, a logistic regression classifier is
adopted to distinguish target from background, and retrained online to adapt to
appearance changes. Subsequently, the observational model is integrated into a
particle filter framework to peform visual tracking. Experimental results on
various challenging benchmark sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker
performs favourably against several state-of-the-art trackers.

in this work. In order to meet all the complex restrictions contained in such a
problem, it has been modeled as a rich vehicle routing problem, which can be
more specifically considered as an asymmetric and clustered vehicle routing
problem with simultaneous pickup and deliveries, variable costs and forbidden
paths (AC-VRP-SPDVCFP). This is the first study of such a problem in the
literature. For this reason, a benchmark composed by 15 instances has been also
proposed. In the design of this benchmark, real geographical positions have
been used, located in the province of Bizkaia, Spain. For the proper treatment
of this AC-VRP-SPDVCFP, a discrete firefly algorithm (DFA) has been developed.
This application is the first application of the firefly algorithm to any rich
vehicle routing problem. To prove that the proposed DFA is a promising
technique, its performance has been compared with two other well-known
techniques: an evolutionary algorithm and an evolutionary simulated annealing.
Our results have shown that the DFA has outperformed these two classic
meta-heuristics.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks and evolutionary computation have a rich intertwined history.
They most commonly appear together when an evolutionary algorithm optimises the
parameters and topology of a neural network for reinforcement learning
problems, or when a neural network is applied as a surrogate fitness function
to aid the evolutionary optimisation of expensive fitness functions. In this
paper we take a different approach, asking the question of whether a neural
network can be used to provide a mutation distribution for an evolutionary
algorithm, and what advantages this approach may offer? Two modern neural
network models are investigated, a Denoising Autoencoder modified to produce
stochastic outputs and the Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator.
Results show that the neural network approach to learning genotypes is able to
solve many difficult discrete problems, such as MaxSat and HIFF, and regularly
outperforms other evolutionary techniques.

 <dc:title>Robust Control Framework for Time-Varying Power-Sharing among

 <dc:description>  One of the most important challenges facing an electric grid is to
incorporate renewables and distributed energy resources (DERs) to the grid.
Because of the associated uncertainties in power generations and peak power
demands, opportunities for improving the functioning and reliability of the
grid lie in the design of an efficient, yet pragmatic distributed control
framework with guaranteed robustness margins. This paper addresses the problem
of output voltage regulation for multiple DC-DC converters connected to a grid,
and prescribes a robust scheme for sharing power among different sources. More
precisely, we develop a control architecture where, unlike most standard
control frameworks, the desired power ratios appear as reference signals to
individual converter systems, and not as internal parameters of the system of
parallel converters. This makes the proposed approach suited for scenarios when
the desired power ratios vary rapidly with time. Additionally, the proposed
control framework is suitable to both centralized and decentralized
implementations, i.e., the same control architecture can be employed for
voltage regulation irrespective of the availability of common load-current (or
power) measurement, without the need to modify controller parameters. The
control design is obtained using robust optimal-control framework. Case studies
presented show the enhanced performance of prescribed optimal controllers for
voltage regulation and power sharing.

 <dc:description>  Links in many real-world networks activate and deactivate in correspondence
to the sporadic interactions between the elements of the system. The activation
patterns may be irregular or bursty and play an important role on the dynamics
of processes taking place in the network. Information or disease spreading in
networks are paradigmatic examples of this situation. Besides burstiness,
several correlations may appear in the process of link activation: memory
effects imply temporal correlations, but also the existence of communities in
the network may mediate the activation patterns of internal an external links.
Here we study the competition of topological and temporal correlations in link
activation and how they affect the dynamics of systems running on the network.
Interestingly, both types of correlations by separate have opposite effects:
one (topological) delays the dynamics of processes on the network, while the
other (temporal) accelerates it. When they occur together, our results show
that the direction and intensity of the final outcome depends on the
competition in a non trivial way.

 <dc:description>  In \cite{EK10} the use of VCG in matching markets is motivated by saying that
in order to compute market clearing prices in a matching market, the auctioneer
needs to know the true valuations of the bidders. Hence VCG and corresponding
personalized prices are proposed as an incentive compatible mechanism. The same
line of argument pops up in several lecture sheets and other documents related
to courses based on Easley and Kleinberg's book, seeming to suggest that
computing market clearing prices and corresponding assignments were \emph{not}
incentive compatible. Main purpose of our note is to observe that, in contrast,
assignments based on buyer optimal market clearing prices are indeed incentive
compatible.

 <dc:description>  We consider the design of an optimal collision-free sensor schedule for a
number of sensors which monitor different linear dynamical systems
correspondingly. At each time, only one of all the sensors can send its local
estimate to the remote estimator. A preliminary work for the two-sensor
scheduling case has been studied in the literature. The generalization into
multiple-sensor scheduling case is shown to be nontrivial. We first find a
necessary condition of the optimal solution provided that the spectral radii of
any two system matrices are not equal, which can significantly reduce the
feasible optimal solution space without loss of performance. By modelling a
finite-state Markov decision process (MDP) problem, we can numerically search
an asymptotic periodic schedule which is proven to be optimal. From a practical
viewpoint, the computational complexity is formidable for some special system
models, e.g., the spectral radii of some certain system matrices are far from
others'. Some simple but effective suboptimal schedules for any systems are
proposed. We also find a lower bound of the optimal cost, which enables us to
quantify the performance gap between any suboptimal schedule and the optimal
one.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem whether two ALC knowledge bases are

problem is undecidable for conjunctive queries (CQs) but 2EXPTIME-complete for

We also consider the problem whether two ALC TBoxes give the same answers to
any query in a given vocabulary over all ABoxes, and show that for CQs this
problem is undecidable, too, but becomes decidable and 2EXPTIME-complete in
Horn-ALC, and even EXPTIME-complete in Horn-ALC when restricted to (unions of)

 <dc:description>  The correlation of interference has been well quantified in Poisson networks
where the interferers are independent of each other. However, there exists
dependence among the base stations (BSs) in wireless networks. In view of this,
we quantify the interference correlation in non-Poisson networks where the
interferers are distributed as a Matern cluster process (MCP) and a
second-order cluster process (SOCP). Interestingly, it is found that the
correlation coefficient of interference for the Matern cluster networks,
$\zeta_{MCP}$, is equal to that for second-order cluster networks,
$\zeta_{SOCP}$. Furthermore, they are greater than their counterpart for the
Poisson networks. This shows that clustering in interferers enhances the
interference correlation. In addition, we show that the correlation
coefficients $\zeta_{MCP}$ and $\zeta_{SOCP}$ increase as the average number of
points in each cluster, $c$, grows, but decrease with the increase in the
cluster radius, $R$. More importantly, we point that the effects of clustering
on interference correlation can be neglected as
$\frac{c}{\pi^{2}R^{2}}\rightarrow0$. Finally, the analytical results are
validated by simulations.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the increasing usage of smartphones, there is a corresponding increase
in the phone metadata generated by individuals using these devices. Managing
the privacy of personal information on these devices can be a complex task.
Recent research has suggested the use of social and behavioral data for
automatically recommending privacy settings. This paper is the first effort to
connect users' phone use metadata with their privacy attitudes. Based on a
10-week long field study involving phone metadata collection via an app, and a
survey on privacy attitudes, we report that an analysis of cell phone metadata
may reveal vital clues to a person's privacy attitudes. Specifically, a
predictive model based on phone usage metadata significantly outperforms a
comparable personality features-based model in predicting individual privacy
attitudes. The results motivate a newer direction of automatically inferring a
user's privacy attitudes by looking at their phone usage characteristics.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel and efficient heuristic framework for
approximating the solutions to the multiple traveling salesmen problem (m-TSP)
and other variants on the TSP. The approach adopted in this paper is an
extension of the Maximum-Entropy-Principle (MEP) and the Deterministic
Annealing (DA) algorithm. The framework is presented as a general tool that can
be suitably adapted to a number of variants on the basic TSP. Additionally,
unlike most other heuristics for the TSP, the framework presented in this paper
is independent of the edges defined between any two pairs of nodes. This makes
the algorithm particularly suited for variants such as the close-enough
traveling salesman problem (CETSP) which are challenging due to added
computational complexity. The examples presented in this paper illustrate the
effectiveness of this new framework for use in TSP and many variants thereof.

 <dc:description>  This article analyzes two classes of job selection policies that control how
a network of autonomous aerial vehicles delivers goods from depots to
customers. Customer requests (jobs) occur according to a spatio-temporal
stochastic process not known by the system. If job selection uses a policy in
which the first job (FJ) is served first, the system may collapse to
instability by removing just one vehicle. Policies that serve the nearest job
(NJ) first show such threshold behavior only in some settings and can be
implemented in a distributed manner. The timing of job selection has
significant impact on delivery time and stability for NJ while it has no impact
for FJ. Based on these findings we introduce a methodological approach for
decision-making support to set up and operate such a system, taking into
account the trade-off between monetary cost and service quality. In particular,
we compute a lower bound for the infrastructure expenditure required to achieve
a certain expected delivery time. The approach includes three time horizons:
long-term decisions on the number of depots to deploy in the service area,
mid-term decisions on the number of vehicles to use, and short-term decisions
on the policy to operate the vehicles.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of estimating the parameters of a time-homogeneous
Markov chain given only noisy, aggregate data. This arises when a population of
individuals behave independently according to a Markov chain, but individual
sample paths cannot be observed due to limitations of the observation process
or the need to protect privacy. Instead, only population-level counts of the
number of individuals in each state at each time step are available. When these
counts are exact, a conditional least squares (CLS) estimator is known to be
consistent and asymptotically normal. We initiate the study of method of
moments estimators for this problem to handle the more realistic case when
observations are additionally corrupted by noise. We show that CLS can be
interpreted as a simple &quot;plug-in&quot; method of moments estimator. However, when
observations are noisy, it is not consistent because it fails to account for
additional variance introduced by the noise. We develop a new, simpler method
of moments estimator that bypasses this problem and is consistent under noisy

 <dc:title>SLING: A Near-Optimal Index Structure for SimRank</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  SimRank is a similarity measure for graph nodes that has numerous
applications in practice. Scalable SimRank computation has been the subject of
extensive research for more than a decade, and yet, none of the existing
solutions can efficiently derive SimRank scores on large graphs with provable
accuracy guarantees. In particular, the state-of-the-art solution requires up
to a few seconds to compute a SimRank score in million-node graphs, and does
not offer any worst-case assurance in terms of the query error.
  This paper presents SLING, an efficient index structure for SimRank
computation. SLING guarantees that each SimRank score returned has at most
$\varepsilon$ additive error, and it answers any single-pair and single-source
SimRank queries in $O(1/\varepsilon)$ and $O(n/\varepsilon)$ time,
respectively. These time complexities are near-optimal, and are significantly
better than the asymptotic bounds of the most recent approach. Furthermore,
SLING requires only $O(n/\varepsilon)$ space (which is also near-optimal in an
asymptotic sense) and $O(m/\varepsilon + n\log \frac{n}{\delta}/\varepsilon^2)$
pre-computation time, where $\delta$ is the failure probability of the
preprocessing algorithm. We experimentally evaluate SLING with a variety of
real-world graphs with up to several millions of nodes. Our results demonstrate
that SLING is up to $10000$ times (resp. $110$ times) faster than competing
methods for single-pair (resp. single-source) SimRank queries, at the cost of
higher space overheads.

 <dc:title>Topological Self-Stabilization with Name-Passing Process Calculi</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rickmann, Christina</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Topological self-stabilization describes the ability of a distributed system
to let the nodes themselves establish a meaningful overlay network. Independent
from the initial network topology, the system converges to the desired topology
via forwarding, inserting, and deleting links to neighboring nodes.
Name-passing process calculi, like the pi-calculus, are a well-known and widely
used method to model concurrent and distributed algorithms. The pi-calculus is
designed to naturally express processes with a changing link infrastructure, as
the communication between processes may carry information that can be used for
a change in the linkage between the processes. We redesign a simple local
linearization algorithm with asynchronous message-passing that was originally
designed for a shared memory model. We use an extended localized pi-calculus, a
variant of the pi-calculus, to model the algorithm. Subsequently, we formally
prove the self-stabilizing properties closure, weak convergence for every
arbitrary initial configuration, and strong convergence for two special cases.
In our proofs we utilize rather an assertional reasoning than an action-based
style. Furthermore, we describe the challenges in proving (strong) convergence
in the general case. Additionally, we give strong arguments for strong
convergence, supported by further proven lemmata, and discuss different
approaches for a formal proof.

 <dc:description>  The energy-efficient Adapteva Epiphany architecture exhibits massive
many-core scalability in a physically compact 2D array of RISC cores with a
fast network-on-chip (NoC). With fully divergent cores capable of MIMD
execution, the physical topology and memory-mapped capabilities of the core and
network translate well to partitioned global address space (PGAS) parallel
programming models. Following an investigation into the use of two-sided
communication using threaded MPI, one-sided communication using SHMEM is being
explored. Here we present work in progress on the development of an OpenSHMEM
1.2 implementation for the Epiphany architecture.

 <dc:title>Note on Optimal Trees for Parallel Hash Functions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A recent work shows how we can optimize a tree based mode of operation for a
rate 1 hash function. In particular, an algorithm and a theorem are presented
for selecting a good tree topology in order to optimize both the running time
and the number of processors at each step of the computation. Because this
paper deals only with trees having their leaves at the same depth, the number
of saved computing resources is perfectly optimal only for this category of
trees. In this note, we address the more general case and describe a simple
algorithm which, starting from such a tree topology, reworks it to further
reduce the number of processors and the total amount of work done to hash a
message.

 <dc:description>  The energy-efficient Adapteva Epiphany architecture exhibits massive
many-core scalability in a physically compact 2D array of RISC cores with a
fast network-on-chip (NoC). The architecture presents many features and
constraints which contribute to software design challenges for the application
developer. Addressing these challenges within the software stack that supports
application development is critical to improving productivity and expanding the
range of applications for the architecture. We report here on advances that
have been made in the COPRTHR-2 software stack targeting the Epiphany
architecture that address critical issues identified in previous work.
Specifically, we describe improvements that bring greater control and precision
to the design of compact compiled binary programs in the context of the limited
per-core local memory of the architecture. We describe a new design for
run-time support that has been implemented to dramatically improve the program
load and execute performance and capabilities. Finally, we describe
developments that advance host-coprocessor interoperability to expand the
functionality available to the application developer.

 <dc:title>Modeling Electrical Daily Demand in Presence of PHEVs in Smart Grids

 <dc:description>  Replacing a portion of current light duty vehicles (LDV) with plug-in hybrid
electric vehicles (PHEVs) offers the possibility to reduce the dependence on
petroleum fuels together with environmental and economic benefits. The charging
activity of PHEVs will certainly introduce new load to the power grid. In the
framework of the development of a smarter grid, the primary focus of the
present study is to propose a model for the electrical daily demand in presence
of PHEVs charging. Expected PHEV demand is modeled by the PHEV charging time
and the starting time of charge according to real world data. A normal
distribution for starting time of charge is assumed. Several distributions for
charging time are considered: uniform distribution, Gaussian with positive
support, Rician distribution and a non-uniform distribution coming from driving
patterns in real-world data. We generate daily demand profiles by using
real-world residential profiles throughout 2014 in the presence of different
expected PHEV demand models. Support vector machines (SVMs), a set of
supervised machine learning models, are employed in order to find the best
model to fit the data. SVMs with radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial
kernels were tested. Model performances are evaluated by means of mean squared
error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Best results are
obtained with RBF kernel: maximum (worst) values for MSE and MAPE were about
2.89 10-8 and 0.023, respectively.

 <dc:description>  In the fast evacuation problem, we study the path planning problem for two
robots who want to minimize the worst-case evacuation time on the unit disk.
The robots are initially placed at the center of the disk. In order to
evacuate, they need to reach an unknown point, the exit, on the boundary of the
disk. Once one of the robots finds the exit, it will instantaneously notify the
other agent, who will make a beeline to it.
  The problem has been studied for robots with the same speed~\cite{s1}. We
study a more general case where one robot has speed $1$ and the other has speed
$s \geq 1$. We provide optimal evacuation strategies in the case that $s \geq
c_{2.75} \approx 2.75$ by showing matching upper and lower bounds on the
worst-case evacuation time. For $1\leq s &lt; c_{2.75}$, we show (non-matching)
upper and lower bounds on the evacuation time with a ratio less than $1.22$.
Moreover, we demonstrate that a generalization of the two-robot search strategy
from~\cite{s1} is outperformed by our proposed strategies for any $s \geq
c_{1.71} \approx 1.71$.

 <dc:description>  Zero-delay transmission of a Gaussian source over an additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) channel is considered in the presence of an additive Gaussian
interference signal. The mean squared error (MSE) distortion is minimized under
an average power constraint assuming that the interference signal is known at
the transmitter. Optimality of simple linear transmission does not hold in this
setting due to the presence of the known interference signal. While the optimal
encoder-decoder pair remains an open problem, various non-linear transmission
schemes are proposed in this paper. In particular, interference concentration
(ICO) and one-dimensional lattice (1DL) strategies, using both uniform and
non-uniform quantization of the interference signal, are studied. It is shown
that, in contrast to typical scalar quantization of Gaussian sources, a
non-uniform quantizer, whose quantization intervals become smaller as we go
further from zero, improves the performance. Given that the optimal decoder is
the minimum MSE (MMSE) estimator, a necessary condition for the optimality of
the encoder is derived, and the numerically optimized encoder (NOE) satisfying
this condition is obtained. Based on the numerical results, it is shown that
1DL with non-uniform quantization performs closer (compared to the other
schemes) to the numerically optimized encoder while requiring significantly
lower complexity.

recent developments on forward and reverse entropy power inequalities not just
for the Shannon-Boltzmann entropy but also more generally for R\'enyi entropy.
In the process, we discuss connections between the so-called functional (or
integral) and probabilistic (or entropic) analogues of some classical

 <dc:description>  The Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technology has great
potential to manage the rapid growth of wireless data traffic. Massive MIMO
achieves tremendous spectral efficiency by spatial multiplexing of many tens of
user equipments (UEs). These gains are only achieved in practice if many more
UEs can connect efficiently to the network than today. As the number of UEs
increases, while each UE intermittently accesses the network, the random access
functionality becomes essential to share the limited number of pilots among the
UEs. In this paper, we revisit the random access problem in the Massive MIMO
context and develop a reengineered protocol, termed strongest-user collision
resolution (SUCRe). An accessing UE asks for a dedicated pilot by sending an
uncoordinated random access pilot, with a risk that other UEs send the same
pilot. The favorable propagation of Massive MIMO channels is utilized to enable
distributed collision detection at each UE, thereby determining the strength of
the contenders' signals and deciding to repeat the pilot if the UE judges that
its signal at the receiver is the strongest. The SUCRe protocol resolves the
vast majority of all pilot collisions in crowded urban scenarios and continues
to admit UEs efficiently in overloaded networks.

 <dc:description>  The maximum achievable rate or mutual informa- tion of multidimensional
rotationally invariant distributions in the presence of additive white Gaussian
noise is analyzed. A simple expression for the special case of multisphere
distributions is derived. Such distributions consist of points in a
multidimensional Euclidean space that are uniformly distributed over several
multidimensional concentric hyperspheres. For the 2-dimensional case, such
distributions have been previously considered in order to reduce the
computational complexity of finding a bound on the channel capacity of
fiber-optic channels. These distributions take advantage of the statistical
rotational invariance of the noise and nonlinear distortions in fiber-optic
channels. Using the derived mutual information expression, 2- and 4-dimensional
multisphere distributions are compared for fiber-optic dual-polarization
channels dominated by linear noise. At high signal-to-noise ratios,
4-dimensional multisphere distributions offer higher achievable rates than
2-dimensional ones transmitted on each of the two polarizations of the optical
carrier. Such 4-dimensional multisphere distributions are also shown to be
statistically invariant under 4-dimensional nonlinear transmission in fibers.

 <dc:title>Hypothetical Problems concerning the Theory of Relativity on
  Cryptographic Currency Implementations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ladha, Abrahim</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bitcoin has demonstrated there are many security improvements applicable to
normal currency. As the human race expands and we colonize other planets, we
have to consider how we are going to extend integral parts of of society, and
that includes our currency system. Information transferring does not scale well
with very large distances, entirely due to physical limitations. For example,
there is a maximum speed that any information can travel, and it cannot be
faster than the speed of light. In this paper we take these physical
limitations into account to give treatment to the following question. Can a
single crypto-currency be used across the entire universe? Trivially many
currencies can be used with exchange rates but we will try to avoid this as our
solution. The idea of this paper was inspired by a paper titled &quot;The Theory of
Interstellar Trade&quot; by Paul Krugman, a Nobel Economist.

 <dc:title>Collective influence in evolutionary social dilemmas</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  When evolutionary games are contested in structured populations, the degree
of each player in the network plays an important role. If they exist, hubs
often determine the fate of the population in remarkable ways. Recent research
based on optimal percolation in random networks has shown, however, that the
degree is neither the sole nor the best predictor of influence in complex
networks. Low-degree nodes may also be optimal influencers if they are
hierarchically linked to hubs. Taking this into account leads to the formalism
of collective influence in complex networks, which as we show here, has
far-reaching implications for the favorable resolution of social dilemmas. In
particular, there exists an optimal hierarchical depth for the determination of
collective influence that we use to describe the potency of players for passing
their strategies, which depends on the strength of the social dilemma.
Interestingly, the degree, which corresponds to the baseline depth zero, is
optimal only when the temptation to defect is small. Our research reveals that
evolutionary success stories are related to spreading processes which are
rooted in favorable hierarchical structures that extend beyond local
neighborhoods.

 <dc:description>  What does a typical visit to Paris look like? Do people first take photos of
the Louvre and then the Eiffel Tower? Can we visually model a temporal event
like &quot;Paris Vacation&quot; using current frameworks? In this paper, we explore how
we can automatically learn the temporal aspects, or storylines of visual
concepts from web data. Previous attempts focus on consecutive image-to-image
transitions and are unsuccessful at recovering the long-term underlying story.
Our novel Skipping Recurrent Neural Network (S-RNN) model does not attempt to
predict each and every data point in the sequence, like classic RNNs. Rather,
S-RNN uses a framework that skips through the images in the photo stream to
explore the space of all ordered subsets of the albums via an efficient
sampling procedure. This approach reduces the negative impact of strong
short-term correlations, and recovers the latent story more accurately. We show
how our learned storylines can be used to analyze, predict, and summarize photo
albums from Flickr. Our experimental results provide strong qualitative and
quantitative evidence that S-RNN is significantly better than other candidate
methods such as LSTMs on learning long-term correlations and recovering latent
storylines. Moreover, we show how storylines can help machines better
understand and summarize photo streams by inferring a brief personalized story
of each individual album.

 <dc:description>  A multiple input multiple output ultra-wideband cognitive radar based on
compressive sensing is presented in this letter. For traditional UWB radar,
high sampling rate analog to digital converter at the receiver is required to
meet Shannon theorem, which increases hardware complexity. In order to bypass
the bottleneck of ADC or further increase the radar bandwidth using the latest
wideband ADC, we propose to exploit CS for signal reconstruction at the
receiver of UWB radar for the sparse targets in the surveillance area. Besides,
the function of narrowband interference cancellation is integrated into the
proposed MIMO UWB radar. The field demonstration proves the feasibility and
reliability of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In the community of remote sensing, nonlinear mixing models have recently
received particular attention in hyperspectral image processing. In this paper,
we present a novel nonlinear spectral unmixing method following the recent
multilinear mixing model of [1], which includes an infinite number of terms
related to interactions between different endmembers. The proposed unmixing
method is unsupervised in the sense that the endmembers are estimated jointly
with the abundances and other parameters of interest, i.e., the transition
probability of undergoing further interactions. Non-negativity and sum-to one
constraints are imposed on abundances while only nonnegativity is considered
for endmembers. The resulting unmixing problem is formulated as a constrained
nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved by a block coordinate descent
strategy, consisting of updating the endmembers, abundances and transition
probability iteratively. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with
linear unmixing methods for synthetic and real hyperspectral datasets acquired
by the AVIRIS sensor. The advantage of using non-linear unmixing as opposed to
linear unmixing is clearly shown in these examples.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose an alternating low-rank decomposition (ALRD)
approach and novel subspace algorithms for direction-of-arrival (DOA)
estimation. In the ALRD scheme, the decomposition matrix for rank reduction is
composed of a set of basis vectors. A low-rank auxiliary parameter vector is
then employed to compute the output power spectrum. Alternating optimization
strategies based on recursive least squares (RLS), denoted as ALRD-RLS and
modified ALRD-RLS (MARLD-RLS), are devised to compute the basis vectors and the
auxiliary parameter vector. Simulations for large sensor arrays with both
uncorrelated and correlated sources are presented, showing that the proposed
algorithms are superior to existing techniques.

 <dc:title>A Sparse and Low-Rank Optimization Framework for Index Coding via

 <dc:creator>Shi, Yuanming</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mishra, Bamdev</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Side information provides a pivotal role for message delivery in many
communication scenarios to accommodate increasingly large data sets, e.g.,
caching networks. Although index coding provides a fundamental modeling
framework to exploit the benefits of side information, the index coding problem
itself still remains open and only a few instances have been solved. In this
paper, we propose a novel sparse and low- rank optimization modeling framework
for the index coding problem to characterize the tradeoff between the amount of
side information and the achievable data rate. Specifically, sparsity of the
model measures the amount of side information, while low- rankness represents
the achievable data rate. The resulting sparse and low-rank optimization
problem has non-convex sparsity inducing objective and non-convex rank
constraint. To address the coupled challenges in objective and constraint, we
propose a novel Riemannian optimization framework by exploiting the quotient
manifold geometry of fixed-rank matrices, accompanied by a smooth sparsity
inducing surrogate. Simulation results demonstrate the appealing sparsity and
low-rankness tradeoff in the proposed model, thereby revealing the tradeoff
between the amount of side information and the achievable data rate in the
index coding problem.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the issue of output instability of deep neural
networks: small perturbations in the visual input can significantly distort the
feature embeddings and output of a neural network. Such instability affects
many deep architectures with state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of
computer vision tasks. We present a general stability training method to
stabilize deep networks against small input distortions that result from
various types of common image processing, such as compression, rescaling, and
cropping. We validate our method by stabilizing the state-of-the-art Inception
architecture against these types of distortions. In addition, we demonstrate
that our stabilized model gives robust state-of-the-art performance on
large-scale near-duplicate detection, similar-image ranking, and classification
on noisy datasets.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel architecture, the event-based GASSOM for learning and
extracting invariant representations from event streams originating from
neuromorphic vision sensors. The framework is inspired by feed-forward cortical
models for visual processing. The model, which is based on the concepts of
sparsity and temporal slowness, is able to learn feature extractors that
resemble neurons in the primary visual cortex. Layers of units in the proposed
model can be cascaded to learn feature extractors with different levels of
complexity and selectivity. We explore the applicability of the framework on
real world tasks by using the learned network for object recognition. The
proposed model achieve higher classification accuracy compared to other
state-of-the-art event based processing methods. Our results also demonstrate
the generality and robustness of the method, as the recognizers for different
data sets and different tasks all used the same set of learned feature
detectors, which were trained on data collected independently of the testing
data.

 <dc:description>  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have exhibited superior performance
in many visual recognition tasks including image classification, object
detection, and scene label- ing, due to their large learning capacity and
resistance to overfit. For the image classification task, most of the current
deep CNN- based approaches take the whole size-normalized image as input and
have achieved quite promising results. Compared with the previously dominating
approaches based on feature extraction, pooling, and classification, the deep
CNN-based approaches mainly rely on the learning capability of deep CNN to
achieve superior results: the burden of minimizing intra-class variation while
maximizing inter-class difference is entirely dependent on the implicit feature
learning component of deep CNN; we rely upon the implicitly learned filters and
pooling component to select the discriminative regions, which correspond to the
activated neurons. However, if the irrelevant regions constitute a large
portion of the image of interest, the classification performance of the deep
CNN, which takes the whole image as input, can be heavily affected. To solve
this issue, we propose a novel latent CNN framework, which treats the most
discriminate region as a latent variable. We can jointly learn the global CNN
with the latent CNN to avoid the aforementioned big irrelevant region issue,
and our experimental results show the evident advantage of the proposed latent
CNN over traditional deep CNN: latent CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art
performance of deep CNN on standard benchmark datasets including the CIFAR-10,
CIFAR- 100, MNIST and PASCAL VOC 2007 Classification dataset.

 <dc:description>  Facial expressions convey nonverbal cues which play an important role in
interpersonal relations, and are widely used in behavior interpretation of
emotions, cognitive science, and social interactions. In this paper we analyze
different ways of representing geometric feature and present a fully automatic
facial expression recognition (FER) system using salient geometric features. In
geometric feature-based FER approach, the first important step is to initialize
and track dense set of facial points as the expression evolves over time in
consecutive frames. In the proposed system, facial points are initialized using
elastic bunch graph matching (EBGM) algorithm and tracking is performed using
Kanade-Lucas-Tomaci (KLT) tracker. We extract geometric features from point,
line and triangle composed of tracking results of facial points. The most
discriminative line and triangle features are extracted using feature selective
multi-class AdaBoost with the help of extreme learning machine (ELM)
classification. Finally the geometric features for FER are extracted from the
boosted line, and triangles composed of facial points. The recognition accuracy
using features from point, line and triangle are analyzed independently. The
performance of the proposed FER system is evaluated on three different data
sets: namely CK+, MMI and MUG facial expression data sets.

 <dc:description>  Facial expressions are one of the most powerful, natural and immediate means
for human being to communicate their emotions and intensions. Recognition of
facial expression has many applications including human-computer interaction,
cognitive science, human emotion analysis, personality development etc. In this
paper, we propose a new method for the recognition of facial expressions from
single image frame that uses combination of appearance and geometric features
with support vector machines classification. In general, appearance features
for the recognition of facial expressions are computed by dividing face region
into regular grid (holistic representation). But, in this paper we extracted
region specific appearance features by dividing the whole face region into
domain specific local regions. Geometric features are also extracted from
corresponding domain specific regions. In addition, important local regions are
determined by using incremental search approach which results in the reduction
of feature dimension and improvement in recognition accuracy. The results of
facial expressions recognition using features from domain specific regions are
also compared with the results obtained using holistic representation. The
performance of the proposed facial expression recognition system has been
validated on publicly available extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) facial expression
data sets.

 <dc:title>High-performance Semantic Segmentation Using Very Deep Fully
  Convolutional Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for high-performance semantic image segmentation (or
semantic pixel labelling) based on very deep residual networks, which achieves
the state-of-the-art performance. A few design factors are carefully considered
to this end.
  We make the following contributions. (i) First, we evaluate different
variations of a fully convolutional residual network so as to find the best
configuration, including the number of layers, the resolution of feature maps,
and the size of field-of-view. Our experiments show that further enlarging the
field-of-view and increasing the resolution of feature maps are typically
beneficial, which however inevitably leads to a higher demand for GPU memories.
To walk around the limitation, we propose a new method to simulate a high
resolution network with a low resolution network, which can be applied during
training and/or testing. (ii) Second, we propose an online bootstrapping method
for training. We demonstrate that online bootstrapping is critically important
for achieving good accuracy. (iii) Third we apply the traditional dropout to
some of the residual blocks, which further improves the performance. (iv)
Finally, our method achieves the currently best mean intersection-over-union
78.3\% on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, as well as on the recent dataset
Cityscapes.

 <dc:title>A parallel repetition theorem for all entangled games</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The behavior of games repeated in parallel, when played with quantumly
entangled players, has received much attention in recent years. Quantum
analogues of Raz's classical parallel repetition theorem have been proved for
many special classes of games. However, for general entangled games no parallel
repetition theorem was known. We prove that the entangled value of a two-player
game $G$ repeated $n$ times in parallel is at most $c_G n^{-1/4} \log n$ for a
constant $c_G$ depending on $G$, provided that the entangled value of $G$ is
less than 1. In particular, this gives the first proof that the entangled value
of a parallel repeated game must converge to 0 for all games whose entangled
value is less than 1. Central to our proof is a combination of both classical
and quantum correlated sampling.

 <dc:title>A Generalized Fundamental Matrix for Computing Fundamental Quantities of

 <dc:description>  As is well known, the fundamental matrix $(I - P + e \pi)^{-1}$ plays an
important role in the performance analysis of Markov systems, where $P$ is the
transition probability matrix, $e$ is the column vector of ones, and $\pi$ is
the row vector of the steady state distribution. It is used to compute the
performance potential (relative value function) of Markov decision processes
under the average criterion, such as $g=(I - P + e \pi)^{-1} f$ where $g$ is
the column vector of performance potentials and $f$ is the column vector of
reward functions. However, we need to pre-compute $\pi$ before we can compute
$(I - P + e \pi)^{-1}$. In this paper, we derive a generalization version of
the fundamental matrix as $(I - P + e r)^{-1}$, where $r$ can be any given row
vector satisfying $r e \neq 0$. With this generalized fundamental matrix, we
can compute $g=(I - P + e r)^{-1} f$. The steady state distribution is computed
as $\pi = r(I - P + e r)^{-1}$. The Q-factors at every state-action pair can
also be computed in a similar way. These formulas may give some insights on
further understanding how to efficiently compute or estimate the values of $g$,
$\pi$, and Q-factors in Markov systems, which are fundamental quantities for
the performance optimization of Markov systems.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the issue of large covariance matrix estimation in
high-dimensional statistical analysis. Recently, improved iterative algorithms
with positive-definite guarantee have been developed. However, these algorithms
cannot be directly extended to use a nonconvex penalty for sparsity inducing.
Generally, a nonconvex penalty has the capability of ameliorating the bias
problem of the popular convex lasso penalty, and thus is more advantageous. In
this work, we propose a class of positive-definite covariance estimators using
generalized nonconvex penalties. We develop a first-order algorithm based on
the alternating direction method framework to solve the nonconvex optimization
problem efficiently. The convergence of this algorithm has been proved.
Further, the statistical properties of the new estimators have been analyzed
for generalized nonconvex penalties. Moreover, extension of this algorithm to
covariance estimation from sketched measurements has been considered. The
performances of the new estimators have been demonstrated by both a simulation
study and a gene clustering example for tumor tissues. Code for the proposed
estimators is available at https://github.com/FWen/Nonconvex-PDLCE.git.

 <dc:description>  Existing open-domain human-computer conversation systems are typically
passive: they either synthesize or retrieve a reply provided a human-issued
utterance. It is generally presumed that humans should take the role to lead
the conversation and introduce new content when a stalemate occurs, and that
the computer only needs to &quot;respond.&quot; In this paper, we propose
StalemateBreaker, a conversation system that can proactively introduce new
content when appropriate. We design a pipeline to determine when, what, and how
to introduce new content during human-computer conversation. We further propose
a novel reranking algorithm Bi-PageRank-HITS to enable rich interaction between
conversation context and candidate replies. Experiments show that both the
content-introducing approach and the reranking algorithm are effective. Our
full StalemateBreaker model outperforms a state-of-the-practice conversation
system by +14.4% p@1 when a stalemate occurs.

 <dc:description>  The Coalitional Manipulation problem has been studied extensively in the
literature for many voting rules. However, most studies have focused on the
complete information setting, wherein the manipulators know the votes of the
non-manipulators. While this assumption is reasonable for purposes of showing
intractability, it is unrealistic for algorithmic considerations. In most
real-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate
knowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation
with incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial
order for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter.
In this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of
manipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation. We say that
an extension of a partial order is if there exists a manipulative vote for that
extension.
  1. Weak Manipulation (WM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes
their preferred candidate win in at least one extension of the partial votes of
the non-manipulators.
  2. Opportunistic Manipulation (OM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way
that makes their preferred candidate win in every viable extension of the
partial votes of the non-manipulators.
  3. Strong Manipulation (SM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that
makes their preferred candidate win in every extension of the partial votes of
the non-manipulators.
  We consider several scenarios for which the traditional manipulation problems
are easy (for instance, Borda with a single manipulator). For many of them, the
corresponding manipulative questions that we propose turn out to be
computationally intractable. Our hardness results often hold even when very
little information is missing, or in other words, even when the instances are
quite close to the complete information setting.

 <dc:description>  Sparsely spread code division multiple access (SCDMA) is a non-orthogonal
superposition coding scheme that permits a base station simultaneously
communicates with multiple users over a common channel. The detection
performance of an SCDMA system is mainly determined by its signature matrix,
which should be sparse to guarantee large Euclidean distance for the equivalent
signal constellation after spreading and superposition. Good signature matrices
that perform well under both belief prorogation and the maximum likelihood
detections are designed. The proposed design applies to several similar
well-documented schemes, including trellis code multiple access (TCMA), low
density spreading, and superposition modulation systems.

 <dc:description>  The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of feature representation
learning and distance metric learning, whereas the two steps are often
discussed separately. To explore their interaction, this work proposes an
end-to-end learning framework called DARI, i.e. Distance metric And
Representation Integration, and validates the effectiveness of DARI in the
challenging task of person verification. Given the training images annotated
with the labels, we first produce a large number of triplet units, and each one
contains three images, i.e. one person and the matched/mismatch references. For
each triplet unit, the distance disparity between the matched pair and the
mismatched pair tends to be maximized. We solve this objective by building a
deep architecture of convolutional neural networks. In particular, the
Mahalanobis distance matrix is naturally factorized as one top fully-connected
layer that is seamlessly integrated with other bottom layers representing the
image feature. The image feature and the distance metric can be thus
simultaneously optimized via the one-shot backward propagation. On several
public datasets, DARI shows very promising performance on re-identifying
individuals cross cameras against various challenges, and outperforms other
state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  Semantic matching, which aims to determine the matching degree between two
texts, is a fundamental problem for many NLP applications. Recently, deep
learning approach has been applied to this problem and significant improvements
have been achieved. In this paper, we propose to view the generation of the
global interaction between two texts as a recursive process: i.e. the
interaction of two texts at each position is a composition of the interactions
between their prefixes as well as the word level interaction at the current
position. Based on this idea, we propose a novel deep architecture, namely
Match-SRNN, to model the recursive matching structure. Firstly, a tensor is
constructed to capture the word level interactions. Then a spatial RNN is
applied to integrate the local interactions recursively, with importance
determined by four types of gates. Finally, the matching score is calculated
based on the global interaction. We show that, after degenerated to the exact
matching scenario, Match-SRNN can approximate the dynamic programming process
of longest common subsequence. Thus, there exists a clear interpretation for
Match-SRNN. Our experiments on two semantic matching tasks showed the
effectiveness of Match-SRNN, and its ability of visualizing the learned
matching structure.

 <dc:title>Precomputed Real-Time Texture Synthesis with Markovian Generative
  Adversarial Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes Markovian Generative Adversarial Networks (MGANs), a
method for training generative neural networks for efficient texture synthesis.
While deep neural network approaches have recently demonstrated remarkable
results in terms of synthesis quality, they still come at considerable
computational costs (minutes of run-time for low-res images). Our paper
addresses this efficiency issue. Instead of a numerical deconvolution in
previous work, we precompute a feed-forward, strided convolutional network that
captures the feature statistics of Markovian patches and is able to directly
generate outputs of arbitrary dimensions. Such network can directly decode
brown noise to realistic texture, or photos to artistic paintings. With
adversarial training, we obtain quality comparable to recent neural texture
synthesis methods. As no optimization is required any longer at generation
time, our run-time performance (0.25M pixel images at 25Hz) surpasses previous
neural texture synthesizers by a significant margin (at least 500 times
faster). We apply this idea to texture synthesis, style transfer, and video
stylization.

 <dc:title>Composition of Deep and Spiking Neural Networks for Very Low Bit Rate
  Speech Coding</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Most current very low bit rate (VLBR) speech coding systems use hidden Markov
model (HMM) based speech recognition/synthesis techniques. This allows
transmission of information (such as phonemes) segment by segment that
decreases the bit rate. However, the encoder based on a phoneme speech
recognition may create bursts of segmental errors. Segmental errors are further
propagated to optional suprasegmental (such as syllable) information coding.
Together with the errors of voicing detection in pitch parametrization,
HMM-based speech coding creates speech discontinuities and unnatural speech
sound artefacts.
  In this paper, we propose a novel VLBR speech coding framework based on
neural networks (NNs) for end-to-end speech analysis and synthesis without
HMMs. The speech coding framework relies on phonological (sub-phonetic)
representation of speech, and it is designed as a composition of deep and
spiking NNs: a bank of phonological analysers at the transmitter, and a
phonological synthesizer at the receiver, both realised as deep NNs, and a
spiking NN as an incremental and robust encoder of syllable boundaries for
coding of continuous fundamental frequency (F0). A combination of phonological
features defines much more sound patterns than phonetic features defined by
HMM-based speech coders, and the finer analysis/synthesis code contributes into
smoother encoded speech. Listeners significantly prefer the NN-based approach
due to fewer discontinuities and speech artefacts of the encoded speech. A
single forward pass is required during the speech encoding and decoding. The
proposed VLBR speech coding operates at a bit rate of approximately 360 bits/s.

 <dc:description>  Thanks to the efforts of the robotics and autonomous systems community,
robots are becoming ever more capable. There is also an increasing demand from
end-users for autonomous service robots that can operate in real environments
for extended periods. In the STRANDS project we are tackling this demand
head-on by integrating state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and robotics
research into mobile service robots, and deploying these systems for long-term
installations in security and care environments. Over four deployments, our
robots have been operational for a combined duration of 104 days autonomously
performing end-user defined tasks, covering 116km in the process. In this
article we describe the approach we have used to enable long-term autonomous
operation in everyday environments, and how our robots are able to use their
long run times to improve their own performance.

structures; a characterisation of those pre-strategies (deemed strategies)
which are preserved by composition with a copycat strategy; and the
construction of a bicategory of these strategies. Furthermore, we prove that
the corresponding category has a compact closed structure, and hence forms the
basis for the semantics of concurrent higher-order computation.

 <dc:title>Unsupervised Image Segmentation using the Deffuant-Weisbuch Model from
  Social Dynamics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kayal, Subhradeep</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Unsupervised image segmentation algorithms aim at identifying disjoint
homogeneous regions in an image, and have been subject to considerable
attention in the machine vision community. In this paper, a popular theoretical
model with it's origins in statistical physics and social dynamics, known as
the Deffuant-Weisbuch model, is applied to the image segmentation problem. The
Deffuant-Weisbuch model has been found to be useful in modelling the evolution
of a closed system of interacting agents characterised by their opinions or
beliefs, leading to the formation of clusters of agents who share a similar
opinion or belief at steady state. In the context of image segmentation, this
paper considers a pixel as an agent and it's colour property as it's opinion,
with opinion updates as per the Deffuant-Weisbuch model. Apart from applying
the basic model to image segmentation, this paper incorporates adjacency and
neighbourhood information in the model, which factors in the local similarity
and smoothness properties of images. Convergence is reached when the number of
unique pixel opinions, i.e., the number of colour centres, matches the
pre-specified number of clusters. Experiments are performed on a set of images
from the Berkeley Image Segmentation Dataset and the results are analysed both
qualitatively and quantitatively, which indicate that this simple and intuitive
method is promising for image segmentation. To the best of the knowledge of the
author, this is the first work where a theoretical model from statistical
physics and social dynamics has been successfully applied to image processing.

 <dc:description>  In multiagent systems, we often have a set of agents each of which have a
preference ordering over a set of items and one would like to know these
preference orderings for various tasks, for example, data analysis, preference
aggregation, voting etc. However, we often have a large number of items which
makes it impractical to ask the agents for their complete preference ordering.
In such scenarios, we usually elicit these agents' preferences by asking (a
hopefully small number of) comparison queries --- asking an agent to compare
two items. Prior works on preference elicitation focus on unrestricted domain
and the domain of single peaked preferences and show that the preferences in
single peaked domain can be elicited by much less number of queries compared to
unrestricted domain. We extend this line of research and study preference
elicitation for single peaked preferences on trees which is a strict superset
of the domain of single peaked preferences. We show that the query complexity
crucially depends on the number of leaves, the path cover number, and the
distance from path of the underlying single peaked tree, whereas the other
natural parameters like maximum degree, diameter, pathwidth do not play any
direct role in determining query complexity. We then investigate the query
complexity for finding a weak Condorcet winner for preferences single peaked on
a tree and show that this task has much less query complexity than preference
elicitation. Here again we observe that the number of leaves in the underlying
single peaked tree and the path cover number of the tree influence the query
complexity of the problem.

 <dc:title>A Generalized Erasure Channel in the Sense of Polarization for Binary
  Erasure Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The polar transformation of a binary erasure channel (BEC) can be exactly
approximated by other BECs. Ar{\i}kan proposed that polar codes for a BEC can
be efficiently constructed by using its useful property. This study proposes a
new class of arbitrary input generalized erasure channels, which can be exactly
approximated the polar transformation by other same channel models, as with the
BEC. One of the main results is the recursive formulas of the polar
transformation of the proposed channel. In the study, we evaluate the polar
transformation by using the $\alpha$-mutual information. Particularly, when the
input alphabet size is a prime power, we examines the following: (i)
inequalities for the average of the $\alpha$-mutual information of the proposed
channel after the one-step polar transformation, and (ii) the exact proportion
of polarizations of the $\alpha$-mutual information of proposed channels in
infinite number of polar transformations.

 <dc:title>Stabilizing Transmission Intervals for Nonlinear Delayed Networked
  Control Systems [Extended Version]</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tolic, Domagoj</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hirche, Sandra</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article, we consider a nonlinear process with delayed dynamics to be
controlled over a communication network in the presence of disturbances and
study robustness of the resulting closed-loop system with respect to
network-induced phenomena such as sampled, distorted, delayed and lossy data as
well as scheduling protocols. For given plant-controller dynamics and
communication network properties (e.g., propagation delays and scheduling
protocols), we quantify the control performance level (in terms of Lp-gains) as
the transmission interval varies. Maximally Allowable Transfer Interval (MATI)
labels the greatest transmission interval for which a prescribed Lp-gain is
attained. The proposed methodology combines impulsive delayed system modeling
with Lyapunov-Razumikhin techniques to allow for MATIs that are smaller than
the communication delays. Other salient features of our methodology are the
consideration of variable delays, corrupted data and employment of model-based
estimators to prolong MATIs. The present stability results are provided for the
class of Uniformly Globally Exponentially Stable (UGES) scheduling protocols.
The well-known Round Robin (RR) and Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocols are
examples of UGES protocols. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to
demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.

 <dc:title>Alternating direction algorithms for $\ell_0$ regularization in
  compressed sensing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Song, Chaobing</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Xia, Shu-Tao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose three iterative greedy algorithms for compressed
sensing, called \emph{iterative alternating direction} (IAD), \emph{normalized
iterative alternating direction} (NIAD) and \emph{alternating direction
pursuit} (ADP), which stem from the iteration steps of alternating direction
method of multiplier (ADMM) for $\ell_0$-regularized least squares
($\ell_0$-LS) and can be considered as the alternating direction versions of
the well-known iterative hard thresholding (IHT), normalized iterative hard
thresholding (NIHT) and hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) respectively. Firstly,
relative to the general iteration steps of ADMM, the proposed algorithms have
no splitting or dual variables in iterations and thus the dependence of the
current approximation on past iterations is direct. Secondly, provable
theoretical guarantees are provided in terms of restricted isometry property,
which is the first theoretical guarantee of ADMM for $\ell_0$-LS to the best of
our knowledge. Finally, they outperform the corresponding IHT, NIHT and HTP
greatly when reconstructing both constant amplitude signals with random signs
(CARS signals) and Gaussian signals.

 <dc:description>  A boundary value problem for a fractional power $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$ of the
second-order elliptic operator is considered. The boundary value problem is
singularly perturbed when $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. It is solved numerically
using a time-dependent problem for a pseudo-parabolic equation. For the
auxiliary Cauchy problem, the standard two-level schemes with weights are
applied. The numerical results are presented for a model two-dimen\-sional
boundary value problem with a fractional power of an elliptic operator. Our
work focuses on the solution of the boundary value problem with $0 &lt;
\varepsilon \ll 1$.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel artificial neural network architecture that integrates
robustness to adversarial input in the network structure. The main idea of our
approach is to force the network to make predictions on what the given instance
of the class under consideration would look like and subsequently test those
predictions. By forcing the network to redraw the relevant parts of the image
and subsequently comparing this new image to the original, we are having the
network give a &quot;proof&quot; of the presence of the object.

 <dc:description>  As an automatic method of determining model complexity using the training
data alone, Bayesian linear regression provides us a principled way to select
hyperparameters. But one often needs approximation inference if distribution
assumption is beyond Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose a
Bayesian linear regression model with Student-t assumptions (BLRS), which can
be inferred exactly. In this framework, both conjugate prior and expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm are generalized. Meanwhile, we prove that the
maximum likelihood solution is equivalent to the standard Bayesian linear
regression with Gaussian assumptions (BLRG). The $q$-EM algorithm for BLRS is
nearly identical to the EM algorithm for BLRG. It is showed that $q$-EM for
BLRS can converge faster than EM for BLRG for the task of predicting online
news popularity.

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic timed automata are a suitable formalism to model systems with
real-time, nondeterministic and probabilistic behaviour. We study two-player
zero-sum games on such automata where the objective of the game is specified as
the expected time to reach a target. The two players---called player Min and
player Max---compete by proposing timed moves simultaneously and the move with
a shorter delay is performed. The first player attempts to minimise the given
objective while the second tries to maximise the objective. We observe that
these games are not determined, and study decision problems related to
computing the upper and lower values, showing that the problems are decidable
and lie in the complexity class NEXPTIME $\cap$ co-NEXPTIME.

 <dc:description>  Coefficient inverse problems related to identifying the right-hand side of an
equation with use of additional information is of interest among inverse
problems for partial differential equations. When considering non-stationary
problems, tasks of recovering the dependence of the right-hand side on time and
spatial variables can be treated as independent. These tasks relate to a class
of linear inverse problems, which sufficiently simplifies their study. This
work is devoted to a finding the dependence of right-hand side of
multidimensional parabolic equation on spatial variables using additional
observations of the solution at the final point of time - the final
overdetermination. More general problems are associated with some integral
observation of the solution on time - the integral overdetermination. The first
method of numerical solution of inverse problems is based on iterative solution
of boundary value problem for time derivative with non-local acceleration. The
second method is based on the known approach with iterative refinement of
desired dependence of the right-hand side on spacial variables. Capabilities of
proposed methods are illustrated by numerical examples for model
two-dimensional problem of identifying the right-hand side of a parabolic
equation. The standard finite-element approximation on space is used, the time
discretization is based on fully implicit two-level schemes.

 <dc:title>Delta divergence: A novel decision cognizant measure of classifier

 <dc:description>  Disagreement between two classifiers regarding the class membership of an
observation in pattern recognition can be indicative of an anomaly and its
nuance. As in general classifiers base their decision on class aposteriori
probabilities, the most natural approach to detecting classifier incongruence
is to use divergence. However, existing divergences are not particularly
suitable to gauge classifier incongruence. In this paper, we postulate the
properties that a divergence measure should satisfy and propose a novel
divergence measure, referred to as Delta divergence. In contrast to existing
measures, it is decision cognizant. The focus in Delta divergence on the
dominant hypotheses has a clutter reducing property, the significance of which
grows with increasing number of classes. The proposed measure satisfies other
important properties such as symmetry, and independence of classifier
confidence. The relationship of the proposed divergence to some baseline
measures is demonstrated experimentally, showing its superiority.

 <dc:description>  FinFET technology is prone to suffer from Line Edge Roughness (LER) based VT
variation with scaling. To address this, we proposed an Epitaxially Defined
(ED) FinFET (EDFinFET) as an alternate to FinFET architecture for 10 nm node
and beyond. We showed by statistical simulations that EDFinFET reduces LER
based VT variability by 90% and overall variability by 59%. However, EDFinFET
consists of wider fins as the fin widths are not constrained by electrostatics
and variability (cf. FinFETs have fin width ~ LG/3 where LG is gate-length).
This indicates that EDFinFET based circuits may be less dense. In this study we
show that wide fins enable taller fin heights. The ability to engineer multiple
STI levels on tall fins enables different transistor widths (i.e. various W/Ls
e.g. 1-10) in a single fin. This capability ensures that even though individual
EDFinFET devices have ~2x larger footprints than FinFETs, EDFinFET may produce
equal or higher circuit density for basic building blocks like inverters or
NAND gates for W/Ls of 2 and higher.

 <dc:description>  In this article we develop a three dimensional (3D) analytical model of
wireless networks. We establish an analytical expression of the SINR (Signal to
Interference plus Noise Ratio) of user equipments (UE), by using a 3D fluid
model approach of the network. This model enables to evaluate in a simple way
the cumulative distribution function of the SINR, and therefore the
performance, the quality of service and the coverage of wireless networks, with
a high accuracy. The use of this 3D wireless network model, instead of a
standard two-dimensional one, in order to analyze wireless networks, is
particularly interesting. Indeed, this 3D model enables to establish more
accurate performance and quality of services results than a 2D one.

 <dc:description>  Traffic inspection is a fundamental building block of many security solutions
today. For example, to prevent the leakage or exfiltration of confidential
insider information, as well as to block malicious traffic from entering the
network, most enterprises today operate intrusion detection and prevention
systems that inspect traffic. However, the state-of-the-art inspection systems
do not reflect well the interests of the different involved autonomous roles.
For example, employees in an enterprise, or a company outsourcing its network
management to a specialized third party, may require that their traffic remains
confidential, even from the system administrator. Moreover, the rules used by
the intrusion detection system, or more generally the configuration of an
online or offline anomaly detection engine, may be provided by a third party,
e.g., a security research firm, and can hence constitute a critical business
asset which should be kept confidential. Today, it is often believed that
accounting for these additional requirements is impossible, as they contradict
efficiency and effectiveness. We in this paper explore a novel approach, called
Privacy Preserving Inspection (PRI), which provides a solution to this problem,
by preserving privacy of traffic inspection and confidentiality of inspection
rules and configurations, and e.g., also supports the flexible installation of
additional Data Leak Prevention (DLP) rules specific to the company.

 <dc:description>  Contacts between individuals play an important role in determining how
infectious diseases spread. Various methods to gather data on such contacts
co-exist, from surveys to wearable sensors. Comparisons of data obtained by
different methods in the same context are however scarce, in particular with
respect to their use in data-driven models of spreading processes. Here, we use
a combined data set describing contacts registered by sensors and friendship
relations in the same population to address this issue in a case study. We
investigate if the use of the friendship network is equivalent to a sampling
procedure performed on the sensor contact network with respect to the outcome
of simulations of spreading processes: such an equivalence might indeed give
hints on ways to compensate for the incompleteness of contact data deduced from
surveys. We show that this is indeed the case for these data, for a
specifically designed sampling procedure, in which respondents report their
neighbors with a probability depending on their contact time. We study the
impact of this specific sampling procedure on several data sets, discuss
limitations of our approach and its possible applications in the use of data
sets of various origins in data-driven simulations of epidemic processes.

 <dc:description>  MapReduce is a popular parallel computing paradigm for Big Data processing in
clusters and data centers. It is observed that different job execution orders
and MapReduce slot configurations for a MapReduce workload have significantly
different performance with regarding to the makespan, total completion time,
system utilization and other performance metrics. There are quite a few
algorithms on minimizing makespan of multiple MapReduce jobs. However, these
algorithms are heuristic or suboptimal. The best known algorithm for minimizing
the makespan is 3-approximation by applying Johnson rule. In this paper, we
propose an approach called UAAS algorithm to meet the conditions of classical
Johnson model. Then we can still use Johnson model for an optimal solution. We
explain how to adapt to Johnson model and provide a few key features of our
proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Fisher vector (FV) has become a popular image representation. One notable
underlying assumption of the FV framework is that local descriptors are well
decorrelated within each cluster so that the covariance matrix for each
Gaussian can be simplified to be diagonal. Though the FV usually relies on the
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decorrelate local features, the PCA is
applied to the entire training data and hence it only diagonalizes the
\textit{universal} covariance matrix, rather than those w.r.t. the local
components. As a result, the local decorrelation assumption is usually not
supported in practice.
  To relax this assumption, this paper proposes a completed model of the Fisher
vector, which is termed as the Completed Fisher vector (CFV). The CFV is a more
general framework of the FV, since it encodes not only the variances but also
the correlations of the whitened local descriptors. The CFV thus leads to
improved discriminative power. We take the task of material categorization as
an example and experimentally show that: 1) the CFV outperforms the FV under
all parameter settings; 2) the CFV is robust to the changes in the number of
components in the mixture; 3) even with a relatively small visual vocabulary
the CFV still works well on two challenging datasets.

 <dc:description>  Bogopolski, Martino and Ventura in [BMV10] introduced a general criteria to
construct groups extensions with unsolvable conjugacy problem using short exact
sequences. We prove that such extensions have always solvable word problem.
This makes the proposed construction a systematic way to obtain finitely
presented groups with solvable word problem and unsolvable conjugacy problem.
It is believed that such groups are important in cryptography. For this, and as
an example, we provide an explicit construction of an extension of Thompson
group F and we propose it as a base for a public key cryptography protocol.

 <dc:description>  In virtualized data centers, consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) on
minimizing the number of total physical machines (PMs) has been recognized as a
very efficient approach. This paper considers the energy-efficient
consolidation of VMs in a Cloud Data center. Concentrating on CPU-intensive
applications, the objective is to schedule all requests non-preemptively,
subjecting to constraints of PM capacities and running time interval spans,
such that the total energy consumption of all PMs is minimized (called MinTE
for abbreviation). The MinTE problem is NP-complete in general. We propose a
self-adaptive approached called SAVE. The approach makes decisions of the
assignment and migration of VMs by probabilistic processes and is based
exclusively on local information, therefore it is very simple to implement.
Both simulation and real environment test show that our proposed method SAVE
can reduce energy consumption about 30% against VMWare DRS and 10-20% against
EcoCloud on average.

 <dc:title>One-dimensional phase retrieval with additional interference

 <dc:creator>Beinert, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The one-dimensional phase retrieval problem consists in the recovery of a
complex-valued signal from its Fourier intensity. Due to the well-known
ambiguousness of this problem, the determination of the original signal within
the extensive solution set is challenging and can only be done under suitable a
priori assumption or additional information about the unknown signal. Depending
on the application, one has sometimes access to further interference
measurements between the unknown signal and a reference signal. Beginning with
the reconstruction in the discrete-time setting, we show that each signal can
be uniquely recovered from its Fourier intensity and two further interference
measurements between the unknown signal and a modulation of the signal itself.
Afterwards, we consider the continuous-time problem, where we obtain an
equivalent result. Moreover, the unique recovery of a continuous-time signal
can also be ensured by using interference measurements with a known or an
unknown reference which is unrelated to the unknown signal.

 <dc:description>  Analyzing signals arising from dynamical systems typically requires many
modeling assumptions and parameter estimation. In high dimensions, this
modeling is particularly difficult due to the &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot;. In
this paper, we propose a method for building an intrinsic representation of
such signals in a purely data-driven manner. First, we apply a manifold
learning technique, diffusion maps, to learn the intrinsic model of the latent
variables of the dynamical system, solely from the measurements. Second, we use
concepts and tools from control theory and build a linear contracting observer
to estimate the latent variables in a sequential manner from new incoming
measurements. The effectiveness of the presented framework is demonstrated by
applying it to a toy problem and to a music analysis application. In these
examples we show that our method reveals the intrinsic variables of the
analyzed dynamical systems.

 <dc:description>  Considering the ambiguousness of the discrete-time phase retrieval problem to
recover a signal from its Fourier intensities, one can ask the question: what
additional information about the unknown signal do we need to select the
correct solution within the large solution set? Based on a characterization of
the occurring ambiguities, we investigate different a priori conditions in
order to reduce the number of ambiguities or even to receive a unique solution.
Particularly, if we have access to additional magnitudes of the unknown signal
in the time domain, we can show that almost all signals with finite support can
be uniquely recovered. Moreover, we prove that an analogous result can be
obtained by exploiting additional phase information.

 <dc:description>  Typical human actions last several seconds and exhibit characteristic
spatio-temporal structure. Recent methods attempt to capture this structure and
learn action representations with convolutional neural networks. Such
representations, however, are typically learned at the level of a few video
frames failing to model actions at their full temporal extent. In this work we
learn video representations using neural networks with long-term temporal
convolutions (LTC). We demonstrate that LTC-CNN models with increased temporal
extents improve the accuracy of action recognition. We also study the impact of
different low-level representations, such as raw values of video pixels and
optical flow vector fields and demonstrate the importance of high-quality
optical flow estimation for learning accurate action models. We report
state-of-the-art results on two challenging benchmarks for human action
recognition UCF101 (92.7%) and HMDB51 (67.2%).

 <dc:description>  Free content and services on the Web are often supported by ads. However,
with the proliferation of intrusive and privacy-invasive ads, a significant
proportion of users have started to use ad blockers. As existing ad blockers
are radical (they block all ads) and are not designed taking into account their
economic impact, ad-based economic model of the Web is in danger today. In this
paper, we target privacy-sensitive users and provide them with fine-grained
control over tracking. Our working assumption is that some categories of web
pages (for example, related to health, religion, etc.) are more
privacy-sensitive to users than others (education, science, etc.). Therefore,
our proposed approach consists in providing users with an option to specify the
categories of web pages that are privacy-sensitive to them and block trackers
present on such web pages only. As tracking is prevented by blocking network
connections of third-party domains, we avoid not only tracking but also
third-party ads. Since users will continue receiving ads on web pages belonging
to non-sensitive categories, our approach essentially provides a trade-off
between privacy and economy. To test the viability of our solution, we
implemented it as a Google Chrome extension, named MyTrackingChoices (available
on Chrome Web Store). Our real-world experiments with MyTrackingChoices show
that the economic impact of ad blocking exerted by privacy-sensitive users can
be significantly reduced.

 <dc:title>Do the Contemporary Cubature and Unscented Kalman Filtering Methods

 <dc:description>  This brief technical note elaborates three well-known state estimators, which
are used extensively in practice. These are the rather old-fashioned extended
Kalman filter (EKF) and the recently-designed cubature Kalman filtering (CKF)
and unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) algorithms. Nowadays, it is commonly
accepted that the contemporary techniques outperform always the traditional EKF
in the accuracy of state estimation because of the higher-order approximation
of the mean of propagated Gaussian density in the time- and measurement-update
steps of the listed filters. However, the present paper specifies this commonly
accepted opinion and shows that despite the mentioned theoretical fact the EKF
may outperform the CKF and UKF methods in the accuracy of state estimation when
the stochastic system under consideration exposes a stiff behavior. That is why
stiff stochastic models are difficult to deal with and require effective state
estimation techniques to be designed yet.

 <dc:description>  Statistical machine learning plays an important role in modern statistics and
computer science. One main goal of statistical machine learning is to provide
universally consistent algorithms, i.e., the estimator converges in probability
or in some stronger sense to the Bayes risk or to the Bayes decision function.
Kernel methods based on minimizing the regularized risk over a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) belong to these statistical machine learning
methods. It is in general unknown which kernel yields optimal results for a
particular data set or for the unknown probability measure. Hence various
kernel learning methods were proposed to choose the kernel and therefore also
its RKHS in a data adaptive manner. Nevertheless, many practitioners often use
the classical Gaussian RBF kernel or certain Sobolev kernels with good success.
The goal of this short note is to offer one possible theoretical explanation
for this empirical fact.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the first framework for integrating procedural knowledge,

as step-by-step instructions, is largely unstructured and isolated from other
sources of online knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we propose
extending to procedural knowledge the benefits that Linked Data has already
brought to representing, retrieving and reusing declarative knowledge. We
describe a framework for representing generic know-how as Linked Data and for
automatically acquiring this representation from existing resources on the Web.
This system also allows the automatic generation of links between different
know-how resources, and between those resources and other online knowledge
bases, such as DBpedia. We discuss the results of applying this framework to a
real-world scenario and we show how it outperforms existing manual
community-driven integration efforts.

 <dc:description>  Kinect skeleton tracker is able to achieve considerable human body tracking
performance in convenient and a low-cost manner. However, The tracker often
captures unnatural human poses such as discontinuous and vibrated motions when
self-occlusions occur. A majority of approaches tackle this problem by using
multiple Kinect sensors in a workspace. Combination of the measurements from
different sensors is then conducted in Kalman filter framework or optimization
problem is formulated for sensor fusion. However, these methods usually require
heuristics to measure reliability of measurements observed from each Kinect
sensor. In this paper, we developed a method to improve Kinect skeleton using
single Kinect sensor, in which supervised learning technique was employed to
correct unnatural tracking motions. Specifically, deep recurrent neural
networks were used for improving joint positions and velocities of Kinect
skeleton, and three methods were proposed to integrate the refined positions
and velocities for further enhancement. Moreover, we suggested a novel measure
to evaluate naturalness of captured motions. We evaluated the proposed approach
by comparison with the ground truth obtained using a commercial optical
maker-based motion capture system.

 <dc:description>  Motivation: Structural heterogeneity in single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) data represents a major challenge for high-resolution
structure determination. Unsupervised classification may serve as the first
step in the assessment of structural heterogeneity. Traditional algorithms for
unsupervised classification, such as K-means clustering and maximum likelihood
optimization, may classify images into wrong classes with decreasing
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the image data, yet demand increased cost in
computation. Overcoming these limitations requires further development on
clustering algorithms for high-performance cryo-EM data analysis. Results: Here
we introduce a statistical manifold learning algorithm for unsupervised
single-particle deep clustering. We show that statistical manifold learning
improves classification accuracy by about 40% in the absence of input
references for lower SNR data. Applications to several experimental datasets
suggest that our deep clustering approach can detect subtle structural
difference among classes. Through code optimization over the Intel
high-performance computing (HPC) processors, our software implementation can
generate thousands of reference-free class averages within several hours from
hundreds of thousands of single-particle cryo-EM images, which allows
significant improvement in ab initio 3D reconstruction resolution and quality.
Our approach has been successfully applied in several structural determination
projects. We expect that it provides a powerful computational tool in analyzing
highly heterogeneous structural data and assisting in computational
purification of single-particle datasets for high-resolution reconstruction.

 <dc:description>  Earlier techniques of text mining included algorithms like k-means, Naive
Bayes, SVM which classify and cluster the text document for mining relevant
information about the documents. The need for improving the mining techniques
has us searching for techniques using the available algorithms. This paper
proposes one technique which uses the auxiliary information that is present
inside the text documents to improve the mining. This auxiliary information can
be a description to the content. This information can be either useful or
completely useless for mining. The user should assess the worth of the
auxiliary information before considering this technique for text mining. In
this paper, a combination of classical clustering algorithms is used to mine
the datasets. The algorithm runs in two stages which carry out mining at
different levels of abstraction. The clustered documents would then be
classified based on the necessary groups. The proposed technique is aimed at
improved results of document clustering.

 <dc:description>  Teaching machines to accomplish tasks by conversing naturally with humans is
challenging. Currently, developing task-oriented dialogue systems requires
creating multiple components and typically this involves either a large amount
of handcrafting, or acquiring costly labelled datasets to solve a statistical
learning problem for each component. In this work we introduce a neural
network-based text-in, text-out end-to-end trainable goal-oriented dialogue
system along with a new way of collecting dialogue data based on a novel
pipe-lined Wizard-of-Oz framework. This approach allows us to develop dialogue
systems easily and without making too many assumptions about the task at hand.
The results show that the model can converse with human subjects naturally
whilst helping them to accomplish tasks in a restaurant search domain.

 <dc:description>  We consider wireless backhauling for a scenario where two small-cell base
stations (SC-BSs) employ the same time and frequency resources for offloading
their data to a common macro-cell base station (MC-BS). The two SC-BSs allocate
a part of the shared resource to exchange data in order to be able to cooperate
to boost the backhaul capacity. For this scenario, we develop the optimal
transmission strategy which, based on the channel state information, determines
whether the SC-BSs should exchange data and cooperate or transmit their data
independently to the MC-BS. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed cooperative~wireless backhauling protocol compared to existing
protocols in the literature.

 <dc:description>  This is the first work investigating community structure and interaction

four forums of different size, language, and topic. Quote usage, which is
surprisingly consistent over time and users, appears to have an important role
in aiding intra-thread navigation, and uncovers a hidden &quot;social&quot; structure in
communities otherwise lacking all trappings (from friends and followers to
reputations) of today's social networks.

 <dc:description>  While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a great success in
single-label image classification, it is important to note that real world
images generally contain multiple labels, which could correspond to different
objects, scenes, actions and attributes in an image. Traditional approaches to
multi-label image classification learn independent classifiers for each
category and employ ranking or thresholding on the classification results.
These techniques, although working well, fail to explicitly exploit the label
dependencies in an image. In this paper, we utilize recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) to address this problem. Combined with CNNs, the proposed CNN-RNN
framework learns a joint image-label embedding to characterize the semantic
label dependency as well as the image-label relevance, and it can be trained
end-to-end from scratch to integrate both information in a unified framework.
Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed
architecture achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-label
classification model

 <dc:description>  Perceiving meaningful activities in a long video sequence is a challenging
problem due to ambiguous definition of 'meaningfulness' as well as clutters in
the scene. We approach this problem by learning a generative model for regular
motion patterns, termed as regularity, using multiple sources with very limited
supervision. Specifically, we propose two methods that are built upon the
autoencoders for their ability to work with little to no supervision. We first
leverage the conventional handcrafted spatio-temporal local features and learn
a fully connected autoencoder on them. Second, we build a fully convolutional
feed-forward autoencoder to learn both the local features and the classifiers
as an end-to-end learning framework. Our model can capture the regularities
from multiple datasets. We evaluate our methods in both qualitative and
quantitative ways - showing the learned regularity of videos in various aspects
and demonstrating competitive performance on anomaly detection datasets as an
application.

 <dc:description>  We present a formalisation in Agda of the theory of concurrent transitions,
residuation, and causal equivalence of traces for the pi-calculus. Our
formalisation employs de Bruijn indices and dependently-typed syntax, and
aligns the &quot;proved transitions&quot; proposed by Boudol and Castellani in the
context of CCS with the proof terms naturally present in Agda's representation
of the labelled transition relation. Our main contributions are proofs of the
&quot;diamond lemma&quot; for the residuals of concurrent transitions and a formal
definition of equivalence of traces up to permutation of transitions.
  In the pi-calculus transitions represent propagating binders whenever their
actions involve bound names. To accommodate these cases, we require a more
general diamond lemma where the target states of equivalent traces are no
longer identical, but are related by a braiding that rewires the bound and free
names to reflect the particular interleaving of events involving binders. Our
approach may be useful for modelling concurrency in other languages where
transitions carry metadata sensitive to particular interleavings, such as
dynamically allocated memory addresses.

 <dc:title>Competition Between Regulation-Providing and Fixed-Power Charging

 <dc:description>  This paper models a non-cooperative game between two EV charging stations.
One is a fixed-power charging station purchasing electricity from the grid at
wholesale price and reselling the energy to EV owners at a higher retail price;
the other is regulation-providing and varies the recharging power level of its
clients to provide regulation services to the grid, so its profit comes from
both EV owners (who buy energy) and the grid (which pays for regulation
services). Users are reluctant to charging power variations and prefer shorter
overall charging times, hence regulation-providing charging has to be cheaper
than fixed-power charging.
  We analyze the competition among those charging providers, and examine the
performance at the equilibrium in terms of user welfare, station revenue and
electricity prices. As expected, competing stations provide users with lower
charging prices than when both charging solutions are offered by a monopolistic
provider. Moreover, while competition benefits users, it also benefits the grid
in that the amount of regulation services increases significantly with respect
to the monopolistic case.

 <dc:description>  Due to the massive parallel computing capability and outstanding image and
signal processing performance, cellular neural network (CNN) is one promising
type of non-Boolean computing system that can outperform the traditional
digital logic computation and mitigate the physical scaling limit of the
conventional CMOS technology. The CNN was originally implemented by VLSI analog
technologies with operational amplifiers and operational transconductance
amplifiers as neurons and synapses, respectively, which are power and area
consuming. In this paper, we propose a hybrid structure to implement the CNN
with magnetic components and CMOS peripherals with a complete driving and
sensing circuitry. In addition, we propose a digitally programmable magnetic
synapse that can achieve both positive and negative values of the templates.
After rigorous performance analyses and comparisons, optimal energy is achieved
based on various design parameters, including the driving voltage and the CMOS
driving size. At a comparable footprint area and operation speed, a spintronic
CNN is projected to achieve more than one order of magnitude energy reduction
per operation compared to its CMOS counterpart.

 <dc:description>  We present some results on stabilization for reduced-order models (ROMs) of
partial differential equations. The stabilization is achieved using Lyapunov
theory to design a new closure model that is robust to parametric
uncertainties. The free parameters in the proposed ROM stabilization method are
optimized using a model-free multi-parametric extremum seeking (MES) algorithm.
The 3D Boussinesq equations provide a challenging numerical test-problem that
is used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  The analysis of adaptive carrier phase estimation is investigated in
long-haul high speed n-level phase shift keying (n-PSK) optical fiber
communication systems based on the one-tap normalized least-mean-square (LMS)
algorithm. The close-form expressions for the estimated carrier phase and the
bit-error-rate floor have been derived in the n-PSK coherent optical
transmission systems. The results show that the one-tap normalized LMS
algorithm performs pretty well in the carrier phase estimation, but will be
less effective with the increment of modulation levels, in the compensation of
both intrinsic laser phase noise and equalization enhanced phase noise.

 <dc:description>  Network objects are a simple and natural abstraction for distributed
object-oriented programming. Languages that support network objects, however,
often leave synchronization to the user, along with its associated pitfalls,
such as data races and the possibility of failure. In this paper, we present
D-SCOOP, a distributed programming model that allows for interference-free and
transaction-like reasoning on (potentially multiple) network objects, with
synchronization handled automatically, and network failures managed by a
compensation mechanism. We achieve this by leveraging the runtime semantics of
a multi-threaded object-oriented concurrency model, directly generalizing it
with a message-based protocol for efficiently coordinating remote objects. We
present our pathway to fusing these contrasting but complementary ideas, and
evaluate the performance overhead of the automatic synchronization in D-SCOOP,
finding that it comes close to---or outperforms---explicit locking-based
synchronization in Java RMI.

 <dc:description>  Modern cellular networks in traditional frequency bands are notoriously
interference-limited especially in urban areas, where base stations are
deployed in close proximity to one another. The latest releases of Long Term
Evolution (LTE) incorporate features for coordinating downlink transmissions as
an efficient means of managing interference. Recent field trial results and
theoretical studies of the performance of joint transmission (JT) coordinated
multi-point (CoMP) schemes revealed, however, that their gains are not as high
as initially expected, despite the large coordination overhead. These schemes
are known to be very sensitive to defects in synchronization or information
exchange between coordinating bases stations as well as uncoordinated
interference. In this article, we review recent advanced coordinated
beamforming (CB) schemes as alternatives, requiring less overhead than JT CoMP
while achieving good performance in realistic conditions. By stipulating that,
in certain LTE scenarios of increasing interest, uncoordinated interference
constitutes a major factor in the performance of CoMP techniques at large, we
hereby assess the resilience of the state-of-the-art CB to uncoordinated
interference. We also describe how these techniques can leverage the latest
specifications of current cellular networks, and how they may perform when we
consider standardized feedback and coordination. This allows us to identify
some key roadblocks and research directions to address as LTE evolves towards
the future of mobile communications.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an analytical comparison of active and passive receiver
models in diffusive molecular communication. In the active model, molecules are
absorbed when they collide with the receiver surface. In the passive model, the
receiver is a virtual boundary that does not affect molecule behavior. Two
approaches are presented to derive transforms between the receiver signals. As
an example, two models for an unbounded diffusion-only molecular communication
system with a spherical receiver are unified. As time increases in the
three-dimensional system, the transform functions have constant scaling
factors, such that the receiver models are effectively equivalent. Methods are
presented to enable the transformation of stochastic simulations, which are
used to verify the transforms and demonstrate that transforming the simulation
of a passive receiver can be more efficient and more accurate than the direct
simulation of an absorbing receiver.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present deterministic analysis of sufficient conditions for
sparse subspace clustering under missing data, when data is assumed to come
from a Union of Subspaces (UoS) model. In this context we consider two cases,
namely Case I when all the points are sampled at the same co-ordinates, and
Case II when points are sampled at different locations. We show that results
for Case I directly follow from several existing results in the literature,
while results for Case II are not as straightforward and we provide a set of
dual conditions under which, perfect clustering holds true. We provide
extensive set of simulation results for clustering as well as completion of
data under missing entries, under the UoS model. Our experimental results
indicate that in contrast to the full data case, accurate clustering does not
imply accurate subspace identification and completion, indicating the natural
order of relative hardness of these problems.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of answering queries about a sensitive dataset
subject to differential privacy. The queries may be chosen adversarially from a
larger set Q of allowable queries in one of three ways, which we list in order
from easiest to hardest to answer:
  Offline: The queries are chosen all at once and the differentially private
mechanism answers the queries in a single batch.
  Online: The queries are chosen all at once, but the mechanism only receives
the queries in a streaming fashion and must answer each query before seeing the
next query.
  Adaptive: The queries are chosen one at a time and the mechanism must answer
each query before the next query is chosen. In particular, each query may
depend on the answers given to previous queries.
  Many differentially private mechanisms are just as efficient in the adaptive
model as they are in the offline model. Meanwhile, most lower bounds for
differential privacy hold in the offline setting. This suggests that the three
models may be equivalent.
  We prove that these models are all, in fact, distinct. Specifically, we show
that there is a family of statistical queries such that exponentially more
queries from this family can be answered in the offline model than in the
online model. We also exhibit a family of search queries such that
exponentially more queries from this family can be answered in the online model
than in the adaptive model. We also investigate whether such separations might
hold for simple queries like threshold queries over the real line.

 <dc:title>SDN Partitioning: A Centralized Control Plane for Distributed Routing

 <dc:description>  Hybrid IP networks that use both control paradigms - distributed and
centralized - promise the best of two worlds: programmability and agility of
SDN, and reliability and fault tolerance of distributed routing protocols like
OSPF. The common approaches follow a division of labor concept, where SDN
controls prioritized traffic and OSPF assures care-free operation of best
effort traffic. We propose SDN Partitioning, which establishes centralized
control over the distributed routing protocol by partitioning the topology into
sub-domains with SDN-enabled border nodes, such that OSPF's routing updates
have to traverse SDN border nodes to reach neighboring sub-domains. This allows
the central controller to modify how sub-domains view one another, which in
turn allows to steer inter-sub-domain traffic. The degree of dynamic control
against simplicity of OSPF can be trade off by adjusting the size of the
sub-domains. This paper explains the technical requirements, presents a novel
scheme for balanced topology partitioning, and provides the models for common
network management tasks. Our performance evaluation shows that - already in
its minimum configuration with two sub-domains - SDN Partitioning provides
significant improvements in all respects compared to legacy routing protocols,
whereas smaller sub-domains provide network control capabilities comparable to
full SDN deployment.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic impact analysis is a fundamental technique for understanding the
impact of specific program entities, or changes to them, on the rest of the
program for concrete executions. However, existing techniques are either
inapplicable or of very limited utility for distributed programs running in
multiple concurrent processes. This paper presents DISTEA, a technique and tool
for dynamic impact analysis of distributed systems. By partially ordering
distributed method-execution events and inferring causality from the ordered
events, DISTEA can predict impacts propagated both within and across process
boundaries. We implemented DISTEA for Java and applied it to four distributed
programs of various types and sizes, including two enterprise systems. We also
evaluated the precision and practical usefulness of DISTEA, and demonstrated
its application in program comprehension, through two case studies. The results
show that DISTEA is highly scalable, more effective than existing alternatives,
and instrumental to understanding distributed systems and their executions.

 <dc:title>ModelWizard: Toward Interactive Model Construction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hutchison, Dylan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Data scientists engage in model construction to discover machine learning
models that well explain a dataset, in terms of predictiveness,
understandability and generalization across domains. Questions such as &quot;what if
we model common cause Z&quot; and &quot;what if Y's dependence on X reverses&quot; inspire
many candidate models to consider and compare, yet current tools emphasize
constructing a final model all at once.
  To more naturally reflect exploration when debating numerous models, we
propose an interactive model construction framework grounded in composable
operations. Primitive operations capture core steps refining data and model
that, when verified, form an inductive basis to prove model validity. Derived,
composite operations enable advanced model families, both generic and
specialized, abstracted away from low-level details.
  We prototype our envisioned framework in ModelWizard, a domain-specific
language embedded in F# to construct Tabular models. We enumerate language
design and demonstrate its use through several applications, emphasizing how
language may facilitate creation of complex models. To future engineers
designing data science languages and tools, we offer ModelWizard's design as a
new model construction paradigm, speeding discovery of our universe's
structure.

 <dc:description>  Cooperation in cellular networks has been recently suggested as a promising
scheme to improve system performance. In this work, clusters are formed based
on the Mutually Nearest Neighbour relation, which defines which stations
cooperate in pair and which do not. When node positions follow a Poisson Point
Process (PPP) the performance of the original clustering model can be
approximated by another one, formed by the superposition of two PPPs (one for
the singles and one for the pairs) equipped with adequate marks. This allows to
derive exact expressions for the network coverage probability under two
user-cluster association rules. Numerical evaluation shows coverage gains from
different signal cooperation schemes that can reach up to 15% compared to the
standard non-cooperative network coverage. The analysis is general and can be
applied to any type of cooperation or coordination between pairs of
transmitting nodes.

 <dc:description>  This research maps the knowledge translation process for two different types
of nanotechnologies applied to cancer: liposomes and metallic nanostructures
(MNs). We performed a structural analysis of citation networks and text mining
supported in controlled vocabularies. In the case of liposomes, our results
identify subnetworks (invisible colleges) associated with different therapeutic
strategies: nanopharmacology, hyperthermia, and gene therapy. Only in the
pharmacological strategy was an organized knowledge translation process
identified, which, however, is monopolized by the liposomal doxorubicins. In
the case of MNs, subnetworks are not differentiated by the type of therapeutic
strategy, and the content of the documents is still basic research. Research on
MNs is highly focused on developing a combination of molecular imaging and
photothermal therapy.

 <dc:title>Extracting Patterns of Urban Activity from Geotagged Social Data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Data generated on location-based social networks provide rich information on
the whereabouts of urban dwellers. Specifically, such data reveal who spends
time where, when, and on what type of activity (e.g., shopping at a mall, or
dining at a restaurant). That information can, in turn, be used to describe
city regions in terms of activity that takes place therein. For example, the
data might reveal that citizens visit one region mainly for shopping in the
morning, while another for dining in the evening. Furthermore, once such a
description is available, one can ask more elaborate questions: What are the
features that distinguish one region from another -- is it simply the type of
venues they host or is it the visitors they attract? What regions are similar
across cities?
  In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions using publicly shared
Foursquare data. In contrast with previous work, our method makes use of a
probabilistic model with minimal assumptions about the data and thus relieves
us from having to make arbitrary decisions in our analysis (e.g., regarding the
granularity of discovered regions or the importance of different features). We
perform an empirical comparison with previous work and discuss insights
obtained through our findings.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes a simple instance retrieval pipeline based on encoding the
convolutional features of CNN using the bag of words aggregation scheme (BoW).
Assigning each local array of activations in a convolutional layer to a visual
word produces an \textit{assignment map}, a compact representation that relates
regions of an image with a visual word. We use the assignment map for fast
spatial reranking, obtaining object localizations that are used for query
expansion. We demonstrate the suitability of the BoW representation based on
local CNN features for instance retrieval, achieving competitive performance on
the Oxford and Paris buildings benchmarks. We show that our proposed system for
CNN feature aggregation with BoW outperforms state-of-the-art techniques using
sum pooling at a subset of the challenging TRECVid INS benchmark.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Endpoint Object Conveyance Using a Large-Scale Actuator Network</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sinclair, Martin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Large-Scale Actuator Networks (LSAN) are a rapidly growing class of
electromechanical systems. A prime application of LSANs in the industrial
sector is distributed manipulation. LSAN's are typically implemented using:
vibrating plates, air jets, and mobile multi-robot teams. This paper
investigates a surface capable of morphing its shape using an array of linear
actuators to impose two dimensional translational movement on a set of objects.
The collective nature of the actuator network overcomes the limitations of the
single Degree of Freedom (DOF) manipulators, and forms a complex topography to
convey multiple objects to a reference location. A derivation of the kinematic
constraints and limitations of an arbitrary multi-cell surface is provided.
These limitations determine the allowable actuator alignments when configuring
the surface. A fusion of simulation and practical results demonstrate the
advantages of using this technology over static feeders.

 <dc:description>  The concept of &quot;task&quot; is at the core of artificial intelligence (AI): Tasks
are used for training and evaluating AI systems, which are built in order to
perform and automatize tasks we deem useful. In other fields of engineering
theoretical foundations allow thorough evaluation of designs by methodical
manipulation of well understood parameters with a known role and importance;
this allows an aeronautics engineer, for instance, to systematically assess the
effects of wind speed on an airplane's performance and stability. No framework
exists in AI that allows this kind of methodical manipulation: Performance
results on the few tasks in current use (cf. board games, question-answering)
cannot be easily compared, however similar or different. The issue is even more
acute with respect to artificial *general* intelligence systems, which must
handle unanticipated tasks whose specifics cannot be known beforehand. A *task
theory* would enable addressing tasks at the *class* level, bypassing their
specifics, providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks,
environments, and their parameters, resulting in more rigorous ways of
measuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior. Even modest
improvements in this direction would surpass the current ad-hoc nature of
machine learning and AI evaluation. Here we discuss the main elements of the
argument for a task theory and present an outline of what it might look like
for physical tasks.

 <dc:description>  Word2Vec is a widely used algorithm for extracting low-dimensional vector
representations of words. It generated considerable excitement in the machine
learning and natural language processing (NLP) communities recently due to its
exceptional performance in many NLP applications such as named entity
recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation and question answering.
State-of-the-art algorithms including those by Mikolov et al. have been
parallelized for multi-core CPU architectures but are based on vector-vector
operations that are memory-bandwidth intensive and do not efficiently use
computational resources. In this paper, we improve reuse of various data
structures in the algorithm through the use of minibatching, hence allowing us
to express the problem using matrix multiply operations. We also explore
different techniques to distribute word2vec computation across nodes in a
compute cluster, and demonstrate good strong scalability up to 32 nodes. In
combination, these techniques allow us to scale up the computation near
linearly across cores and nodes, and process hundreds of millions of words per
second, which is the fastest word2vec implementation to the best of our
knowledge.

 <dc:title>Capacitated Dominating Set on Planar Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Becker, Amariah</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Capacitated Domination generalizes the classic Dominating Set problem by
specifying for each vertex a required demand and an available capacity for
covering demand in its closed neighborhood. The objective is to find a
minimum-sized set of vertices that can cover all of the graph's demand without
exceeding any of the capacities. In this paper we look specifically at
domination with hard-capacities, where the capacity and cost of a vertex can
contribute to the solution at most once. Previous complexity results suggest
that this problem cannot be solved (or even closely approximated) efficiently
in general. In this paper we present a polynomial-time approximation scheme for
Capacitated Domination in unweighted planar graphs when the maximum capacity
and maximum demand are bounded. We also show how this result can be extended to
the closely-related Capacitated Vertex Cover problem.

 <dc:title>A Convex Cauchy-Schwarz DivergenceMeasure for Blind Source Separation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Albataineh, Zaid</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Salem, Fathi M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new class of divergence measures for Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) for the demixing of multiple source mixtures. We call it the
Convex Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence (CCS-DIV), and it is formed by integrating
convex functions into the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The new measure is
symmetric and the degree of its curvature with respect to the
joint-distribution can be tuned by a (convexity) parameter. The CCS-DIV is able
to speed-up the search process in the parameter space and produces improved
demixing performance. An algorithm, generated from the proposed divergence, is
developed which is employing the non-parametric Parzen window-based
distribution. Simulation evidence is presented to verify and quantify its
superior performance in comparison to state-of-the art approaches.

 <dc:description>  The unique identities of every mobile user (phone number,IMSI) and device
(IMEI) are far from secure and are increasingly vulnerable to a variety of
network-level threats. The exceedingly high reliance on the weak SIM
authentication layer does not present any notion of end-to-end security for
mobile users. We propose the design and implementation of Secure Mobile
Identities (SMI), a repetitive key-exchange protocol that uses this weak SIM
authentication as a foundation to enable mobile users to establish stronger
identity authenticity. The security guarantees of SMI are directly reliant on
the mobility of users and are further enhanced by external trusted entities
providing trusted location signatures (e.g. trusted GPS, NFC synchronization
points). In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of our protocol using an
implementation and analysis across standard mobility models.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the high dimensionality problem in blind source
separation (BSS), where the number of sources is greater than two. Two pairwise
iterative schemes are proposed to tackle this high dimensionality problem. The
two pairwise schemes realize nonparametric independent component analysis (ICA)
algorithms based on a new high-performance Convex CauchySchwarz Divergence

real-world high dimensional source applications. Finally, the performance
superiority of the proposed schemes is demonstrated in metric-comparison with
FastICA, RobustICA, convex ICA (CICA), and other leading existing algorithms.

 <dc:title>Evolutionary Projection Selection for Radon Barcodes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tizhoosh, Hamid R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rahnamayan, Shahryar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, Radon transformation has been used to generate barcodes for tagging
medical images. The under-sampled image is projected in certain directions, and
each projection is binarized using a local threshold. The concatenation of the
thresholded projections creates a barcode that can be used for tagging or
annotating medical images. A small number of equidistant projections, e.g., 4
or 8, is generally used to generate short barcodes. However, due to the diverse
nature of digital images, and since we are only working with a small number of
projections (to keep the barcode short), taking equidistant projections may not
be the best course of action. In this paper, we proposed to find $n$ optimal
projections, whereas $n\!&lt;\!180$, in order to increase the expressiveness of
Radon barcodes. We show examples for the exhaustive search for the simple case
when we attempt to find 4 best projections out of 16 equidistant projections
and compare it with the evolutionary approach in order to establish the benefit
of the latter when operating on a small population size as in the case of
micro-DE. We randomly selected 10 different classes from IRMA dataset (14,400
x-ray images in 58 classes) and further randomly selected 5 images per class
for our tests.

 <dc:title>Radon Features and Barcodes for Medical Image Retrieval via SVM</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhu, Shujin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For more than two decades, research has been performed on content-based image
retrieval (CBIR). By combining Radon projections and the support vector
machines (SVM), a content-based medical image retrieval method is presented in
this work. The proposed approach employs the normalized Radon projections with
corresponding image category labels to build an SVM classifier, and the Radon
barcode database which encodes every image in a binary format is also generated
simultaneously to tag all images. To retrieve similar images when a query image
is given, Radon projections and the barcode of the query image are generated.
Subsequently, the k-nearest neighbor search method is applied to find the
images with minimum Hamming distance of the Radon barcode within the same class
predicted by the trained SVM classifier that uses Radon features. The
performance of the proposed method is validated by using the IRMA 2009 dataset
with 14,410 x-ray images in 57 categories. The results demonstrate that our
method has the capacity to retrieve similar responses for the correctly
identified query image and even for those mistakenly classified by SVM. The
approach further is very fast and has low memory requirement.

 <dc:description>  Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) in large medical image archives is a
challenging and necessary task. Generally, different feature extraction methods
are used to assign expressive and invariant features to each image such that
the search for similar images comes down to feature classification and/or
matching. The present work introduces a new image retrieval method for medical
applications that employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with recently
introduced Radon barcodes. We combine neural codes for global classification
with Radon barcodes for the final retrieval. We also examine image search based
on regions of interest (ROI) matching after image retrieval. The IRMA dataset
with more than 14,000 x-rays images is used to evaluate the performance of our
method. Experimental results show that our approach is superior to many
published works.

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate that an attention-based encoder-decoder model can be used for
sentence-level grammatical error identification for the Automated Evaluation of
Scientific Writing (AESW) Shared Task 2016. The attention-based encoder-decoder
models can be used for the generation of corrections, in addition to error
identification, which is of interest for certain end-user applications. We show
that a character-based encoder-decoder model is particularly effective,
outperforming other results on the AESW Shared Task on its own, and showing
gains over a word-based counterpart. Our final model--a combination of three
character-based encoder-decoder models, one word-based encoder-decoder model,
and a sentence-level CNN--is the highest performing system on the AESW 2016
binary prediction Shared Task.

 <dc:title>Anatomy-Aware Measurement of Segmentation Accuracy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tizhoosh, Hamid R.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quantifying the accuracy of segmentation and manual delineation of organs,
tissue types and tumors in medical images is a necessary measurement that
suffers from multiple problems. One major shortcoming of all accuracy measures
is that they neglect the anatomical significance or relevance of different
zones within a given segment. Hence, existing accuracy metrics measure the
overlap of a given segment with a ground-truth without any anatomical
discrimination inside the segment. For instance, if we understand the rectal
wall or urethral sphincter as anatomical zones, then current accuracy measures
ignore their significance when they are applied to assess the quality of the
prostate gland segments. In this paper, we propose an anatomy-aware measurement
scheme for segmentation accuracy of medical images. The idea is to create a
``master gold'' based on a consensus shape containing not just the outline of
the segment but also the outlines of the internal zones if existent or
relevant. To apply this new approach to accuracy measurement, we introduce the
anatomy-aware extensions of both Dice coefficient and Jaccard index and
investigate their effect using 500 synthetic prostate ultrasound images with 20
different segments for each image. We show that through anatomy-sensitive
calculation of segmentation accuracy, namely by considering relevant anatomical
zones, not only the measurement of individual users can change but also the
ranking of users' segmentation skills may require reordering.

 <dc:description>  Molecular communication is an emerging paradigm for systems that rely on the
release of molecules as information carriers. Communication via molecular
diffusion is a popular strategy that is ubiquitous in nature and very fast over
distances on the order of a micron or less. Existing closed-form analysis of
the diffusion channel impulse response generally assumes that the transmitter
is a point source. In this paper, channel impulse responses are derived for
spherical transmitters with either a passive or absorbing receiver. The derived
channel impulse responses are in closed-form for a one-dimensional environment
and can be found via numerical integration for a three-dimensional environment.
The point transmitter assumption (PTA) is formally defined so that its accuracy
can be measured in comparison to the derived spherical transmitter impulse
responses. The spherical transmitter model is much more accurate than the PTA
when the distance between a transmitter and its receiver is small relative to
the size of the transmitter. The derived results are verified via microscopic
particle-based simulations using the molecular communication simulation
platform AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via Reaction-Diffusion). A spherical
transmitter variation where molecules are released from the surface of a solid
sphere is also considered via simulation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we specifically present a parallel solution to finding the
one-ring neighboring nodes and elements for each vertex in generic meshes. The
finding of nodal neighbors is computationally straightforward but expensive for
large meshes. To improve the efficiency, the parallelism is adopted by
utilizing the modern Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The presented parallel
solution is heavily dependent on the parallel sorting, scan, and reduction, and
can be applied to determine both the neighboring nodes and elements. To
evaluate the performance, the parallel solution is compared to the
corresponding serial solution. Experimental results show that: our parallel
solution can achieve the speedups of approximately 55 and 90 over the
corresponding serial solution for finding neighboring nodes and elements,
respectively. Our parallel solution is efficient and easy to implement, but
requires the allocation of large device memory.

 <dc:description>  In CNN-based object detection methods, region proposal becomes a bottleneck
when objects exhibit significant scale variation, occlusion or truncation. In
addition, these methods mainly focus on 2D object detection and cannot estimate
detailed properties of objects. In this paper, we propose subcategory-aware
CNNs for object detection. We introduce a novel region proposal network that
uses subcategory information to guide the proposal generating process, and a
new detection network for joint detection and subcategory classification. By
using subcategories related to object pose, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both detection and pose estimation on commonly used benchmarks.

 <dc:title>On the Complexity and Performance of Parsing with Derivatives</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Current algorithms for context-free parsing inflict a trade-off between ease
of understanding, ease of implementation, theoretical complexity, and practical
performance. No algorithm achieves all of these properties simultaneously.
  Might et al. (2011) introduced parsing with derivatives, which handles
arbitrary context-free grammars while being both easy to understand and simple
to implement. Despite much initial enthusiasm and a multitude of independent
implementations, its worst-case complexity has never been proven to be better
than exponential. In fact, high-level arguments claiming it is fundamentally
exponential have been advanced and even accepted as part of the folklore.
Performance ended up being sluggish in practice, and this sluggishness was
taken as informal evidence of exponentiality.
  In this paper, we reexamine the performance of parsing with derivatives. We
have discovered that it is not exponential but, in fact, cubic. Moreover,
simple (though perhaps not obvious) modifications to the implementation by
Might et al. (2011) lead to an implementation that is not only easy to
understand but also highly performant in practice.

 <dc:description>  Basic personality traits are typically assessed through questionnaires. Here
we consider phone-based metrics as a way to asses personality traits. We use
data from smartphones with custom data-collection software distributed to 730
individuals. The data includes information about location, physical motion,
face-to-face contacts, online social network friends, text messages and calls.
The data is further complemented by questionnaire-based data on basic
personality traits. From the phone-based metrics, we define a set of behavioral
variables, which we use in a prediction of basic personality traits. We find
that predominantly, the Big Five personality traits extraversion and, to some
degree, neuroticism are strongly expressed in our data. As an alternative to
the Big Five, we investigate whether other linear combinations of the 44
questions underlying the Big Five Inventory are more predictable. In a tertile
classification problem, basic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as
independent component analysis, increase the predictability relative to the
baseline from $11\%$ to $23\%$. Finally, from a supervised linear classifier,
we were able to further improve this predictability to $33\%$. In all cases,
the most predictable projections had an overweight of the questions related to
extraversion and neuroticism. In addition, our findings indicate that the score
system underlying the Big Five Inventory disregards a part of the information
available in the 44 questions.

 <dc:description>  Femtocell networks have become a promising solution in supporting high data
rates for 5G systems, where cell densification is performed using the small
femtocells. However, femtocell networks have many challenges. One of the major
challenges of femtocell networks is the interference management problem, where
deployment of femtocells in the range of macro-cells may degrade the
performance of the macrocell. In this paper, we develop a new platform for
studying interference management in distributed femtocell networks using
reinforcement learning approach. We design a complete MAC protocol to perform
distributed power allocation using Q-Learning algorithm, where both independent
and cooperative learning approaches are applied across network nodes. The
objective of the Q-Learning algorithms is to maximize aggregate femtocells
capacity, while maintaining the QoS for the Macrocell users. Furthermore, we
present the realization of the algorithms using GNURadio and USRP platforms.
Performance evaluation are conducted in terms of macrocell capacity convergence
to a target capacity and improvement of aggregate femtocells capacity.

 <dc:description>  Referenced Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) was recently introduced as a
method to analyze the historical roots of research fields and groups or
institutions. RPYS maps the distribution of the publication years of the cited
references in a document set. In this study, we apply this methodology to the
{\oe}uvre of an individual researcher on the occasion of a Festschrift for
Andr\'as Schubert's 70th birthday. We discuss the different options of RPYS in
relation to one another (e.g. Multi-RPYS), and in relation to the longer-term
research program of algorithmic historiography (e.g., HistCite) based on
Schubert's publications (n=172) and cited references therein as a bibliographic
domain in scientometrics. Main path analysis and Multi-RPYS of the citation
network are used to show the changes and continuities in Schubert's
intellectual career. Diachronic and static decomposition of a document set can
lead to different results, while the analytically distinguishable lines of
research may overlap and interact over time, and intermittent.

 <dc:description>  Scaling multinomial logistic regression to datasets with very large number of
data points and classes has not been trivial. This is primarily because one
needs to compute the log-partition function on every data point. This makes
distributing the computation hard. In this paper, we present a distributed
stochastic gradient descent based optimization method (DS-MLR) for scaling up
multinomial logistic regression problems to very large data. Our algorithm
exploits double-separability, an attractive property we observe in the
objective functions of several models in machine learning, that allows us to
achieve both data as well as model parallelism simultaneously. In addition to
being parallelizable, our algorithm can also easily be made asynchronous. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method empirically on several real-world
datasets, for instance a reddit dataset with data and parameter sizes of 200 GB
and 300 GB respectively.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we prove that the Max-Morse Matching Problem is approximable,
thus resolving an open problem posed by Joswig and Pfetsch. We describe two
different approximation algorithms for the Max-Morse Matching Problem. For
$D$-dimensional simplicial complexes, we obtain a
$\frac{(D+1)}{(D^2+D+1)}$-factor approximation ratio using a simple edge
reorientation algorithm that removes cycles. Our second result is an algorithm
that provides a $\frac{2}{D}$-factor approximation for simplicial manifolds by
processing the simplices in increasing order of dimension. One application of
these algorithms is towards efficient homology computation of simplicial
complexes. Experiments using a prototype implementation on several datasets
indicate that the algorithm computes near optimal results.

 <dc:description>  Similar to oil that acted as a basic raw material and key driving force of
industrial society, information acts as a raw material and principal mover of
knowledge society in the knowledge production, propagation and application. New
developments in information processing and information communication
technologies allow increasingly complex and accurate descriptions,
representations and models, which are often multi-parameter, multi-perspective,
multi-level and multidimensional. This leads to the necessity of collaborative
work between different domains with corresponding specialist competences,
sciences and research traditions. We present several major transdisciplinary
unification projects for information and knowledge, which proceed on the
descriptive, logical and the level of generative mechanisms. Parallel process
of boundary crossing and transdisciplinary activity is going on in the applied
domains. Technological artifacts are becoming increasingly complex and their
design is strongly user-centered, which brings in not only the function and
various technological qualities but also other aspects including esthetic, user
experience, ethics and sustainability with social and environmental dimensions.
When integrating knowledge from a variety of fields, with contributions from
different groups of stakeholders, numerous challenges are met in establishing
common view and common course of action. In this context, information is our
environment, and informational ecology determines both epistemology and spaces
for action. We present some insights into the current state of the art of
transdisciplinary theory and practice of information studies and informatics.
We depict different facets of transdisciplinarity as we see it from our
different research fields that include information studies, computability,
human-computer interaction, multi-operating-systems environments and
philosophy.

 <dc:description>  We are interested in supporting software evolution caused by changing
requirements and/or environmental settings. For example, users of a system may
require new functionality (changing requirements), or performance enhancements
to cope with growing user population. Specifically, we propose to use goal
models to capture such changes, and exploit reasoning techniques that derive
optimal new specifications for a system whose requirements and/or environment
have changed. Moreover, we are interested in discovering new classes of
evolution requirements, for example, that give preference to evolutions that
minimize implementation effort for the implementation of the evolution. To
address both of these problems, we exploit Constraint Goal Models (CGMs) an
expressive language for modelling goals that comes with scalable solvers that
can solve hybrid constraint and optimization problems using a combination of
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT)
solvers. We evaluate our proposal by modeling and reasoning with a goal model
for meeting scheduling.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, there is increasing interest in the development of teamwork skills
in the educational context. This growing interest is motivated by its
pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises
organize their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its
crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support
for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team
performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be
optimized. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a
gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure
generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin's role theory to facilitate the
generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves
current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the
feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of
a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty
with regard to each student's predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since
it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the
estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool
in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team
activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve
different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.

 <dc:description>  Business elites reconfigure their locus of organization over time, from the
city level, to the national level, and beyond. We ask what the current level of
elite organization is and propose a novel theoretical and empirical approach to
answer this question. Building on the universal distinction between local and
nonlocal ties we use network analysis and community detection to dissect the
global network of interlocking directorates among over five million firms. We
find that elite orientation is indeed changing from the national to the
transnational plane, but we register a considerable heterogeneity across
different regions in the world. In some regions the business communities are
organized along national borders, whereas in other areas the locus of
organization is at the city level or international level. London dominates the
global corporate elite network. Our findings underscore that the study of
corporate elites requires an approach that is sensitive to levels of
organization that go beyond the confines of nation states.

 <dc:description>  Many terminals are used in safety-critical operations in which humans,
through terminal user interfaces, become a part of the system control loop
(e.g., medical and industrial systems). These terminals are typically embedded,
single-purpose devices with restricted functionality, sometimes air-gapped and
increasingly hardened.
  We describe a new way of attacking such terminals in which an adversary has
only temporary, non-invasive, physical access to the terminal. In this attack,
the adversary attaches a small device to the interface that connects user input
peripherals to the terminal. The device executes the attack when the authorized
user is performing safety-critical operations, by modifying or blocking user
input, or injecting new input events.
  Given that the attacker has access to user input, the execution of this
attack might seem trivial. However, to succeed, the attacker needs to overcome
a number of challenges including the inability to directly observe the user
interface and avoid being detected by the users. We present techniques that
allow user interface state and input tracking. We evaluate these techniques and
show that they can be implemented efficiently. We further evaluate the
effectiveness of our attack through an online user study and find input
modification attacks that are hard for the users to detect and would therefore
lead to serious violations of the input integrity.

 <dc:description>  Automatic segmentation of objects from a single image is a challenging
problem which generally requires training on large number of images. We
consider the problem of automatically segmenting only the dynamic objects from
a given pair of images of a scene captured from different positions. We exploit
dense correspondences along with saliency measures in order to first localize
the interest points on the dynamic objects from the two images. We propose a
novel approach based on techniques from computational geometry in order to
automatically segment the dynamic objects from both the images using a top-down
segmentation strategy. We discuss how the proposed approach is unique in
novelty compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. We show
that the proposed approach for segmentation is efficient in handling large
motions and is able to achieve very good segmentation of the objects for
different scenes. We analyse the results with respect to the manually marked
ground truth segmentation masks created using our own dataset and provide key
observations in order to improve the work in future.

 <dc:description>  A negotiation team is a set of agents with common and possibly also
conflicting preferences that forms one of the parties of a negotiation. A
negotiation team is involved in two decision making processes simultaneously, a
negotiation with the opponents, and an intra-team process to decide on the
moves to make in the negotiation. This article focuses on negotiation team
decision making for circumstances that require unanimity of team decisions.
Existing agent-based approaches only guarantee unanimity in teams negotiating
in domains exclusively composed of predictable and compatible issues. This
article presents a model for negotiation teams that guarantees unanimous team
decisions in domains consisting of predictable and compatible, and also
unpredictable issues. Moreover, the article explores the influence of using
opponent, and team member models in the proposing strategies that team members
use. Experimental results show that the team benefits if team members employ
Bayesian learning to model their teammates' preferences.

 <dc:description>  An agent-based negotiation team is a group of interdependent agents that join
together as a single negotiation party due to their shared interests in the
negotiation at hand. The reasons to employ an agent-based negotiation team may
vary: (i) more computation and parallelization capabilities, (ii) unite agents
with different expertise and skills whose joint work makes it possible to
tackle complex negotiation domains, (iii) the necessity to represent different
stakeholders or different preferences in the same party (e.g., organizations,
countries, and married couple). The topic of agent-based negotiation teams has
been recently introduced in multi-agent research. Therefore, it is necessary to
identify good practices, challenges, and related research that may help in
advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based negotiation teams. For that
reason, in this article we review the tasks to be carried out by agent-based
negotiation teams. Each task is analyzed and related with current advances in
different research areas. The analysis aims to identify special challenges that
may arise due to the particularities of agent-based negotiation teams.

 <dc:description>  In this article, an agent-based negotiation model for negotiation teams that
negotiate a deal with an opponent is presented. Agent-based negotiation teams
are groups of agents that join together as a single negotiation party because
they share an interest that is related to the negotiation process. The model
relies on a trusted mediator that coordinates and helps team members in the
decisions that they have to take during the negotiation process: which offer is
sent to the opponent, and whether the offers received from the opponent are
accepted. The main strength of the proposed negotiation model is the fact that
it guarantees unanimity within team decisions since decisions report a utility
to team members that is greater than or equal to their aspiration levels at
each negotiation round. This work analyzes how unanimous decisions are taken
within the team and the robustness of the model against different types of
manipulations. An empirical evaluation is also performed to study the impact of
the different parameters of the model.

 <dc:description>  Inference algorithms in probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) can be
thought of as interpreters, since an inference algorithm traverses a model
given evidence to answer a query. As with interpreters, we can improve the
efficiency of inference algorithms by compiling them once the model, evidence
and query are known. We present SIMPL, a domain specific language for inference
algorithms, which uses this idea in order to automatically specialize annotated
inference algorithms. Due to the approach of specialization, unlike a
traditional compiler, with SIMPL new inference algorithms can be added easily,
and still be optimized using domain-specific information. We evaluate SIMPL and
show that partial evaluation gives a 2-6x speedup, caching provides an
additional 1-1.5x speedup, and generating C code yields an additional 13-20x
speedup, for an overall speedup of 30-150x for several inference algorithms and
models.

 <dc:description>  Ambient Intelligence aims to offer personalized services and easier ways of
interaction between people and systems. Since several users and systems may
coexist in these environments, it is quite possible that entities with opposing
preferences need to cooperate to reach their respective goals. Automated
negotiation is pointed as one of the mechanisms that may provide a solution to
this kind of problems. In this article, a multi-issue bilateral bargaining
model for Ambient Intelligence domains is presented where it is assumed that
agents have computational bounded resources and do not know their opponents'
preferences. The main goal of this work is to provide negotiation models that
obtain efficient agreements while maintaining the computational cost low. A
niching genetic algorithm is used before the negotiation process to sample
one's own utility function (self-sampling). During the negotiation process,
genetic operators are applied over the opponent's and one's own offers in order
to sample new offers that are interesting for both parties. Results show that
the proposed model is capable of outperforming similarity heuristics which only
sample before the negotiation process and of obtaining similar results to
similarity heuristics which have access to all of the possible offers.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, fundamental limits in sequencing of a set of closely related
DNA molecules are addressed. This problem is called pooled-DNA sequencing which
encompasses many interesting problems such as haplotype phasing, metageomics,
and conventional pooled-DNA sequencing in the absence of tagging. From an
information theoretic point of view, we have proposed fundamental limits on the
number and length of DNA reads in order to achieve a reliable assembly of all
the pooled DNA sequences. In particular, pooled-DNA sequencing from both
noiseless and noisy reads are investigated in this paper. In the noiseless
case, necessary and sufficient conditions on perfect assembly are derived.
Moreover, asymptotically tight lower and upper bounds on the error probability
of correct assembly are obtained under a biologically plausible probabilistic
model. For the noisy case, we have proposed two novel DNA read denoising
methods, as well as corresponding upper bounds on assembly error probabilities.
It has been shown that, under mild circumstances, the performance of the
reliable assembly converges to that of the noiseless regime when, for a given
read length, the number of DNA reads is sufficiently large. Interestingly, the
emergence of long DNA read technologies in recent years envisions the
applicability of our results in real-world applications.

 <dc:description>  Under some circumstances, a group of individuals may need to negotiate
together as a negotiation team against another party. Unlike bilateral
negotiation between two individuals, this type of negotiations entails to adopt
an intra-team strategy for negotiation teams in order to make team decisions
and accordingly negotiate with the opponent. It is crucial to be able to
negotiate successfully with heterogeneous opponents since opponents'
negotiation strategy and behavior may vary in an open environment. While one
opponent might collaborate and concede over time, another may not be inclined
to concede. This paper analyzes the performance of recently proposed intra-team
strategies for negotiation teams against different categories of opponents:
competitors, matchers, and conceders. Furthermore, it provides an extension of
the negotiation tool Genius for negotiation teams in bilateral settings.
Consequently, this work facilitates research in negotiation teams.

 <dc:description>  In this article we study the impact of the negotiation environment on the
performance of several intra-team strategies (team dynamics) for agent-based
negotiation teams that negotiate with an opponent. An agent-based negotiation
team is a group of agents that joins together as a party because they share
common interests in the negotiation at hand. It is experimentally shown how
negotiation environment conditions like the deadline of both parties, the
concession speed of the opponent, similarity among team members, and team size
affect performance metrics like the minimum utility of team members, the
average utility of team members, and the number of negotiation rounds. Our goal
is identifying which intra-team strategies work better in different
environmental conditions in order to provide useful knowledge for team members
to select appropriate intra-team strategies according to environmental
conditions.

 <dc:title>Reliable Linear, Sesquilinear and Bijective Operations On Integer Data
  Streams Via Numerical Entanglement</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Anam, Mohammad Ashraful</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new technique is proposed for fault-tolerant linear, sesquilinear and
bijective (LSB) operations on $M$ integer data streams ($M\geq3$), such as:
scaling, additions/subtractions, inner or outer vector products, permutations
and convolutions. In the proposed method, the $M$ input integer data streams
are linearly superimposed to form $M$ numerically-entangled integer data
streams that are stored in-place of the original inputs. A series of LSB
operations can then be performed directly using these entangled data streams.
The results are extracted from the $M$ entangled output streams by additions
and arithmetic shifts. Any soft errors affecting any single disentangled output
stream are guaranteed to be detectable via a specific post-computation
reliability check. In addition, when utilizing a separate processor core for
each of the $M$ streams, the proposed approach can recover all outputs after
any single fail-stop failure. Importantly, unlike algorithm-based fault
tolerance (ABFT) methods, the number of operations required for the
entanglement, extraction and validation of the results is linearly related to
the number of the inputs and does not depend on the complexity of the performed
LSB operations. We have validated our proposal in an Intel processor (Haswell
architecture with AVX2 support) via fast Fourier transforms, circular
convolutions, and matrix multiplication operations. Our analysis and
experiments reveal that the proposed approach incurs between $0.03\%$ to $7\%$
reduction in processing throughput for a wide variety of LSB operations. This
overhead is 5 to 1000 times smaller than that of the equivalent ABFT method
that uses a checksum stream. Thus, our proposal can be used in fault-generating
processor hardware or safety-critical applications, where high reliability is
required without the cost of ABFT or modular redundancy.

 <dc:description>  The use of extremely high frequency (EHF) or millimeter-wave (mmWave) band
has attracted significant attention for the next generation wireless access
networks. As demonstrated by recent measurements, mmWave frequencies render
themselves quite sensitive to &quot;blocking&quot; caused by obstacles like foliage,
humans, vehicles, etc. However, there is a dearth of analytical models for
characterizing such blocking and the consequent effect on the signal
reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel, general, and tractable model
for characterizing the blocking caused by humans (assuming them to be randomly
located in the environment) to mmWave propagation as a function of system
parameters like transmitter-receiver locations and dimensions, as well as
density and dimensions of humans. Moreover, the proposed model is validated
using a ray-launcher tool. Utilizing the proposed model, the blockage
probability is shown to increase with human density and separation between the
transmitter-receiver pair. Furthermore, the developed analysis is shown to
demonstrate the existence of a transmitter antenna height that maximizes the
received signal strength, which in turn is a function of the
transmitter-receiver distance and their dimensions.

 <dc:description>  The increasing application of social and human-enabled systems in people's
daily life from one side and from the other side the fast growth of mobile and
smart phones technologies have resulted in generating tremendous amount of
data, also referred to as big data, and a need for analyzing these data, i.e.,
big data analytics. Recently a trend has emerged to incorporate human computing
power into big data analytics to solve some shortcomings of existing big data
analytics such as dealing with semi or unstructured data. Including crowd into
big data analytics creates some new challenges such as security, privacy and
availability issues.
  In this paper study hybrid human-machine big data analytics and propose a
framework to study these systems from crowd involvement point of view. We
identify some open issues in the area and propose a set of research directions
for the future of big data analytics area.
