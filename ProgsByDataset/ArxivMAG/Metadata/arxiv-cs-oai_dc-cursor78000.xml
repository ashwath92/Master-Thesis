 <dc:description>  Overlapping of cervical cells and poor contrast of cell cytoplasm are the
major issues in accurate detection and segmentation of cervical cells. An
unsupervised cell segmentation approach is presented here. Cell clump
segmentation was carried out using the extended depth of field (EDF) image
created from the images of different focal planes. A modified Otsu method with
prior class weights is proposed for accurate segmentation of nuclei from the
cell clumps. The cell cytoplasm was further segmented from cell clump depending
upon the number of nucleus detected in that cell clump. Level set model was
used for cytoplasm segmentation.

 <dc:title>Extended fast search clustering algorithm: widely density clusters, no
  density peaks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Wenkai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Li, Jing</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  CFSFDP (clustering by fast search and find of density peaks) is recently
developed density-based clustering algorithm. Compared to DBSCAN, it needs less
parameters and is computationally cheap for its non-iteration. Alex. at al have
demonstrated its power by many applications. However, CFSFDP performs not well
when there are more than one density peak for one cluster, what we name as &quot;no
density peaks&quot;. In this paper, inspired by the idea of a hierarchical
clustering algorithm CHAMELEON, we propose an extension of CFSFDP,E_CFSFDP, to
adapt more applications. In particular, we take use of original CFSFDP to
generating initial clusters first, then merge the sub clusters in the second
phase. We have conducted the algorithm to several data sets, of which, there
are &quot;no density peaks&quot;. Experiment results show that our approach outperforms
the original one due to it breaks through the strict claim of data sets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the mQA model, which is able to answer questions
about the content of an image. The answer can be a sentence, a phrase or a
single word. Our model contains four components: a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) to extract the question representation, a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) to extract the visual representation, an LSTM for storing the linguistic
context in an answer, and a fusing component to combine the information from
the first three components and generate the answer. We construct a Freestyle
Multilingual Image Question Answering (FM-IQA) dataset to train and evaluate
our mQA model. It contains over 150,000 images and 310,000 freestyle Chinese
question-answer pairs and their English translations. The quality of the
generated answers of our mQA model on this dataset is evaluated by human judges
through a Turing Test. Specifically, we mix the answers provided by humans and
our model. The human judges need to distinguish our model from the human. They
will also provide a score (i.e. 0, 1, 2, the larger the better) indicating the
quality of the answer. We propose strategies to monitor the quality of this
evaluation process. The experiments show that in 64.7% of cases, the human
judges cannot distinguish our model from humans. The average score is 1.454
(1.918 for human). The details of this work, including the FM-IQA dataset, can
be found on the project page: http://idl.baidu.com/FM-IQA.html

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of the web presents an unsolved problem of automatically
analyzing billions of pages of natural language. We introduce a scalable
algorithm that clusters hundreds of millions of web pages into hundreds of
thousands of clusters. It does this on a single mid-range machine using
efficient algorithms and compressed document representations. It is applied to
two web-scale crawls covering tens of terabytes. ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12
contain 500 and 733 million web pages and were clustered into 500,000 to
700,000 clusters. To the best of our knowledge, such fine grained clustering
has not been previously demonstrated. Previous approaches clustered a sample
that limits the maximum number of discoverable clusters. The proposed EM-tree
algorithm uses the entire collection in clustering and produces several orders
of magnitude more clusters than the existing algorithms. Fine grained
clustering is necessary for meaningful clustering in massive collections where
the number of distinct topics grows linearly with collection size. These
fine-grained clusters show an improved cluster quality when assessed with two
novel evaluations using ad hoc search relevance judgments and spam
classifications for external validation. These evaluations solve the problem of
assessing the quality of clusters where categorical labeling is unavailable and
unfeasible.

 <dc:description>  Under the context of Industrie 4.0 (I4.0), future production systems provide
balanced operations between manufacturing flexibility and efficiency, realized
in an autonomous, horizontal, and decentralized item-level production control
framework. Structured interoperability via precise formulations on an
appropriate degree is crucial to achieve engineering efficiency in the system
life cycle. However, selecting the degree of formalization can be challenging,
as it crucially depends on the desired common understanding (semantic degree)
between multiple parties. In this paper, we categorize different semantic
degrees and map a set of technologies in industrial automation to their
associated degrees. Furthermore, we created guidelines to assist engineers
selecting appropriate semantic degrees in their design. We applied these
guidelines on publically available scenarios to examine the validity of the
approach, and identified semantic elements over internally developed use cases
targeting semantically-enabled plug-and-produce.

 <dc:description>  In retail, there are predictable yet dramatic time-dependent patterns in
customer behavior, such as periodic changes in the number of visitors, or
increases in visitors just before major holidays. The current paradigm of
multi-armed bandit analysis does not take these known patterns into account.
This means that for applications in retail, where prices are fixed for periods
of time, current bandit algorithms will not suffice. This work provides a
remedy that takes the time-dependent patterns into account, and we show how
this remedy is implemented in the UCB and {\epsilon}-greedy methods and we
introduce a new policy called the variable arm pool method. In the corrected
methods, exploitation (greed) is regulated over time, so that more exploitation
occurs during higher reward periods, and more exploration occurs in periods of
low reward. In order to understand why regret is reduced with the corrected
methods, we present a set of bounds that provide insight into why we would want
to exploit during periods of high reward, and discuss the impact on regret. Our
proposed methods perform well in experiments, and were inspired by a
high-scoring entry in the Exploration and Exploitation 3 contest using data
from Yahoo! Front Page. That entry heavily used time-series methods to regulate
greed over time, which was substantially more effective than other contextual
bandit methods.

 <dc:description>  We obtain new upper bounds on the additive distortion for graph emulators and
spanners on relatively few edges. We introduce a new subroutine called &quot;strip
creation,&quot; and we combine this subroutine with several other ideas to obtain
the following results:
  \item Every graph has a spanner on $O(n^{1+\epsilon})$ edges with
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/2 - \epsilon/2})$ additive distortion, for arbitrary
$\epsilon\in [0,1]$. \item Every graph has an emulator on $\tilde{O}(n^{1 +
\epsilon})$ edges with $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3 - 2\epsilon/3})$ additive distortion
whenever $\epsilon \in [0, \frac{1}{5}]$. \item Every graph has a spanner on
$\tilde{O}(n^{1 + \epsilon})$ edges with $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3 - 5\epsilon/3})$
additive distortion whenever $\epsilon \in [0, \frac{1}{4}]$.
  Our first spanner has the new best known asymptotic edge-error tradeoff for
additive spanners whenever $\epsilon \in [0, \frac{1}{7}]$. Our second spanner
has the new best tradeoff whenever $\epsilon \in [\frac{1}{7}, \frac{3}{17}]$.
Our emulator has the new best asymptotic edge-error tradeoff whenever $\epsilon
\in [0, \frac{1}{5}]$.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of corruption detection on networks. In this model
each vertex of a directed graph can be either truthful or corrupt. Each vertex
reports about the types (truthful or corrupt) of all his out-neighbors. If he
is truthful, he reports the truth, whereas if he is corrupt he reports
adversarially. This model, considered by Preparata, Metze, and Chien (1967)
motivated by the desire to identify the faulty components of a digital system
by having the other components checking them, became known as the PMC model.
The main known results for this model characterize networks in which {\em all}
corrupt (that is, faulty) vertices can be identified, when there is a known
upper bound on their number. We are interested in the investigation of networks
in which {\em most} of the corrupt vertices can be identified. We show that the
main relevant parameter here is graph expansion. This implies that in contrast
to the known results about the PMC model that imply that in order to identify
all corrupt vertices when their number is $t$ all indegrees have to be at least
$t$, there are bounded degree graphs in which almost all corrupt and almost all
truthful vertices can be identified, whenever there is a majority of truthful
vertices. We also show that expansion is necessary for obtaining such a
corruption detection and discuss algorithms and the computational hardness of
the problem.

 <dc:description>  Object viewpoint estimation from 2D images is an essential task in computer
vision. However, two issues hinder its progress: scarcity of training data with
viewpoint annotations, and a lack of powerful features. Inspired by the growing
availability of 3D models, we propose a framework to address both issues by
combining render-based image synthesis and CNNs. We believe that 3D models have
the potential in generating a large number of images of high variation, which
can be well exploited by deep CNN with a high learning capacity. Towards this
goal, we propose a scalable and overfit-resistant image synthesis pipeline,
together with a novel CNN specifically tailored for the viewpoint estimation
task. Experimentally, we show that the viewpoint estimation from our pipeline
can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL 3D+ benchmark.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a flexible system to reconstruct 3D models of objects
captured with an RGB-D sensor. A major advantage of the method is that our
reconstruction pipeline allows the user to acquire a full 3D model of the
object. This is achieved by acquiring several partial 3D models in different
sessions that are automatically merged together to reconstruct a full model. In
addition, the 3D models acquired by our system can be directly used by
state-of-the-art object instance recognition and object tracking modules,
providing object-perception capabilities for different applications, such as
human-object interaction analysis or robot grasping. The system does not impose
constraints in the appearance of objects (textured, untextured) nor in the
modelling setup (moving camera with static object or a turn-table setup). The
proposed reconstruction system has been used to model a large number of objects
resulting in metrically accurate and visually appealing 3D models.

 <dc:description>  Two endemic plant species in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, Crocus
cyprius and Ophrys kotschyi, were used as a case study. We have coupled climate
change scenarios, and land use change models with species distribution models.
Future land use scenarios were modelled by initially calculating the rate of
current land use changes between two time snapshots (2000 and 2006) on the
island, and based on these transition probabilities markov-chain cellular
automata were used to generate future land use changes for 2050. Climate change
scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and B2A were derived from the IPCC reports. Species
climatic preferences were derived from their current distributions using
classification trees while habitats preferences were derived from the Red Data
Book of the Flora of Cyprus. A bioclimatic model for Crocus cyprius was built
using mean temperature of wettest quarter, max temperature of warmest month and
precipitation seasonality, while for Ophrys kotchyi the bioclimatic model was
built using precipitation of wettest month, mean temperature of warmest
quarter, isothermality, precipitation of coldest quarter, and annual
precipitation. Sequentially, simulation scenarios were performed regarding
future species distributions by accounting climate alone and both climate and
land use changes. The distribution of the two species resulting from the
bioclimatic models was then filtered by future land use changes, providing the
species projected potential distribution. The species projected potential
distribution varies depending on the type and scenario used, but many of both
species current sites/locations are projected to be outside their future
potential distribution. Our results demonstrate the importance of including
both land use and climatic changes in predictive species modeling.

 <dc:description>  The Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol allows the nodes
in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) or a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) to know
where to forward data packets. Such a protocol is 'loop free' if it never leads
to routing decisions that forward packets in circles. This paper describes the
mechanization of an existing pen-and-paper proof of loop freedom of AODV in the
interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. The mechanization relies on a novel
compositional approach for lifting invariants to networks of nodes. We exploit
the mechanization to analyse several improvements of AODV and show that
Isabelle/HOL can re-establish most proof obligations automatically and identify
exactly the steps that are no longer valid.

 <dc:description>  Parallel data processing has become indispensable for processing applications
involving huge data sets. This brings into focus the Graphics Processing Units
(GPUs) which emphasize on many-core computing. With the advent of General
Purpose GPUs (GPGPU), applications not directly associated with graphics
operations can also harness the computation capabilities of GPUs. Hence, it
would be beneficial if the computing capabilities of a given GPGPU could be
task optimized and made available. This paper describes a client-server
framework in which users can choose a processing task and submit large
data-sets for processing to a remote GPGPU and receive the results back, using
well defined interfaces. The framework provides extensibility in terms of the
number and type of tasks that the client can choose or submit for processing at
the remote GPGPU server machine, with complete transparency to the underlying
hardware and operating systems. Parallelization of user-submitted tasks on the
GPGPU has been achieved using NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture
(CUDA).

 <dc:title>Event detection, tracking, and visualization in Twitter: a
  mention-anomaly-based approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guille, Adrien</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Favre, Cecile</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The ever-growing number of people using Twitter makes it a valuable source of
timely information. However, detecting events in Twitter is a difficult task,
because tweets that report interesting events are overwhelmed by a large volume
of tweets on unrelated topics. Existing methods focus on the textual content of
tweets and ignore the social aspect of Twitter. In this paper we propose MABED
(i.e. mention-anomaly-based event detection), a novel statistical method that
relies solely on tweets and leverages the creation frequency of dynamic links
(i.e. mentions) that users insert in tweets to detect significant events and
estimate the magnitude of their impact over the crowd. MABED also differs from
the literature in that it dynamically estimates the period of time during which
each event is discussed, rather than assuming a predefined fixed duration for
all events. The experiments we conducted on both English and French Twitter
data show that the mention-anomaly-based approach leads to more accurate event
detection and improved robustness in presence of noisy Twitter content.
Qualitatively speaking, we find that MABED helps with the interpretation of
detected events by providing clear textual descriptions and precise temporal
descriptions. We also show how MABED can help understanding users' interest.
Furthermore, we describe three visualizations designed to favor an efficient
exploration of the detected events.

 <dc:description>  In the Network Inference problem, one seeks to recover the edges of an
unknown graph from the observations of cascades propagating over this graph. In
this paper, we approach this problem from the sparse recovery perspective. We
introduce a general model of cascades, including the voter model and the
independent cascade model, for which we provide the first algorithm which
recovers the graph's edges with high probability and $O(s\log m)$ measurements
where $s$ is the maximum degree of the graph and $m$ is the number of nodes.
Furthermore, we show that our algorithm also recovers the edge weights (the
parameters of the diffusion process) and is robust in the context of
approximate sparsity. Finally we prove an almost matching lower bound of
$\Omega(s\log\frac{m}{s})$ and validate our approach empirically on synthetic
graphs.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we address the problem to model all the nodes (words or
phrases) in a dependency tree with the dense representations. We propose a
recursive convolutional neural network (RCNN) architecture to capture syntactic
and compositional-semantic representations of phrases and words in a dependency
tree. Different with the original recursive neural network, we introduce the
convolution and pooling layers, which can model a variety of compositions by
the feature maps and choose the most informative compositions by the pooling
layers. Based on RCNN, we use a discriminative model to re-rank a $k$-best list
of candidate dependency parsing trees. The experiments show that RCNN is very
effective to improve the state-of-the-art dependency parsing on both English
and Chinese datasets.

 <dc:title>Symmetry Reduction Enables Model Checking of More Complex Emergent

 <dc:description>  The emergent global behaviours of robotic swarms are important to achieve
their navigation task goals. These emergent behaviours can be verified to
assess their correctness, through techniques like model checking. Model
checking exhaustively explores all possible behaviours, based on a discrete
model of the system, such as a swarm in a grid. A common problem in model
checking is the state-space explosion that arises when the states of the model
are numerous. We propose a novel implementation of symmetry reduction, in the
form of encoding navigation algorithms relatively with respect to a reference,
based on the symmetrical properties of swarms in grids. We applied the relative
encoding to a swarm navigation algorithm, Alpha, modelled for the NuSMV model
checker. A comparison of the state-space and verification results with an
absolute (or global) and a relative encoding of the Alpha algorithm highlights
the advantages of our approach, allowing model checking larger grid sizes and
number of robots, and consequently, verifying more complex emergent behaviours.
For example, a property was verified for a grid with 3 robots and a maximum
allowed size of 8x8 cells in a global encoding, whereas this size was increased
to 16x16 using a relative encoding. Also, the time to verify a property for a
swarm of 3 robots in a 6x6 grid was reduced from almost 10 hours to only 7
minutes. Our approach is transferable to other swarm navigation algorithms.

 <dc:description>  A partition $(C_1,C_2,...,C_q)$ of $G = (V,E)$ into clusters of strong
(respectively, weak) diameter $d$, such that the supergraph obtained by
contracting each $C_i$ is $\ell$-colorable is called a strong (resp., weak)
$(d, \ell)$-network-decomposition. Network-decompositions were introduced in a
seminal paper by Awerbuch, Goldberg, Luby and Plotkin in 1989. Awerbuch et al.
showed that strong $(exp\{O(\sqrt{ \log n \log \log n})\}, exp\{O(\sqrt{ \log n
\log \log n})\})$-network-decompositions can be computed in distributed
deterministic time $exp\{O(\sqrt{ \log n \log \log n})\}$.
  The result of Awerbuch et al. was improved by Panconesi and Srinivasan in
1992: in the latter result $d = \ell = exp\{O(\sqrt{\log n})\}$, and the
running time is $exp\{O(\sqrt{\log n})\}$ as well. Much more recently Barenboim
(2012) devised a distributed randomized constant-time algorithm for computing
strong network decompositions with $d = O(1)$. However, the parameter $\ell$ in
his result is $O(n^{1/2 + \epsilon})$.
  In this paper we drastically improve the result of Barenboim and devise a
distributed randomized constant-time algorithm for computing strong $(O(1),
O(n^{\epsilon}))$-network-decompositions. As a corollary we derive a
constant-time randomized $O(n^{\epsilon})$-approximation algorithm for the
distributed minimum coloring problem, improving the previously best-known
$O(n^{1/2 + \epsilon})$ approximation guarantee. We also derive other improved
distributed algorithms for a variety of problems.
  Most notably, for the extremely well-studied distributed minimum dominating
set problem currently there is no known deterministic polylogarithmic-time
algorithm. We devise a {deterministic} polylogarithmic-time approximation
algorithm for this problem, addressing an open problem of Lenzen and
Wattenhofer (2010).

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the verification of control systems implemented in
Simulink. The goal is to ensure that high-level requirements on control
performance, like stability, are satisfied by the Simulink diagram. A two stage
process is proposed. First, the high-level requirements are decomposed into
specific parametrized sub-requirements and implemented as assertions in
Simulink. Second, the verification takes place. On one hand, the
sub-requirements are verified through assertion checks in simulation. On the
other hand, according to their scope, some of the sub-requirements are verified
through assertion checks in simulation, and others via automatic theorem
proving over an ideal mathematical model of the diagram. We compare performing
only assertion checks against the use of theorem proving, to highlight the
advantages of the latter. Theorem proving performs verification by computing a
mathematical proof symbolically, covering the entire state space of the
variables. An automatic translation tool from Simulink to the language of the
theorem proving tool Why3 is also presented. The paper demonstrates our
approach by verifying the stability of a simple discrete linear system.

 <dc:title>Pilot Decontamination Through Pilot Sequence Hopping in Massive MIMO
  Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work concerns wireless cellular networks applying massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) technology. In such a system, the base station in a
given cell is equipped with a very large number (hundreds or even thousands) of
antennas and serves multiple users. Estimation of the channel from the base
station to each user is performed at the base station using an uplink pilot
sequence. Such a channel estimation procedure suffers from pilot contamination.
Orthogonal pilot sequences are used in a given cell but, due to the shortage of
orthogonal sequences, the same pilot sequences must be reused in neighboring
cells, causing pilot contamination. The solution presented in this paper
suppresses pilot contamination, without the need for coordination among cells.
Pilot sequence hopping is performed at each transmission slot, which provides a
randomization of the pilot contamination. Using a modified Kalman filter, it is
shown that such randomized contamination can be significantly suppressed.
Comparisons with conventional estimation methods show that the mean squared
error can be lowered as much as an order of magnitude at low mobility.

 <dc:title>On the relation between accuracy and fairness in binary classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Our study revisits the problem of accuracy-fairness tradeoff in binary
classification. We argue that comparison of non-discriminatory classifiers
needs to account for different rates of positive predictions, otherwise
conclusions about performance may be misleading, because accuracy and
discrimination of naive baselines on the same dataset vary with different rates
of positive predictions. We provide methodological recommendations for sound
comparison of non-discriminatory classifiers, and present a brief theoretical
and empirical analysis of tradeoffs between accuracy and non-discrimination.

 <dc:title>Massive MIMO for Crowd Scenarios: A Solution Based on Random Access</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new approach to intra-cell pilot contamination in
crowded massive MIMO scenarios. The approach relies on two essential properties
of a massive MIMO system, namely near-orthogonality between user channels and
near-stability of channel powers. Signal processing techniques that take
advantage of these properties allow us to view a set of contaminated pilot
signals as a graph code on which iterative belief propagation can be performed.
This makes it possible to decontaminate pilot signals and increase the
throughput of the system. The proposed solution exhibits high performance with
large improvements over the conventional method. The improvements come at the
price of an increased error rate, although this effect is shown to decrease
significantly for increasing number of antennas at the base station.

 <dc:description>  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems have the potential to deliver
higher system throughput, compared to contemporary orthogonal multiple access
techniques. For a linearly precoded multiple-input multiple-output (MISO)
system, we study the downlink sum rate maximization problem, when the NOMA
principles are applied. Being a non-convex and intractable optimization
problem,we resort to approximate it with a minorization-maximization algorithm
(MMA), which is a widely used tool in statistics. In each step of the MMA, we
solve a second-order cone program, such that the feasibility set in each step
contains that of the previous one, and is always guaranteed to be a subset of
the feasibility set of the original problem. It should be noted that the
algorithm takes a few iterations to converge. Furthermore, we study the
conditions under which the achievable rates maximization can be further
simplified to a low complexity design problem, and we compute the probability
of occurrence of this event. Numerical examples are conducted to show a
comparison of the proposed approach against conventional multiple access
systems. NOMA is reported to provide better spectral and power efficiency with
a polynomial time computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  As the number of electronic components in the car increases, the requirement
for the higher data transmission scheme among them is on the sharp rise.
Controller area network (CAN) has been widely adopted to support the in-car
communications needs but the data rate is far below what other schemes such as
Ethernet and optical fibers can offer. A new scheme for enhancing the speed of
CAN network has been proposed, where carrier modulated signal is introduced on
top of the existing CAN signal whereby the data rate can be enhanced over
100Mbps. The proposed scheme is compatible with the existing CAN network and
accordingly enables seamless upgrade of the existing network to support high
speed demand using CAN protocol.

 <dc:description>  In a recent and ongoing work, Baldwin and Klemperer explored a connection
between tropical geometry and economics. They gave a sufficient condition for
the existence of competitive equilibrium in product-mix auctions of indivisible
goods. This result, which we call the Unimodularity Theorem, can also be traced
back to the work of Danilov, Koshevoy, and Murota in discrete convex analysis.
We give a new proof of the Unimodularity Theorem via the classical
unimodularity theorem in integer programming. We give a unified treatment of
these results via tropical geometry and formulate a new sufficient condition
for competitive equilibrium when there are only two types of product.
Generalizations of our theorem in higher dimensions are equivalent to various
forms of the Oda conjecture in algebraic geometry.

 <dc:description>  Graph edit distance (GED) is a powerful and flexible graph matching paradigm
that can be used to address different tasks in structural pattern recognition,
machine learning, and data mining. In this paper, some new binary linear
programming formulations for computing the exact GED between two graphs are
proposed. A major strength of the formulations lies in their genericity since
the GED can be computed between directed or undirected fully attributed graphs
(i.e. with attributes on both vertices and edges). Moreover, a relaxation of
the domain constraints in the formulations provides efficient lower bound
approximations of the GED. A complete experimental study comparing the proposed
formulations with 4 state-of-the-art algorithms for exact and approximate graph
edit distances is provided. By considering both the quality of the proposed
solution and the efficiency of the algorithms as performance criteria, the
results show that none of the compared methods dominates the others in the
Pareto sense. As a consequence, faced to a given real-world problem, a
trade-off between quality and efficiency has to be chosen w.r.t. the
application constraints. In this context, this paper provides a guide that can
be used to choose the appropriate method.

 <dc:description>  Future power grids will offer enhanced controllability due to the increased
availability of power flow control units (FACTS). As the installation of
control units in the grid is an expensive investment, we are interested in
using few controllers to achieve high controllability. In particular, two
questions arise: How many flow control buses are necessary to obtain globally
optimal power flows? And if fewer flow control buses are available, what can we
achieve with them? Using steady state IEEE benchmark data sets, we explore
experimentally that already a small number of controllers placed at certain
grid buses suffices to achieve globally optimal power flows. We present a
graph-theoretic explanation for this behavior. To answer the second question we
perform a set of experiments that explore the existence and costs of feasible
power flow solutions at increased loads with respect to the number of flow
control buses in the grid. We observe that adding a small number of flow
control buses reduces the flow costs and extends the existence of feasible
solutions at increased load.

 <dc:description>  An increasing number of works explore collaborative human-computer systems in
which human gaze is used to enhance computer vision systems. For object
detection these efforts were so far restricted to late integration approaches
that have inherent limitations, such as increased precision without increase in
recall. We propose an early integration approach in a deformable part model,
which constitutes a joint formulation over gaze and visual data. We show that
our GazeDPM method improves over the state-of-the-art DPM baseline by 4% and a
recent method for gaze-supported object detection by 3% on the public POET
dataset. Our approach additionally provides introspection of the learnt models,
can reveal salient image structures, and allows us to investigate the interplay
between gaze attracting and repelling areas, the importance of view-specific
models, as well as viewers' personal biases in gaze patterns. We finally study
important practical aspects of our approach, such as the impact of using
saliency maps instead of real fixations, the impact of the number of fixations,
as well as robustness to gaze estimation error.

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor nodes are powered by batteries, for which replacement is very
difficult. That is why, optimization of energy consumption is a major objective
in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs).On the other hand, noisy channel
has a prominent influence on the reliability of data transmission. Therefore,
an energy efficient transmission strategy should be considered on the
communication process of wireless nodes in order to obtain optimal energy
network consumption. Indeed, the choice of suitable modulation format with the
proper Error Correcting code (ECC) played a great responsibility to obtain
better energy conservation.In this work, we aim to evaluate the performance
analysis of Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation with several
combinations of coding strategies using various analysis metrics such as Bit
Error Rate (BER), energy consumption.Through extensive simulation, we disclose
that he gain achieved through GMSK modulation with suitable channel coding
mechanism is promising to obtain reliable communication and energy conservation
in WSN.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a methodology for deriving a model of a complex
system by exploiting the information extracted from Topological Data Analysis.
Central to our approach is the S[B] paradigm in which a complex system is
represented by a two-level model. One level, the structural S one, is derived
using the newly introduced quantitative concept of Persistent Entropy. The
other level, the behavioral B one, is characterized by a network of interacting
computational agents described by a Higher Dimensional Automaton. The
methodology yields also a representation of the evolution of the derived
two-level model as a Persistent Entropy Automaton. The presented methodology is
applied to a real case study, the Idiotypic Network of the mammal immune
system.

 <dc:description>  We present a semi-supervised approach that localizes multiple unknown object
instances in long videos. We start with a handful of labeled boxes and
iteratively learn and label hundreds of thousands of object instances. We
propose criteria for reliable object detection and tracking for constraining
the semi-supervised learning process and minimizing semantic drift. Our
approach does not assume exhaustive labeling of each object instance in any
single frame, or any explicit annotation of negative data. Working in such a
generic setting allow us to tackle multiple object instances in video, many of
which are static. In contrast, existing approaches either do not consider
multiple object instances per video, or rely heavily on the motion of the
objects present. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by evaluating the automatically labeled data on a variety of metrics like
quality, coverage (recall), diversity, and relevance to training an object
detector.

 <dc:description>  The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems
in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ
simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient
inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations.
This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made
using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible,
arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our
approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow,
whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by
applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of
complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop
categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of
approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that
the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true
posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches,
provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational
inference.

identification and regulation. The main feature consists of breaking the
control input to the system into a regulator part and a persistently exciting
part. The former is used to regulate the plant using a robust MPC formulation,
in which the latter is treated as a bounded additive disturbance. The
identification process is executed by a simple recursive least squares
algorithm. In order to guarantee sufficient excitation for the identification,
an additional non-convex constraint is enforced over the persistently exciting
part.

 <dc:description>  Network coding is famous for significantly improving the throughput of
networks. The successful decoding of the network coded data relies on some side
information of the original data. In that framework, independent data flows are
usually first decoded and then network coded by relay nodes. If appropriate
signal design is adopted, physical layer network coding is a natural way in
wireless networks. In this work, a network coding tree algorithm which enhances
the efficiency of the multiple access system (MAS) is presented. For MAS,
existing works tried to avoid the collisions while collisions happen frequently
under heavy load. By introducing network coding to MAS, our proposed algorithm
achieves a better performance of throughput and delay. When multiple users
transmit signal in a time slot, the mexed signals are saved and used to jointly
decode the collided frames after some component frames of the network coded
frame are received. Splitting tree structure is extended to the new algorithm
for collision solving. The throughput of the system and average delay of frames
are presented in a recursive way. Besides, extensive simulations show that
network coding tree algorithm enhances the system throughput and decreases the
average frame delay compared with other algorithms. Hence, it improves the
system performance.

 <dc:description>  Deauthentication is an important component of any authentication system. The
widespread use of computing devices in daily life has underscored the need for
zero-effort deauthentication schemes. However, the quest for eliminating user
effort may lead to hidden security flaws in the authentication schemes. As a
case in point, we investigate a prominent zero-effort deauthentication scheme,
called ZEBRA, which provides an interesting and a useful solution to a
difficult problem as demonstrated in the original paper. We identify a subtle
incorrect assumption in its adversary model that leads to a fundamental design
flaw. We exploit this to break the scheme with a class of attacks that are much
easier for a human to perform in a realistic adversary model, compared to the
na\&quot;ive attacks studied in the ZEBRA paper. For example, one of our main
attacks, where the human attacker has to opportunistically mimic only the
victim's keyboard typing activity at a nearby terminal, is significantly more
successful compared to the na\&quot;ive attack that requires mimicking keyboard and
mouse activities as well as keyboard-mouse movements. Further, by understanding
the design flaws in ZEBRA as cases of tainted input, we show that we can draw
on well-understood design principles to improve ZEBRA's security.

 <dc:description>  Display advertising normally charges advertisers for every single ad
impression. Specifically, if an ad in a webpage has been loaded in the browser,
an ad impression is counted. However, due to the position and size of the ad
slot, lots of ads are actually not viewed but still measured as impressions and
charged. These fraud ad impressions indeed undermine the efficacy of display
advertising. A perfect ad impression viewability measurement should match what
the user has really viewed with a short memory. In this paper, we conduct
extensive investigations on display ad impression viewability measurements on
dimensions of ad creative displayed pixel percentage and exposure time to find
which measurement provides the most accurate ad impression counting. The
empirical results show that the most accurate measurement counts one ad
impression if more than 75% of the ad creative pixels have been exposed for at
least 2 continuous seconds.

$I(f(X);Y)\leq 1-h(\alpha)$ for any Boolean function $f$. So far, the best

 <dc:description>  Lifelong reinforcement learning provides a promising framework for developing
versatile agents that can accumulate knowledge over a lifetime of experience
and rapidly learn new tasks by building upon prior knowledge. However, current
lifelong learning methods exhibit non-vanishing regret as the amount of
experience increases and include limitations that can lead to suboptimal or
unsafe control policies. To address these issues, we develop a lifelong policy
gradient learner that operates in an adversarial set- ting to learn multiple
tasks online while enforcing safety constraints on the learned policies. We
demonstrate, for the first time, sublinear regret for lifelong policy search,
and validate our algorithm on several benchmark dynamical systems and an
application to quadrotor control.

 <dc:title>Complexity Theoretic Limitations on Learning Halfspaces</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Daniely, Amit</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of agnostically learning halfspaces which is defined by
a fixed but unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on $\mathbb{Q}^n\times \{\pm
1\}$. We define $\mathrm{Err}_{\mathrm{HALF}}(\mathcal{D})$ as the least error
of a halfspace classifier for $\mathcal{D}$. A learner who can access
$\mathcal{D}$ has to return a hypothesis whose error is small compared to
$\mathrm{Err}_{\mathrm{HALF}}(\mathcal{D})$.
  Using the recently developed method of the author, Linial and Shalev-Shwartz
we prove hardness of learning results under a natural assumption on the
complexity of refuting random $K$-$\mathrm{XOR}$ formulas. We show that no
efficient learning algorithm has non-trivial worst-case performance even under
the guarantees that $\mathrm{Err}_{\mathrm{HALF}}(\mathcal{D}) \le \eta$ for
arbitrarily small constant $\eta&gt;0$, and that $\mathcal{D}$ is supported in
$\{\pm 1\}^n\times \{\pm 1\}$. Namely, even under these favorable conditions
its error must be $\ge \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n^c}$ for every $c&gt;0$. In
particular, no efficient algorithm can achieve a constant approximation ratio.
Under a stronger version of the assumption (where $K$ can be poly-logarithmic
in $n$), we can take $\eta = 2^{-\log^{1-\nu}(n)}$ for arbitrarily small
$\nu&gt;0$. Interestingly, this is even stronger than the best known lower bounds
(Arora et. al. 1993, Feldamn et. al. 2006, Guruswami and Raghavendra 2006) for
the case that the learner is restricted to return a halfspace classifier (i.e.
proper learning).

 <dc:title>Optimizing the Information Retrieval Trade-off in Data Visualization
  Using $\alpha$-Divergence</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Data visualization is one of the major applications of nonlinear
dimensionality reduction. From the information retrieval perspective, the
quality of a visualization can be evaluated by considering the extent that the
neighborhood relation of each data point is maintained while the number of
unrelated points that are retrieved is minimized. This property can be
quantified as a trade-off between the mean precision and mean recall of the
visualization. While there have been some approaches to formulate the
visualization objective directly as a weighted sum of the precision and recall,
there is no systematic way to determine the optimal trade-off between these two
nor a clear interpretation of the optimal value. In this paper, we investigate
the properties of $\alpha$-divergence for information visualization, focusing
our attention on a particular range of $\alpha$ values. We show that the
minimization of the new cost function corresponds to maximizing a geometric
mean between precision and recall, parameterized by $\alpha$. Contrary to some
earlier methods, no hand-tuning is needed, but we can rigorously estimate the
optimal value of $\alpha$ for a given input data. For this, we provide a
statistical framework using a novel distribution called Exponential Divergence
with Augmentation (EDA). By the extensive set of experiments, we show that the
optimal value of $\alpha$, obtained by EDA corresponds to the optimal trade-off
between the precision and recall for a given data distribution.

&lt; R &lt; 1$. The proof is generic and applies to other codes with sufficient
amount of symmetry as well. The main idea is to combine the following
observations: (i) monotone functions experience a sharp threshold behavior,
(ii) the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions are monotone, (iii)
Reed--Muller codes are 2-transitive and thus the EXIT functions associated with
their codeword bits are all equal, and (iv) therefore the Area Theorem for the
average EXIT functions implies that RM codes' threshold is at channel capacity.

 <dc:description>  The conformance testing problem for dynamical systems asks, given two
dynamical models (e.g., as Simulink diagrams), whether their behaviors are
&quot;close&quot; to each other. In the semi-formal approach to conformance testing, the
two systems are simulated on a large set of tests, and a metric, defined on
pairs of real-valued, real-timed trajectories, is used to determine a lower
bound on the distance. We show how the Skorkhod metric on continuous dynamical
systems can be used as the foundation for conformance testing of complex
dynamical models. The Skorokhod metric allows for both state value mismatches
and timing distortions, and is thus well suited for checking conformance
between idealized models of dynamical systems and their implementations. We
demonstrate the robustness of the system conformance quantification by proving
a \emph{transference theorem}: trajectories close under the Skorokhod metric
satisfy &quot;close&quot; logical properties. Specifically, we show the result for the
timed linear time logic \TLTL augmented with a rich class of temporal and
spatial constraint predicates. We provide a window-based streaming algorithm to
compute the Skorokhod metric, and use it as a basis for a conformance testing
tool for Simulink. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool
in finding discrepant behaviors on a set of control system benchmarks,
including an industrial challenge problem.

 <dc:description>  Object proposals have quickly become the de-facto pre-processing step in a
number of vision pipelines (for object detection, object discovery, and other
tasks). Their performance is usually evaluated on partially annotated datasets.
In this paper, we argue that the choice of using a partially annotated dataset
for evaluation of object proposals is problematic -- as we demonstrate via a
thought experiment, the evaluation protocol is 'gameable', in the sense that
progress under this protocol does not necessarily correspond to a &quot;better&quot;
category independent object proposal algorithm.
  To alleviate this problem, we: (1) Introduce a nearly-fully annotated version
of PASCAL VOC dataset, which serves as a test-bed to check if object proposal
techniques are overfitting to a particular list of categories. (2) Perform an
exhaustive evaluation of object proposal methods on our introduced nearly-fully
annotated PASCAL dataset and perform cross-dataset generalization experiments;
and (3) Introduce a diagnostic experiment to detect the bias capacity in an
object proposal algorithm. This tool circumvents the need to collect a densely
annotated dataset, which can be expensive and cumbersome to collect. Finally,
we plan to release an easy-to-use toolbox which combines various publicly
available implementations of object proposal algorithms which standardizes the
proposal generation and evaluation so that new methods can be added and
evaluated on different datasets. We hope that the results presented in the
paper will motivate the community to test the category independence of various

 <dc:description>  Computation of singular value decomposition (SVD) has been a topic of concern
by many numerical linear algebra researchers. Fast SVD has been a very
effective tool in computer vision in a number of aspects, such as: face
recognition, eye tracking etc. At the present state of the art fast and
fixed-point power efficient SVD algorithm needs to be developed for real-time
embedded computing. The work in this paper is the genesis of an attempt to
build an on-board real-time face and eye tracking system for human drivers to
detect loss of attention due to drowsiness or fatigue. A major function of this
on-board system is quick customization. This is carried out when a new driver
comes in. The face and eye images are recorded while instructing the driver for
making specific poses. The eigen faces and eigen eyes are generated at several
resolution levels and stored in the on-board computer. The discriminating eigen
space of face and eyes are determined and stored in the on-board flash memory
for detection and tracking of face and eyes and classification of eyes (open or
closed) as well. Therefore, fast SVD of image covariance matrix at various
levels of resolution needs to be carried out to generate the eigen database. As
a preliminary step, we review the existing symmetric SVD algorithms and
evaluate their feasibility for such an application. In this article, we compare
the performance of (1) Jacobi's, (2) Hestenes', (3) Golub-Kahan, (4)
Tridiagonalization and Symmetric QR iteration and (5) Tridiagonalization and
Divide and Conquer algorithms. A case study has been demonstrated as an
example.

 <dc:description>  Translation Memory (TM) systems are one of the most widely used translation
technologies. An important part of TM systems is the matching algorithm that
determines what translations get retrieved from the bank of available
translations to assist the human translator. Although detailed accounts of the
matching algorithms used in commercial systems can't be found in the
literature, it is widely believed that edit distance algorithms are used. This
paper investigates and evaluates the use of several matching algorithms,
including the edit distance algorithm that is believed to be at the heart of
most modern commercial TM systems. This paper presents results showing how well
various matching algorithms correlate with human judgments of helpfulness
(collected via crowdsourcing with Amazon's Mechanical Turk). A new algorithm
based on weighted n-gram precision that can be adjusted for translator length
preferences consistently returns translations judged to be most helpful by
translators for multiple domains and language pairs.

 <dc:title>A Circular Interference Model for Asymmetric Aggregate Interference</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Taranetz, Martin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rupp, Markus</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Scaling up the number of base stations per unit area is one of the major
trends in mobile cellular systems of the fourth (4G)- and fifth generation
(5G), making it increasingly difficult to characterize aggregate interference
statistics with system models of low complexity. This paper proposes a new
circular interference model that aggregates given interferer deployments to
power profiles along circles. The model accurately preserves the original
interference statistics while considerably reducing the amount of relevant
interferers. In comparison to common approaches from stochastic geometry, it
enables to characterize cell-center- and cell-edge users, and preserves effects
that are otherwise concealed by spatial averaging. To enhance the analysis of
given power profiles and to validate the accuracy of the circular model, a new
finite sum representation for the sum of Gamma random variables with
integer-valued shape parameter is introduced. The approach allows to decompose
the distribution of the aggregate interference into the contributions of the
individual interferers. Such knowledge is particularly expedient for the
application of base station coordination- and cooperation schemes. Moreover,
the proposed approach enables to accurately predict the corresponding
signal-to-interference-ratio- and rate statistics.

 <dc:description>  This paper contains an extensive combinatorial analysis of the single-peaked
domain restriction and investigates the likelihood that an election is
single-peaked. We provide a very general upper bound result for domain
restrictions that can be defined by certain forbidden configurations. This
upper bound implies that many domain restrictions (including the single-peaked
restriction) are very unlikely to appear in a random election chosen according
to the Impartial Culture assumption. For single-peaked elections, this upper
bound can be refined and complemented by a lower bound that is asymptotically
tight. In addition, we provide exact results for elections with few voters or
candidates. Moreover, we consider the P\'{o}lya urn model and the Mallows model
and obtain lower bounds showing that single-peakedness is considerably more
likely to appear for certain parameterizations.

 <dc:description>  Given a specification and a set of candidate programs (program space), the
program synthesis problem is to find a candidate program that satisfies the
specification. We present the synthesis through unification (STUN) approach,
which is an extension of the counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS)
approach. In CEGIS, the synthesizer maintains a subset S of inputs and a
candidate program Prog that is correct for S. The synthesizer repeatedly checks
if there exists a counter-example input c such that the execution of Prog is
incorrect on c. If so, the synthesizer enlarges S to include c, and picks a
program from the program space that is correct for the new set S.
  The STUN approach extends CEGIS with the idea that given a program Prog that
is correct for a subset of inputs, the synthesizer can try to find a program
Prog' that is correct for the rest of the inputs. If Prog and Prog' can be
unified into a program in the program space, then a solution has been found. We
present a generic synthesis procedure based on the STUN approach and specialize
it for three different domains by providing the appropriate unification
operators. We implemented these specializations in prototype tools, and we show
that our tools often per- forms significantly better on standard benchmarks
than a tool based on a pure CEGIS approach.

 <dc:description>  We describe the latest improvements to the IBM English conversational
telephone speech recognition system. Some of the techniques that were found
beneficial are: maxout networks with annealed dropout rates; networks with a
very large number of outputs trained on 2000 hours of data; joint modeling of
partially unfolded recurrent neural networks and convolutional nets by
combining the bottleneck and output layers and retraining the resulting model;
and lastly, sophisticated language model rescoring with exponential and neural
network LMs. These techniques result in an 8.0% word error rate on the
Switchboard part of the Hub5-2000 evaluation test set which is 23% relative
better than our previous best published result.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Manipulation in Elections with Top-truncated Ballots</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the computational social choice literature, there has been great interest
in understanding how computational complexity can act as a barrier against
manipulation of elections. Much of this literature, however, makes the
assumption that the voters or agents specify a complete preference ordering
over the set of candidates. There are many multiagent systems applications, and
even real-world elections, where this assumption is not warranted, and this in
turn raises the question &quot;How hard is it to manipulate elections if the agents
reveal only partial preference orderings?&quot; It is this question we try to
address in this paper. In particular, we look at the weighted manipulation
problem -- both constructive and destructive manipulation -- when the voters
are allowed to specify any top-truncated ordering over the set of candidates.
We provide general results for all scoring rules, for elimination versions of
all scoring rules, for the plurality with runoff rule, for a family of election
systems known as Copeland$^{\alpha}$, and for the maximin protocol. Finally, we
also look at the impact on complexity of manipulation when there is uncertainty
about the non-manipulators' votes.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores and analyzes two randomized designs for robust Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) employing low-dimensional data sketching. In one
design, a data sketch is constructed using random column sampling followed by
low dimensional embedding, while in the other, sketching is based on random
column and row sampling. Both designs are shown to bring about substantial
savings in complexity and memory requirements for robust subspace learning over
conventional approaches that use the full scale data. A characterization of the
sample and computational complexity of both designs is derived in the context
of two distinct outlier models, namely, sparse and independent outlier models.
The proposed randomized approach can provably recover the correct subspace with
computational and sample complexity that are almost independent of the size of
the data. The results of the mathematical analysis are confirmed through
numerical simulations using both synthetic and real data.

 <dc:description>  We consider cooperative localization technique for mobile agents with
communication and computation capabilities. We start by provide and overview of
different decentralization strategies in the literature, with special focus on
how these algorithms maintain an account of intrinsic correlations between
state estimate of team members. Then, we present a novel decentralized
cooperative localization algorithm that is a decentralized implementation of a
centralized Extended Kalman Filter for cooperative localization. In this
algorithm, instead of propagating cross-covariance terms, each agent propagates
new intermediate local variables that can be used in an update stage to create
the required propagated cross-covariance terms. Whenever there is a relative
measurement in the network, the algorithm declares the agent making this
measurement as the interim master. By acquiring information from the interim
landmark, the agent the relative measurement is taken from, the interim master
can calculate and broadcast a set of intermediate variables which each robot
can then use to update its estimates to match that of a centralized Extended
Kalman Filter for cooperative localization. Once an update is done, no further
communication is needed until the next relative measurement.

 <dc:description>  Generating natural language descriptions for in-the-wild videos is a
challenging task. Most state-of-the-art methods for solving this problem borrow
existing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (AlexNet,
GoogLeNet) to extract a visual representation of the input video. However,
these deep CNN architectures are designed for single-label centered-positioned
object classification. While they generate strong semantic features, they have
no inherent structure allowing them to detect multiple objects of different
sizes and locations in the frame. Our paper tries to solve this problem by
integrating the base CNN into several fully convolutional neural networks
(FCNs) to form a multi-scale network that handles multiple receptive field
sizes in the original image. FCNs, previously applied to image segmentation,
can generate class heat-maps efficiently compared to sliding window mechanisms,
and can easily handle multiple scales. To further handle the ambiguity over
multiple objects and locations, we incorporate the Multiple Instance Learning
mechanism (MIL) to consider objects in different positions and at different
scales simultaneously. We integrate our multi-scale multi-instance architecture
with a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network to generate sentence
descriptions based on the visual representation. Ours is the first end-to-end
trainable architecture that is capable of multi-scale region processing.
Evaluation on a Youtube video dataset shows the advantage of our approach
compared to the original single-scale whole frame CNN model. Our flexible and
efficient architecture can potentially be extended to support other video
processing tasks.

 <dc:description>  Images of the eye are key in several computer vision problems, such as shape
registration and gaze estimation. Recent large-scale supervised methods for
these problems require time-consuming data collection and manual annotation,
which can be unreliable. We propose synthesizing perfectly labelled
photo-realistic training data in a fraction of the time. We used computer
graphics techniques to build a collection of dynamic eye-region models from
head scan geometry. These were randomly posed to synthesize close-up eye images
for a wide range of head poses, gaze directions, and illumination conditions.
We used our model's controllability to verify the importance of realistic
illumination and shape variations in eye-region training data. Finally, we
demonstrate the benefits of our synthesized training data (SynthesEyes) by
out-performing state-of-the-art methods for eye-shape registration as well as
cross-dataset appearance-based gaze estimation in the wild.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the sequential composite hypothesis test with multiple
sensors. The sensors observe random samples in parallel and communicate with a
fusion center, who makes the global decision based on the sensor inputs. On one
hand, in the centralized scenario, where local samples are precisely
transmitted to the fusion center, the generalized sequential likelihood ratio
test (GSPRT) is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of the expected
sample size as error rates tend to zero. On the other hand, for systems with
limited power and bandwidth resources, decentralized solutions that only send a
summary of local samples (we particularly focus on a one-bit communication
protocol) to the fusion center is of great importance. To this end, we first
consider a decentralized scheme where sensors send their one-bit quantized
statistics every fixed period of time to the fusion center. We show that such a
uniform sampling and quantization scheme is strictly suboptimal and its
suboptimality can be quantified by the KL divergence of the distributions of
the quantized statistics under both hypotheses. We then propose a decentralized
GSPRT based on level-triggered sampling. That is, each sensor runs its own
GSPRT repeatedly and reports its local decision to the fusion center
asynchronously. We show that this scheme is asymptotically optimal as the local
thresholds and global thresholds grow large at different rates. Lastly, two
particular models and their associated applications are studied to compare the
centralized and decentralized approaches. Numerical results are provided to
demonstrate that the proposed level-triggered sampling based decentralized
scheme aligns closely with the centralized scheme with substantially lower
communication overhead, and significantly outperforms the uniform sampling and
quantization based decentralized scheme.

 <dc:title>Identifying Modes of Intent from Driver Behaviors in Dynamic
  Environments</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In light of growing attention of intelligent vehicle systems, we propose
developing a driver model that uses a hybrid system formulation to capture the
intent of the driver. This model hopes to capture human driving behavior in a
way that can be utilized by semi- and fully autonomous systems in heterogeneous
environments. We consider a discrete set of high level goals or intent modes,
that is designed to encompass the decision making process of the human. A
driver model is derived using a dataset of lane changes collected in a
realistic driving simulator, in which the driver actively labels data to give
us insight into her intent. By building the labeled dataset, we are able to
utilize classification tools to build the driver model using features of based
on her perception of the environment, and achieve high accuracy in identifying
driver intent. Multiple algorithms are presented and compared on the dataset,
and a comparison of the varying behaviors between drivers is drawn. Using this
modeling methodology, we present a model that can be used to assess driver
behaviors and to develop human-inspired safety metrics that can be utilized in
intelligent vehicular systems.

 <dc:description>  Let $G$ be a plane graph with outer cycle $C$ and let $(L(v):v\in V(G))$ be a
family of sets such that $|L(v)|\ge 5$ for every $v\in V(G)$. By an
$L$-coloring of a subgraph $J$ of $G$ we mean a (proper) coloring $\phi$ of $J$
such that $\phi(v)\in L(v)$ for every vertex $v$ of $J$. We prove a conjecture
of Dvorak et al. that if $H$ is a minimal subgraph of $G$ such that $C$ is a
subgraph of $H$ and every $L$-coloring of $C$ that extends to an $L$-coloring
of $H$ also extends to an $L$-coloring of $G$, then $|V(H)|\le 19|V(C)|$.
  This is a lemma that plays an important role in subsequent papers, because it
motivates the study of graphs embedded in surfaces that satisfy an
isoperimetric inequality suggested by this result. Such study turned out to be
quite profitable for the subject of list coloring graphs on surfaces.

 <dc:title>A new algorithm for contact angle estimation in molecular dynamics

 <dc:description>  It is important to study contact angle of a liquid on a solid surface to
understand its wetting properties, capillarity and surface interaction energy.
While performing transient molecular dynamics (MD) simulations it requires
calculating the time evolution of contact angle. This is a tedious effort to do
manually or with image processing algorithms. In this work we propose a new
algorithm to estimate contact angle from MD simulations directly and in a
computationally efficient way. This algorithm segregates the droplet molecules
from the vapor molecules using Mahalanobis distance (MND) technique. Then the
density is smeared onto a 2D grid using 4th order B-spline interpolation
function. The vapor liquid interface data is estimated from the grid using
density filtering. With the interface data a circle is fitted using Landau
method. The equation of this circle is solved for obtaining the contact angle.
This procedure is repeated by rotating the droplet about the vertical axis. We
have applied this algorithm to a number of studies (different potentials and
thermostat methods) which involves the MD simulation of water.

 <dc:title>A sparse recovery method for initial ranging in IEEE 802.16 OFDMA

 <dc:description>  Initial ranging constitutes a part of the synchronization procedure employed
by the wireless communication standards. This allows the base station (BS) to
detect the subscriber stations (SS) that are willing to commence communication.
In addition, the ranging process allows the BS to estimate the uplink channel
parameters of these SSs. Accurate estimation of these parameters are crucial as
they ensure that the uplink signals from all the SSs arrive at the BS
synchronously and approximately at the same power level. However, this
detection and estimation problem turns out to be very challenging when multiple
users initiate the ranging procedure at the same time. We address this issue by
exploiting the underlying sparsity of the estimation problem. We propose a fast
sparse signal recovery approach to improve the ranging performance in
multi-user environment. Compared to the standard correlation based techniques,
our method shows a clear improvement in ranging code detection, timing offset
and channel power estimation. Although this method has been developed around
the WiMAX standard, the underlying principles apply to other OFDM based
standards as well.

 <dc:title>Finite-SNR Analysis of Partial Relaying with Relay Selection in
  Channel-coded Cooperative Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vu, Thang X.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Duhamel, Pierre</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work studies the performance of a cooperative network which consists of
two channel-coded sources, multiple relays, and one destination. Due to
spectral efficiency constraint, we assume only one time slot is dedicated for
relaying. Conventional network coding based cooperation (NCC) selects the best
relay which uses network coding to serve two sources simultaneously. The
performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) of NCC, however, is not available
in the literature. In this paper, we first derive the closed-form expression
for the BER of NCC and analytically show that NCC always achieves diversity of
order two regardless the number of available relays and the channel code.
Secondly, motivated by a loss in diversity in NCC, we propose a novel relaying
scheme based on partial relaying cooperation (PARC) in which two best relays
are selected, each forwarding half of the codeword to help one source.
Closed-form expression for BER and system diversity order of the proposed
scheme are derived. Analytical results show that the diversity order of PARC is
a function of the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the minimum
distance of the channel code. More importantly, full diversity order in PARC
can be achieved for practically operating finite SNRs with the proper channel
code. Finally, intensive simulations present a huge SNR gain of PARC over NCC
and reference schemes without relay selection.

 <dc:title>A Pareto Front-Based Multiobjective Path Planning Algorithm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lavin, Alexander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Path planning is one of the most vital elements of mobile robotics. With a
priori knowledge of the environment, global path planning provides a
collision-free route through the workspace. The global path plan can be
calculated with a variety of informed search algorithms, most notably the A*
search method, guaranteed to deliver a complete and optimal solution that
minimizes the path cost. Path planning optimization typically looks to minimize
the distance traversed from start to goal, yet many mobile robot applications
call for additional path planning objectives, presenting a multiobjective
optimization (MOO) problem. Past studies have applied genetic algorithms to MOO
path planning problems, but these may have the disadvantages of computational
complexity and suboptimal solutions. Alternatively, the algorithm in this paper
approaches MOO path planning with the use of Pareto fronts, or finding
non-dominated solutions. The algorithm presented incorporates Pareto optimality
into every step of A* search, thus it is named A*-PO. Results of simulations
show A*-PO outperformed several variations of the standard A* algorithm for MOO
path planning. A planetary exploration rover case study was added to
demonstrate the viability of A*-PO in a real-world application.

 <dc:description>  Recently, there has been significant interest in the study of the community
search problem in social and information networks: given one or more query
nodes, find densely connected communities containing the query nodes. However,
most existing studies do not address the &quot;free rider&quot; issue, that is, nodes far
away from query nodes and irrelevant to them are included in the detected
community. Some state-of-the-art models have attempted to address this issue,
but not only are their formulated problems NP-hard, they do not admit any
approximations without restrictive assumptions, which may not always hold in
practice.
  In this paper, given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes Q, we
study community search using the k-truss based community model. We formulate
our problem of finding a closest truss community (CTC), as finding a connected
k-truss subgraph with the largest k that contains Q, and has the minimum
diameter among such subgraphs. We prove this problem is NP-hard. Furthermore,
it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor $(2-\varepsilon)$, for
any $\varepsilon &gt;0 $. However, we develop a greedy algorithmic framework,
which first finds a CTC containing Q, and then iteratively removes the furthest
nodes from Q, from the graph. The method achieves 2-approximation to the
optimal solution. To further improve the efficiency, we make use of a compact
truss index and develop efficient algorithms for k-truss identification and
maintenance as nodes get eliminated. In addition, using bulk deletion
optimization and local exploration strategies, we propose two more efficient
algorithms. One of them trades some approximation quality for efficiency while
the other is a very efficient heuristic. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world
networks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our community model and
search algorithms.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of drones, aerial video analysis becomes increasingly
important; yet, it has received scant attention in the literature. This paper
addresses a new problem of parsing low-resolution aerial videos of large
spatial areas, in terms of 1) grouping, 2) recognizing events and 3) assigning
roles to people engaged in events. We propose a novel framework aimed at
conducting joint inference of the above tasks, as reasoning about each in
isolation typically fails in our setting. Given noisy tracklets of people and
detections of large objects and scene surfaces (e.g., building, grass), we use
a spatiotemporal AND-OR graph to drive our joint inference, using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo and dynamic programming. We also introduce a new formalism of
spatiotemporal templates characterizing latent sub-events. For evaluation, we
have collected and released a new aerial videos dataset using a hex-rotor
flying over picnic areas rich with group events. Our results demonstrate that
we successfully address above inference tasks under challenging conditions.

 <dc:description>  Motion sensors (e.g., accelerometers) on smartphones have been demonstrated
to be a powerful side channel for attackers to spy on users' inputs on
touchscreen. In this paper, we reveal another motion accelerometer-based attack
which is particularly serious: when a person takes the metro, a malicious
application on her smartphone can easily use accelerator readings to trace her.
We first propose a basic attack that can automatically extract metro-related
data from a large amount of mixed accelerator readings, and then use an
ensemble interval classier built from supervised learning to infer the riding
intervals of the user. While this attack is very effective, the supervised
learning part requires the attacker to collect labeled training data for each
station interval, which is a significant amount of effort. To improve the
efficiency of our attack, we further propose a semi-supervised learning
approach, which only requires the attacker to collect labeled data for a very
small number of station intervals with obvious characteristics. We conduct real
experiments on a metro line in a major city. The results show that the
inferring accuracy could reach 89\% and 92\% if the user takes the metro for 4
and 6 stations, respectively.

 <dc:description>  Today's large-scale enterprise networks, data center networks, and wide area
networks can be decomposed into multiple administrative or geographical
domains. Domains may be owned by different administrative units or
organizations. Hence protecting domain information is an important concern.
Existing general-purpose Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) methods that
preserves privacy for domains are extremely slow for cross-domain routing
problems. In this paper we present PYCRO, a cryptographic protocol specifically
designed for privacy-preserving cross-domain routing optimization in Software
Defined Networking (SDN) environments. PYCRO provides two fundamental routing
functions, policy-compliant shortest path computing and bandwidth allocation,
while ensuring strong protection for the private information of domains. We
rigorously prove the privacy guarantee of our protocol. We have implemented a
prototype system that runs PYCRO on servers in a campus network. Experimental
results using real ISP network topologies show that PYCRO is very efficient in
computation and communication costs.

grouped into sets based on some similarity measure. Most of the clustering
algorithms assume that the main memory is infinite and can accommodate the set
of patterns. In reality many applications give rise to a large set of patterns
which does not fit in the main memory. When the data set is too large, much of
the data is stored in the secondary memory. Input/Outputs (I/O) from the disk
are the major bottleneck in designing efficient clustering algorithms for large
data sets. Different designing techniques have been used to design clustering
algorithms for large data sets. External memory algorithms are one class of
algorithms which can be used for large data sets. These algorithms exploit the
hierarchical memory structure of the computers by incorporating locality of
reference directly in the algorithm. This paper makes some contribution towards
designing clustering algorithms in the external memory model (Proposed by
Aggarwal and Vitter 1988) to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, it is
shown that the Shared near neighbors algorithm is not very I/O efficient since
the computational complexity is same as the I/O complexity. The algorithm is
designed in the external memory model and I/O complexity is reduced. The
computational complexity remains same. We substantiate the theoretical analysis
by showing the performance of the algorithms with their traditional counterpart
by implementing in STXXL library.

 <dc:title>CCS: It's not Fair! Fair Schedulers cannot be implemented in CCS-like

 <dc:description>  In the process algebra community it is sometimes suggested that, on some
level of abstraction, any distributed system can be modelled in standard
process-algebraic specification formalisms like CCS. This sentiment is
strengthened by results testifying that CCS, like many similar formalisms, is
Turing powerful and provides a mechanism for interaction. This paper counters
that sentiment by presenting a simple fair scheduler---one that in suitable
variations occurs in many distributed systems---of which no implementation can
be expressed in CCS, unless CCS is enriched with a fairness assumption.
  Since Dekker's and Peterson's mutual exclusion protocols implement fair
schedulers, it follows that these protocols cannot be rendered correctly in CCS
without imposing a fairness assumption. Peterson expressed this algorithm
correctly in pseudocode without resorting to a fairness assumption, so it
furthermore follows that CCS lacks the expressive power to accurately capture
such pseudocode.

 <dc:description>  Providing feedback, both assessing final work and giving hints to stuck
students, is difficult for open-ended assignments in massive online classes
which can range from thousands to millions of students. We introduce a neural
network method to encode programs as a linear mapping from an embedded
precondition space to an embedded postcondition space and propose an algorithm
for feedback at scale using these linear maps as features. We apply our
algorithm to assessments from the Code.org Hour of Code and Stanford
University's CS1 course, where we propagate human comments on student
assignments to orders of magnitude more submissions.

 <dc:description>  Although deep neural networks (DNN) are able to scale with direct advances in
computational power (e.g., memory and processing speed), they are not well
suited to exploit the recent trends for parallel architectures. In particular,
gradient descent is a sequential process and the resulting serial dependencies
mean that DNN training cannot be parallelized effectively. Here, we show that a
DNN may be replicated over a massive parallel architecture and used to provide
a cumulative sampling of local solution space which results in rapid and robust
learning. We introduce a complimentary convolutional bootstrapping approach
that enhances performance of the parallel architecture further. Our
parallelized convolutional bootstrapping DNN out-performs an identical
fully-trained traditional DNN after only a single iteration of training.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization scheme that exploits
ubiquitous visible lights, which are necessarily and densely deployed in almost
all indoor environments. We unveil two phenomena of lights available for
positioning: 1) the light strength varies according to different light sources,
which can be easily detected by light sensors embedded in COTS devices (e.g.,
smart-phone, smart-glass and smart-watch); 2) the light strength is stable in
different times of the day thus exploiting it can avoid frequent site-survey
and database maintenance. Hence, a user could locate oneself by differentiating
the light source of received light strength (RLS). However, different from
existing positioning systems that exploit special LEDs, ubiquitous visible
lights lack fingerprints that can uniquely identify the light source, which
results in an ambiguity problem that an RLS may correspond to multiple
positions. Moreover, RLS is not only determined by device's position, but also
seriously affected by its orientation, which causes great complexity in
site-survey. To address these challenges, we first propose and validate a
realistic light strength model that can attributes RLS to arbitrary positions
with heterogenous orientations. This model is further perfected by taking
account of the device diversity, influence of multiple light sources and
shading of obstacles. Then we design a localizing scheme that harness user's
mobility to generate spatial-related RLS to tackle the position-ambiguity
problem of a single RLS, which is robust against sunlight interference, shading
effect of human-body and unpredictable behaviours (e.g., put the device in
pocket) of user. Experiment results show that our scheme achieves mean accuracy
$1.93$m and $1.98$m in office ($720m^2$) and library scenario ($960m^2$)
respectively.

 <dc:description>  Pairwise ordered tree alignment are combinatorial objects that appear in RNA
secondary structure comparison. However, the usual representation of tree
alignments as supertrees is ambiguous, i.e. two distinct supertrees may induce
identical sets of matches between identical pairs of trees. This ambiguity is
uninformative, and detrimental to any probabilistic analysis.In this work, we
consider tree alignments up to equivalence. Our first result is a precise
asymptotic enumeration of tree alignments, obtained from a context-free grammar
by mean of basic analytic combinatorics. Our second result focuses on
alignments between two given ordered trees $S$ and $T$. By refining our grammar
to align specific trees, we obtain a decomposition scheme for the space of
alignments, and use it to design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for
sampling alignments under the Gibbs-Boltzmann probability distribution. This
generalizes existing tree alignment algorithms, and opens the door for a
probabilistic analysis of the space of suboptimal RNA secondary structures
alignments.

 <dc:title>Line of Sight 2 x nr MIMO with Random Antenna Orientations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Line-of-sight (LoS) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) gives full
spatial-multiplexing gain when the antenna array geometry and orientation are
designed based on the inter-terminal distance. These known design
methodologies, that hold for antenna arrays with fixed orientation, do not
provide full MIMO gains for arbitrary array orientations. In this paper, we
study LoS MIMO channels with random array orientations when the number of
transmit antennas used for signalling is 2. We study the impact of common array
geometries on error probability, and identify the code design parameter that
describes the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) error performance of an
arbitrary coding scheme. For planar receive arrays, the error rate is shown to
decay only as fast as that of a rank 1 channel, and no better than 1/SNR^3 for
a class of coding schemes that includes spatial multiplexing. We then show that
for the tetrahedral receive array, which uses the smallest number of antennas
among non-planar arrays, the error rate decays faster than that of rank 1
channels and is exponential in SNR for every coding scheme. Finally, we design
a LoS MIMO system that guarantees a good error performance for all
transmit/receive array orientations and over a range of inter-terminal
distances.

 <dc:description>  Golo is a simple dynamically-typed language for the Java Virtual Machine.
Initially implemented as a ahead-of-time compiler to JVM bytecode, it leverages
invokedy-namic and JSR 292 method handles to implement a reasonably efficient
runtime. Truffle is emerging as a framework for building interpreters for JVM
languages with self-specializing AST nodes. Combined with the Graal compiler,
Truffle offers a simple path towards writing efficient interpreters while
keeping the engineering efforts balanced. The Golo project is interested in
experimenting with a Truffle interpreter in the future, as it would provides
interesting comparison elements between invokedynamic versus Truffle for
building a language runtime.

 <dc:description>  Vehicular communication is characterized by a dynamic environment, high
mobility, and comparatively low antenna heights on the communicating entities
(vehicles and roadside units). These characteristics make vehicular propagation
and channel modeling particularly challenging. In this article, we classify and
describe the most relevant vehicular propagation and channel models, with a
particular focus on the usability of the models for the evaluation of protocols
and applications. We first classify the models based on the propagation
mechanisms they employ and their implementation approach. We also classify the
models based on the channel properties they implement and pay special attention
to the usability of the models, including the complexity of implementation,
scalability, and the input requirements (e.g., geographical data input). We
also discuss the less-explored aspects in vehicular channel modeling, including
modeling specific environments (e.g., tunnels, overpasses, and parking lots)
and types of communicating vehicles (e.g., scooters and public transportation
vehicles). We conclude by identifying the underresearched aspects of vehicular
propagation and channel modeling that require further modeling and measurement
studies.

 <dc:description>  The tension between qualitative theorizing and quantitative methods is
pervasive in the social sciences, and poses a constant challenge to empirical
research. But in science studies as an interdisciplinary specialty, there are
additional reasons why a more reflexive consciousness of the differences among
the relevant disciplines is necessary. How can qualitative insights from the
history of ideas and the sociology of science be combined with the quantitative
perspective? By using the example of the lexical and semantic value of word
occurrences, the issue of qualitatively different meanings of the same
phenomena is discussed as a methodological problem. Nine criteria for methods
which are needed for the development of science studies as an integrated
enterprise can then be specified. Information calculus is suggested as a method
which can comply with these criteria.

 <dc:description>  Given a finite Abelian group $G$ and a generator subset $A\subset G$ of
cardinality two, we consider the Cayley digraph $\Gamma=$Cay$(G,A)$. This
digraph is called $2$--Cayley digraph. An extension of $\Gamma$ is a
$2$--Cayley digraph, $\Gamma'=$Cay$(G',A)$ with $G&lt;G'$, such that there is some
subgroup $H&lt;G'$ satisfying the digraph isomorphism
Cay$(G'/H,A)\cong$Cay$(G,A)$. We also call the digraph $\Gamma$ a quotient of
$\Gamma'$. Notice that the generator set does not change. A $2$--Cayley digraph
is called optimal when its diameter is optimal with respect to its order.
  In this work we define two procedures, E and Q, which generate a particular
type of extensions and quotients of $2$--Cayley digraphs, respectively. These
procedures are used to obtain optimal quotients and extensions. Quotients
obtained by procedure Q of optimal $2$--Cayley digraphs are proved to be also
optimal. The number of tight extensions, generated by procedure E from a given
tight digraph, is characterized. Tight digraphs for which procedure E gives
infinite tight extensions are also characterized. Finally, these two procedures
allow the obtention of new optimal families of $2$--Cayley digraphs and also
the improvement of the diameter of many proposals in the literature.

 <dc:title>The Specification of Sugarscape</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kehoe, Joseph</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sugarscape is a well known and influential Agent Based Social Simulation
(ABSS). Various parts of Sugarscape are supplied as examples in almost all
Agent Based Model (ABM) toolkits. It has been used for demonstrating the
applicability of different approaches to ABM. However a lack of agreement on
the precise definition of the rules within Sugarscape has curtailed its
usefulness. We provide a formal specification of Sugarscape using the Z
specification language. This demonstrates the ability of formal specification
to capture the definition of an ABM in a precise manner. It shows that formal
specifications could be used as an approach to tackle the replication problem
in the field of ABM. It also provides the first clear interpretation of
Sugarscape identifying areas where information is missing and/or ambiguous.
This enables researchers to make proper comparisons between different
implementations of this model.

 <dc:title>Implementing a Photorealistic Rendering System using GLSL</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hachisuka, Toshiya</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Ray tracing on GPUs is becoming quite common these days. There are many
publicly available documents on how to implement basic ray tracing on GPUs for
spheres and implicit surfaces. We even have some general frameworks for ray
tracing on GPUs. We however hardly find details on how to implement more
complex ray tracing algorithms themselves that are commonly used for
photorealistic rendering. This paper explains an implementation of a
stand-alone rendering system on GPUs which supports the bounding volume
hierarchy and stochastic progressive photon mapping. The key characteristic of
the system is that it uses only GLSL shaders without relying on any platform
dependent feature. The system can thus run on many platforms that support
OpenGL, making photorealistic rendering on GPUs widely accessible. This paper
also sketches practical ideas for stackless traversal and pseudorandom number
generation which both fit well with the limited system configuration.

 <dc:description>  The spectral properties of the adjacency matrix provide a trove of
information about the structure and function of complex networks. In
particular, the largest eigenvalue and its associated principal eigenvector are
crucial in the understanding of nodes centrality and the unfolding of dynamical
processes. Here we show that two distinct types of localization of the
principal eigenvector may occur in heterogeneous networks. For synthetic
networks with degree distribution $P(q) \sim q^{-\gamma}$, localization occurs
on the largest hub if $\gamma&gt;5/2$; for $\gamma&lt;5/2$ a new type of localization
arises on a mesoscopic subgraph associated with the shell with the largest
index in the $K$-core decomposition. Similar evidence for the existence of
distinct localization modes is found in the analysis of real-world networks.
Our results open a new perspective on dynamical processes on networks and on a
recently proposed alternative measure of node centrality based on the
non-backtracking matrix.

 <dc:description>  The hypergraph transversal problem has been intensively studied, from both a
theoretical and a practical point of view. In particular , its incremental
complexity is known to be quasi-polynomial in general and polynomial for
bounded hypergraphs. Recent applications in computational biology however
require to solve a generalization of this problem, that we call bi-objective
transversal problem. The instance is in this case composed of a pair of
hypergraphs (A, B), and the aim is to find minimal sets which hit all the
hyperedges of A while intersecting a minimal set of hyperedges of B. In this
paper, we formalize this problem, link it to a problem on monotone boolean
$\land$ -- $\lor$ formulae of depth 3 and study its incremental complexity.

 <dc:description>  Suppose that we are given a set of videos, along with natural language
descriptions in the form of multiple sentences (e.g., manual annotations, movie
scripts, sport summaries etc.), and that these sentences appear in the same
temporal order as their visual counterparts. We propose in this paper a method
for aligning the two modalities, i.e., automatically providing a time stamp for
every sentence. Given vectorial features for both video and text, we propose to
cast this task as a temporal assignment problem, with an implicit linear
mapping between the two feature modalities. We formulate this problem as an
integer quadratic program, and solve its continuous convex relaxation using an
efficient conditional gradient algorithm. Several rounding procedures are
proposed to construct the final integer solution. After demonstrating
significant improvements over the state of the art on the related task of
aligning video with symbolic labels [7], we evaluate our method on a
challenging dataset of videos with associated textual descriptions [36], using
both bag-of-words and continuous representations for text.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm for
solving bandwidth coloring problem (BCP) and bandwidth multicoloring problem
(BMCP). BCP and BMCP are generalizations of the well known vertex coloring
problem and they are of a great interest from both theoretical and practical
points of view. Presented VNS combines a shaking procedure which perturbs the
colors for an increasing number of vertices and a specific variable
neighborhood descent (VND) procedure, based on the specially designed
arrangement of the vertices which are the subject of re-coloring. By this
approach, local search is split in a series of disjoint procedures, enabling
better choice of the vertices which are addressed to re-color. The experiments
show that proposed method is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art
algorithms and improves 2 out of 33 previous best known solutions for BMCP.

 <dc:title>VPG and EPG bend-numbers of Halin Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A piecewise linear curve in the plane made up of $k+1$ line segments, each of
which is either horizontal or vertical, with consecutive segments being of
different orientation is called a $k$-bend path. Given a graph $G$, a
collection of $k$-bend paths in which each path corresponds to a vertex in $G$
and two paths have a common point if and only if the vertices corresponding to
them are adjacent in $G$ is called a $B_k$-VPG representation of $G$.
Similarly, a collection of $k$-bend paths each of which corresponds to a vertex
in $G$ is called an $B_k$-EPG representation of $G$ if any two paths have a
line segment of non-zero length in common if and only if their corresponding
vertices are adjacent in $G$. The VPG bend-number $b_v(G)$ of a graph $G$ is
the minimum $k$ such that $G$ has a $B_k$-VPG representation. Similarly, the
EPG bend-number $b_e(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ has a
$B_k$-EPG representation. Halin graphs are the graphs formed by taking a tree
with no degree $2$ vertex and then connecting its leaves to form a cycle in
such a way that the graph has a planar embedding. We prove that if $G$ is a
Halin graph then $b_v(G) \leq 1$ and $b_e(G) \leq 2$. These bounds are tight.
In fact, we prove the stronger result that if $G$ is a planar graph formed by
connecting the leaves of any tree to form a simple cycle, then it has a
VPG-representation using only one type of 1-bend paths and an
EPG-representation using only one type of 2-bend paths.

 <dc:title>Constructing Fully Complete Models of Multiplicative Linear Logic</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The multiplicative fragment of Linear Logic is the formal system in this
family with the best understood proof theory, and the categorical models which
best capture this theory are the fully complete ones. We demonstrate how the
Hyland-Tan double glueing construction produces such categories, either with or
without units, when applied to any of a large family of degenerate models. This
process explains as special cases a number of such models from the literature.
In order to achieve this result, we develop a tensor calculus for compact
closed categories with finite biproducts. We show how the combinatorial
properties required for a fully complete model are obtained by this glueing
construction adding to the structure already available from the original
category.

 <dc:description>  We define two algorithms for propagating information in classification
problems with pairwise relationships. The algorithms are based on contraction
maps and are related to non-linear diffusion and random walks on graphs. The
approach is also related to message passing algorithms, including belief
propagation and mean field methods. The algorithms we describe are guaranteed
to converge on graphs with arbitrary topology. Moreover they always converge to
a unique fixed point, independent of initialization. We prove that the fixed
points of the algorithms under consideration define lower-bounds on the energy
function and the max-marginals of a Markov random field. The theoretical
results also illustrate a relationship between message passing algorithms and
value iteration for an infinite horizon Markov decision process. We illustrate
the practical application of the algorithms under study with numerical
experiments in image restoration, stereo depth estimation and binary
classification on a grid.

 <dc:description>  This paper aims to validate the $\beta$-Ginibre point process as a model for
the distribution of base station locations in a cellular network. The
$\beta$-Ginibre is a repulsive point process in which repulsion is controlled
by the $\beta$ parameter. When $\beta$ tends to zero, the point process
converges in law towards a Poisson point process. If $\beta$ equals to one it
becomes a Ginibre point process. Simulations on real data collected in Paris
(France) show that base station locations can be fitted with a $\beta$-Ginibre
point process. Moreover we prove that their superposition tends to a Poisson
point process as it can be seen from real data. Qualitative interpretations on
deployment strategies are derived from the model fitting of the raw data.

 <dc:title>Communicating with Beeps</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The beep model is a very weak communications model in which devices in a
network can communicate only via beeps and silence. As a result of its weak
assumptions, it has broad applicability to many different implementations of
communications networks. This comes at the cost of a restrictive environment
for algorithm design.
  Despite being only recently introduced, the beep model has received
considerable attention, in part due to its relationship with other
communication models such as that of ad-hoc radio networks. However, there has
been no definitive published result for several fundamental tasks in the model.
We aim to rectify this with our paper.
  We present algorithms for the tasks of broadcast, gossiping, and
multi-broadcast. Our $O(D+\log M)$-time algorithm for broadcasting is a simple
formalization of a concept known as beep waves, and is asymptotically optimal.
We give an $O(n \log L)$-time depth-first search procedure, and show how this
can be used as the basis for an $O(n \log LM)$-time gossiping algorithm.
Finally, we present almost optimal algorithms for the more general problem of
multi-broadcast. When message provenance is required, we give an $O(k \log
\frac{LM}{k}+D \log L)$-time algorithm and a corresponding $\Omega(k \log
\frac{LM}{k}+D)$ lower bound. When provenance is not required, we give an
algorithm taking $O(k \log \frac {M}{k}+D \log L)$ time when $M&gt;k$ and $O(M+D
\log L)$ otherwise, and a corresponding lower bound of $\Omega(k \log
\frac{M}{k}+D)$ when $M&gt;k$ and $\Omega(M+D)$ otherwise.
  Our algorithms are all explicit, deterministic, and practical, and give
efficient means of communication while making arguably the minimum possible
assumptions about the network.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the problem of localizing a mobile device based
on readings from its embedded sensors utilizing machine learning methodologies.
We consider a real-world environment, collect a large dataset of 3110
datapoints, and examine the performance of a substantial number of machine
learning algorithms in localizing a mobile device. We have found algorithms
that give a mean error as accurate as 0.76 meters, outperforming other indoor
localization systems reported in the literature. We also propose a hybrid
instance-based approach that results in a speed increase by a factor of ten
with no loss of accuracy in a live deployment over standard instance-based
methods, allowing for fast and accurate localization. Further, we determine how
smaller datasets collected with less density affect accuracy of localization,
important for use in real-world environments. Finally, we demonstrate that
these approaches are appropriate for real-world deployment by evaluating their
performance in an online, in-motion experiment.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A randomized covering-packing duality between source and channel coding will
be discussed by considering the source coding problem of coding a source with a
certain distortion level and by considering a channel which communicates the
source within a certain distortion level. An operational view of source-channel
separation for communication with a fidelity criterion will be discussed in
brief.

 <dc:title>The complexity of approximately counting in 2-spin systems on
  $k$-uniform bounded-degree hypergraphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Galanis, Andreas</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the most important recent developments in the complexity of
approximate counting is the classification of the complexity of approximating
the partition functions of antiferromagnetic 2-spin systems on bounded-degree
graphs. This classification is based on a beautiful connection to the so-called
uniqueness phase transition from statistical physics on the infinite
$\Delta$-regular tree. Our objective is to study the impact of this
classification on unweighted 2-spin models on $k$-uniform hypergraphs. As has
already been indicated by Yin and Zhao, the connection between the uniqueness
phase transition and the complexity of approximate counting breaks down in the
hypergraph setting. Nevertheless, we show that for every non-trivial symmetric
$k$-ary Boolean function $f$ there exists a degree bound $\Delta_0$ so that for
all $\Delta \geq \Delta_0$ the following problem is NP-hard: given a
$k$-uniform hypergraph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$, approximate the
partition function of the hypergraph 2-spin model associated with $f$. It is
NP-hard to approximate this partition function even within an exponential
factor. By contrast, if $f$ is a trivial symmetric Boolean function (e.g., any
function $f$ that is excluded from our result), then the partition function of
the corresponding hypergraph 2-spin model can be computed exactly in polynomial
time.

 <dc:title>Optimal leader election in multi-hop radio networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Czumaj, Artur</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Davies, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present two optimal randomized leader election algorithms for multi-hop
radio networks, which run in expected time asymptotically equal to the time
required to broadcast one message to the entire network. We first observe that,
under certain assumptions, a simulation approach of Bar-Yehuda, Golreich and
Itai (1991) can be used to obtain an algorithm that for directed and undirected
networks elects a leader in $O(D \log\frac{n}{D} + \log^2 n)$ expected time,
where $n$ is the number of the nodes and $D$ is the eccentricity or the
diameter of the network. We then extend this approach and present a second
algorithm, which operates on undirected multi-hop radio networks with collision
detection and elects a leader in $O(D + \log n)$ expected run-time. This
algorithm in fact operates on the beep model, a strictly weaker model in which
nodes can only communicate via beeps or silence. Both of these algorithms are
optimal; no optimal expected-time algorithms for these models have been
previously known.
  We further apply our techniques to design an algorithm that is quicker to
achieve leader election with high probability. We give an algorithm for the
model without collision detection which always runs in time $O((D
\log\frac{n}{D} + \log^2 n)\cdot \sqrt{\log n})$, and succeeds with high
probability. While non-optimal, and indeed slightly slower than the algorithm
of Ghaffari and Haeupler (2013), it has the advantage of working in directed
networks; it is the fastest known leader election algorithm to achieve a
high-probability bound in such circumstances.

 <dc:title>Automatic Detection of the Common and Non-common Frequencies in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Both sampling a time-varying signal, and its spectral analysis are activities
subjected to theoretically compelling, such as Shannon's theorem and the
objectively limiting of the frequency's resolution. Usually, the signals'
spectra are processed and interpreted by a scientist who, presumably, has
sufficient prior information about the monitored signals to conclude on the
significant frequencies, for example. On the other hand, processing and
interpretation of signals' spectra can be routine tasks that must be automated
using suitable software, i.e. PC application. In the above context, the paper
presents the theoretic bases of an intuitive and practical approach of the
(automatic) detection of the common and non-common frequencies in two or more
congruent spectra.

 <dc:description>  We consider random lattice triangulations of $n\times k$ rectangular regions
with weight $\lambda^{|\sigma|}$ where $\lambda&gt;0$ is a parameter and
$|\sigma|$ denotes the total edge length of the triangulation. When
$\lambda\in(0,1)$ and $k$ is fixed, we prove a tight upper bound of order $n^2$
for the mixing time of the edge-flip Glauber dynamics. Combined with the
previously known lower bound of order $\exp(\Omega(n^2))$ for $\lambda&gt;1$ [3],
this establishes the existence of a dynamical phase transition for thin
rectangles with critical point at $\lambda=1$.

 <dc:title>Design and Implementation of Real-time Algorithms for Eye Tracking and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The alertness level of drivers can be estimated with the use of computer
vision based methods. The level of fatigue can be found from the value of
PERCLOS. It is the ratio of closed eye frames to the total frames processed.
The main objective of the thesis is the design and implementation of real-time
algorithms for measurement of PERCLOS. In this work we have developed a
real-time system which is able to process the video onboard and to alarm the
driver in case the driver is in alert. For accurate estimation of PERCLOS the
frame rate should be greater than 4 and accuracy should be greater than 90%.
For eye detection we have used mainly two approaches Haar classifier based
method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based method for day time. During
night time active Near Infra Red (NIR) illumination is used. Local Binary
Pattern (LBP) histogram based method is used for the detection of eyes at night
time. The accuracy rate of the algorithms was found to be more than 90% at
frame rates more than 5 fps which was suitable for the application.

 <dc:title>Direct Variational Perspective Shape from Shading with Cartesian Depth

 <dc:description>  Most of today's state-of-the-art methods for perspective shape from shading
are modelled in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs) of
Hamilton-Jacobi type. To improve the robustness of such methods w.r.t. noise
and missing data, first approaches have recently been proposed that seek to
embed the underlying PDE into a variational framework with data and smoothness
term. So far, however, such methods either make use of a radial depth
parametrisation that makes the regularisation hard to interpret from a
geometrical viewpoint or they consider indirect smoothness terms that require
additional consistency constraints to provide valid solutions. Moreover the
minimisation of such frameworks is an intricate task, since the underlying
energy is typically non-convex. In our paper we address all three of the
aforementioned issues. First, we propose a novel variational model that
operates directly on the Cartesian depth. In this context, we also point out a
common mistake in the derivation of the surface normal. Moreover, we employ a
direct second-order regulariser with edge-preservation property. This direct
regulariser yields by construction valid solutions without requiring additional
consistency constraints. Finally, we also propose a novel coarse-to-fine
minimisation framework based on an alternating explicit scheme. This framework
allows us to avoid local minima during the minimisation and thus to improve the
accuracy of the reconstruction. Experiments show the good quality of our model
as well as the usefulness of the proposed numerical scheme.

 <dc:description>  We present paired learning and inference algorithms for significantly
reducing computation and increasing speed of the vector dot products in the
classifiers that are at the heart of many NLP components. This is accomplished
by partitioning the features into a sequence of templates which are ordered
such that high confidence can often be reached using only a small fraction of
all features. Parameter estimation is arranged to maximize accuracy and early
confidence in this sequence. Our approach is simpler and better suited to NLP
than other related cascade methods. We present experiments in left-to-right
part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and transition-based
dependency parsing. On the typical benchmarking datasets we can preserve POS
tagging accuracy above 97% and parsing LAS above 88.5% both with over a
five-fold reduction in run-time, and NER F1 above 88 with more than 2x increase
in speed.

 <dc:description>  Privacy in Online Social Networks (OSNs) evolved from a niche topic to a
broadly discussed issue in a wide variety of media. Nevertheless, OSNs
drastically increase the amount of information that can be found about
individuals on the web. To estimate the dimension of data leakage in OSNs, we
measure the real exposure of user content of 4,182 Facebook users from 102
countries in the most popular OSN, Facebook. We further quantify the impact of
a comprehensible privacy control interface that has been shown to extremely
decrease configuration efforts as well as misconfiguration in audience
selection.
  Our study highlights the importance of usable security. (i) The total amount
of content that is visible to Facebook users does not dramatically decrease by
simplifying the audience selection interface, but the composition of the
visible content changes. (ii) Which information is uploaded to Facebook as well
as which information is shared with whom strongly depends on the user's country
of origin.

 <dc:description>  Large kernel systems are prone to be ill-conditioned. Pivoted Cholesky
decomposition (PCD) render a stable and efficient solution to the systems
without a perturbation of regularization. This paper proposes a new PCD
algorithm by tuning Cross Approximation (CA) algorithm to kernel matrices which
merges the merits of PCD and CA, and proves as well as numerically exemplifies
that it solves large kernel systems two-order more efficiently than those
resorts to regularization. As a by-product, a diagonal-pivoted CA technique is
also shown efficient in eigen-decomposition of large covariance matrices in an
uncertainty quantification problem.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new method for studying electromechanical transients in
power systems using three phase, combined transmission and distribution models
(hybrid models). The methodology models individual phases of an electric
network and associated unbalance in load and generation. Therefore, the impacts
of load unbalance, single phase distributed generation and line impedance
unbalance on electromechanical transients can be studied without using
electromagnetic transient simulation (EMTP) programs. The implementation of
this methodology in software is called the Three Phase Dynamics Analyzer
(TPDA). Case studies included in the paper demonstrate the accuracy of TPDA and
its ability to simulate electromechanical transients in hybrid models. TPDA has
the potential for providing electric utilities and power system planners with
more accurate assessment of system stability than traditional dynamic
simulation software that assume balanced network topology.

 <dc:description>  The development of methods to deal with the informative contents of the text
units in the matching process is a major challenge in automatic summary
evaluation systems that use fixed n-gram matching. The limitation causes
inaccurate matching between units in a peer and reference summaries. The
present study introduces a new Keyphrase based Summary Evaluator KpEval for
evaluating automatic summaries. The KpEval relies on the keyphrases since they
convey the most important concepts of a text. In the evaluation process, the
keyphrases are used in their lemma form as the matching text unit. The system
was applied to evaluate different summaries of Arabic multi-document data set
presented at TAC2011. The results showed that the new evaluation technique
correlates well with the known evaluation systems: Rouge1, Rouge2, RougeSU4,
and AutoSummENG MeMoG. KpEval has the strongest correlation with AutoSummENG
MeMoG, Pearson and spearman correlation coefficient measures are 0.8840, 0.9667
respectively.

 <dc:description>  Robust automated organ segmentation is a prerequisite for computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD), quantitative imaging analysis and surgical assistance. For
high-variability organs such as the pancreas, previous approaches report
undesirably low accuracies. We present a bottom-up approach for pancreas
segmentation in abdominal CT scans that is based on a hierarchy of information
propagation by classifying image patches at different resolutions; and
cascading superpixels. There are four stages: 1) decomposing CT slice images as
a set of disjoint boundary-preserving superpixels; 2) computing pancreas class
probability maps via dense patch labeling; 3) classifying superpixels by
pooling both intensity and probability features to form empirical statistics in
cascaded random forest frameworks; and 4) simple connectivity based
post-processing. The dense image patch labeling are conducted by: efficient
random forest classifier on image histogram, location and texture features; and
more expensive (but with better specificity) deep convolutional neural network
classification on larger image windows (with more spatial contexts). Evaluation
of the approach is performed on a database of 80 manually segmented CT volumes
in six-fold cross-validation (CV). Our achieved results are comparable, or
better than the state-of-the-art methods (evaluated by
&quot;leave-one-patient-out&quot;), with Dice 70.7% and Jaccard 57.9%. The computational
efficiency has been drastically improved in the order of 6~8 minutes, comparing
with others of ~10 hours per case. Finally, we implement a multi-atlas label
fusion (MALF) approach for pancreas segmentation using the same datasets. Under
six-fold CV, our bottom-up segmentation method significantly outperforms its
MALF counterpart: (70.7 +/- 13.0%) versus (52.5 +/- 20.8%) in Dice. Deep CNN
patch labeling confidences offer more numerical stability, reflected by smaller
standard deviations.

 <dc:description>  The 3D documentation of the tunnel surface during construction requires fast
and robust measurement systems. In the solution proposed in this paper, during
tunnel advance a single camera is taking pictures of the tunnel surface from
several positions. The recorded images are automatically processed to gain a 3D
tunnel surface model. Image acquisition is realized by the
tunneling/advance/driving personnel close to the tunnel face (= the front end
of the advance). Based on the following fully automatic analysis/evaluation, a
decision on the quality of the outbreak can be made within a few minutes. This
paper describes the image recording system and conditions as well as the
stereo-photogrammetry based workflow for the continuously merged dense 3D
reconstruction of the entire advance region. Geo-reference is realized by means
of signalized targets that are automatically detected in the images. We report
on the results of recent testing under real construction conditions, and
conclude with prospects for further development in terms of on-site
performance.

 <dc:title>PIR with Low Storage Overhead: Coding instead of Replication</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Private information retrieval (PIR) protocols allow a user to retrieve a data
item from a database without revealing any information about the identity of
the item being retrieved. Specifically, in information-theoretic $k$-server
PIR, the database is replicated among $k$ non-communicating servers, and each
server learns nothing about the item retrieved by the user. The cost of PIR
protocols is usually measured in terms of their communication complexity, which
is the total number of bits exchanged between the user and the servers, and
storage overhead, which is the ratio between the total number of bits stored on
all the servers and the number of bits in the database. Since single-server
information-theoretic PIR is impossible, the storage overhead of all existing
PIR protocols is at least $2$.
  In this work, we show that information-theoretic PIR can be achieved with
storage overhead arbitrarily close to the optimal value of $1$, without
sacrificing the communication complexity. Specifically, we prove that all known
$k$-server PIR protocols can be efficiently emulated, while preserving both
privacy and communication complexity but significantly reducing the storage
overhead. To this end, we distribute the $n$ bits of the database among $s+r$
servers, each storing $n/s$ coded bits (rather than replicas). For every fixed
$k$, the resulting storage overhead $(s+r)/s$ approaches $1$ as $s$ grows;
explicitly we have $r\le k\sqrt{s}(1+o(1))$. Moreover, in the special case $k =
2$, the storage overhead is only $1 + \frac{1}{s}$. In order to achieve these
results, we introduce and study a new kind of binary linear codes, called here
$k$-server PIR codes. We then show how such codes can be constructed, and we
establish several bounds on the parameters of $k$-server PIR codes. Finally, we
briefly discuss extensions of our results to nonbinary alphabets, to robust
PIR, and to $t$-private PIR.

 <dc:description>  The Set Covering Machine (SCM) is a greedy learning algorithm that produces
sparse classifiers. We extend the SCM for datasets that contain a huge number
of features. The whole genetic material of living organisms is an example of
such a case, where the number of feature exceeds 10^7. Three human pathogens
were used to evaluate the performance of the SCM at predicting antimicrobial
resistance. Our results show that the SCM compares favorably in terms of
sparsity and accuracy against L1 and L2 regularized Support Vector Machines and
CART decision trees. Moreover, the SCM was the only algorithm that could
consider the full feature space. For all other algorithms, the latter had to be
filtered as a preprocessing step.

 <dc:description>  Video classification has advanced tremendously over the recent years. A large
part of the improvements in video classification had to do with the work done
by the image classification community and the use of deep convolutional
networks (CNNs) which produce competitive results with hand- crafted motion
features. These networks were adapted to use video frames in various ways and
have yielded state of the art classification results. We present two methods
that build on this work, and scale it up to work with millions of videos and
hundreds of thousands of classes while maintaining a low computational cost. In
the context of large scale video processing, training CNNs on video frames is
extremely time consuming, due to the large number of frames involved. We
propose to avoid this problem by training CNNs on either YouTube thumbnails or
Flickr images, and then using these networks' outputs as features for other
higher level classifiers. We discuss the challenges of achieving this and
propose two models for frame-level and video-level classification. The first is
a highly efficient mixture of experts while the latter is based on long short
term memory neural networks. We present results on the Sports-1M video dataset
(1 million videos, 487 classes) and on a new dataset which has 12 million
videos and 150,000 labels.

 <dc:title>On the Tradeoff between Energy Harvesting and Caching in Wireless

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Self-powered, energy harvesting small cell base stations (SBS) are expected
to be an integral part of next-generation wireless networks. However, due to
uncertainties in harvested energy, it is necessary to adopt energy efficient
power control schemes to reduce an SBSs' energy consumption and thus ensure
quality-of-service (QoS) for users. Such energy-efficient design can also be
done via the use of content caching which reduces the usage of the
capacity-limited SBS backhaul. of popular content at SBS can also prove
beneficial in this regard by reducing the backhaul usage. In this paper, an
online energy efficient power control scheme is developed for an energy
harvesting SBS equipped with a wireless backhaul and local storage. In our
model, energy arrivals are assumed to be Poisson distributed and the popularity
distribution of requested content is modeled using Zipf's law. The power
control problem is formulated as a (discounted) infinite horizon dynamic
programming problem and solved numerically using the value iteration algorithm.
Using simulations, we provide valuable insights on the impact of energy
harvesting and caching on the energy and sum-throughput performance of the SBS
as the network size is varied. Our results also show that the size of cache and
energy harvesting equipment at the SBS can be traded off, while still meeting
the desired system performance.

 <dc:description>  Semantic relation extraction is one of the frontiers of biomedical natural
language processing research. Gold standards are key tools for advancing this
research. It is challenging to generate these standards because of the high
cost of expert time and the difficulty in establishing agreement between
annotators. We implemented and evaluated a microtask crowdsourcing approach
that can produce a gold standard for extracting drug-disease relations. The
aggregated crowd judgment agreed with expert annotations from a pre-existing
corpus on 43 of 60 sentences tested. The levels of crowd agreement varied in a
similar manner to the levels of agreement among the original expert annotators.
This work rein-forces the power of crowdsourcing in the process of assembling
gold standards for relation extraction. Further, it high-lights the importance
of exposing the levels of agreement between human annotators, expert or crowd,
in gold standard corpora as these are reproducible signals indicating
ambiguities in the data or in the annotation guidelines.

 <dc:description>  Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an emerging network architecture designed
to overcome limitations of the current IP-based Internet. One of the
fundamental tenets of CCN is that data, or content, is a named and addressable
entity in the network. Consumers request content by issuing interest messages
with the desired content name. These interests are forwarded by routers to
producers, and the resulting content object is returned and optionally cached
at each router along the path. In-network caching makes it difficult to enforce
access control policies on sensitive content outside of the producer since
routers only use interest information for forwarding decisions. To that end, we
propose an Interest-Based Access Control (IBAC) scheme that enables access
control enforcement using only information contained in interest messages,
i.e., by making sensitive content names unpredictable to unauthorized parties.
Our IBAC scheme supports both hash- and encryption-based name obfuscation. We
address the problem of interest replay attacks by formulating a mutual trust
framework between producers and consumers that enables routers to perform
authorization checks when satisfying interests from their cache. We assess the
computational, storage, and bandwidth overhead of each IBAC variant. Our design
is flexible and allows producers to arbitrarily specify and enforce any type of
access control on content, without having to deal with the problems of content
encryption and key distribution. This is the first comprehensive design for CCN
access control using only information contained in interest messages.

 <dc:title>New DNA Cyclic Codes over Rings</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is dealing with DNA cyclic codes which play an important role in
DNA computing and have attracted a particular attention in the literature.
Firstly, we introduce a new family of DNA cyclic codes over the ring
$R=\mathbb{F}_2[u]/(u^6)$. Such codes have theoretical advantages as well as
several applications in DNA computing. A direct link between the elements of
such a ring and the $64$ codons used in the amino acids of the living organisms
is established. Such a correspondence allows us to extend the notion of the
edit distance to the ring $R$ which is useful for the correction of the
insertion, deletion and substitution errors. Next, we define the Lee weight,
the Gray map over the ring $R$ as well as the binary image of the cyclic DNA
codes allowing the transfer of studying DNA codes into studying binary codes.
Secondly, we introduce another new family of DNA skew cyclic codes constructed
over the ring $\tilde {R}=\mathbb{F}_2+v\mathbb{F}_2=\{0,1,v,v+1\}$ where
$v^2=v$ and study their property of being reverse-complement. We show that the
obtained code is derived from the cyclic reverse-complement code over the ring
$\tilde {R}$. We shall provide the binary images and present some explicit
examples of such codes.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of recovering two-dimensional (2-D) block-sparse
signals with \emph{unknown} cluster patterns. Two-dimensional block-sparse
patterns arise naturally in many practical applications such as foreground
detection and inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging. To exploit the
block-sparse structure, we introduce a 2-D pattern-coupled hierarchical
Gaussian prior model to characterize the statistical pattern dependencies among
neighboring coefficients. Unlike the conventional hierarchical Gaussian prior
model where each coefficient is associated independently with a unique
hyperparameter, the pattern-coupled prior for each coefficient not only
involves its own hyperparameter, but also its immediate neighboring
hyperparameters. Thus the sparsity patterns of neighboring coefficients are
related to each other and the hierarchical model has the potential to encourage
2-D structured-sparse solutions. An expectation-maximization (EM) strategy is
employed to obtain the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate of the
hyperparameters, along with the posterior distribution of the sparse signal. In
addition, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is
embedded into the EM framework to efficiently compute an approximation of the
posterior distribution of hidden variables, which results in a significant
reduction in computational complexity. Numerical results are provided to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We discuss a general method to learn data representations from multiple
tasks. We provide a justification for this method in both settings of multitask
learning and learning-to-learn. The method is illustrated in detail in the
special case of linear feature learning. Conditions on the theoretical
advantage offered by multitask representation learning over independent task
learning are established. In particular, focusing on the important example of
half-space learning, we derive the regime in which multitask representation
learning is beneficial over independent task learning, as a function of the
sample size, the number of tasks and the intrinsic data dimensionality. Other
potential applications of our results include multitask feature learning in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and multilayer, deep networks.

 <dc:description>  We study how risk-sensitive players act in situations where the outcome is
influenced not only by the state-action profile but also by the distribution of
it. In such interactive decision-making problems, the classical mean-field game
framework does not apply. We depart from most of the mean-field games
literature by presuming that a decision-maker may include its own-state
distribution in its decision. This leads to the class of mean-field-type games.
In mean-field-type situations, a single decision-maker may have a big impact on
the mean-field terms for which new type of optimality equations are derived. We
establish a finite dimensional stochastic maximum principle for mean-field-type
games where the drift functions have a p-norm structure which weaken the
classical Lipschitz and differentiability assumptions. Sufficient optimality
equations are established via Dynamic Programming Principle but in infinite
dimension. Using de Finetti-Hewitt-Savage theorem, we show that a propagation
of chaos property with 'virtual' particles holds for the non-linear
McKean-Vlasov dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Detecting the interactions of genetic compounds like genes, SNPs, proteins,
metabolites, etc. can potentially unravel the mechanisms behind complex traits
and common genetic disorders. Several methods have been taken into
consideration for the analysis of different types of genetic data, regression
being one of the most widely adopted. Without any doubt, a common data type is
represented by gene expression profiles, from which gene regulatory networks
have been inferred with different approaches. In this work we review nine
penalised regression methods applied to microarray data to infer the topology
of the network of interactions. We evaluate each method with respect to the
complexity of biological data. We analyse the limitations of each of them in
order to suggest a number of precautions that should be considered to make
their predictions more significant and reliable.

 <dc:title>A Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial Time Algorithm for Two Graph
  Bisection Problems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The aim of the paper is to propose a bounded-error quantum polynomial time
(BQP) algorithm for the max-bisection and the min-bisection problems. The
max-bisection and the min-bisection problems are fundamental NP-hard problems.
Given a graph with even number of vertices, the aim of the max-bisection
problem is to divide the vertices into two subsets of the same size to maximize
the number of edges between the two subsets, while the aim of the min-bisection
problem is to minimize the number of edges between the two subsets. The
proposed algorithm runs in $O(m^2)$ for a graph with $m$ edges and in the worst
case runs in $O(n^4)$ for a dense graph with $n$ vertices. The proposed
algorithm targets a general graph by representing both problems as Boolean
constraint satisfaction problems where the set of satisfied constraints are
simultaneously maximized/minimized using a novel iterative partial negation and
partial measurement technique. The algorithm is shown to achieve an arbitrary
high probability of success of $1-\epsilon$ for small $\epsilon&gt;0$ using a
polynomial space resources.

 <dc:description>  Recently the influence maximization problem has received much attention for
its applications on viral marketing and product promotions. However, such
influence maximization problems have not taken into account the monetary effect
on the purchasing decision of individuals. To fulfill this gap, in this paper,
we aim for maximizing the revenue by considering the quantity constraint on the
promoted commodity. For this problem, we not only identify a proper small group
of individuals as seeds for promotion but also determine the pricing of the
commodity. To tackle the revenue maximization problem, we first introduce a
strategic searching algorithm, referred to as Algorithm PRUB, which is able to
derive the optimal solutions. After that, we further modify PRUB to propose a
heuristic, Algorithm PRUB+IF, for obtaining feasible solutions more effciently
on larger instances. Experiments on real social networks with different
valuation distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUB and PRUB+IF.

 <dc:description>  The ability to map descriptions of scenes to 3D geometric representations has
many applications in areas such as art, education, and robotics. However, prior
work on the text to 3D scene generation task has used manually specified object
categories and language that identifies them. We introduce a dataset of 3D
scenes annotated with natural language descriptions and learn from this data
how to ground textual descriptions to physical objects. Our method successfully
grounds a variety of lexical terms to concrete referents, and we show
quantitatively that our method improves 3D scene generation over previous work
using purely rule-based methods. We evaluate the fidelity and plausibility of
3D scenes generated with our grounding approach through human judgments. To
ease evaluation on this task, we also introduce an automated metric that
strongly correlates with human judgments.

 <dc:description>  We propose and study a row-and-column affine measurement scheme for low-rank
matrix recovery. Each measurement is a linear combination of elements in one
row or one column of a matrix $X$. This setting arises naturally in
applications from different domains. However, current algorithms developed for
standard matrix recovery problems do not perform well in our case, hence the
need for developing new algorithms and theory for our problem. We propose a
simple algorithm for the problem based on Singular Value Decomposition ($SVD$)
and least-squares ($LS$), which we term \alg. We prove that (a simplified
version of) our algorithm can recover $X$ exactly with the minimum possible
number of measurements in the noiseless case. In the general noisy case, we
prove performance guarantees on the reconstruction accuracy under the Frobenius
norm. In simulations, our row-and-column design and \alg algorithm show
improved speed, and comparable and in some cases better accuracy compared to
standard measurements designs and algorithms. Our theoretical and experimental
results suggest that the proposed row-and-column affine measurements scheme,
together with our recovery algorithm, may provide a powerful framework for
affine matrix reconstruction.

 <dc:description>  The categorical compositional distributional model of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and
Clark provides a linguistically motivated procedure for computing the meaning
of a sentence as a function of the distributional meaning of the words therein.
The theoretical framework allows for reasoning about compositional aspects of
language and offers structural ways of studying the underlying relationships.
While the model so far has been applied on the level of syntactic structures, a
sentence can bring extra information conveyed in utterances via intonational
means. In the current paper we extend the framework in order to accommodate
this additional information, using Frobenius algebraic structures canonically
induced over the basis of finite-dimensional vector spaces. We detail the
theory, provide truth-theoretic and distributional semantics for meanings of
intonationally-marked utterances, and present justifications and extensive
examples.

 <dc:description>  Algorithms for search of communities in networks usually consist discrete
variations of links. Here we discuss a flow method, driven by a set of
differential equations. Two examples are demonstrated in detail. First is a
partition of a signed graph into two parts, where the proposed equations are
interpreted in terms of removal of a cognitive dissonance by agents placed in
the network nodes. There, the signs and values of links refer to positive or
negative interpersonal relationships of different strength. Second is an
application of a method akin to the previous one, dedicated to communities
identification, to the Sierpinski triangle of finite size. During the time
evolution, the related graphs are weighted; yet at the end the discrete
character of links is restored. In the case of the Sierpinski triangle, the
method is supplemented by adding a small noise to the initial connectivity
matrix. By breaking the symmetry of the network, this allows to a successful
handling of overlapping nodes.

 <dc:description>  High school and college graduates seemingly are often battling for the
courses they should major in order to achieve their target career. In this
paper, we worked on suggesting a career path to a graduate to reach his/her
dream career given the current educational status. Firstly, we collected the
career data of professionals and academicians from various career fields and
compiled the data set by using the necessary information from the data.
Further, this was used as the basis to suggest the most appropriate career path
for the person given his/her current educational status. Decision trees and
string matching algorithms were employed to suggest the appropriate career path
for a person. Finally, an analysis of the result has been done directing to
further improvements in the model.

temporal operators. Its expressivity in capturing both space and time
robustness helps solving falsification problems, (i.e. searching for a critical
path in hybrid system models); it does so by communicating a designer's
intention more faithfully to the stochastic optimization engine employed in a
falsification solver. We also introduce a sliding window-like algorithm that
keeps the cost of computing truth/robustness values tractable.

 <dc:description>  In a class of methods for measurement of available path capacity and other
capacity-related metrics in a network, trains of probe packets are transmitted
from a sender to a receiver across a network path, and the sequences of time
stamps at sending and reception are analyzed. In large-scale implementations
there may potentially be interference between the probe-packet trains
corresponding to several concurrent measurement sessions, due to congestion in
the network and common measurement end points.
  This paper outlines principles for large-scale deployments of network
capacity measurement methods using standardized network functionality. Further,
the paper provides an in-depth study of dimensioning and scalability challenges
related to the measurement end-points of such systems.
  The main result is a framework for dimensioning of large-scale network
capacity measurement systems based on TWAMP. The framework is based on a method
for explicit calculation of queuelength and waiting-time distributions, where
results from M/G/1 queuing theory are combined with Monte Carlo integration.

 <dc:description>  We study six months of human mobility data, including WiFi and GPS traces
recorded with high temporal resolution, and find that time series of WiFi scans
contain a strong latent location signal. In fact, due to inherent stability and
low entropy of human mobility, it is possible to assign location to WiFi access
points based on a very small number of GPS samples and then use these access
points as location beacons. Using just one GPS observation per day per person
allows us to estimate the location of, and subsequently use, WiFi access points
to account for 80\% of mobility across a population. These results reveal a
great opportunity for using ubiquitous WiFi routers for high-resolution outdoor
positioning, but also significant privacy implications of such side-channel
location tracking.

 <dc:title>A network approach for power grid robustness against cascading failures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Cascading failures are one of the main reasons for blackouts in electrical
power grids. Stable power supply requires a robust design of the power grid
topology. Currently, the impact of the grid structure on the grid robustness is
mainly assessed by purely topological metrics, that fail to capture the
fundamental properties of the electrical power grids such as power flow
allocation according to Kirchhoff's laws. This paper deploys the effective
graph resistance as a metric to relate the topology of a grid to its robustness
against cascading failures. Specifically, the effective graph resistance is
deployed as a metric for network expansions (by means of transmission line
additions) of an existing power grid. Four strategies based on network
properties are investigated to optimize the effective graph resistance,
accordingly to improve the robustness, of a given power grid at a low
computational complexity. Experimental results suggest the existence of
Braess's paradox in power grids: bringing an additional line into the system
occasionally results in decrease of the grid robustness. This paper further
investigates the impact of the topology on the Braess's paradox, and identifies
specific sub-structures whose existence results in Braess's paradox. Careful
assessment of the design and expansion choices of grid topologies incorporating
the insights provided by this paper optimizes the robustness of a power grid,
while avoiding the Braess's paradox in the system.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analyze the Gaussian X channel in the mixed interference
regime. In this regime, multiple access transmission to one of the receivers is
shown to be close to optimal in terms of sum rate. Three upper bounds are
derived for the sum capacity in the mixed interference regime, and the
subregions where each of these bounds dominate the others are identified. The
genie-aided sum capacity upper bounds derived also show that the gap between
sum capacity and the sum rate of the multiple access transmission scheme is
small for a significant part of the mixed interference region. For any \delta &gt;
0, the region where multiple access transmission to one of the receivers is
within \delta from sum capacity is determined.

 <dc:title>The Minimum Spanning Tree of Maximum Entropy</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In computer vision, we have the problem of creating graphs out of
unstructured point-sets, i.e. the data graph. A common approach for this
problem consists of building a triangulation which might not always lead to the
best solution. Small changes in the location of the points might generate
graphs with unstable configurations and the topology of the graph could change
significantly. After building the data-graph, one could apply Graph Matching
techniques to register the original point-sets. In this paper, we propose a
data graph technique based on the Minimum Spanning Tree of Maximum Entropty
(MSTME). We aim at a data graph construction which could be more stable than
the Delaunay triangulation with respect to small variations in the neighborhood
of points. Our technique aims at creating data graphs which could help the
point-set registration process. We propose an algorithm with a single free
parameter that weighs the importance between the total weight cost and the
entropy of the current spanning tree. We compare our algorithm on a number of
different databases with the Delaunay triangulation.

 <dc:title>Infinite subgame perfect equilibrium in the Hausdorff difference

 <dc:description>  Subgame perfect equilibria are specific Nash equilibria in perfect
information games in extensive form. They are important because they relate to
the rationality of the players. They always exist in infinite games with
continuous real-valued payoffs, but may fail to exist even in simple games with
slightly discontinuous payoffs. This article considers only games whose outcome
functions are measurable in the Hausdorff difference hierarchy of the open sets
(\textit{i.e.} $\Delta^0_2$ when in the Baire space), and it characterizes the
families of linear preferences such that every game using these preferences has
a subgame perfect equilibrium: the preferences without infinite ascending
chains (of course), and such that for all players $a$ and $b$ and outcomes
$x,y,z$ we have $\neg(z &lt;_a y &lt;_a x \,\wedge\, x &lt;_b z &lt;_b y)$. Moreover at
each node of the game, the equilibrium constructed for the proof is
Pareto-optimal among all the outcomes occurring in the subgame. Additional
results for non-linear preferences are presented.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we present our improved algorithm for error localization
from counterexamples, LocFaults, flow-driven and constraint-based. This
algorithm analyzes the paths of CFG (Control Flow Graph) of the erroneous
program to calculate the subsets of suspicious instructions to correct the
program. Indeed, we generate a system of constraints for paths of control flow
graph for which at most k conditional statements can be wrong. Then we compute
the MCSs (Minimal Correction Set) of bounded size on each of these paths.
Removal of one of these sets of constraints gives maximal satisfiable subset,
in other words, a maximal satisfiable subset satisfying the postcondition. To
calculate the MCSs, we extend the generic algorithm proposed by Liffiton and
Sakallah in order to deal programs with numerical instructions more
effectively. We are interested to present the incremental aspect of this new
algorithm that is not yet presented.

 <dc:description>  A current-mode CMOS design is proposed for realizing receive mode multi-beams
in the analog domain using a novel DFT approximation. High-bandwidth CMOS RF
transistors are employed in low-voltage current mirrors to achieve bandwidths
exceeding 4 GHz with good beam fidelity. Current mirrors realize the
coefficients of the considered DFT approximation, which take simple values in
$\{0, \pm1, \pm2\}$ only. This allows high bandwidths realizations using simple
circuitry without needing phase-shifters or delays. The proposed design is used
as a method to efficiently achieve spatial discrete Fourier transform operation
across a ULA to obtain multiple simultaneous RF beams. An example using 1.2 V
current-mode approximate DFT on 65 nm CMOS, with BSIM4 models from the RF kit,
show potential operation up to 4 GHz with eight independent aperture beams.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchical organization -- the recursive composition of sub-modules -- is
ubiquitous in biological networks, including neural, metabolic, ecological, and
genetic regulatory networks, and in human-made systems, such as large
organizations and the Internet. To date, most research on hierarchy in networks
has been limited to quantifying this property. However, an open, important
question in evolutionary biology is why hierarchical organization evolves in
the first place. It has recently been shown that modularity evolves because of
the presence of a cost for network connections. Here we investigate whether
such connection costs also tend to cause a hierarchical organization of such
modules. In computational simulations, we find that networks without a
connection cost do not evolve to be hierarchical, even when the task has a
hierarchical structure. However, with a connection cost, networks evolve to be
both modular and hierarchical, and these networks exhibit higher overall
performance and evolvability (i.e. faster adaptation to new environments).
Additional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability
after controlling for modularity. Overall, our results suggest that the same
force--the cost of connections--promotes the evolution of both hierarchy and
modularity, and that these properties are important drivers of network
performance and adaptability. In addition to shedding light on the emergence of
hierarchy across the many domains in which it appears, these findings will also
accelerate future research into evolving more complex, intelligent
computational brains in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

 <dc:description>  The Kumbh is a religious Hindu festival that has been celebrated for
centuries. The 2013 Kumbh Mela, a grander form of the annual Kumbh, was
purportedly the largest gathering of people in human history. Many of the
participants carried cell phones, making it possible for us to use a
data-driven approach to document this magnificent festival. We used Call Detail
Records (CDRs) from participants attending the event, a total of 390 million
records, to investigate its population dynamics. We report here on some of our
preliminary findings.

 <dc:title>Polynomially Low Error PCPs with polyloglog n Queries via Modular

 <dc:description>  We show that every language in NP has a PCP verifier that tosses $O(\log n)$
random coins, has perfect completeness, and a soundness error of at most
$1/\text{poly}(n)$, while making at most $O(\text{poly}\log\log n)$ queries
into a proof over an alphabet of size at most $n^{1/\text{poly}\log\log n}$.
Previous constructions that obtain $1/\text{poly}(n)$ soundness error used
either $\text{poly}\log n $ queries or an exponential sized alphabet, i.e. of
size $2^{n^c}$ for some $c&gt;0$. Our result is an exponential improvement in both
parameters simultaneously.
  Our result can be phrased as a polynomial-gap hardness for approximate CSPs
with arity $\text{poly}\log\log n$ and alphabet size $n^{1/\text{poly}\log n}$.
The ultimate goal, in this direction, would be to prove polynomial hardness for
CSPs with constant arity and polynomial alphabet size (aka the sliding scale
conjecture for inverse polynomial soundness error).
  Our construction is based on a modular generalization of previous PCP
constructions in this parameter regime, which involves a composition theorem
that uses an extra `consistency' query but maintains the inverse polynomial
relation between the soundness error and the alphabet size.
  Our main technical/conceptual contribution is a new notion of soundness,
which we refer to as {\em distributional soundness}, that replaces the previous
notion of &quot;list decoding soundness&quot;, and that allows us to prove a modular
composition theorem with tighter parameters. This new notion of soundness
allows us to invoke composition a super-constant number of times without
incurring a blow-up in the soundness error.

 <dc:title>Open Ended Intelligence: The individuation of Intelligent Agents</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weinbaum, David</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Artificial General Intelligence is a field of research aiming to distill the
principles of intelligence that operate independently of a specific problem
domain or a predefined context and utilize these principles in order to
synthesize systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human being is
capable of and eventually go beyond that. While &quot;narrow&quot; artificial
intelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech
recognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic motion,
etc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding
general intelligence remains elusive. In the paper we offer a novel theoretical
approach to understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief
introduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number
of serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the
concept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence
perceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a
priori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative
process of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We
call this process open-ended intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is developed
as an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application
can be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three
facets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making
and the individuation of general cognitive agents. We further show how
open-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed,
self-organizing network of interacting elements and how such process is
scalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination
and intelligence and a new understanding of values. We conclude with a number
of questions for future research.

 <dc:description>  We prove the syntactic soundness of classical tableaux with free variables
and on-the-fly Skolemization. Soundness proofs are usually built from semantic
arguments, and this is to our knowledge, the first proof that appeals to
syntactic means. We actually prove the soundness property with respect to
cut-free sequent calculus. This requires great care because of the additional
liberty in freshness checking allowed by the use of Skolem terms. In contrast
to semantic soundness, we gain the possibility to state a cut elimination
theorem for sequent calculus, under the proviso that completeness of the method
holds. We believe that such techniques can be applied to tableaux in other
logics as well.

 <dc:description>  Real-world machine learning applications may require functions that are
fast-to-evaluate and interpretable. In particular, guaranteed monotonicity of
the learned function can be critical to user trust. We propose meeting these
goals for low-dimensional machine learning problems by learning flexible,
monotonic functions using calibrated interpolated look-up tables. We extend the
structural risk minimization framework of lattice regression to train monotonic
look-up tables by solving a convex problem with appropriate linear inequality
constraints. In addition, we propose jointly learning interpretable
calibrations of each feature to normalize continuous features and handle
categorical or missing data, at the cost of making the objective non-convex. We
address large-scale learning through parallelization, mini-batching, and
propose random sampling of additive regularizer terms. Case studies with
real-world problems with five to sixteen features and thousands to millions of
training samples demonstrate the proposed monotonic functions can achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy on practical problems while providing greater
transparency to users.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a communication-free algorithm for distributed
coverage of an arbitrary network by a group of mobile agents with local sensing
capabilities. The network is represented as a graph, and the agents are
arbitrarily deployed on some nodes of the graph. Any node of the graph is
covered if it is within the sensing range of at least one agent. The agents are
mobile devices that aim to explore the graph and to optimize their locations in
a decentralized fashion by relying only on their sensory inputs. We formulate
this problem in a game theoretic setting and propose a communication-free
learning algorithm for maximizing the coverage.

 <dc:description>  The &quot;Local Ranking Problem&quot; (LRP) is related to the computation of a
centrality-like rank on a local graph, where the scores of the nodes could
significantly differ from the ones computed on the global graph. Previous work
has studied LRP on the hyperlink graph but never on the BrowseGraph, namely a
graph where nodes are webpages and edges are browsing transitions. Recently,
this graph has received more and more attention in many different tasks such as
ranking, prediction and recommendation. However, a web-server has only the
browsing traffic performed on its pages (local BrowseGraph) and, as a
consequence, the local computation can lead to estimation errors, which hinders
the increasing number of applications in the state of the art. Also, although
the divergence between the local and global ranks has been measured, the
possibility of estimating such divergence using only local knowledge has been
mainly overlooked. These aspects are of great interest for online service
providers who want to: (i) gauge their ability to correctly assess the
importance of their resources only based on their local knowledge, and (ii)
take into account real user browsing fluxes that better capture the actual user
interest than the static hyperlink network. We study the LRP problem on a
BrowseGraph from a large news provider, considering as subgraphs the
aggregations of browsing traces of users coming from different domains. We show
that the distance between rankings can be accurately predicted based only on
structural information of the local graph, being able to achieve an average
rank correlation as high as 0.8.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates one of the most fundamental computer vision problems:
image segmentation. We propose a supervised hierarchical approach to
object-independent image segmentation. Starting with over-segmenting
superpixels, we use a tree structure to represent the hierarchy of region
merging, by which we reduce the problem of segmenting image regions to finding
a set of label assignment to tree nodes. We formulate the tree structure as a
constrained conditional model to associate region merging with likelihoods
predicted using an ensemble boundary classifier. Final segmentations can then
be inferred by finding globally optimal solutions to the model efficiently. We
also present an iterative training and testing algorithm that generates various
tree structures and combines them to emphasize accurate boundaries by
segmentation accumulation. Experiment results and comparisons with other very
recent methods on six public data sets demonstrate that our approach achieves
the state-of-the-art region accuracy and is very competitive in image
segmentation without semantic priors.

 <dc:title>Domain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machines for Drift Compensation in

 <dc:creator>Zhang, Lei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses an important issue, known as sensor drift that behaves a
nonlinear dynamic property in electronic nose (E-nose), from the viewpoint of
machine learning. Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and
costly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples
recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be
efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and
regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised
and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e. source domain). To
our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been
studied. This paper proposes a unified framework, referred to as Domain
Adaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier
by leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift
compensation as well as gases recognition in E-nose systems, without loss of
the computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the
unified framework, two algorithms called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for
the purpose of this paper, respectively. In order to percept the differences
among ELM, DAELM-S and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided. Experiments on the
popular sensor drift data with multiple batches collected by E-nose system
clearly demonstrate that the proposed DAELM significantly outperforms existing
drift compensation methods without cumbersome measures, and also bring new
perspectives for ELM.

 <dc:description>  Although quantum key distribution (QKD) comes from the development of quantum
theory, the implementation of a practical QKD system does involve a lot of
classical process, such as key reconciliation and privacy amplification, which
is called post-processing. Post-processing has been a crucial element to high
speed QKD systems, even the bottleneck of it because of its relatively high
time consumption. Low density parity check (LDPC) is now becoming a promising
approach of overcoming the bottleneck due to its good performance in processing
throughput. In this article we propose and simulate an easily implemented but
efficiently rate-adaptive LDPC coding approach of reconciliation, different
from the previously proposed puncturing- and shortening-based approach. We also
give a measure for choosing the optimal LDPC parameter for our rate-adaptive
approach according to error rates.

multiplications and 992 real additions. The proposed algorithm can compute the
same result with only 512 real multiplications and 576 real additions. The
derivation of our algorithm is based on utilizing the fact that multiplication
of two Kaluza numbers can be expressed as a matrixvector product. The matrix
multiplicand that participates in the product calculating has unique structural
properties. Namely exploitation of these specific properties leads to
significant reducing of the complexity of Kaluza numbers multiplication.

 <dc:description>  Recent research shows that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to extract
deep speaker vectors (d-vectors) that preserve speaker characteristics and can
be used in speaker verification. This new method has been tested on
text-dependent speaker verification tasks, and improvement was reported when
combined with the conventional i-vector method.
  This paper extends the d-vector approach to semi text-independent speaker
verification tasks, i.e., the text of the speech is in a limited set of short
phrases. We explore various settings of the DNN structure used for d-vector
extraction, and present a phone-dependent training which employs the posterior
features obtained from an ASR system. The experimental results show that it is
possible to apply d-vectors on semi text-independent speaker recognition, and
the phone-dependent training improves system performance.

 <dc:description>  There is a well-known asymptotic formula, due to W. M. Schmidt (1968) for the
number of full-rank integer lattices of index at most $V$ in $\mathbb{Z}^n$.
This set of lattices $L$ can naturally be partitioned with respect to the
factor group $\mathbb{Z}^n/L$. Accordingly, we count the number of full-rank
integer lattices $L \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\mathbb{Z}^n/L$ is
cyclic and of order at most $V$, and deduce that these co-cyclic lattices are
dominant among all integer lattices: their natural density is $\left(\zeta(6)
\prod_{k=4}^n \zeta(k)\right)^{-1} \approx 85\%$. The problem is motivated by
complexity theory, namely worst-case to average-case reductions for lattice
problems.

 <dc:description>  Biodiversity monitoring using audio recordings is achievable at a truly
global scale via large-scale deployment of inexpensive, unattended recording
stations or by large-scale crowdsourcing using recording and species
recognition on mobile devices. The ability, however, to reliably identify
vocalising animal species is limited by the fact that acoustic signatures of
interest in such recordings are typically embedded in a diverse and complex
acoustic background. To avoid the problems associated with modelling such
backgrounds, we build generative models of bird sounds and use the concept of
novelty detection to screen recordings to detect sections of data which are
likely bird vocalisations. We present detection results against various
acoustic environments and different signal-to-noise ratios. We discuss the
issues related to selecting the cost function and setting detection thresholds
in such algorithms. Our methods are designed to be scalable and automatically
applicable to arbitrary selections of species depending on the specific
geographic region and time period of deployment.

 <dc:title>Efficient Elastic Net Regularization for Sparse Linear Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lipton, Zachary C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Elkan, Charles</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents an algorithm for efficient training of sparse linear
models with elastic net regularization. Extending previous work on delayed
updates, the new algorithm applies stochastic gradient updates to non-zero
features only, bringing weights current as needed with closed-form updates.
Closed-form delayed updates for the $\ell_1$, $\ell_{\infty}$, and rarely used
$\ell_2$ regularizers have been described previously. This paper provides
closed-form updates for the popular squared norm $\ell^2_2$ and elastic net
regularizers.
  We provide dynamic programming algorithms that perform each delayed update in
constant time. The new $\ell^2_2$ and elastic net methods handle both fixed and
varying learning rates, and both standard {stochastic gradient descent} (SGD)
and {forward backward splitting (FoBoS)}. Experimental results show that on a
bag-of-words dataset with $260,941$ features, but only $88$ nonzero features on
average per training example, the dynamic programming method trains a logistic
regression classifier with elastic net regularization over $2000$ times faster
than otherwise.

 <dc:description>  Growth dynamic of real networks because of emerging complexities is an open
and interesting question. Indeed it is not realistic to ignore history impact
on the current events. The mystery behind that complexity could be in the role
of history in some how. To regard this point, the average effect of history has
been included by a kernel function in differential equation of Barabasi Albert
(BA) model . This approach leads to a fractional order BA differential equation
as a generalization of BA model. As opposed to unlimited growth for degree of
nodes, our results show that over time the memory impact will cause a decay for
degrees. This gives a higher chance to younger members for turning to a hub. In
fact in a real network, there are two competitive processes. On one hand, based
on preferential attachment mechanism nodes with higher degree are more likely
to absorb links. On the other hand, node history through aging process prevents
new connections. Our findings from simulating a network grown by considering
these effects also from studying a real network of collaboration between
Hollywood movie actors conforms the results and significant effects of history
and time on dynamic.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of partitioning active users in a
manner that facilitates multi-access without collision. The setting is of a
noisy, synchronous, Boolean, multi-access channel where $K$ active users (out
of a total of $N$ users) seek to access. A solution to the partition problem
places each of the $N$ users in one of $K$ groups (or blocks) such that no two
active nodes are in the same block. We consider a simple, but non-trivial and
illustrative case of $K=2$ active users and study the number of steps $T$ used
to solve the partition problem. By random coding and a suboptimal decoding
scheme, we show that for any $T\geq (C_1 +\xi_1)\log N$, where $C_1$ and
$\xi_1$ are positive constants (independent of $N$), and $\xi_1$ can be
arbitrary small, the partition problem can be solved with error probability
$P_e^{(N)} \to 0$, for large $N$. Under the same scheme, we also bound $T$ from
the other direction, establishing that, for any $T \leq (C_2 - \xi_2) \log N$,
the error probability $P_e^{(N)} \to 1$ for large $N$; again $C_2$ and $\xi_2$
are constants and $\xi_2$ can be arbitrarily small. These bounds on the number
of steps are lower than the tight achievable lower-bound in terms of $T \geq
(C_g +\xi)\log N $ for group testing (in which all active users are identified,
rather than just partitioned). Thus, partitioning may prove to be a more
efficient approach for multi-access than group testing.

 <dc:description>  A Sleeping Beauty (SB) in science refers to a paper whose importance is not
recognized for several years after publication. Its citation history exhibits a
long hibernation period followed by a sudden spike of popularity. Previous
studies suggest a relative scarcity of SBs. The reliability of this conclusion
is, however, heavily dependent on identification methods based on arbitrary
threshold parameters for sleeping time and number of citations, applied to
small or monodisciplinary bibliographic datasets. Here we present a systematic,
large-scale, and multidisciplinary analysis of the SB phenomenon in science. We
introduce a parameter-free measure that quantifies the extent to which a
specific paper can be considered an SB. We apply our method to 22 million
scientific papers published in all disciplines of natural and social sciences
over a time span longer than a century. Our results reveal that the SB
phenomenon is not exceptional. There is a continuous spectrum of delayed
recognition where both the hibernation period and the awakening intensity are
taken into account. Although many cases of SBs can be identified by looking at
monodisciplinary bibliographic data, the SB phenomenon becomes much more
apparent with the analysis of multidisciplinary datasets, where we can observe
many examples of papers achieving delayed yet exceptional importance in
disciplines different from those where they were originally published. Our
analysis emphasizes a complex feature of citation dynamics that so far has
received little attention, and also provides empirical evidence against the use
of short-term citation metrics in the quantification of scientific impact.

 <dc:title>ISS With Respect to Boundary Disturbances for 1-D Parabolic PDES</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Due to unbounded input operators in partial differential equations (PDEs)
with boundary inputs, there has been a long-held intuition that input-to-state
stability (ISS) properties and finite gains cannot be established with respect
to disturbances at the boundary. This intuition has been reinforced by many
unsuccessful attempts, as well as by the success in establishing ISS only with
respect to the derivative of the disturbance. Contrary to this intuition, we
establish such a result for parabolic PDEs. Our methodology does not rely on
the transformation of the boundary disturbance to a distributed input and the
stability analysis is performed in time-varying subsets of the state space. The
obtained results are used for the comparison of the gain coefficients of
transport PDEs with respect to inlet disturbances and for the establishment of
the ISS property with respect to control actuator errors for parabolic systems
under boundary feedback control.

 <dc:description>  We prove the correctness of a recently-proposed cache coherence protocol,
Tardis, which is simple, yet scalable to high processor counts, because it only
requires O(logN) storage per cacheline for an N-processor system. We prove that
Tardis follows the sequential consistency model and is both deadlock- and
livelock-free. Our proof is based on simple and intuitive invariants of the
system and thus applies to any system scale and many variants of Tardis.

 <dc:description>  In topology inference from data, current approaches face two major problems.
One concerns the selection of a correct parameter to build an appropriate
complex on top of the data points; the other involves with the typical `large'
size of this complex. We address these two issues in the context of inferring
homology from sample points of a smooth manifold of known dimension sitting in
an Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$. We show that, for a sample size of $n$
points, we can identify a set of $O(n^2)$ points (as opposed to $O(n^{\lceil
\frac{k}{2}\rceil})$ Voronoi vertices) approximating a subset of the medial
axis that suffices to compute a distance sandwiched between the well known
local feature size and the local weak feature size (in fact, the approximating
set can be further reduced in size to $O(n)$). This distance, called the lean
feature size, helps pruning the input set at least to the level of local
feature size while making the data locally uniform. The local uniformity in
turn helps in building a complex for homology inference on top of the
sparsified data without requiring any user-supplied distance threshold. Unlike
most topology inference results, ours does not require that the input is dense
relative to a {\em global} feature such as {\em reach} or {\em weak feature
size}; instead it can be adaptive with respect to the local feature size. We
present some empirical evidence in support of our theoretical claims.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave links are of a line-of-sight nature. Hence, multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in the millimeter-wave band may not
achieve full spatial diversity or multiplexing. In this paper, we utilize
reconfigurable antennas and the high antenna directivity in the millimeter-wave
band to propose a rate-two space coding design for 2x2 MIMO systems. The
proposed scheme can be decoded with a low complexity maximum-likelihood
detector at the receiver and yet it can enhance the bit-error-rate performance
of millimeter-wave systems compared to traditional spatial multiplexing
schemes, such as the Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time Architecture
(VBLAST). Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed code and show its superiority compared to existing rate-two space-time
block codes.

 <dc:description>  Our ability to control complex systems is a fundamental challenge of
contemporary science. Recently introduced tools to identify the driver nodes,
nodes through which we can achieve full control, predict the existence of
multiple control configurations, prompting us to classify each node in a
network based on their role in control. Accordingly a node is critical,
intermittent or redundant if it acts as a driver node in all, some or none of
the control configurations. Here we develop an analytical framework to identify
the category of each node, leading to the discovery of two distinct control
modes in complex systems: centralized vs distributed control. We predict the
control mode for an arbitrary network and show that one can alter it through
small structural perturbations. The uncovered bimodality has implications from
network security to organizational research and offers new insights into the
dynamics and control of complex systems.

 <dc:description>  Spectral Clustering as a relaxation of the normalized/ratio cut has become
one of the standard graph-based clustering methods. Existing methods for the
computation of multiple clusters, corresponding to a balanced $k$-cut of the
graph, are either based on greedy techniques or heuristics which have weak
connection to the original motivation of minimizing the normalized cut. In this
paper we propose a new tight continuous relaxation for any balanced $k$-cut
problem and show that a related recently proposed relaxation is in most cases
loose leading to poor performance in practice. For the optimization of our
tight continuous relaxation we propose a new algorithm for the difficult
sum-of-ratios minimization problem which achieves monotonic descent. Extensive
comparisons show that our method outperforms all existing approaches for ratio
cut and other balanced $k$-cut criteria.

 <dc:description>  An important form of prior information in clustering comes in form of
cannot-link and must-link constraints. We present a generalization of the
popular spectral clustering technique which integrates such constraints.
Motivated by the recently proposed $1$-spectral clustering for the
unconstrained problem, our method is based on a tight relaxation of the
constrained normalized cut into a continuous optimization problem. Opposite to
all other methods which have been suggested for constrained spectral
clustering, we can always guarantee to satisfy all constraints. Moreover, our
soft formulation allows to optimize a trade-off between normalized cut and the
number of violated constraints. An efficient implementation is provided which
scales to large datasets. We outperform consistently all other proposed methods
in the experiments.

 <dc:description>  Electron-beam direct-write (EBDW) lithography systems must in the future
transmit terabits of information per second to be viable for commercial
semiconductor manufacturing. Lossless layout image compression algorithms with
high decoding throughputs and modest decoding resources are tools to address
the data transfer portion of the throughput problem. The earlier lossless
layout image compression algorithm Corner2 is designed for binary layout images
on raster-scanning systems. We propose variations of Corner2 collectively
called Corner2-EPC and Paeth-EPC which apply to electron-beam proximity
corrected layout images and offer interesting trade-offs between compression
ratios and decoding speeds. Most of our algorithms achieve better overall
compression performance than PNG, Block C4 and LineDiffEntropy while having low
decoding times and resources.

 <dc:description>  Linear codes can be employed to construct authentication codes, which is an
interesting area of cryptography. The parameters of the authentication codes
depend on the complete weight enumerator of the underlying linear codes. In
order to obtain an authentication code with good parameters, the underlying
linear code must have proper parameters. The first objective of this paper is
to determine the complete weight enumerators of a class of linear codes with
two weights and three weights. The second is to employ these linear codes to
construct authentication codes with new parameters.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Binary constant weight codes have important applications and have been
studied for many years. Optimal or near-optimal binary constant weight codes of
small lengths have been determined. In this paper we propose a new construction
of explicit binary constant weight codes from $q$-ary Reed-Solomon codes. Some
of our binary constant weight codes are optimal or new. In particular new
binary constant weight codes $A(64, 10, 8) \geq 4108$ and $A(64, 12, 8) \geq
522$ are constructed. We also give explicitly constructed binary constant
weight codes which improve Gilbert and Graham-Sloane lower bounds in some range
of parameters. An extension to algebraic geometric codes is also presented.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a generalized longest common subsequence problem
with multiple substring inclusive constraints. For the two input sequences $X$
and $Y$ of lengths $n$ and $m$, and a set of $d$ constraints
$P=\{P_1,\cdots,P_d\}$ of total length $r$, the problem is to find a common
subsequence $Z$ of $X$ and $Y$ including each of constraint string in $P$ as a
substring and the length of $Z$ is maximized. A new dynamic programming
solution to this problem is presented in this paper. The correctness of the new
algorithm is proved. The time complexity of our algorithm is $O(d2^dnmr)$. In
the case of the number of constraint strings is fixed, our new algorithm for
the generalized longest common subsequence problem with multiple substring
inclusive constraints requires $O(nmr)$ time and space.

 <dc:title>Placement Optimization of Energy and Information Access Points in

 <dc:creator>Bi, Suzhi</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The applications of wireless power transfer technology to wireless
communications can help build a wireless powered communication network (WPCN)
with more reliable and sustainable power supply compared to the conventional
battery-powered network. However, due to the fundamental differences in
wireless information and power transmissions, many important aspects of
conventional battery-powered wireless communication networks need to be
redesigned for efficient operations of WPCNs. In this paper, we study the
placement optimization of energy and information access points in WPCNs, where
the wireless devices (WDs) harvest the radio frequency energy transferred by
dedicated energy nodes (ENs) in the downlink, and use the harvested energy to
transmit data to information access points (APs) in the uplink. In particular,
we are interested in minimizing the network deployment cost with minimum number
of ENs and APs by optimizing their locations, while satisfying the energy
harvesting and communication performance requirements of the WDs. Specifically,
we first study the minimum-cost placement problem when the ENs and APs are
separately located, where an alternating optimization method is proposed to
jointly optimize the locations of ENs and APs. Then, we study the placement
optimization when each pair of EN and AP are co-located and integrated as a
hybrid access point, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem.
Simulation results show that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the
network deployment cost and yet guarantee the given performance requirements,
which is a key consideration in the future applications of WPCNs.

 <dc:description>  Pointwise matches between two time series are of great importance in time
series analysis, and dynamic time warping (DTW) is known to provide generally
reasonable matches. There are situations where time series alignment should be
invariant to scaling and offset in amplitude or where local regions of the
considered time series should be strongly reflected in pointwise matches. Two
different variants of DTW, affine DTW (ADTW) and regional DTW (RDTW), are
proposed to handle scaling and offset in amplitude and provide regional
emphasis respectively. Furthermore, ADTW and RDTW can be combined in two
different ways to generate alignments that incorporate advantages from both
methods, where the affine model can be applied either globally to the entire
time series or locally to each region. The proposed alignment methods
outperform DTW on specific simulated datasets, and one-nearest-neighbor
classifiers using their associated difference measures are competitive with the
difference measures associated with state-of-the-art alignment methods on real
datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the concept of color semantics by modeling a dataset of
magazine cover designs, evaluating the model via crowdsourcing, and
demonstrating several prototypes that facilitate color-related design tasks. We
investigate a probabilistic generative modeling framework that expresses
semantic concepts as a combination of color and word distributions
$-$color-word topics. We adopt an extension to Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) topic modeling called LDA-dual to infer a set of color-word topics over a
corpus of 2,654 magazine covers spanning 71 distinct titles and 12 genres.
While LDA models text documents as distributions over word topics, we model
magazine covers as distributions over color-word topics. The results of our
crowdsourced experiments confirm that the model is able to successfully
discover the associations between colors and linguistic concepts. Finally, we
demonstrate several simple prototypes that apply the learned model to color
palette recommendation, design example retrieval, image retrieval, image color
selection, and image recoloring.

 <dc:description>  Short Message Service (SMS) based Information Systems (SMSbIS) provide an
excellent alternative to a traditional approach of obtaining specific
information by direct (through phone) or indirect (IVRS, Web, Email) probing.
Information and communication technology and far reaching mobile penetration
has opened this new research trend Number of key players in Search industry
including Microsoft and Google are attracted by the expected increase in volume
of use of such applications. The wide range of applications and their public
acceptance has motivated researchers to work in this research domain. Several
applications such as SMS based information access using database management
services, SMS based information retrieval through internet (search engine), SMS
based information extraction, question answering, image retrieval etc. have
been emerged. With the aim to understand the functionality involved in these
systems, an extensive review of a few of these SMSbISs has been planned and
executed by us. These systems are classified into four categories based on the
objectives and domains of the applications. As a result of this study a well
structured functional model is presented here. The model is evaluated in
different dimensions, which is presented in this paper. In addition to this a
chronological progress with respect to research and development in this
upcoming field is compiled in this paper. Such an extensive review presented in
this paper would definitely help the researchers and developers to understand
the technical aspects of this field. The functional framework presented here
would be useful to the system designers to design and develop an SMS based
Information System of any specific domain.

 <dc:description>  Much of the data being created on the web contains interactions between users
and items. Stochastic blockmodels, and other methods for community detection
and clustering of bipartite graphs, can infer latent user communities and
latent item clusters from this interaction data. These methods, however,
typically ignore the items' contents and the information they provide about
item clusters, despite the tendency of items in the same latent cluster to
share commonalities in content. We introduce content-augmented stochastic
blockmodels (CASB), which use item content together with user-item interaction
data to enhance the user communities and item clusters learned. Comparisons to
several state-of-the-art benchmark methods, on datasets arising from scientists
interacting with scientific articles, show that content-augmented stochastic
blockmodels provide highly accurate clusters with respect to metrics

 <dc:description>  In the push for exascale computing, energy efficiency is of utmost concern.
System architectures often adopt accelerators to hasten application execution
at the cost of power. The Intel Xeon Phi co-processor is unique accelerator
that offers application designers high degrees of parallelism, energy-efficient
cores, and various execution modes. To explore the vast number of available
configurations, a model must be developed to predict execution time, power, and
energy for the CPU and Xeon Phi. An experimentation method has been developed
which measures power for the CPU and Xeon Phi separately, as well as total
system power. Execution time and performance are also captured for two
experiments conducted in this work. The experiments, frequency scaling and
strong scaling, will help validate the adopted model and assist in the
development of a model which defines the host and Xeon Phi. The proxy
applications investigated, representative of large-scale real-world
applications, are Co-Design Molecular Dynamics (CoMD) and Livermore
Unstructured Lagrangian Explicit Shock Hydrodynamics (LULESH). The frequency
experiment discussed in this work is used to determine the time on-chip and
off-chip to measure the compute- or latencyboundedness of the application.
Energy savings were not obtained in symmetric mode for either application.

 <dc:title>A Service Broker Model for Cloud based Render Farm Selection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cloud computing is gaining popularity in the 3D Animation industry for
rendering the 3D images. Rendering is an inevitable task in creating the 3d
animated scenes. It is a process where the scene files to be animated is read
and converted into 3D photorealistic images automatically. Since it is a
computationally intensive task, this process consumes the majority of the time
taken for 3D images production. As the scene files could be processed in
parallel, clusters of computers called render farms can be used to speed up the
rendering process. The advantage of using Cloud based render farms is that it
is scalable and can be availed on demand. One of the important challenges faced
by the 3D studios is the comparison and selection of the cloud based render
farm service provider who could satisfy their functional and the non functional
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper we propose, a frame work
for Cloud Service Broker (CSB) responsible for the selection and provision of
the cloud based render farm. The Cloud Service Broker matches the functional
and the non functional Quality of Service requirements (QoS) of the user with
the service offerings of the render farm service providers and helps the user
in selecting the right service provider using an aggregate utility function.
The CSB also facilitates the process of Service Level Agreement (SLA)
negotiation and monitoring by the third party monitoring services.

 <dc:description>  The movies like the Avatar are a good example of the stunning visual effects
that the animation could bring into a movie.The 3D wire frame models are
converted to 3D photo realistic images using a process called the rendering.
This rendering process is offered as a service in the cloud, where the
animation files to be rendered are split into frames and rendered in the cloud
resources and are popularly known as Rendering as a Service. As this is gaining
high popularity among the animators community, this work intends to enable the
animators to Gain basic knowledge about Rendering as a Service. Understand the
variety in the service models through the taxonomy,Explore, compare and
classify the services quickly using the tree-structured taxonomy of services.
In this paper, the various characteristics of the services are organized in the
form of a tree to enable quick classification and comparison of the services.
To enhance the understandability, three popular services have been classified
and verified according to the proposed tree-structured taxonomy.

 <dc:description>  A major challenge in next-generation genome sequencing (NGS) is to assemble
massive overlapping short reads that are randomly sampled from DNA fragments.
To complete assembling, one needs to finish a fundamental task in many leading
assembly algorithms: counting the number of occurrences of k-mers (length-k
substrings in sequences). The counting results are critical for many components
in assembly (e.g. variants detection and read error correction). For large
genomes, the k-mer counting task can easily consume a huge amount of memory,
making it impossible for large-scale parallel assembly on commodity servers.
  In this paper, we develop MSPKmerCounter, a disk-based approach, to
efficiently perform k-mer counting for large genomes using a small amount of
memory. Our approach is based on a novel technique called Minimum Substring
Partitioning (MSP). MSP breaks short reads into multiple disjoint partitions
such that each partition can be loaded into memory and processed individually.
By leveraging the overlaps among the k-mers derived from the same short read,
MSP can achieve astonishing compression ratio so that the I/O cost can be
significantly reduced. For the task of k-mer counting, MSPKmerCounter offers a
very fast and memory-efficient solution. Experiment results on large real-life
short reads data sets demonstrate that MSPKmerCounter can achieve better
overall performance than state-of-the-art k-mer counting approaches.
  MSPKmerCounter is available at http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~yangli/MSPKmerCounter

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of maximum likelihood (ML) detection in training-assisted
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems with phase noise impairments is
studied for two different scenarios, i.e. the case when the channel is
deterministic and known (constant channel) and the case when the channel is
stochastic and unknown (fading channel). Further, two different operations with
respect to the phase noise sources are considered, namely, the case of
identical phase noise sources and the case of independent phase noise sources
over the antennas. In all scenarios the optimal detector is derived for a very
general parametrization of the phase noise distribution. Further, a high
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) analysis is performed to show that
symbol-error-rate (SER) floors appear in all cases. The SER floor in the case
of identical phase noise sources (for both constant and fading channels) is
independent of the number of antenna elements. In contrast, the SER floor in
the case of independent phase noise sources is reduced when increasing the
number of antenna elements (for both constant and fading channels). Finally,
the system model is extended to multiple data channel uses and it is shown that
the conclusions are valid for these setups, as well.

 <dc:title>Differentially Private Distributed Online Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online learning has been in the spotlight from the machine learning society
for a long time. To handle massive data in Big Data era, one single learner
could never efficiently finish this heavy task. Hence, in this paper, we
propose a novel distributed online learning algorithm to solve the problem.
Comparing to typical centralized online learner, the distributed learners
optimize their own learning parameters based on local data sources and timely
communicate with neighbors. However, communication may lead to a privacy
breach. Thus, we use differential privacy to preserve the privacy of learners,
and study the influence of guaranteeing differential privacy on the utility of
the distributed online learning algorithm. Furthermore, by using the results
from Kakade and Tewari (2009), we use the regret bounds of online learning to
achieve fast convergence rates for offline learning algorithms in distributed
scenarios, which provides tighter utility performance than the existing
state-of-the-art results. In simulation, we demonstrate that the differentially
private offline learning algorithm has high variance, but we can use mini-batch
to improve the performance. Finally, the simulations show that the analytical
results of our proposed theorems are right and our private distributed online
learning algorithm is a general framework.

 <dc:description>  Context: Model-Driven Security (MDS) is as a specialised Model-Driven
Engineering research area for supporting the development of secure systems.
Over a decade of research on MDS has resulted in a large number of
publications. Objective: To provide a detailed analysis of the state of the art
in MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR) is essential. Method: We conducted
an extensive SLR on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a
rigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary
MDS studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process
consists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After
discovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified,
strictly selected, and reviewed 108 MDS publications. Results: The results of
our SLR show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified
primary MDS studies. E.g. regarding security modelling artefact, we found that
developing domain-specific languages plays a key role in many MDS approaches.
The current limitations in each MDS artefact are pointed out and corresponding
potential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the
identified primary MDS studies into 5 principal MDS studies, and other emerging
or less common MDS studies. Finally, some trend analyses of MDS research are
given. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple
security concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains
supporting the MDS development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the
application of MDS methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this SLR is the
first in the field of Software Engineering that combines a snowballing strategy
with database searching. This combination has delivered an extensive literature
study on MDS.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address robust static anti-windup compensator design and
performance analysis for saturated linear closed loops in the presence of
nonlinear probabilistic parameter uncertainties via randomized techniques. The
proposed static anti-windup analysis and robust performance synthesis
correspond to several optimization goals, ranging from minimization of the
nonlinear input/output gain to maximization of the stability region or
maximization of the domain of attraction. We also introduce a novel paradigm
accounting for uncertainties in the energy of the disturbance inputs. Due to
the special structure of linear static anti-windup design, wherein the design
variables are decoupled from the Lyapunov certificates, we introduce a
significant extension, called scenario with certificates (SwC), of the
so-called scenario approach for uncertain optimization problems. This extension
is of independent interest for similar robust synthesis problems involving
parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. We demonstrate that the scenario with
certificates robust design formulation is appealing because it provides a way
to implicitly design the parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and to remove
restrictive assumptions about convexity with respect to the uncertain
parameters. Subsequently, to reduce the computational cost, we present a
sequential randomized algorithm for iteratively solving this problem. The
obtained results are illustrated by numerical examples.

 <dc:title>New results on inconsistency indices and their relationship with the
  quality of priority vector estimation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Grzybowski, Andrzej Z.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The article is devoted to the problem of inconsistency in the pairwise
comparisons based prioritization methodology. The issue of &quot;inconsistency&quot; in
this context has gained much attention in recent years. The literature provides
us with a number of different &quot;inconsistency&quot; indices suggested for measuring
the inconsistency of the pairwise comparison matrix (PCM). The latter is
understood as a deviation of the PCM from the &quot;consistent case&quot; - a notion that
is formally well-defined in this theory. However the usage of the indices is
justified only by some heuristics. It is still unclear what they really
&quot;measure&quot;. What is even more important and still not known is the relationship
between their values and the &quot;consistency&quot; of the decision maker's judgments on
one hand, and the prioritization results upon the other. We provide examples
showing that it is necessary to distinguish between these three following
tasks: the &quot;measuring&quot; of the &quot;PCM inconsistency&quot; and the PCM-based &quot;measuring&quot;
of the consistency of decision maker's judgments and, finally, the &quot;measuring&quot;
of the usefulness of the PCM as a source of information for estimation of the
priority vector (PV). Next we focus on the third task, which seems to be the
most important one in Multi-Criteria Decision Making. With the help of Monte
Carlo experiments, we study the performance of various inconsistency indices as
indicators of the final PV estimation quality. The presented results allow a
deeper understanding of the information contained in these indices and help in
choosing a proper one in a given situation. They also enable us to develop a
new inconsistency characteristic and, based on it, to propose the PCM
acceptance approach that is supported by the classical statistical methodology.

 <dc:title>A Simple Yet Effective Improvement to the Bilateral Filter for Image
  Denoising</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rithwik, Kollipara</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The bilateral filter has diverse applications in image processing, computer
vision, and computational photography. In particular, this non-linear filter is
quite effective in denoising images corrupted with additive Gaussian noise. The
filter, however, is known to perform poorly at large noise levels. Several
adaptations of the filter have been proposed in the literature to address this
shortcoming, but often at an added computational cost. In this paper, we report
a simple yet effective modification that improves the denoising performance of
the bilateral filter at almost no additional cost. We provide visual and
quantitative results on standard test images which show that this improvement
is significant both visually and in terms of PSNR and SSIM (often as large as 5
dB). We also demonstrate how the proposed filtering can be implemented at
reduced complexity by adapting a recent idea for fast bilateral filtering.

 <dc:description>  CPUs and operating systems are moving from 32 to 64 bits, and hence it is
important to have good pseudorandom number generators designed to fully exploit
these word lengths. However, existing 64-bit very long period generators based
on linear recurrences modulo 2 are not completely optimized in terms of the
equidistribution properties. Here we develop 64-bit maximally equidistributed
pseudorandom number generators that are optimal in this respect and have speeds
equivalent to 64-bit Mersenne Twisters. We provide a table of specific
parameters with period lengths from $2^{607}-1$ to $2^{44497}-1$. (An online
appendix is available at http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~harase/melg-64-app.pdf)

 <dc:description>  We characterize the complexity of liveness verification for parameterized
systems consisting of a leader process and arbitrarily many anonymous and
identical contributor processes. Processes communicate through a shared,
bounded-value register. While each operation on the register is atomic, there
is no synchronization primitive to execute a sequence of operations atomically.
  We analyze the case in which processes are modeled by finite-state machines
or pushdown machines and the property is given by a B\&quot;uchi automaton over the
alphabet of read and write actions of the leader. We show that the problem is
decidable, and has a surprisingly low complexity: it is NP-complete when all
processes are finite-state machines, and is PSPACE-hard and in NEXPTIME when
they are pushdown machines. This complexity is lower than for the
non-parameterized case: liveness verification of finitely many finite-state
machines is PSPACE-complete, and undecidable for two pushdown machines.
  For finite-state machines, our proofs characterize infinite behaviors using
existential abstraction and semilinear constraints. For pushdown machines, we
show how contributor computations of high stack height can be simulated by
computations of many contributors, each with low stack height. Together, our
results characterize the complexity of verification for parameterized systems
under the assumptions of anonymity and asynchrony.

 <dc:description>  This is a report on our ongoing research on a combinatorial approach to knot
recognition, using coloring of knots by certain algebraic objects called
quandles. The aim of the paper is to summarize the mathematical theory of knot
coloring in a compact, accessible manner, and to show how to use it for
computational purposes. In particular, we address how to determine colorability
of a knot, and propose to use SAT solving to search for colorings. The
computational complexity of the problem, both in theory and in our
implementation, is discussed. In the last part, we explain how coloring can be
utilized in knot recognition.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the partial gathering problem of mobile agents in
asynchronous unidirectional rings equipped with whiteboards on nodes. The
partial gathering problem is a new generalization of the total gathering
problem. The partial gathering problem requires, for a given integer $g$, that
each agent should move to a node and terminate so that at least $g$ agents
should meet at the same node. The requirement for the partial gathering problem
is weaker than that for the (well-investigated) total gathering problem, and
thus, we have interests in clarifying the difference on the move complexity
between them. We propose three algorithms to solve the partial gathering
problem. The first algorithm is deterministic but requires unique ID of each
agent. This algorithm achieves the partial gathering in $O(gn)$ total moves,
where $n$ is the number of nodes. The second algorithm is randomized and
requires no unique ID of each agent (i.e., anonymous). This algorithm achieves
the partial gathering in expected $O(gn)$ total moves. The third algorithm is
deterministic and requires no unique ID of each agent. For this case, we show
that there exist initial configurations in which no algorithm can solve the
problem and agents can achieve the partial gathering in $O(kn)$ total moves for
solvable initial configurations, where $k$ is the number of agents. Note that
the total gathering problem requires $\Omega (kn)$ total moves, while the
partial gathering problem requires $\Omega (gn)$ total moves in each model.
Hence, we show that the move complexity of the first and second algorithms is
asymptotically optimal.

 <dc:description>  Detecting edges is a fundamental problem in computer vision with many
applications, some involving very noisy images. While most edge detection
methods are fast, they perform well only on relatively clean images. Indeed,
edges in such images can be reliably detected using only local filters.
Detecting faint edges under high levels of noise cannot be done locally at the
individual pixel level, and requires more sophisticated global processing.
Unfortunately, existing methods that achieve this goal are quite slow. In this
paper we develop a novel multiscale method to detect curved edges in noisy
images. While our algorithm searches for edges over a huge set of candidate
curves, it does so in a practical runtime, nearly linear in the total number of
image pixels. As we demonstrate experimentally, our algorithm is orders of
magnitude faster than previous methods designed to deal with high noise levels.
Nevertheless, it obtains comparable, if not better, edge detection quality on a
variety of challenging noisy images.

 <dc:description>  With a view to provide a user-friendly interface for designing, training and
developing deep learning frameworks, we have developed Expresso, a GUI tool
written in Python. Expresso is built atop Caffe, the open-source, prize-winning
framework popularly used to develop Convolutional Neural Networks. Expresso
provides a convenient wizard-like graphical interface which guides the user
through various common scenarios -- data import, construction and training of
deep networks, performing various experiments, analyzing and visualizing the
results of these experiments. The multi-threaded nature of Expresso enables
concurrent execution and notification of events related to the aforementioned
scenarios. The GUI sub-components and inter-component interfaces in Expresso
have been designed with extensibility in mind. We believe Expresso's
flexibility and ease of use will come in handy to researchers, newcomers and
seasoned alike, in their explorations related to deep learning.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have successfully contributed to
improve the accuracy of regression-based methods for computer vision tasks such
as human pose estimation, landmark localization, and object detection. The
network optimization has been usually performed with L2 loss and without
considering the impact of outliers on the training process, where an outlier in
this context is defined by a sample estimation that lies at an abnormal
distance from the other training sample estimations in the objective space. In
this work, we propose a regression model with ConvNets that achieves robustness
to such outliers by minimizing Tukey's biweight function, an M-estimator robust
to outliers, as the loss function for the ConvNet. In addition to the robust
loss, we introduce a coarse-to-fine model, which processes input images of
progressively higher resolutions for improving the accuracy of the regressed
values. In our experiments, we demonstrate faster convergence and better
generalization of our robust loss function for the tasks of human pose
estimation and age estimation from face images. We also show that the
combination of the robust loss function with the coarse-to-fine model produces
comparable or better results than current state-of-the-art approaches in four
publicly available human pose estimation datasets.

 <dc:description>  With increasingly &quot;big&quot; data available in biomedical research, deriving
accurate and reproducible biology knowledge from such big data imposes enormous
computational challenges. In this paper, motivated by recently developed
stochastic block coordinate algorithms, we propose a highly scalable randomized
block coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm for convex optimization with general
compact convex constraints, which has diverse applications in analyzing
biomedical data for better understanding cellular and disease mechanisms. We
focus on implementing the derived stochastic block coordinate algorithm to
align protein-protein interaction networks for identifying conserved functional
pathways based on the IsoRank framework. Our derived stochastic block
coordinate Frank-Wolfe (SBCFW) algorithm has the convergence guarantee and
naturally leads to the decreased computational cost (time and space) for each
iteration. Our experiments for querying conserved functional protein complexes
in yeast networks confirm the effectiveness of this technique for analyzing
large-scale biological networks.

 <dc:description>  Designing efficient channel access schemes for wireless communications
without any prior knowledge about the nature of environments has been a very
challenging issue, especially when the channel states distribution of all
spectrum resources could be entirely or partially stochastic and/or adversarial
at different time and locations. In this paper, we propose an adaptive channel
access algorithm for wireless communications in unknown environments based on
the theory of multi-armed bandits (MAB) problems. By automatically tuning two
control parameters, i.e., learning rate and exploration probability, our
algorithms are capable of finding the optimal channel access strategies and
achieving the almost optimal learning performance over time under our defined
four typical regimes for general unknown environments, e.g., the stochastic
regime where channels follow some unknown i.i.d process, the adversarial regime
where all channels are suffered by adversarial jamming attack, the mixed
stochastic and adversarial regime where a subset of channels are attacked and
the contaminated stochastic regime where occasionally adversarial events
contaminate the stochastic channel process, etc. To reduce the implementation
time and space complexity, we further develop an enhanced algorithm by
exploiting the internal structure of the selection of channel access strategy.
We conduct extensive simulations in all these regimes to validate our
theoretical analysis. The quantitative performance studies indicate the
superior throughput gain and the flexibility of our algorithm in practice,
which is resilient to both oblivious and adaptive jamming attacks with
different intelligence and any attacking strength that ranges from no-attack to
the full-attack of all spectrum resources.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, low-rank based tensor completion, which is a higher-order
extension of matrix completion, has received considerable attention. However,
the low-rank assumption is not sufficient for the recovery of visual data, such
as color and 3D images, where the ratio of missing data is extremely high. In
this paper, we consider &quot;smoothness&quot; constraints as well as low-rank
approximations, and propose an efficient algorithm for performing tensor
completion that is particularly powerful regarding visual data. The proposed
method admits significant advantages, owing to the integration of smooth
PARAFAC decomposition for incomplete tensors and the efficient selection of
models in order to minimize the tensor rank. Thus, our proposed method is
termed as &quot;smooth PARAFAC tensor completion (SPC).&quot; In order to impose the
smoothness constraints, we employ two strategies, total variation (SPC-TV) and
quadratic variation (SPC-QV), and invoke the corresponding algorithms for model
learning. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world
visual data illustrate the significant improvements of our method, in terms of
both prediction performance and efficiency, compared with many state-of-the-art
tensor completion methods.

 <dc:title>Energy Efficiency of Downlink Networks with Caching at Base Stations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Caching popular contents at base stations (BSs) can reduce the backhaul cost
and improve the network throughput. Yet whether locally caching at the BSs can
improve the energy efficiency (EE), a major goal for 5th generation cellular
networks, remains unclear. Due to the entangled impact of various factors on EE
such as interference level, backhaul capacity, BS density, power consumption
parameters, BS sleeping, content popularity and cache capacity, another
important question is what are the key factors that contribute more to the EE
gain from caching. In this paper, we attempt to explore the potential of EE of
the cache-enabled wireless access networks and identify the key factors. By
deriving closed-form expression of the approximated EE, we provide the
condition when the EE can benefit from caching, find the optimal cache capacity
that maximizes the network EE, and analyze the maximal EE gain brought by
caching. We show that caching at the BSs can improve the network EE when power
efficient cache hardware is used. When local caching has EE gain over not
caching, caching more contents at the BSs may not provide higher EE. Numerical
and simulation results show that the caching EE gain is large when the backhaul
capacity is stringent, interference level is low, content popularity is skewed,
and when caching at pico BSs instead of macro BSs.

 <dc:description>  Graph polynomials which are definable in Monadic Second Order Logic (MSOL) on
the vocabulary of graphs are Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) with respect to
clique-width. In contrast, graph polynomials which are definable in MSOL on the
vocabulary of hypergraphs are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to
tree-width, but not necessarily with respect to clique width. No algorithmic
meta-theorem is known for the computation of graph polynomials definable in
MSOL on the vocabulary of hypergraphs with respect to clique-width. We define
an infinite class of such graph polynomials extending the class of graph
polynomials definable in MSOL on the vocabulary of graphs and prove that they
are Fixed-Parameter Polynomial Time (FPPT) computable, i.e. that they can be
computed in time $O(n^{f(k)})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $k$ is
the clique-width.

 <dc:description>  We present an innovative method called FilExSeC (Filaments Extraction,
Selection and Classification), a data mining tool developed to investigate the
possibility to refine and optimize the shape reconstruction of filamentary
structures detected with a consolidated method based on the flux derivative
analysis, through the column-density maps computed from Herschel infrared
Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL) observations of the Galactic plane. The present
methodology is based on a feature extraction module followed by a machine
learning model (Random Forest) dedicated to select features and to classify the
pixels of the input images. From tests on both simulations and real
observations the method appears reliable and robust with respect to the
variability of shape and distribution of filaments. In the cases of highly
defined filament structures, the presented method is able to bridge the gaps
among the detected fragments, thus improving their shape reconstruction. From a
preliminary &quot;a posteriori&quot; analysis of derived filament physical parameters,
the method appears potentially able to add a sufficient contribution to
complete and refine the filament reconstruction.

 <dc:description>  The finite satisfiability problem of monadic second order logic is decidable
only on classes of structures of bounded tree-width by the classic result of
Seese (1991). We prove the following problem is decidable:
  Input: (i) A monadic second order logic sentence $\alpha$, and (ii) a
sentence $\beta$ in the two-variable fragment of first order logic extended
with counting quantifiers. The vocabularies of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ may
intersect.
  Output: Is there a finite structure which satisfies $\alpha\land\beta$ such
that the restriction of the structure to the vocabulary of $\alpha$ has bounded
tree-width? (The tree-width of the desired structure is not bounded.)
  As a consequence, we prove the decidability of the satisfiability problem by
a finite structure of bounded tree-width of a logic extending monadic second
order logic with linear cardinality constraints of the form
$|X_{1}|+\cdots+|X_{r}|&lt;|Y_{1}|+\cdots+|Y_{s}|$, where the $X_{i}$ and $Y_{j}$
are monadic second order variables. We prove the decidability of a similar
extension of WS1S.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an effective method to analyze the recognition
confidence of handwritten Chinese character, based on the softmax regression
score of a high performance convolutional neural networks (CNN). Through
careful and thorough statistics of 827,685 testing samples that randomly
selected from total 8836 different classes of Chinese characters, we find that
the confidence measurement based on CNN is an useful metric to know how
reliable the recognition results are. Furthermore, we find by experiments that
the recognition confidence can be used to find out similar and confusable
character-pairs, to check wrongly or cursively written samples, and even to
discover and correct mis-labelled samples. Many interesting observations and
statistics are given and analyzed in this study.

 <dc:description>  Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising approach for improving the
performance and manageability of future network architectures. However, little
work has gone into using SDN to improve the performance and manageability of
existing networks without requiring a major overhaul of the existing network
infrastructure.
  In this paper, we show how we can dramatically improve, or supercharge, the
performance of existing IP routers by combining them with SDN-enabled equipment
in a novel way. More particularly, our supercharged solution substantially
reduces the convergence time of an IP router upon link or node failure without
inducing any reconfiguration of the IP router itself. Our key insight is to use
the SDN controller to precompute backup forwarding entries and immediately
activate them upon failure, enabling almost immediate data-plane recovery,
while letting the router converge at its typical slow pace. By boosting
existing equipment's performance, we not only increase their lifetime but also
provide new incentives for network operators to kickstart SDN deployment.
  We implemented a fully functional &quot;supercharger&quot; and use it to boost the
convergence performance of a Cisco Nexus 7k router. Using a FPGA-based traffic
generator, we show that our supercharged router systematically converges within
~150ms, a 900x reduction with respect to its normal convergence time under
similar conditions.

participation community agreed about the measurement of two indexes, one of
approval and one of participation. Both practice and literature is constantly
handled by the experts involved, and the formalization of such model and

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a single-agent modal logic framework for reasoning
about goal-direct &quot;knowing how&quot; based on ideas from linguistics, philosophy,
modal logic and automated planning. We first define a modal language to express
&quot;I know how to guarantee phi given psi&quot; with a semantics not based on standard
epistemic models but labelled transition systems that represent the agent's
knowledge of his own abilities. A sound and complete proof system is given to
capture the valid reasoning patterns about &quot;knowing how&quot; where the most
important axiom suggests its compositional nature.

 <dc:title>Towards Realistic Team Formation in Social Networks based on Densest

 <dc:description>  Given a task $\mathcal{T}$, a set of experts $V$ with multiple skills and a
social network $G(V, W)$ reflecting the compatibility among the experts, team
formation is the problem of identifying a team $C \subseteq V$ that is both
competent in performing the task $\mathcal{T}$ and compatible in working
together. Existing methods for this problem make too restrictive assumptions
and thus cannot model practical scenarios. The goal of this paper is to
consider the team formation problem in a realistic setting and present a novel
formulation based on densest subgraphs. Our formulation allows modeling of many
natural requirements such as (i) inclusion of a designated team leader and/or a
group of given experts, (ii) restriction of the size or more generally cost of
the team (iii) enforcing locality of the team, e.g., in a geographical sense or
social sense, etc.
  The proposed formulation leads to a generalized version of the classical
densest subgraph problem with cardinality constraints (DSP), which is an NP
hard problem and has many applications in social network analysis. In this
paper, we present a new method for (approximately) solving the generalized DSP
(GDSP). Our method, FORTE, is based on solving an equivalent continuous
relaxation of GDSP. The solution found by our method has a quality guarantee
and always satisfies the constraints of GDSP. Experiments show that the
proposed formulation (GDSP) is useful in modeling a broader range of team
formation problems and that our method produces more coherent and compact teams
of high quality. We also show, with the help of an LP relaxation of GDSP, that
our method gives close to optimal solutions to GDSP.

 <dc:description>  Metros (heavy rail transit systems) are integral parts of urban
transportation systems. Failures in their operations can have serious impacts
on urban mobility, and measuring their robustness is therefore critical.
Moreover, as physical networks, metros can be viewed as network topological
entities, and as such they possess measurable network properties. In this
paper, by using network science and graph theoretical concepts, we investigate
both theoretical and experimental robustness metrics (i.e., the robustness
indicator, the effective graph conductance, and the critical thresholds) and
their performance in quantifying the robustness of metro networks under random
failures or targeted attacks. We find that the theoretical metrics quantify
different aspects of the robustness of metro networks. In particular, the
robustness indicator captures the number of alternative paths and the effective
graph conductance focuses on the length of each path. Moreover, the high
positive correlation between the theoretical metrics and experimental metrics
and the negative correlation within the theoretical metrics provide significant
insights for planners to design more robust system while accommodating for
transit specificities (e.g., alternative paths, fast transferring).

 <dc:description>  The statistical properties of the multivariate Gamma-Gamma ($\Gamma \Gamma$)
distribution with arbitrary correlation have remained unknown. In this paper,
we provide analytical expressions for the joint probability density function
(PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF) and moment generation function of
the multivariate $\Gamma \Gamma$ distribution with arbitrary correlation.
Furthermore, we present novel approximating expressions for the PDF and CDF of
the sum of $\Gamma \Gamma$ random variables with arbitrary correlation. Based
on this statistical analysis, we investigate the performance of radio frequency
and optical wireless communication systems. It is noteworthy that the presented
expressions include several previous results in the literature as special
cases.

 <dc:description>  We design an algorithmic framework using matrix exponentials for time-domain
simulation of power delivery network (PDN). Our framework can reuse factorized
matrices to simulate the large-scale linear PDN system with variable stepsizes.
In contrast, current conventional PDN simulation solvers have to use fixed
step-size approach in order to reuse factorized matrices generated by the
expensive matrix decomposition. Based on the proposed exponential integration
framework, we design a PDN solver R-MATEX with the flexible time-stepping
capability. The key operation of matrix exponential and vector product (MEVP)
is computed by the rational Krylov subspace method.
  To further improve the runtime, we also propose a distributed computing
framework DR-MATEX. DR-MATEX reduces Krylov subspace generations caused by
frequent breakpoints from a large number of current sources during simulation.
By virtue of the superposition property of linear system and scaling invariance
property of Krylov subspace, DR-MATEX can divide the whole simulation task into
subtasks based on the alignments of breakpoints among those sources. The
subtasks are processed in parallel at different computing nodes without any
communication during the computation of transient simulation. The final result
is obtained by summing up the partial results among all the computing nodes
after they finish the assigned subtasks. Therefore, our computation model
belongs to the category known as Embarrassingly Parallel model.
  Experimental results show R-MATEX and DR-MATEX can achieve up to around 14.4X
and 98.0X runtime speedups over traditional trapezoidal integration based
solver with fixed timestep approach.

 <dc:title>Smooth and iteratively Restore: A simple and fast edge-preserving

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In image processing, it can be a useful pre-processing step to smooth away
small structures, such as noise or unimportant details, while retaining the
overall structure of the image by keeping edges, which separate objects, sharp.
Typically this edge-preserving smoothing process is achieved using edge-aware
filters. However such filters may preserve unwanted small structures as well if
they contain edges. In this work we present a novel framework for
edge-preserving smoothing which separates the process into two different steps:
First the image is smoothed using a blurring filter and in the second step the
important edges are restored using a guided edge-aware filter. The presented
method proves to deliver very good results, compared to state-of-the-art
edge-preserving smoothing filters, especially at removing unwanted small
structures. Furthermore it is very versatile and can easily be adapted to
different fields of applications while at the same time being very fast to
compute and therefore well-suited for real time applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the challenges of the Internet of Things programming.
Sensing and data gathering from the various sources are often the key elements
of applications for Smart Cities. So, the effective programming models for them
are very important. In this article, we discuss system software models and
solutions, rather than network related aspects. In our paper, we present the
web-based domain-specific language for Internet of Things applications. Our
goal is to present the modern models for data processing in Internet of Things
and Smart Cities applications. In our view, the use of this kind of tools
should seriously reduce the time to develop new applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a full-rate full-diversity space-time block code
(STBC) for 2x2 reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
that require a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detector. We consider a
transmitter equipped with a linear antenna array where each antenna element can
be independently configured to create a directive radiation pattern toward a
selected direction. This property of transmit antennas allow us to increase the
data rate of the system, while reducing the computational complexity of the
receiver. The proposed STBC achieves a coding rate of two in a 2x2 MIMO system
and can be decoded via an ML detector with a complexity of order M, where M is
the cardinality of the transmitted symbol constellation. Our simulations
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed code compared to existing STBCs in
the literature.

 <dc:title>ORFEL: efficient detection of defamation or illegitimate promotion in

 <dc:description>  What if a successful company starts to receive a torrent of low-valued (one
or two stars) recommendations in its mobile apps from multiple users within a
short (say one month) period of time? Is it legitimate evidence that the apps
have lost in quality, or an intentional plan (via lockstep behavior) to steal
market share through defamation? In the case of a systematic attack to one's
reputation, it might not be possible to manually discern between legitimate and
fraudulent interaction within the huge universe of possibilities of
user-product recommendation. Previous works have focused on this issue, but
none of them took into account the context, modeling, and scale that we
consider in this paper. Here, we propose the novel method Online-Recommendation
Fraud ExcLuder (ORFEL) to detect defamation and/or illegitimate promotion of
online products by using vertex-centric asynchronous parallel processing of
bipartite (users-products) graphs. With an innovative algorithm, our results
demonstrate both efficacy and efficiency -- over 95% of potential attacks were
detected, and ORFEL was at least two orders of magnitude faster than the
state-of-the-art. Over a novel methodology, our main contributions are: (1) a
new algorithmic solution; (2) one scalable approach; and (3) a novel context
and modeling of the problem, which now addresses both defamation and
illegitimate promotion. Our work deals with relevant issues of the Web 2.0,
potentially augmenting the credibility of online recommendation to prevent
losses to both customers and vendors.

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate that the concerns expressed by Garcia et al. are misplaced,
due to (1) a misreading of our findings in [1]; (2) a widespread failure to
examine and present words in support of asserted summary quantities based on
word usage frequencies; and (3) a range of misconceptions about word usage
frequency, word rank, and expert-constructed word lists. In particular, we show
that the English component of our study compares well statistically with two
related surveys, that no survey design influence is apparent, and that
estimates of measurement error do not explain the positivity biases reported in
our work and that of others. We further demonstrate that for the frequency
dependence of positivity---of which we explored the nuances in great detail in
[1]---Garcia et al. did not perform a reanalysis of our data---they instead
carried out an analysis of a different, statistically improper data set and
introduced a nonlinearity before performing linear regression.

 <dc:description>  There is multiple databases contain datasets of TP53 gene and its tumor
protein P53 which believed to be involved in over 50% of human cancers cases,
these databases are rich as datasets covered all mutations caused diseases
(cancers), but they haven't efficient mining method can classify and diagnosis
mutations patient's then predict the cancer of that patient. This paper
proposed a novel mining of cancer via mutations because there is no mining
method before offers friendly, effective and flexible predict or diagnosis of
cancers via using whole common database of TP53 gene (tumor protein P53) as
dataset and selecting a minimum number of fields in training and testing quick
propagation algorithm which supporting this miming method. Simulating quick
propagation network for the train dataset shows results the Correlation
(0.9999), R-squared (0.9998) and mean of Absolute Relative Error (0.0029),
while the training for the ALL datasets (train, test and validation dataset)
have results the Correlation (0.9993), R-squared (0.9987) and mean of Absolute

 <dc:title>A Time-Success Ratio Analysis of wPRF-based Leakage-Resilient Stream
  Ciphers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Skorski, Maciej</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Weak pseudorandom functions (wPRFs) found an important application as main
building blocks for leakage-resilient ciphers (EUROCRYPT'09). Several security
bounds, based on different techniques, were given to these stream ciphers. The
security loss in these reduction-based proofs is always polynomial, but has not
been studied in detail. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we present a
clear comparison of quantitatively different security bounds in the literature.
Second, we revisit the current proof techniques and answer the natural question
of how far we are from meaningful and provable security guarantees, when
instantiating weak PRFs with standard primitives (block ciphers or hash
functions). In particular, we demonstrate a flaw in the recent (TCC'14)
analysis of the EUROCRYPT'09 stream cipher, which means that we still don't
know if it offers provable security when instantiated with a standard block
cipher. Our approach is a \emph{time-to-success Ratio} analysis, a universal
measure introduced by Luby, which allow us to compare different security
bounds.

 <dc:description>  We study sequential change-point detection using sketches (linear
projections) of high-dimensional signal vectors, by presenting the sketching
procedures that are derived based on the generalized likelihood ratio
statistic. We consider both fixed and time-varying projections, and derive
theoretical approximations to two fundamental performance metrics: the average
run length (ARL) and the expected detection delay (EDD); these approximations
are shown to be highly accurate by numerical simulations. We also characterize
the performance of the procedure when the projection is a Gaussian random
projection or a sparse 0-1 matrix (in particular, an expander graph). Finally,
we demonstrate the good performance of the sketching performance using
simulation and real-data examples on solar flare detection and failure
detection in power networks.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel model of large-size tilt-rotor aircraft, which
can operate as a helicopter as well as being capable of transition to
fixed-wing flight. Aerodynamics of the dynamic large-size tilt-rotors based on
blade element method is analyzed during mode transition. For the large-size
aircraft with turboshaft engines, the blade pitch angles of the rotors are
regulated to vary according to the desired level of thrust, and the following
expressions are formulated explicitly: rotor thrust and blade pitch angle, drag
torque and blade pitch angle. A finite-time convergent observer based on
Lyapunov function is developed to reconstruct the unknown variables and
uncertainties during mode transitions. The merits of this design include the
modeling of dynamic large-size tilt-rotor, ease of the uncertainties estimation
during the tilting and the widely applications. Moreover, a switched logic
controller based on the finite-time convergent observer is proposed to drive
the aircraft to implement the mode transition with invariant flying height.

 <dc:description>  Hospitals and health care organizations collect large amounts of detailed
health care data that is in high demand by researchers. Thus, the possessors of
such data are in need of methods that allow for this data to be released
without compromising the confidentiality of the individuals to whom it
pertains. As the geographic aspect of this data is becoming increasingly
relevant for research being conducted, it is important for an
\emph{anonymization} process to pay due attention to the geographic attributes
of such data. In this paper, a novel system for health care data anonymization
is presented. At the core of the system is the aggregation of an initial
regionalization guided by the use of a Voronoi diagram. We conduct a comparison
with another geographic-based system of anonymization, GeoLeader. We show that
our system is capable of producing results of a comparable quality with a much
faster running time.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose low-complexity robust adaptive beamforming (RAB)
techniques that based on shrinkage methods. The only prior knowledge required
by the proposed algorithms are the angular sector in which the actual steering
vector is located and the antenna array geometry. We firstly present a
Low-Complexity Shrinkage-Based Mismatch Estimation (LOCSME) algorithm to
estimate the desired signal steering vector mismatch, in which the
interference-plus-noise covariance (INC) matrix is estimated with Oracle
Approximating Shrinkage (OAS) method and the weights are computed with matrix
inversions. We then develop low-cost stochastic gradient (SG) recursions to
estimate the INC matrix and update the beamforming weights, resulting in the
proposed LOCSME-SG algorithm. Simulation results show that both LOCSME and
LOCSME-SG achieve very good output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) compared to previously reported adaptive RAB algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Can data from mobile phones be used to observe economic shocks and their
consequences at multiple scales? Here we present novel methods to detect mass
layoffs, identify individuals affected by them, and predict changes in
aggregate unemployment rates using call detail records (CDRs) from mobile
phones. Using the closure of a large manufacturing plant as a case study, we
first describe a structural break model to correctly detect the date of a mass
layoff and estimate its size. We then use a Bayesian classification model to
identify affected individuals by observing changes in calling behavior
following the plant's closure. For these affected individuals, we observe
significant declines in social behavior and mobility following job loss. Using
the features identified at the micro level, we show that the same changes in
these calling behaviors, aggregated at the regional level, can improve
forecasts of macro unemployment rates. These methods and results highlight
promise of new data resources to measure micro economic behavior and improve
estimates of critical economic indicators.

 <dc:description>  Visualization is a powerful paradigm for exploratory data analysis.
Visualizing large graphs, however, often results in a meaningless hairball. In
this paper, we propose a different approach that helps the user adaptively
explore large million-node graphs from a local perspective. For nodes that the
user investigates, we propose to only show the neighbors with the most
subjectively interesting neighborhoods. We contribute novel ideas to measure
this interestingness in terms of how surprising a neighborhood is given the
background distribution, as well as how well it fits the nodes the user chose
to explore. We introduce FACETS, a fast and scalable method for visually
exploring large graphs. By implementing our above ideas, it allows users to
look into the forest through its trees. Empirical evaluation shows that our
method works very well in practice, providing rankings of nodes that match
interests of users. Moreover, as it scales linearly, FACETS is suited for the
exploration of very large graphs.

 <dc:description>  We conduct an empirical study to test the ability of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) to reduce the effects of nuisance transformations of the input
data, such as location, scale and aspect ratio. We isolate factors by adopting
a common convolutional architecture either deployed globally on the image to
compute class posterior distributions, or restricted locally to compute class
conditional distributions given location, scale and aspect ratios of bounding
boxes determined by proposal heuristics. In theory, averaging the latter should
yield inferior performance compared to proper marginalization. Yet empirical
evidence suggests the converse, leading us to conclude that - at the current
level of complexity of convolutional architectures and scale of the data sets
used to train them - CNNs are not very effective at marginalizing nuisance
variability. We also quantify the effects of context on the overall
classification task and its impact on the performance of CNNs, and propose
improved sampling techniques for heuristic proposal schemes that improve
end-to-end performance to state-of-the-art levels. We test our hypothesis on a
classification task using the ImageNet Challenge benchmark and on a
wide-baseline matching task using the Oxford and Fischer's datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper aims to accelerate the test-time computation of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), especially very deep CNNs that have substantially
impacted the computer vision community. Unlike previous methods that are
designed for approximating linear filters or linear responses, our method takes
the nonlinear units into account. We develop an effective solution to the
resulting nonlinear optimization problem without the need of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD). More importantly, while previous methods mainly focus
on optimizing one or two layers, our nonlinear method enables an asymmetric
reconstruction that reduces the rapidly accumulated error when multiple (e.g.,
&gt;=10) layers are approximated. For the widely used very deep VGG-16 model, our
method achieves a whole-model speedup of 4x with merely a 0.3% increase of
top-5 error in ImageNet classification. Our 4x accelerated VGG-16 model also
shows a graceful accuracy degradation for object detection when plugged into
the Fast R-CNN detector.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes boosting-like deep learning (BDL) framework for
pedestrian detection. Due to overtraining on the limited training samples,
overfitting is a major problem of deep learning. We incorporate a boosting-like
technique into deep learning to weigh the training samples, and thus prevent
overtraining in the iterative process. We theoretically give the details of
derivation of our algorithm, and report the experimental results on open data
sets showing that BDL achieves a better stable performance than the
state-of-the-arts. Our approach achieves 15.85% and 3.81% reduction in the
average miss rate compared with ACF and JointDeep on the largest Caltech
benchmark dataset, respectively.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the solution space structure of model RB, a standard
prototype of Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSPs) with growing domains. Using
rigorous the first and the second moment method, we show that in the solvable
phase close to the satisfiability transition, solutions are clustered into
exponential number of well-separated clusters, with each cluster contains
sub-exponential number of solutions. As a consequence, the system has a
clustering (dynamical) transition but no condensation transition. This picture
of phase diagram is different from other classic random CSPs with fixed domain
size, such as random K-Satisfiability (K-SAT) and graph coloring problems,
where condensation transition exists and is distinct from satisfiability
transition. Our result verifies the non-rigorous results obtained using cavity
method from spin glass theory, and sheds light on the structures of solution
spaces of problems with a large number of states.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study networks of discrete-time linear time-invariant
subsystems. Our focus is on situations where subsystems are connected to each
other through a time-invariant topology and where there exists a base-station
whose aim is to control the subsystems into any desired destinations. However,
the base-station can only communicate with some of the subsystems that we refer
to as leaders. There are no direct links between the base-station and the rest
of subsystems, known as followers, as they are only able to liaise among
themselves and with some of the leaders.
  The current paper formulates this framework as the well-known reachability
problem for linear systems. Then to address this problem, we introduce notions
of leader-reachability and base-reachability. We present algebraic conditions
under which these notions hold. It turns out that if subsystems are represented
by minimal state space representations, then base-reachability always holds.
Hence, we focus on leader-reachability and investigate the corresponding
conditions in detail. We further demonstrate that when the networked system
parameters i.e. subsystems' parameters and interconnection matrices, assume
generic values then the whole network is both leader-reachable and
base-reachable.

 <dc:description>  We present a new combinatorial algorithm for triangle finding and Boolean
matrix multiplication that runs in $\hat{O}(n^3/\log^4 n)$ time, where the
$\hat{O}$ notation suppresses poly(loglog) factors. This improves the previous
best combinatorial algorithm by Chan that runs in $\hat{O}(n^3/\log^3 n)$ time.
Our algorithm generalizes the divide-and-conquer strategy of Chan's algorithm.
Moreover, we propose a general framework for detecting triangles in graphs and
computing Boolean matrix multiplication. Roughly speaking, if we can find the
&quot;easy parts&quot; of a given instance efficiently, we can solve the whole problem
faster than $n^3$.

 <dc:description>  Modern classification problems frequently present mild to severe label
imbalance as well as specific requirements on classification characteristics,
and require optimizing performance measures that are non-decomposable over the
dataset, such as F-measure. Such measures have spurred much interest and pose
specific challenges to learning algorithms since their non-additive nature
precludes a direct application of well-studied large scale optimization methods
such as stochastic gradient descent.
  In this paper we reveal that for two large families of performance measures
that can be expressed as functions of true positive/negative rates, it is
indeed possible to implement point stochastic updates. The families we consider
are concave and pseudo-linear functions of TPR, TNR which cover several
popularly used performance measures such as F-measure, G-mean and H-mean.
  Our core contribution is an adaptive linearization scheme for these families,
using which we develop optimization techniques that enable truly point-based
stochastic updates. For concave performance measures we propose SPADE, a
stochastic primal dual solver; for pseudo-linear measures we propose STAMP, a
stochastic alternate maximization procedure. Both methods have crisp
convergence guarantees, demonstrate significant speedups over existing methods
- often by an order of magnitude or more, and give similar or more accurate
predictions on test data.

 <dc:description>  The problem of maximizing precision at the top of a ranked list, often dubbed
Precision@k (prec@k), finds relevance in myriad learning applications such as
ranking, multi-label classification, and learning with severe label imbalance.
However, despite its popularity, there exist significant gaps in our
understanding of this problem and its associated performance measure.
  The most notable of these is the lack of a convex upper bounding surrogate
for prec@k. We also lack scalable perceptron and stochastic gradient descent
algorithms for optimizing this performance measure. In this paper we make key
contributions in these directions. At the heart of our results is a family of
truly upper bounding surrogates for prec@k. These surrogates are motivated in a
principled manner and enjoy attractive properties such as consistency to prec@k
under various natural margin/noise conditions.
  These surrogates are then used to design a class of novel perceptron
algorithms for optimizing prec@k with provable mistake bounds. We also devise
scalable stochastic gradient descent style methods for this problem with
provable convergence bounds. Our proofs rely on novel uniform convergence
bounds which require an in-depth analysis of the structural properties of
prec@k and its surrogates. We conclude with experimental results comparing our
algorithms with state-of-the-art cutting plane and stochastic gradient
algorithms for maximizing prec@k.

 <dc:description>  We apply belief propagation to a Bayesian bipartite graph composed of
discrete independent hidden variables and discrete visible variables. The
network is the Discrete counterpart of Independent Component Analysis (DICA)
and it is manipulated in a factor graph form for inference and learning. A full
set of simulations is reported for character images from the MNIST dataset. The
results show that the factorial code implemented by the sources contributes to
build a good generative model for the data that can be used in various
inference modes.

 <dc:description>  We present the first power over Wi-Fi system that delivers power and works
with existing Wi-Fi chipsets. Specifically, we show that a ubiquitous piece of
wireless communication infrastructure, the Wi-Fi router, can provide far field
wireless power without compromising the network's communication performance.
Building on our design we prototype, for the first time, battery-free
temperature and camera sensors that are powered using Wi-Fi chipsets with
ranges of 20 and 17 feet respectively. We also demonstrate the ability to
wirelessly recharge nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion coin-cell batteries at
distances of up to 28 feet. Finally, we deploy our system in six homes in a
metropolitan area and show that our design can successfully deliver power via
Wi-Fi in real-world network conditions.

 <dc:title>Representing Meaning with a Combination of Logical and Distributional

 <dc:description>  NLP tasks differ in the semantic information they require, and at this time
no single se- mantic representation fulfills all requirements. Logic-based
representations characterize sentence structure, but do not capture the graded
aspect of meaning. Distributional models give graded similarity ratings for
words and phrases, but do not capture sentence structure in the same detail as
logic-based approaches. So it has been argued that the two are complementary.
We adopt a hybrid approach that combines logic-based and distributional
semantics through probabilistic logic inference in Markov Logic Networks
(MLNs). In this paper, we focus on the three components of a practical system
integrating logical and distributional models: 1) Parsing and task
representation is the logic-based part where input problems are represented in
probabilistic logic. This is quite different from representing them in standard
first-order logic. 2) For knowledge base construction we form weighted
inference rules. We integrate and compare distributional information with other
sources, notably WordNet and an existing paraphrase collection. In particular,
we use our system to evaluate distributional lexical entailment approaches. We
use a variant of Robinson resolution to determine the necessary inference
rules. More sources can easily be added by mapping them to logical rules; our
system learns a resource-specific weight that corrects for scaling differences
between resources. 3) In discussing probabilistic inference, we show how to
solve the inference problems efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we use the
task of textual entailment (RTE), which can utilize the strengths of both
logic-based and distributional representations. In particular we focus on the
SICK dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:title>Coalgebraic Infinite Traces and Kleisli Simulations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Urabe, Natsuki</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Kleisli simulation is a categorical notion introduced by Hasuo to verify
finite trace inclusion. They allow us to give definitions of forward and
backward simulation for various types of systems. A generic categorical theory
behind Kleisli simulation has been developed and it guarantees the soundness of
those simulations wrt. finite trace semantics. Moreover, those simulations can
be aided by forward partial execution (FPE)---a categorical transformation of
systems previously introduced by the authors.
  In this paper, we give Kleisli simulation a theoretical foundation that
assures its soundness also wrt. infinite trace. There, following Jacobs' work,
infinite trace semantics is characterized as the &quot;largest homomorphism.&quot; It
turns out that soundness of forward simulations is rather straightforward; that
of backward simulation holds too, although it requires certain additional
conditions and its proof is more involved. We also show that FPE can be
successfully employed in the infinite trace setting to enhance the
applicability of Kleisli simulations as witnesses of trace inclusion. Our
framework is parameterized in the monad for branching as well as in the functor
for linear-time behaviors; for the former we use the powerset monad (for
nondeterminism) as well as the sub-Giry monad (for probability).

 <dc:title>Deep Ranking for Person Re-identification via Joint Representation
  Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel approach to person re-identification, a
fundamental task in distributed multi-camera surveillance systems. Although a
variety of powerful algorithms have been presented in the past few years, most
of them usually focus on designing hand-crafted features and learning metrics
either individually or sequentially. Different from previous works, we
formulate a unified deep ranking framework that jointly tackles both of these
key components to maximize their strengths. We start from the principle that
the correct match of the probe image should be positioned in the top rank
within the whole gallery set. An effective learning-to-rank algorithm is
proposed to minimize the cost corresponding to the ranking disorders of the
gallery. The ranking model is solved with a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) that builds the relation between input image pairs and their similarity
scores through joint representation learning directly from raw image pixels.
The proposed framework allows us to get rid of feature engineering and does not
rely on any assumption. An extensive comparative evaluation is given,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art
approaches, including both traditional and CNN-based methods on the challenging
VIPeR, CUHK-01 and CAVIAR4REID datasets. Additionally, our approach has better
ability to generalize across datasets without fine-tuning.

 <dc:description>  As tools for dynamic system modelling both conventional methods such as
transfer function or state space representation and modern power flow based
methods are available. The latter methods do not depend on energy domain, are
able to preserve physical system structures, visualize power conversion or
coupling or split, identify power losses or storage, run on conventional
software and emphasize the relevance of energy as basic principle of known
physical domains. Nevertheless common control structures as well as analysis
and design tools may still be applied. Furthermore the generalization of power
flow methods as pseudo-power flow provides with a universal tool for any
dynamic modelling. The phenomenon of power flow constitutes an up to date
education methodology. Thus the paper summarizes fundamentals of selected power
flow oriented modelling methods, presents a Bond Graph block library for
teaching power oriented modelling as compact menu-driven freeware, introduces
selected examples and discusses special features.

 <dc:description>  On modern operating systems, applications under the same user are separated
from each other, for the purpose of protecting them against malware and
compromised programs. Given the complexity of today's OSes, less clear is
whether such isolation is effective against different kind of cross-app
resource access attacks (called XARA in our research). To better understand the
problem, on the less-studied Apple platforms, we conducted a systematic
security analysis on MAC OS~X and iOS. Our research leads to the discovery of a
series of high-impact security weaknesses, which enable a sandboxed malicious
app, approved by the Apple Stores, to gain unauthorized access to other apps'
sensitive data. More specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction
services, including the keychain, WebSocket and NSConnection on OS~X and URL
Scheme on the MAC OS and iOS, can all be exploited by the malware to steal such
confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and bank, and the
secret token of Evernote. Further, the design of the app sandbox on OS~X was
found to be vulnerable, exposing an app's private directory to the sandboxed
malware that hijacks its Apple Bundle ID. As a result, sensitive user data,
like the notes and user contacts under Evernote and photos under WeChat, have
all been disclosed. Fundamentally, these problems are caused by the lack of
app-to-app and app-to-OS authentications. To better understand their impacts,
we developed a scanner that automatically analyzes the binaries of MAC OS and
iOS apps to determine whether proper protection is missing in their code.
Running it on hundreds of binaries, we confirmed the pervasiveness of the
weaknesses among high-impact Apple apps. Since the issues may not be easily
fixed, we built a simple program that detects exploit attempts on OS~X, helping
protect vulnerable apps before the problems can be fully addressed.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, based on a successively accuracy-increasing approximation of
the $\ell_0$ norm, we propose a new algorithm for recovery of sparse vectors
from underdetermined measurements. The approximations are realized with a
certain class of concave functions that aggressively induce sparsity and their
closeness to the $\ell_0$ norm can be controlled. We prove that the series of
the approximations asymptotically coincides with the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_0$
norms when the approximation accuracy changes from the worst fitting to the
best fitting. When measurements are noise-free, an optimization scheme is
proposed which leads to a number of weighted $\ell_1$ minimization programs,
whereas, in the presence of noise, we propose two iterative thresholding
methods that are computationally appealing. A convergence guarantee for the
iterative thresholding method is provided, and, for a particular function in
the class of the approximating functions, we derive the closed-form
thresholding operator. We further present some theoretical analyses via the
restricted isometry, null space, and spherical section properties. Our
extensive numerical simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm closely
follows the performance of the oracle estimator for a range of sparsity levels
wider than those of the state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Trajectory planning is a critical step while programming the parallel
manipulators in a robotic cell. The main problem arises when there exists a
singular configuration between the two poses of the end-effectors while
discretizing the path with a classical approach. This paper presents an
algebraic method to check the feasibility of any given trajectories in the
workspace. The solutions of the polynomial equations associated with the
tra-jectories are projected in the joint space using Gr{\&quot;o}bner based
elimination methods and the remaining equations are expressed in a parametric
form where the articular variables are functions of time t unlike any numerical
or discretization method. These formal computations allow to write the Jacobian
of the manip-ulator as a function of time and to check if its determinant can
vanish between two poses. Another benefit of this approach is to use a largest
workspace with a more complex shape than a cube, cylinder or sphere. For the
Orthoglide, a three degrees of freedom parallel robot, three different
trajectories are used to illustrate this method.

 <dc:description>  The subject of this paper is about the kinematic analysis and the trajectory
planning of the Orthoglide 5-axis. The Orthoglide 5-axis a five degrees of
freedom parallel kinematic machine developed at IRCCyN and is made up of a
hybrid architecture, namely, a three degrees of freedom translational parallel
manip-ulator mounted in series with a two degrees of freedom parallel spherical
wrist. The simpler the kinematic modeling of the Or-thoglide 5-axis, the higher
the maximum frequency of its control loop. Indeed, the control loop of a
parallel kinematic machine should be computed with a high frequency, i.e.,
higher than 1.5 MHz, in order the manipulator to be able to reach high speed
motions with a good accuracy. Accordingly, the direct and inverse kinematic
models of the Orthoglide 5-axis, its inverse kine-matic Jacobian matrix and the
first derivative of the latter with respect to time are expressed in this
paper. It appears that the kinematic model of the manipulator under study can
be written in a quadratic form due to the hybrid architecture of the Orthoglide
5-axis. As illustrative examples, the profiles of the actuated joint angles
(lengths), velocities and accelerations that are used in the control loop of
the robot are traced for two test trajectories.

 <dc:title>Remark on &quot;Algorithm 916: Computing the Faddeyeva and Voigt functions&quot;:
  Efficiency Improvements and Fortran Translation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This remark describes efficiency improvements to Algorithm 916 [Zaghloul and
Ali 2011]. It is shown that the execution time required by the algorithm, when
run at its highest accuracy, may be improved by more than a factor of two. A
better accuracy vs efficiency trade off scheme is also implemented; this
requires the user to supply the number of significant figures desired in the
computed values as an extra input argument to the function. Using this
trade-off, it is shown that the efficiency of the algorithm may be further
improved significantly while maintaining reasonably accurate and safe results
that are free of the pitfalls and complete loss of accuracy seen in other
competitive techniques. The current version of the code is provided in Matlab
and Scilab in addition to a Fortran translation prepared to meet the needs of
real-world problems where very large numbers of function evaluations would
require the use of a compiled language. To fulfill this last requirement, a
recently proposed reformed version of Humlicek's w4 routine, shown to maintain
the claimed accuracy of the algorithm over a wide and fine grid is implemented
in the present Fortran translation for the case of 4 significant figures. This
latter modification assures the reliability of the code to be employed in the
solution of practical problems requiring numerous evaluation of the function
for applications tolerating low accuracy computations (&lt;10-4).

 <dc:description>  One particular challenge in AI is the computational modelling and simulation
of creativity. Feedback and learning from experience are key aspects of the
creative process. Here we investigate how we could implement feedback in
creative systems using a social model. From the field of creative writing we
borrow the concept of a Writers Workshop as a model for learning through
feedback. The Writers Workshop encourages examination, discussion and debates
of a piece of creative work using a prescribed format of activities. We propose
a computational model of the Writers Workshop as a roadmap for incorporation of
feedback in artificial creativity systems. We argue that the Writers Workshop
setting describes the anatomy of the creative process. We support our claim
with a case study that describes how to implement the Writers Workshop model in
a computational creativity system. We present this work using patterns other
people can follow to implement similar designs in their own systems. We
conclude by discussing the broader relevance of this model to other aspects of
AI.

 <dc:description>  Smell has a huge influence over how we perceive places. Despite its
importance, smell has been crucially overlooked by urban planners and
scientists alike, not least because it is difficult to record and analyze at
scale. One of the authors of this paper has ventured out in the urban world and
conducted smellwalks in a variety of cities: participants were exposed to a
range of different smellscapes and asked to record their experiences. As a
result, smell-related words have been collected and classified, creating the
first dictionary for urban smell. Here we explore the possibility of using
social media data to reliably map the smells of entire cities. To this end, for
both Barcelona and London, we collect geo-referenced picture tags from Flickr
and Instagram, and geo-referenced tweets from Twitter. We match those tags and
tweets with the words in the smell dictionary. We find that smell-related words
are best classified in ten categories. We also find that specific categories
(e.g., industry, transport, cleaning) correlate with governmental air quality
indicators, adding validity to our study.

 <dc:description>  In future wireless networks, a significant number of users will be vehicular.
One promising solution to improve the capacity for these vehicular users is to
employ moving relays or car base stations. The system forms cell inside the
vehicle and then uses rooftop antenna for back-hauling to overcome the
vehicular penetration loss. In this paper, we develop a model for aggregate
interference distribution generated from moving/parked cars to indoor users in
order to study whether indoor femto-cells can coexist on the same spectrum with
vehicular communications. Since spectrum authorization for vehicular
communications is open at moment, we consider two spectrum sharing scenarios
(i) communication from mounted antennas on the roof of the vehicles to the
infrastructure network utilizes same spectrum with indoor femto-cells (ii)
in-vehicle communication utilizes same spectrum with indoor femto-cells while
vehicular to infrastructure (V2I) communication is allocated at different
spectrum. Based on our findings we suggest that V2I and indoor femto-cells
should be allocated at different spectrum. The reason being that mounted
roof-top antennas facing the indoor cells generate unacceptable interference
levels. On the other hand, in-vehicle communication and indoor cells can share
the spectrum thanks to the vehicle body isolation and the lower transmit power
levels that can be used inside the vehicle.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of simultaneous on-demand streaming of stored video
to multiple users in a multi-cell wireless network where multiple unicast
streaming sessions are run in parallel and share the same frequency band. Each
streaming session is formed by the sequential transmission of video &quot;chunks,&quot;
such that each chunk arrives into the corresponding user playback buffer within
its playback deadline. We formulate the problem as a Network Utility
Maximization (NUM) where the objective is to fairly maximize users' video
streaming Quality of Experience (QoE) and then derive an iterative control
policy using Lyapunov Optimization, which solves the NUM problem up to any
level of accuracy and yields an online protocol with control actions at every
iteration decomposing into two layers interconnected by the users' request
queues : i) a video streaming adaptation layer reminiscent of DASH, implemented
at each user node; ii) a transmission scheduling layer where a max-weight
scheduler is implemented at each base station. The proposed chunk request
scheme is a pull strategy where every user opportunistically requests video
chunks from the neighboring base stations and dynamically adapts the quality of
its requests based on the current size of the request queue. For the
transmission scheduling component, we first describe the general max-weight
scheduler and then particularize it to a wireless network where the base
stations have multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) beamforming capabilities. We exploit the
channel hardening effect of large-dimensional MIMO channels (massive MIMO) and
devise a low complexity user selection scheme to solve the underlying
combinatorial problem of selecting user subsets for downlink beamforming, which
can be easily implemented and run independently at each base station.

 <dc:title>Detecting Unrealizability of Distributed Fault-tolerant Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Finkbeiner, Bernd</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tentrup, Leander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Writing formal specifications for distributed systems is difficult. Even
simple consistency requirements often turn out to be unrealizable because of
the complicated information flow in the distributed system: not all information
is available in every component, and information transmitted from other
components may arrive with a delay or not at all, especially in the presence of
faults. The problem of checking the distributed realizability of a temporal
specification is, in general, undecidable. Semi-algorithms for synthesis, such
as bounded synthesis, are only useful in the positive case, where they
construct an implementation for a realizable specification, but not in the
negative case: if the specification is unrealizable, the search for the
implementation never terminates. In this paper, we introduce counterexamples to
distributed realizability and present a method for the detection of such
counterexamples for specifications given in linear-time temporal logic (LTL). A
counterexample consists of a set of paths, each representing a different
sequence of inputs from the environment, such that, no matter how the
components are implemented, the specification is violated on at least one of
these paths. We present a method for finding such counterexamples both for the
classic distributed realizability problem and for the fault-tolerant
realizability problem. Our method considers, incrementally, larger and larger
sets of paths until a counterexample is found. For safety specifications in
weakly ordered architectures we obtain a decision procedure, while
counterexamples for full LTL and arbitrary architectures may consist of
infinitely many paths. Experimental results, obtained with a QBF-based
prototype implementation, show that our method finds simple errors very
quickly, and even problems with high combinatorial complexity, like the
Byzantine Generals' Problem, are tractable.

In this model we explore the feasibility of multi-writer multi-reader atomic

bounds for solving the atomic storage in all the explored models. Our results,
significantly different from the static case, advocate for a deeper study of
the main building blocks of distributed computing while the system is prone to
mobile Byzantine failures.

 <dc:description>  Big data benchmarking is particularly important and provides applicable
yardsticks for evaluating booming big data systems. However, wide coverage and
great complexity of big data computing impose big challenges on big data
benchmarking. How can we construct a benchmark suite using a minimum set of
units of computation to represent diversity of big data analytics workloads?
Big data dwarfs are abstractions of extracting frequently appearing operations
in big data computing. One dwarf represents one unit of computation, and big
data workloads are decomposed into one or more dwarfs. Furthermore, dwarfs
workloads rather than vast real workloads are more cost-efficient and
representative to evaluate big data systems. In this paper, we extensively
investigate six most important or emerging application domains i.e. search
engine, social network, e-commerce, multimedia, bioinformatics and astronomy.
After analyzing forty representative algorithms, we single out eight dwarfs
workloads in big data analytics other than OLAP, which are linear algebra,
sampling, logic operations, transform operations, set operations, graph
operations, statistic operations and sort.

 <dc:description>  Delay constrained linear transmission (LT) strategies are considered for the
transmission of composite Gaussian measurements over an additive white Gaussian
noise fading channel under an average power constraint. If the channel state
information (CSI) is known by both the encoder and decoder, the optimal LT
scheme in terms of the average mean-square error distortion is characterized
under a strict delay constraint, and a graphical interpretation of the optimal
power allocation strategy is presented. Then, for general delay constraints,
two LT strategies are proposed based on the solution to a particular multiple
measurements-parallel channels scenario. It is shown that the distortion
decreases as the delay constraint is relaxed, and when the delay constraint is
completely removed, both strategies achieve the optimal performance under
certain matching conditions. If the CSI is known only by the decoder, the
optimal LT strategy is derived under a strict delay constraint. The extension
for general delay constraints is shown to be hard. As a first step towards
understanding the structure of the optimal scheme in this case, it is shown
that for the multiple measurements-parallel channels scenario, any LT scheme
that uses only a one-to-one linear mapping between measurements and channels is
suboptimal in general.

 <dc:title>Computationally efficient MIMO system identification using Signal
  Matched Synthesis Filter Bank</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fatimah, Binish</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Joshi, Shiv Dutt</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a multi input multi output(MIMO) system identification framework
by interpreting the MIMO system in terms of a multirate synthesis filter bank.
The proposed methodology is discussed in two steps: in the first step the MIMO
system is interpreted as a synthesis filter bank and the second step is to
convert the MIMO system into a SISO system &quot;without any loss of information&quot;,
which re-structures the system identification problem into a SISO form. The
system identification problem, in its new form, is identical to the problem of
obtaining the signal matched synthesis filter bank (SMSFB) as proposed in Part
II. Since we have developed fast algorithms to obtain the filter bank
coefficients in Part II, for &quot;the given data case&quot; as well as &quot;the given
statistics case&quot;, we can use these algorithm for the MIMO system identification
as well. This framework can have an adaptive as well as block processing
implementation. The algorithms, used here, involve only scalar computations,
unlike the conventional MIMO system identification algorithms where one
requires matrix computations. These order recursive algorithm can also be used
to obtain approximate smaller order model for large order systems without using
any model order reduction algorithm. The proposed identification framework can
also be used for SISO LPTV system identification and also for a SIMO or MISO
system. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is validated and its performance in
the presence of measurement noise is illustrated using simulation results.

 <dc:title>Characterization of SINR Region for Multiple Interfering Multicast in
  Power-Controlled Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Yi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sung, Chi Wan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers a wireless communication network consisting of multiple
interfering multicast sessions. Different from a unicast system where each
transmitter has only one receiver, in a multicast system, each transmitter has
multiple receivers. It is a well known result for wireless unicast systems that
the feasibility of an signal-to-interference-plus-noise power ratio (SINR)
without power constraint is decided by the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of a
nonnegative matrix. We generalize this result and propose necessary and
sufficient conditions for the feasibility of an SINR in a wireless multicast
system with and without power constraint. The feasible SINR region as well as
its geometric properties are studied. Besides, an iterative algorithm is
proposed which can efficiently check the feasibility condition and compute the
boundary points of the feasible SINR region.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper the following selection problem is discussed. A set of $n$
items is given and we wish to choose a subset of exactly $p$ items of the
minimum total cost. This problem is a special case of 0-1 knapsack in which all
the item weights are equal to~1. Its deterministic version has a trivial
$O(n)$-time algorithm, which consists in choosing $p$ items of the smallest
costs. In this paper it is assumed that the item costs are uncertain. Two
robust models, namely two-stage and recoverable ones, under discrete and
interval uncertainty representations, are discussed. Several positive and
negative complexity results for both of them are provided.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Current cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin, build a decentralized
blockchain-based transaction ledger, maintained through proofs-of-work that
also generate a monetary supply. Such decentralization has benefits, such as
independence from national political control, but also significant limitations
in terms of scalability and computational cost. We introduce RSCoin, a
cryptocurrency framework in which central banks maintain complete control over
the monetary supply, but rely on a distributed set of authorities, or
mintettes, to prevent double-spending. While monetary policy is centralized,
RSCoin still provides strong transparency and auditability guarantees. We
demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the benefits of a modest
degree of centralization, such as the elimination of wasteful hashing and a
scalable system for avoiding double-spending attacks.

 <dc:title>Times series averaging from a probabilistic interpretation of

 <dc:creator>Marteau, Pierre-Fran&#xe7;ois</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  At the light of regularized dynamic time warping kernels, this paper
reconsider the concept of time elastic centroid (TEC) for a set of time series.
From this perspective, we show first how TEC can easily be addressed as a
preimage problem. Unfortunately this preimage problem is ill-posed, may suffer
from over-fitting especially for long time series and getting a sub-optimal
solution involves heavy computational costs. We then derive two new algorithms
based on a probabilistic interpretation of kernel alignment matrices that
expresses in terms of probabilistic distributions over sets of alignment paths.
The first algorithm is an iterative agglomerative heuristics inspired from the
state of the art DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) algorithm proposed specifically
for the Dynamic Time Warping measure. The second proposed algorithm achieves a
classical averaging of the aligned samples but also implements an averaging of
the time of occurrences of the aligned samples. It exploits a straightforward
progressive agglomerative heuristics. An experimentation that compares for 45
time series datasets classification error rates obtained by first near
neighbors classifiers exploiting a single medoid or centroid estimate to
represent each categories show that: i) centroids based approaches
significantly outperform medoids based approaches, ii) on the considered
experience, the two proposed algorithms outperform the state of the art DBA
algorithm, and iii) the second proposed algorithm that implements an averaging
jointly in the sample space and along the time axes emerges as the most
significantly robust time elastic averaging heuristic with an interesting noise
reduction capability. Index Terms-Time series averaging Time elastic kernel

 <dc:description>  In this work we show that the classification performance of high-dimensional
structural MRI data with only a small set of training examples is improved by
the usage of dimension reduction methods. We assessed two different dimension
reduction variants: feature selection by ANOVA F-test and feature
transformation by PCA. On the reduced datasets, we applied common learning
algorithms using 5-fold cross-validation. Training, tuning of the
hyperparameters, as well as the performance evaluation of the classifiers was
conducted using two different performance measures: Accuracy, and Receiver
Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). Our hypothesis is supported by
experimental results.

 <dc:description>  Metagenomics characterizes the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities
by sequencing DNA directly from an environmental sample. One of the main
challenges in metagenomics data analysis is the binning step, where each
sequenced read is assigned to a taxonomic clade. Due to the large volume of
metagenomics datasets, binning methods need fast and accurate algorithms that
can operate with reasonable computing requirements. While standard
alignment-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance, compositional
approaches that assign a taxonomic class to a DNA read based on the k-mers it
contains have the potential to provide faster solutions. In this work, we
investigate the potential of modern, large-scale machine learning
implementations for taxonomic affectation of next-generation sequencing reads
based on their k-mers profile. We show that machine learning-based
compositional approaches benefit from increasing the number of fragments
sampled from reference genome to tune their parameters, up to a coverage of
about 10, and from increasing the k-mer size to about 12. Tuning these models
involves training a machine learning model on about 10 8 samples in 10 7
dimensions, which is out of reach of standard soft-wares but can be done
efficiently with modern implementations for large-scale machine learning. The
resulting models are competitive in terms of accuracy with well-established
alignment tools for problems involving a small to moderate number of candidate
species, and for reasonable amounts of sequencing errors. We show, however,
that compositional approaches are still limited in their ability to deal with
problems involving a greater number of species, and more sensitive to
sequencing errors. We finally confirm that compositional approach achieve
faster prediction times, with a gain of 3 to 15 times with respect to the
BWA-MEM short read mapper, depending on the number of candidate species and the
level of sequencing noise.

 <dc:description>  The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to an
increase in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at their
disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations
of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many
people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they
provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and
discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with
relatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestions
on how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The dataset
consists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons. I used two different
methods to predict the Fantasy Football scores of NFL players: Support Vector
Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks. The results of both are promising given
the limited data that was used.

 <dc:description>  Blogging is a popular way of expressing opinions and discussing topics.
Bloggers demonstrate different levels of commitment and most interesting are
influential bloggers. Around such bloggers, the groups are forming, which
concentrate users sharing similar interests. Finding such bloggers is an
important task and has many applications e.g. marketing, business, politics.
Influential ones affect others which is related to the process of diffusion.
However, there is no objective way to telling which blogger is more
influential. Therefore, researchers take into consideration different criteria
to assess bloggers (e.g. SNA centrality measures). In this paper we propose
new, efficient method for influential bloggers discovery which is based on
relation of commenting in blogger's thread and is defined on bloggers level.
Next, we compare results with other, comparative method proposed by Agarwal et
al. called iFinder which is based on links between posts.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study multidimensional persistence modules [5,13] via what
we call tame functors and noise systems. A noise system leads to a
pseudo-metric topology on the category of tame functors. We show how this
pseudo-metric can be used to identify persistent features of compact
multidimensional persistence modules. To count such features we introduce the
feature counting invariant and prove that assigning this invariant to compact
tame functors is a 1-Lipschitz operation. For 1-dimensional persistence, we
explain how, by choosing an appropriate noise system, the feature counting
invariant identifies the same persistent features as the classical barcode
construction.

 <dc:description>  With large volumes of detailed health care data being collected, there is a
high demand for the release of this data for research purposes. Hospitals and
organizations are faced with conflicting interests of releasing this data and
protecting the confidentiality of the individuals to whom the data pertains.
Similarly, there is a conflict in the need to release precise geographic
information for certain research applications and the requirement to censor or
generalize the same information for the sake of confidentiality. Ultimately the
challenge is to anonymize data in order to comply with government privacy
policies while reducing the loss in geographic information as much as possible.
In this paper, we present a novel geographic-based system for the anonymization
of health care data. This system is broken up into major components for which
different approaches may be supplied. We compare such approaches in order to
make recommendations on which of them to select to best match user
requirements.

 <dc:title>Parameterized Linear Temporal Logics Meet Costs: Still not Costlier than

 <dc:creator>Zimmermann, Martin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We continue the investigation of parameterized extensions of Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL) that retain the attractive algorithmic properties of LTL: a
polynomial space model checking algorithm and a doubly-exponential time
algorithm for solving games. Alur et al. and Kupferman et al. showed that this
is the case for Parametric LTL (PLTL) and PROMPT-LTL respectively, which have
temporal operators equipped with variables that bound their scope in time.
Later, this was also shown to be true for Parametric LDL (PLDL), which extends
PLTL to be able to express all omega-regular properties.
  Here, we generalize PLTL to systems with costs, i.e., we do not bound the
scope of operators in time, but bound the scope in terms of the cost
accumulated during time. Again, we show that model checking and solving games
for specifications in PLTL with costs is not harder than the corresponding
problems for LTL. Finally, we discuss PLDL with costs and extensions to
multiple cost functions.

fit well with the algorithmic results until the emergence of the unfrozen core,
which makes the fluctuation of statistical quantities and causes the replica
symmetric breaking in the solutions. Besides, the entropy of bipartite
Vertex-Cover solutions is calculated with the clustering entropy using a cycle
simplification technique for the unfrozen core. Furthermore, as generalization
of bipartite graphs, bipartite core graph is proposed, the solution space of
which can also be easily determined; and based on these results, how to
generate a $K\ddot{o}nig-Egerv\acute{a}ry$ subgraph is studied by a growth
process of adding edges. The investigation of solution space of bipartite graph
Vertex-Cover provides intensive understanding and some insights on the solution
space complexity, and will produce benefit for finding maximal
$K\ddot{o}nig-Egerv\acute{a}ry$ subgraphs, solving general graph Vertex-Cover
and recognizing the intrinsic hardness of NP-complete problems.

 <dc:description>  Linear dimensionality reduction techniques are powerful tools for image
analysis as they allow the identification of important features in a data set.
In particular, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become very popular
as it is able to extract sparse, localized and easily interpretable features by
imposing an additive combination of nonnegative basis elements. Nonnegative
matrix underapproximation (NMU) is a closely related technique that has the
advantage to identify features sequentially. In this paper, we propose a
variant of NMU that is particularly well suited for image analysis as it
incorporates the spatial information, that is, it takes into account the fact
that neighboring pixels are more likely to be contained in the same features,
and favors the extraction of localized features by looking for sparse basis
elements. We show that our new approach competes favorably with comparable
state-of-the-art techniques on synthetic, facial and hyperspectral image data
sets.

tapping into a larger source of patient information. Telemedicine will have a
profound impact on patient care, increase access and quality, and represent an
opportunity to keep health care costs down. Data generated by smart devices
will enable the real-time monitoring of chronic diseases, allowing optimal

 <dc:description>  Formulations of the Image Decomposition Problem as a Multicut Problem (MP)
w.r.t. a superpixel graph have received considerable attention. In contrast,
instances of the MP w.r.t. a pixel grid graph have received little attention,
firstly, because the MP is NP-hard and instances w.r.t. a pixel grid graph are
hard to solve in practice, and, secondly, due to the lack of long-range terms
in the objective function of the MP. We propose a generalization of the MP with
long-range terms (LMP). We design and implement two efficient algorithms
(primal feasible heuristics) for the MP and LMP which allow us to study
instances of both problems w.r.t. the pixel grid graphs of the images in the
BSDS-500 benchmark. The decompositions we obtain do not differ significantly
from the state of the art, suggesting that the LMP is a competitive formulation
of the Image Decomposition Problem. To demonstrate the generality of the LMP,
we apply it also to the Mesh Decomposition Problem posed by the Princeton
benchmark, obtaining state-of-the-art decompositions.

 <dc:description>  We solve the long-standing problem of making n perfect clones from m copies
of one of two known pure states with minimum failure probability in the general
case where the known states have arbitrary a priori probabilities. The solution
emerges from a geometric formulation of the problem. This formulation also
reveals a deeper connection between cloning and state discrimination. The
convergence of cloning to state discrimination as the number of clones goes to
infinity exhibits a phenomenon analogous to a second order symmetry breaking
phase transition.

 <dc:description>  Demange (2012) generalized the classical single-crossing property to the
intermediate property on median graphs and proved that the representative voter
theorem still holds for this more general framework. We complement her result
with proving that the linear orders of any profile which is intermediate on a
median graph form a Condorcet domain. We prove that for any median graph there
exists a profile that is intermediate with respect to that graph and that one
may need at least as many alternatives as vertices to construct such a profile.
We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize whether or not a given
profile is intermediate with respect to some median graph. Finally, we show
that finding winners for the Chamberlin-Courant rule is polynomial-time
solvable for profiles that are single-crossing on a tree.

 <dc:description>  We show a general problem-solving tool called limit theory. This is an
advanced version of asymptotic analysis of discrete problems when some finite
parameter tends to infinity. We will apply it on three closely related
problems. Alpern's Caching Game (for 2 nuts) is defined as follows. The hider
caches 2 nuts into one or two of $n$ potential holes by digging at most 1 depth
in total. The goal of the searcher is to find both nuts in a limited time $h$,
otherwise the hider wins. We will show that if $h$ and $n/h$ are large enough,
then very counterintuitively, any optimal hiding strategy should dig less than
1 in total, with positive probability. We will prove it by defining and
analyzing a limit problem. Then we will partially solve the entire problem. We
will also have significant progress with two other problems: the
Manickam--Mikl\'os--Singhi Conjecture and the Kikuta--Ruckle Conjecture.

 <dc:description>  The significance of the study of the theoretical and practical properties of
AdaBoost is unquestionable, given its simplicity, wide practical use, and
effectiveness on real-world datasets. Here we present a few open problems
regarding the behavior of &quot;Optimal AdaBoost,&quot; a term coined by Rudin,
Daubechies, and Schapire in 2004 to label the simple version of the standard
AdaBoost algorithm in which the weak learner that AdaBoost uses always outputs
the weak classifier with lowest weighted error among the respective hypothesis
class of weak classifiers implicit in the weak learner. We concentrate on the
standard, &quot;vanilla&quot; version of Optimal AdaBoost for binary classification that
results from using an exponential-loss upper bound on the misclassification
training error. We present two types of open problems. One deals with general
weak hypotheses. The other deals with the particular case of decision stumps,
as often and commonly used in practice. Answers to the open problems can have
immediate significant impact to (1) cementing previously established results on
asymptotic convergence properties of Optimal AdaBoost, for finite datasets,
which in turn can be the start to any convergence-rate analysis; (2)
understanding the weak-hypotheses class of effective decision stumps generated
from data, which we have empirically observed to be significantly smaller than
the typically obtained class, as well as the effect on the weak learner's
running time and previously established improved bounds on the generalization
performance of Optimal AdaBoost classifiers; and (3) shedding some light on the
&quot;self control&quot; that AdaBoost tends to exhibit in practice.

 <dc:description>  Defects4J is a large, peer-reviewed, structured dataset of real-world Java
bugs. Each bug in Defects4J is provided with a test suite and at least one
failing test case that triggers the bug. In this paper, we report on an
experiment to explore the effectiveness of automatic repair on Defects4J. The
result of our experiment shows that 47 bugs of the Defects4J dataset can be
automatically repaired by state-of- the-art repair. This sets a baseline for
future research on automatic repair for Java. We have manually analyzed 84
different patches to assess their real correctness. In total, 9 real Java bugs
can be correctly fixed with test-suite based repair. This analysis shows that
test-suite based repair suffers from under-specified bugs, for which trivial
and incorrect patches still pass the test suite. With respect to practical
applicability, it takes in average 14.8 minutes to find a patch. The experiment
was done on a scientific grid, totaling 17.6 days of computation time. All
their systems and experimental results are publicly available on Github in
order to facilitate future research on automatic repair.

 <dc:description>  The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa raised many questions about the
control of infectious disease in an increasingly connected global society.
Limited availability of contact information made contact tracing difficult or
impractical in combating the outbreak. We consider the development of
multi-scale public health strategies and simulate policies for community-level
response aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as
well as travel restrictions to prevent community cross-contamination. Our
analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of
compliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies
is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are
consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline
after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective
at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40%
level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected
areas. Our results suggest that the multi-scale approach can be used to further
evolve public health strategy for defeating emerging epidemics.

 <dc:description>  The following fact is known for large classes of distributed control systems:
when the target is regular, there exists a regular steering control. This fact
is important to prove convergence estimates of numerical algorithms for the
approximate computation of the steering control.
  In this paper we extend this property to a class of systems with persistent
memory (of Maxwell/Boltzmann type) and we give a variational characterization
of the smooth steering control which may open the way to an extension of the
numerical approach proposed by Ervedoza and Zuazua.

 <dc:description>  We define the nervous system of a robot as the processing unit responsible
for controlling the robot body, together with the links between the processing
unit and the sensorimotor hardware of the robot - i.e., the equivalent of the
central nervous system in biological organisms. We present autonomous robots
that can merge their nervous systems when they physically connect to each
other, creating a &quot;virtual nervous system&quot; (VNS). We show that robots with a
VNS have capabilities beyond those found in any existing robotic system or
biological organism: they can merge into larger bodies with a single brain
(i.e., processing unit), split into separate bodies with independent brains,
and temporarily acquire sensing and actuating capabilities of specialized peer
robots. VNS-based robots can also self-heal by removing or replacing
malfunctioning body parts, including the brain.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary game theory classically investigates which behavioral patterns
are evolutionarily successful in a single game. More recently, a number of
contributions have studied the evolution of preferences instead: which
subjective conceptualizations of a game's payoffs give rise to evolutionarily
successful behavior in a single game. Here, we want to extend this existing
approach even further by asking: which general patterns of subjective
conceptualizations of payoff functions are evolutionarily successful across a
class of games. In other words, we will look at evolutionary competition of
payoff transformations in &quot;meta-games&quot;, obtained from averaging over payoffs of
single games. Focusing for a start on the class of 2x2 symmetric games, we show
that regret minimization can outperform payoff maximization if agents resort to
a security strategy in case of radical uncertainty.

 <dc:title>Joint error correction enhancement of the fountain codes concept</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Duda, Jarek</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Fountain codes like LT or Raptor codes, also known as rateless erasure codes,
allow to encode a message as some number of packets, such that any large enough
subset of these packets is sufficient to fully reconstruct the message. It
requires undamaged packets, while the packets which were not lost are usually
damaged in real scenarios. Hence, an additional error correction layer is often
required: adding some level of redundancy to each packet to be able to repair
eventual damages. This approach requires a priori knowledge of the final damage
level of every packet - insufficient redundancy leads to packet loss,
overprotection means suboptimal channel rate. However, the sender may have
inaccurate or even no a priori information about the final damage levels, for
example in applications like broadcasting, degradation of a storage medium or
damage of picture watermarking.
  Joint Reconstruction Codes (JRC) setting is introduced and discussed in this
paper for the purpose of removing the need of a priori knowledge of damage
level and sub-optimality caused by overprotection and discarding underprotected
packets. It is obtained by combining both processes: reconstruction from
multiple packets and forward error correction. The decoder combines the
resultant informational content of all received packets accordingly to their
actual noise level, which can be estimated a posteriori individually for each
packet. Assuming binary symmetric channel (BSC) of $\epsilon$ bit-flip
probability, every potentially damaged bit carries
$R_0(\epsilon)=1-h_1(\epsilon)$ bits of information, where $h_1$ is the Shannon
entropy. The minimal requirement to fully reconstruct the message is that the
sum of rate $R_0(\epsilon)$ over all bits is at least the size of the message.
We will discuss sequential decoding for the reconstruction purpose, which
statistical behavior can be estimated using Renyi entropy.

 <dc:description>  Coverage planning and optimization is one of the most crucial tasks for a
radio network operator. Efficient coverage optimization requires accurate
coverage estimation. This estimation relies on geo-located field measurements
which are gathered today during highly expensive drive tests (DT); and will be
reported in the near future by users' mobile devices thanks to the 3GPP
Minimizing Drive Tests (MDT) feature~\cite{3GPPproposal}. This feature consists
in an automatic reporting of the radio measurements associated with the
geographic location of the user's mobile device. Such a solution is still
costly in terms of battery consumption and signaling overhead. Therefore,
predicting the coverage on a location where no measurements are available
remains a key and challenging task. This paper describes a powerful tool that
gives an accurate coverage prediction on the whole area of interest: it builds
a coverage map by spatially interpolating geo-located measurements using the
Kriging technique. The paper focuses on the reduction of the computational
complexity of the Kriging algorithm by applying Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK). The
performance evaluation of the FRK algorithm both on simulated measurements and
real field measurements shows a good trade-off between prediction efficiency
and computational complexity. In order to go a step further towards the
operational application of the proposed algorithm, a multicellular use-case is
studied. Simulation results show a good performance in terms of coverage
prediction and detection of the best serving cell.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new probabilistic model for online learning which
dynamically incorporates information from stochastic gradients of an arbitrary
loss function. Similar to probabilistic filtering, the model maintains a
Gaussian belief over the optimal weight parameters. Unlike traditional Bayesian
updates, the model incorporates a small number of gradient evaluations at
locations chosen using Thompson sampling, making it computationally tractable.
The belief is then transformed via a linear flow field which optimally updates
the belief distribution using rules derived from information theoretic
principles. Several versions of the algorithm are shown using different
constraints on the flow field and compared with conventional online learning
algorithms. Results are given for several classification tasks including
logistic regression and multilayer neural networks.

 <dc:description>  Information Visualization techniques are built on a context with many factors
related to both vision and cognition, making it difficult to draw a clear
picture of how data visually turns into comprehension. In the intent of
promoting a better picture, here, we survey concepts on vision, cognition, and
Information Visualization organized in a theorization named Visual Expression
Process. Our theorization organizes the basis of visualization techniques with
a reduced level of complexity; still, it is complete enough to foster
discussions related to design and analytical tasks. Our work introduces the
following contributions: (1) a Theoretical compilation of vision, cognition,
and Information Visualization; (2) Discussions supported by vast literature;
and (3) Reflections on visual-cognitive aspects concerning use and design. We
expect our contributions will provide further clarification about how users and
designers think about InfoVis, leveraging the potential of systems and
techniques.

 <dc:description>  The Web has made it possible to harness human cognition en masse to achieve
new capabilities. Some of these successes are well known; for example Wikipedia
has become the go-to place for basic information on all things; Duolingo
engages millions of people in real-life translation of text, while
simultaneously teaching them to speak foreign languages; and fold.it has
enabled public-driven scientific discoveries by recasting complex biomedical
challenges into popular online puzzle games. These and other early successes
hint at the tremendous potential for future crowd-powered capabilities for the
benefit of health, education, science, and society. In the process, a new field
called Human Computation has emerged to better understand, replicate, and
improve upon these successes through scientific research. Human Computation
refers to the science that underlies online crowd-powered systems and was the
topic of a recent visioning activity in which a representative cross-section of
researchers, industry practitioners, visionaries, funding agency
representatives, and policy makers came together to understand what makes
crowd-powered systems successful. Teams of experts considered past, present,
and future human computation systems to explore which kinds of crowd-powered
systems have the greatest potential for societal impact and which kinds of
research will best enable the efficient development of new crowd-powered
systems to achieve this impact. This report summarize the products and findings
of those activities as well as the unconventional process and activities
employed by the workshop, which were informed by human computation research.

 <dc:description>  Many LOD datasets, such as DBpedia and LinkedGeoData, are voluminous and
process large amounts of requests from diverse applications. Many data products
and services rely on full or partial local LOD replications to ensure faster
querying and processing. While such replicas enhance the flexibility of
information sharing and integration infrastructures, they also introduce data
duplication with all the associated undesirable consequences. Given the
evolving nature of the original and authoritative datasets, to ensure
consistent and up-to-date replicas frequent replacements are required at a
great cost. In this paper, we introduce an approach for interest-based RDF
update propagation, which propagates only interesting parts of updates from the
source to the target dataset. Effectively, this enables remote applications to
`subscribe' to relevant datasets and consistently reflect the necessary changes
locally without the need to frequently replace the entire dataset (or a
relevant subset). Our approach is based on a formal definition for
graph-pattern-based interest expressions that is used to filter interesting
parts of updates from the source. We implement the approach in the iRap
framework and perform a comprehensive evaluation based on DBpedia Live updates,
to confirm the validity and value of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Network connectivity plays an important role in the information exchange
between different agents in the multi-level networks. In this paper, we
establish a game-theoretic framework to capture the uncoordinated nature of the
decision-making at different layers of the multi-level networks. Specifically,
we design a decentralized algorithm that aims to maximize the algebraic
connectivity of the global network iteratively. In addition, we show that the
designed algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium asymptotically and yields an
equilibrium network. To study the network resiliency, we introduce three
adversarial attack models and characterize their worst-case impacts on the
network performance. Case studies based on a two-layer mobile robotic network
are used to corroborate the effectiveness and resiliency of the proposed
algorithm and show the interdependency between different layers of the network
during the recovery processes.

 <dc:description>  We define a compilation scheme for a constructor-based, strongly-sequential,
graph rewriting system which shortcuts some needed steps. The object code is
another constructor-based graph rewriting system. This system is normalizing
for the original system when using an innermost strategy. Consequently, the
object code can be easily implemented by eager functions in a variety of
programming languages. We modify this object code in a way that avoids total or
partial construction of the contracta of some needed steps of a computation.
When computing normal forms in this way, both memory consumption and execution
time are reduced compared to ordinary rewriting computations in the original
system.

 <dc:description>  The general form of safe recursion (or ramified recurrence) can be expressed
by an infinite graph rewrite system including unfolding graph rewrite rules
introduced by Dal Lago, Martini and Zorzi, in which the size of every normal
form by innermost rewriting is polynomially bounded. Every unfolding graph
rewrite rule is precedence terminating in the sense of Middeldorp, Ohsaki and
Zantema. Although precedence terminating infinite rewrite systems cover all the
primitive recursive functions, in this paper we consider graph rewrite systems
precedence terminating with argument separation, which form a subclass of
precedence terminating graph rewrite systems. We show that for any precedence
terminating infinite graph rewrite system G with a specific argument
separation, both the runtime complexity of G and the size of every normal form
in G can be polynomially bounded. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative
proof of the original result by Dal Lago et al.

 <dc:description>  To study implementations and optimisations of interaction net systems we
propose a calculus to allow us to reason about nets, a concrete data-structure
that is in close correspondence with the calculus, and a low-level language to
create and manipulate this data structure. These work together so that we can
describe the compilation process for interaction nets, reason about the
behaviours of the implementation, and study the efficiency and properties.

 <dc:title>Getting Close Without Touching: Near-Gathering for Autonomous Mobile

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the Near-Gathering problem for a finite set of
dimensionless, deterministic, asynchronous, anonymous, oblivious and autonomous
mobile robots with limited visibility moving in the Euclidean plane in
Look-Compute-Move (LCM) cycles. In this problem, the robots have to get close
enough to each other, so that every robot can see all the others, without
touching (i.e., colliding with) any other robot. The importance of solving the
Near-Gathering problem is that it makes it possible to overcome the restriction
of having robots with limited visibility. Hence it allows to exploit all the
studies (the majority, actually) done on this topic in the unlimited visibility
setting. Indeed, after the robots get close enough to each other, they are able
to see all the robots in the system, a scenario that is similar to the one
where the robots have unlimited visibility.
  We present the first (deterministic) algorithm for the Near-Gathering
problem, to the best of our knowledge, which allows a set of autonomous mobile
robots to nearly gather within finite time without ever colliding. Our
algorithm assumes some reasonable conditions on the input configuration (the
Near-Gathering problem is easily seen to be unsolvable in general). Further,
all the robots are assumed to have a compass (hence they agree on the &quot;North&quot;
direction), but they do not necessarily have the same handedness (hence they
may disagree on the clockwise direction).
  We also show how the robots can detect termination, i.e., detect when the
Near-Gathering problem has been solved. This is crucial when the robots have to
perform a generic task after having nearly gathered. We show that termination
detection can be obtained even if the total number of robots is unknown to the
robots themselves (i.e., it is not a parameter of the algorithm), and robots
have no way to explicitly communicate.

 <dc:description>  Meaning of a word varies from one domain to another. Despite this important
domain dependence in word semantics, existing word representation learning
methods are bound to a single domain. Given a pair of
\emph{source}-\emph{target} domains, we propose an unsupervised method for
learning domain-specific word representations that accurately capture the
domain-specific aspects of word semantics. First, we select a subset of
frequent words that occur in both domains as \emph{pivots}. Next, we optimize
an objective function that enforces two constraints: (a) for both source and
target domain documents, pivots that appear in a document must accurately
predict the co-occurring non-pivots, and (b) word representations learnt for
pivots must be similar in the two domains. Moreover, we propose a method to
perform domain adaptation using the learnt word representations. Our proposed
method significantly outperforms competitive baselines including the
state-of-the-art domain-insensitive word representations, and reports best
sentiment classification accuracies for all domain-pairs in a benchmark
dataset.

 <dc:title>Is Massive MIMO Energy Efficient?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) can support high spectral efficiency
(SE) with simple linear transceivers, and is expected to provide high energy
efficiency (EE). In this paper, we analyze the EE of downlink multi-cell
massive MIMO systems under spatially correlated channel model, where both
transmit and circuit power consumptions, training overhead, channel estimation
and pilot contamination (PC) are taken into account. We obtain the maximal EE
for the systems with maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF) for given number of antennas and users by optimizing the
transmit power. The closed-form expressions of approximated optimal transmit
power and maximal EE, and their scaling laws with the number of antennas M are
derived for the systems with MRT and ZFBF. Our analysis shows that the maximal
EE decreases with M for both systems with and without PC, but with different
descending speeds. For the system without PC, the optimal transmit power should
be configured to increases with M, while for the system with PC, the optimal
transmit power should be configured as a constant independent from M. The
analytical results are validated by simulations under a more realistic
three-dimensional channel model.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT) in energy harvesting (EH) relay systems. Unlike existing SWIPT schemes
requiring the channel state information (CSI) for coherent information
delivery, we propose a noncoherent SWIPT framework for decode-and-forward (DF)
relay systems bypassing the need for CSI and consequently saving energy in the
network. The proposed SWIPT framework embraces power-splitting noncoherent DF
(PS-NcDF) and time-switching noncoherent DF (TS-NcDF) in a unified form, and
supports arbitrary M-ary noncoherent frequency-shift keying (FSK) and
differential phase-shift keying (DPSK). Exact (noncoherent) maximum-likelihood
detectors (MLDs) for PS-NcDF and TS-NcDF are developed in a unified form, which
involves integral evaluations yet serves as the optimum performance benchmark
for noncoherent SWIPT. To reduce the computational cost of the exact MLDs, we
also propose closed-form approximate MLDs achieving near-optimum performance,
thus serving as a practical solution for noncoherent SWIPT. Numerical results
demonstrate a performance tradeoff between the first and second hops through
the adjustment of time switching or power splitting parameters, whose optimal
values minimizing the symbol-error rate (SER) are strictly between 0 and 1. We
demonstrate that M-FSK results in a significant energy saving over M-DPSK for M
&gt;= 8; thus M-FSK may be more suitable for EH relay systems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel label propagation based method for saliency
detection. A key observation is that saliency in an image can be estimated by
propagating the labels extracted from the most certain background and object
regions. For most natural images, some boundary superpixels serve as the
background labels and the saliency of other superpixels are determined by
ranking their similarities to the boundary labels based on an inner propagation
scheme. For images of complex scenes, we further deploy a 3-cue-center-biased
objectness measure to pick out and propagate foreground labels. A
co-transduction algorithm is devised to fuse both boundary and objectness
labels based on an inter propagation scheme. The compactness criterion decides
whether the incorporation of objectness labels is necessary, thus greatly
enhancing computational efficiency. Results on five benchmark datasets with
pixel-wise accurate annotations show that the proposed method achieves superior
performance compared with the newest state-of-the-arts in terms of different
evaluation metrics.

 <dc:description>  Cascades are ubiquitous in various network environments. How to predict these
cascades is highly nontrivial in several vital applications, such as viral
marketing, epidemic prevention and traffic management. Most previous works
mainly focus on predicting the final cascade sizes. As cascades are typical
dynamic processes, it is always interesting and important to predict the
cascade size at any time, or predict the time when a cascade will reach a
certain size (e.g. an threshold for outbreak). In this paper, we unify all
these tasks into a fundamental problem: cascading process prediction. That is,
given the early stage of a cascade, how to predict its cumulative cascade size
of any later time? For such a challenging problem, how to understand the micro
mechanism that drives and generates the macro phenomenons (i.e. cascading
proceese) is essential. Here we introduce behavioral dynamics as the micro
mechanism to describe the dynamic process of a node's neighbors get infected by
a cascade after this node get infected (i.e. one-hop subcascades). Through
data-driven analysis, we find out the common principles and patterns lying in
behavioral dynamics and propose a novel Networked Weibull Regression model for
behavioral dynamics modeling. After that we propose a novel method for
predicting cascading processes by effectively aggregating behavioral dynamics,
and propose a scalable solution to approximate the cascading process with a
theoretical guarantee. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on a large
scale social network dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method
can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art baselines in multiple tasks
including cascade size prediction, outbreak time prediction and cascading
process prediction.

 <dc:description>  In energy harvesting (EH) relay networks, the coherent communication requires
accurate estima- tion/tracking of the instantaneous channel state information
(CSI) which consumes extra power. As a remedy, we propose two noncoherent EH
relaying protocols based on the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying, namely,
power splitting noncoherent AF (PS-NcAF) and time switching noncoherent AF
(TS-NcAF), which do not require any instantaneous CSI. We develop a noncoherent
framework of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT),
embracing PS-NcAF and TS-NcAF in a unified form. For arbitrary M-ary
noncoherent frequency-shift keying (FSK) and differential phase- shift keying
(DPSK), we derive maximum-likelihood detectors (MLDs) for PS-NcAF and TS-NcAF
in a unified form, which involves integral evaluations yet serves as the
optimum performance benchmark. To avoid expensive integral computations, we
propose a closed-form detector using the Gauss-Legendre approximation, which
achieves almost identical performance as the MLD but at substantially lower
complexity. These EH-based noncoherent detectors achieve full diversity in
Rayleigh fading. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed PS-NcAF and
TS-NcAF may outperform the conventional grid- powered relay system under the
same total power constraint. Various insights which are useful for the design
of practical SWIPT relaying systems are obtained. Interestingly, PS-NcAF
outperforms TS-NcAF in the single-relay case, whereas TS-NcAF outperforms
PS-NcAF in the multi-relay case.

 <dc:description>  We study three representations of hierarchies of partitions: dendrograms
(direct representations), saliency maps, and minimum spanning trees. We provide
a new bijection between saliency maps and hierarchies based on quasi-flat zones
as used in image processing and characterize saliency maps and minimum spanning
trees as solutions to constrained minimization problems where the constraint is
quasi-flat zones preservation. In practice, these results form a toolkit for
new hierarchical methods where one can choose the most convenient
representation. They also invite us to process non-image data with
morphological hierarchies.

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper presents several results that address a fundamental question in
low-rank matrices recovery: how many measurements are needed to recover low
rank matrices? We begin by investigating the complex matrices case and show
that $4nr-4r^2$ generic measurements are both necessary and sufficient for the
recovery of rank-$r$ matrices in $\C^{n\times n}$ by algebraic tools. Thus, we
confirm a conjecture which is raised by Eldar, Needell and Plan for the complex
case. We next consider the real case and prove that the bound $4nr-4r^2$ is
tight provided $n=2^k+r, k\in \Z_+$. Motivated by Vinzant's work, we construct
$11$ matrices in $\R^{4\times 4}$ by computer random search and prove they
define injective measurements on rank-$1$ matrices in $\R^{4\times 4}$. This
disproves the conjecture raised by Eldar, Needell and Plan for the real case.
Finally, we use the results in this paper to investigate the phase retrieval by
projection and show fewer than $2n-1$ orthogonal projections are possible for
the recovery of $x\in \R^n$ from the norm of them.

 <dc:title>Uplink Downlink Rate Balancing in Cooperating Cellular Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Broadcast MIMO techniques can significantly increase the throughput in the
downlink of cellular networks, at the price of channel state information (CSI)
feedback from the mobiles, sent over the uplink. Thus, it creates a mechanism
that can tradeoff some uplink capacity for increased downlink capacity. In this
work we quantify this tradeoff and study the exchange ratio between the
feedback rate (over the uplink) and the downlink rate. We study both finite and
infinite networks, and show that for high enough (but finite) SNR, the uplink
rate can be exchanged for increased downlink rate with a favorable exchange
ratio. This exchange ratio is an increasing function of the channel coherence
time, and a decreasing function of the number of measured base stations. We
also show that devoting a constant fraction of the uplink to CSI feedback can
increase the downlink multiplexing gain continuously from 0 to 1, in finite
networks. On the other hand, in infinite networks (with infinite connectivity)
our bounds can only show doubly logarithmic scaling of the rate with SNR. The
presented results prove that the adaptation of the feedback rate can control
the balance between the uplink and downlink rates. This capability is very
important in modern cellular networks, where the operators need to respond to
continuously changing user demands.

 <dc:title>Intelligent escalation and the principle of relativity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lescanne, Pierre</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Escalation is the fact that in a game (for instance in an auction), the
agents play forever. The $0,1$-game is an extremely simple infinite game with
intelligent agents in which escalation arises. It shows at the light of
research on cognitive psychology the difference between intelligence
(algorithmic mind) and rationality (algorithmic and reflective mind) in
decision processes. It also shows that depending on the point of view (inside
or outside) the rationality of the agent may change which is proposed to be
called the principle of relativity.

 <dc:title>Semi-autonomous, context-aware, agent using behaviour modelling and

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the issue of gathering the &quot;informed consent&quot; of an
end user in the Internet of Things. We start by evaluating the legal importance
and some of the problems linked with this notion of informed consent in the
specific context of the Internet of Things. From this assessment we propose an
approach based on a semi-autonomous, rule based agent that centralize all
authorization decisions on the personal data of a user and that is able to take
decision on his behalf. We complete this initial agent by integrating
context-awareness, behavior modeling and community based reputation system in
the algorithm of the agent. The resulting system is a &quot;smart&quot; application, the
&quot;privacy butler&quot; that can handle data operations on behalf of the end-user
while keeping the user in control. We finally discuss some of the potential
problems and improvements of the system.

 <dc:description>  Affects---emotions and moods---have an impact on cognitive activities and the
working performance of individuals. Development tasks are undertaken through
cognitive processes, yet software engineering research lacks theory on affects
and their impact on software development activities. In this paper, we report
on an interpretive study aimed at broadening our understanding of the
psychology of programming in terms of the experience of affects while
programming, and the impact of affects on programming performance. We conducted
a qualitative interpretive study based on: face-to-face open-ended interviews,
in-field observations, and e-mail exchanges. This enabled us to construct a
novel explanatory theory of the impact of affects on development performance.
The theory is explicated using an established taxonomy framework. The proposed
theory builds upon the concepts of events, affects, attractors, focus, goals,
and performance. Theoretical and practical implications are given.

 <dc:description>  Hybrid traffic modeling and simulation provide an important way to represent
and evaluate large-scale traffic networks at different levels of details. The
first level, called &quot;microscopic&quot; allows the description of individual vehicles
and their interactions as well as the study of driver's individual behavior.
The second, based on the analogy with fluidic dynamic, is the &quot;macroscopic&quot; one
and provides an efficient way to represent traffic flow behavior in large
traffic infrastructures, using three aggregated variables: traffic density,
mean speed and traffic volume. An intermediate level called &quot;mesoscopic&quot;
considers a group of vehicles sharing common properties such as a same origin
and destination. The work conducted in this paper presents a first step
allowing simulation of wide area traffic network on the basis of dynamic hybrid
modeling, where the representation associated to a network section can change
at runtime. The proposed approach is implemented in a simulation platform,
called Jam-free.

 <dc:title>Prototyping Information Visualization in 3D City Models: a Model-based

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When creating 3D city models, selecting relevant visualization techniques is
a particularly difficult user interface design task. A first obstacle is that
current geodata-oriented tools, e.g. ArcGIS, have limited 3D capabilities and
limited sets of visualization techniques. Another important obstacle is the
lack of unified description of information visualization techniques for 3D city
models. If many techniques have been devised for different types of data or
information (wind flows, air quality fields, historic or legal texts, etc.)
they are generally described in articles, and not really formalized. In this
paper we address the problem of visualizing information in (rich) 3D city
models by presenting a model-based approach for the rapid prototyping of
visualization techniques. We propose to represent visualization techniques as
the composition of graph transformations. We show that these transformations
can be specified with SPARQL construction operations over RDF graphs. These
specifications can then be used in a prototype generator to produce 3D scenes
that contain the 3D city model augmented with data represented using the
desired technique.

 <dc:description>  Relative generalized Hamming weights (RGHWs) of a linear code respect to a
linear subcode determine the security of the linear ramp secret sharing scheme
based on the code. They can be used to express the information leakage of the
secret when some keepers of shares are corrupted. Cyclic codes are an
interesting type of linear codes and have wide applications in communication
and storage systems. In this paper, we investigate the RGHWs of cyclic codes
with two nonzeros respect to any of its irreducible cyclic subcodes. Applying
the method in the paper [arxiv.org/abs/1410.2702], we give two formulae for
RGHWs of the cyclic codes. As applications of the formulae, explicit examples
are computed.

 <dc:description>  We show that a network can self-organize its structure in a completely
distributed manner in order to optimize its synchronizability whilst satisfying
the local constraints: non-negativity of edge weights, and maximum weighted
degree of nodes. A novel multilayer approach is presented which uses a
distributed strategy to estimate two spectral functions of the graph Laplacian,
the algebraic connectivity $\lambda_2$ and the eigenratio $r = \lambda_n /
\lambda_2$ . These local estimates are then used to evolve the edge weights so
as to maximize $\lambda_2$, or minimize $r$ and, hence, achieve an optimal
structure.

 <dc:description>  We propose index codes, based on multidimensional QAM constellations, for the
Gaussian broadcast channel, where every receiver demands all the messages from
the source. The efficiency with which an index code exploits receiver side
information in this broadcast channel is characterised by a code design metric
called &quot;side information gain&quot;. The known index codes for this broadcast
channel enjoy large side information gains, but do not encode all the source
messages at the same rate, and do not admit message sizes that are powers of
two. The index codes proposed in this letter, which are based on linear codes
over integer rings, overcome both these drawbacks and yet provide large values
of side information gain. With the aid of a computer search, we obtain QAM
index codes for encoding up to 5 messages with message sizes 2^m, m &lt;= 6. We
also present the simulated performance of a new 16-QAM index code, concatenated
with an off-the-shelf LDPC code, which is observed to operate within 4.3 dB of
the broadcast channel capacity.

 <dc:title>SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Robust
  Semantic Pixel-Wise Labelling</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel deep architecture, SegNet, for semantic pixel wise image
labelling. SegNet has several attractive properties; (i) it only requires
forward evaluation of a fully learnt function to obtain smooth label
predictions, (ii) with increasing depth, a larger context is considered for
pixel labelling which improves accuracy, and (iii) it is easy to visualise the
effect of feature activation(s) in the pixel label space at any depth. SegNet
is composed of a stack of encoders followed by a corresponding decoder stack
which feeds into a soft-max classification layer. The decoders help map low
resolution feature maps at the output of the encoder stack to full input image
size feature maps. This addresses an important drawback of recent deep learning
approaches which have adopted networks designed for object categorization for
pixel wise labelling. These methods lack a mechanism to map deep layer feature
maps to input dimensions. They resort to ad hoc methods to upsample features,
e.g. by replication. This results in noisy predictions and also restricts the
number of pooling layers in order to avoid too much upsampling and thus reduces
spatial context. SegNet overcomes these problems by learning to map encoder
outputs to image pixel labels. We test the performance of SegNet on outdoor RGB
scenes from CamVid, KITTI and indoor scenes from the NYU dataset. Our results
show that SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance even without use of
additional cues such as depth, video frames or post-processing with CRF models.

 <dc:description>  This study analyzes political interactions in the European Parliament (EP) by
considering how the political agenda of the plenary sessions has evolved over
time and the manner in which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have
reacted to external and internal stimuli when making Parliamentary speeches. It
does so by considering the context in which speeches are made, and the content
of those speeches. To detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time,
speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method, based on
two layers of matrix factorization. This method is applied to a new corpus of
all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period
1999-2014. Our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP has evolved
significantly over time, is impacted upon by the committee structure of the
Parliament, and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the
emergence of the Euro-crisis have a significant impact on what is being
discussed in Parliament.

 <dc:description>  Tries are among the most versatile and widely used data structures on words.
In particular, they are used in fundamental sorting algorithms such as radix
sort which we study in this paper. While the performance of radix sort and
tries under a realistic probabilistic model for the generation of words is of
significant importance, its analysis, even for simplest memoryless sources, has
proved difficult. In this paper we consider a more realistic model where words
are generated by a Markov source. By a novel use of the contraction method
combined with moment transfer techniques we prove a central limit theorem for
the complexity of radix sort and for the external path length in a trie. This
is the first application of the contraction method to the analysis of
algorithms and data structures with Markovian inputs; it relies on the use of
systems of stochastic recurrences combined with a product version of the
Zolotarev metric.

 <dc:description>  Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are increasingly used for explaining
biological processes with complex transcriptional regulation. A GRN links the
expression levels of a set of genes via regulatory controls that gene products
exert on one another. Boolean networks are a common modeling choice since they
balance between detail and ease of analysis. However, even for Boolean networks
the problem of fitting a given network model to an expression dataset is
NP-Complete. Previous methods have addressed this issue heuristically or by
focusing on acyclic networks and specific classes of regulation functions. In
this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for this problem that makes use of
sampling in order to handle large datasets. Our algorithm can handle time
series data for any network type and steady state data for acyclic networks.
Using in-silico time series data we demonstrate good performance on large
datasets with a significant level of noise.

 <dc:description>  Recent study shows that the accuracy of the k-shell method in determining
node coreness in a spreading process is largely impacted due to the existence
of core-like group, which has a large k-shell index but a low spreading
efficiency. Based on analysis of the structure of core-like groups in
real-world networks, we discover that nodes in the core-like group are mutually
densely connected with very few out-leaving links from the group. By defining a
measure of diffusion importance for each edge based on the number of
out-leaving links of its both ends, we are able to identify redundant links in
the spreading process, which have a relatively low diffusion importance but
lead to form the locally densely connected core-like group. After filtering out
the redundant links and applying the k-shell method to the residual network, we
obtain a renewed coreness for each node which is a more accurate index to
indicate its location importance and spreading influence in the original
network. Moreover, we find that the performance of the ranking algorithms based
on the renewed coreness are also greatly enhanced. Our findings help to more
accurately decompose the network core structure and identify influential nodes
in spreading processes.

 <dc:title>An Enumeration of the Equivalence Classes of Self-Dual Matrix Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Morrison, Katherine</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  As a result of their applications in network coding, space-time coding, and
coding for criss-cross errors, matrix codes have garnered significant
attention; in various contexts, these codes have also been termed rank-metric
codes, space-time codes over finite fields, and array codes. We focus on
characterizing matrix codes that are both efficient (have high rate) and
effective at error correction (have high minimum rank-distance). It is well
known that the inherent trade-off between dimension and minimum distance for a
matrix code is reversed for its dual code; specifically, if a matrix code has
high dimension and low minimum distance, then its dual code will have low
dimension and high minimum distance. With an aim towards finding codes with a
perfectly balanced trade-off, we study self-dual matrix codes. In this work, we
develop a framework based on double cosets of the matrix-equivalence maps to
provide a complete classification of the equivalence classes of self-dual
matrix codes, and we employ this method to enumerate the equivalence classes of
these codes for small parameters.

 <dc:description>  The actor model of computation has gained significant popularity over the
last decade. Its high level of abstraction makes it appealing for concurrent
applications in parallel and distributed systems. However, designing a
real-world actor framework that subsumes full scalability, strong reliability,
and high resource efficiency requires many conceptual and algorithmic additives
to the original model.
  In this paper, we report on designing and building CAF, the &quot;C++ Actor
Framework&quot;. CAF targets at providing a concurrent and distributed native
environment for scaling up to very large, high-performance applications, and
equally well down to small constrained systems. We present the key
specifications and design concepts---in particular a message-transparent
architecture, type-safe message interfaces, and pattern matching
facilities---that make native actors a viable approach for many robust,
elastic, and highly distributed developments. We demonstrate the feasibility of
CAF in three scenarios: first for elastic, upscaling environments, second for
including heterogeneous hardware like GPGPUs, and third for distributed runtime
systems. Extensive performance evaluations indicate ideal runtime behaviour for
up to 64 cores at very low memory footprint, or in the presence of GPUs. In
these tests, CAF continuously outperforms the competing actor environments
Erlang, Charm++, SalsaLite, Scala, ActorFoundry, and even the OpenMPI.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the process of remaining anonymous online and its
concurrent operational security that has to be performed. It focusses
particularly on remaining anonymous while purchasing online goods, resulting in
anonymously bought items. Different aspects of the operational security process
as well as anonymously funding with cryptocurrencies are described. Eventually
it is shown how to anonymously purchase items and services from the hidden web,
as well as the delivery. It is shown that, while becoming increasingly
difficult, it is still possible to make anonymous purchases. Our presented work
combines existing best-practices and deliberately avoids untested novel
approaches when possible.

of convolutional neural networks optimised for object recognition. Samples from
the model are of high perceptual quality demonstrating the generative power of
neural networks trained in a purely discriminative fashion. Within the model,
textures are represented by the correlations between feature maps in several
layers of the network. We show that across layers the texture representations
increasingly capture the statistical properties of natural images while making
object information more and more explicit. The model provides a new tool to
generate stimuli for neuroscience and might offer insights into the deep

 <dc:description>  All modern web browsers - Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and
Safari - have a core rendering engine written in C++. This language choice was
made because it affords the systems programmer complete control of the
underlying hardware features and memory in use, and it provides a transparent
compilation model.
  Servo is a project started at Mozilla Research to build a new web browser
engine that preserves the capabilities of these other browser engines but also
both takes advantage of the recent trends in parallel hardware and is more
memory-safe. We use a new language, Rust, that provides us a similar level of
control of the underlying system to C++ but which builds on many concepts
familiar to the functional programming community, forming a novelty - a useful,
safe systems programming language.
  In this paper, we show how a language with an affine type system, regions,
and many syntactic features familiar to functional language programmers can be
successfully used to build state-of-the-art systems software. We also outline
several pitfalls encountered along the way and describe some potential areas
for future research.

 <dc:description>  We present a new oblivious RAM that supports variable-sized storage blocks
(vORAM), which is the first ORAM to allow varying block sizes without trivial
padding. We also present a new history-independent data structure (a HIRB tree)
that can be stored within a vORAM. Together, this construction provides an
efficient and practical oblivious data structure (ODS) for a key/value map, and
goes further to provide an additional privacy guarantee as compared to prior
ODS maps: even upon client compromise, deleted data and the history of old
operations remain hidden to the attacker.
  We implement and measure the performance of our system using Amazon Web
Services, and the single-operation time for a realistic database (up to
$2^{18}$ entries) is less than 1 second. This represents a 100x speed-up
compared to the current best oblivious map data structure (which provides
neither secure deletion nor history independence) by Wang et al. (CCS 14).

 <dc:description>  The Geneva Affective Picture Database WordNet Annotation Tool (GWAT) is a
user-friendly web application for manual annotation of pictures in Geneva
Affective Picture Database (GAPED) with WordNet. The annotation tool has an
intuitive interface which can be efficiently used with very little technical
training. A single picture may be labeled with many synsets allowing experts to
describe semantics with different levels of detail. Noun, verb, adjective and
adverb synsets can be keyword-searched and attached to a specific GAPED picture
with their unique identification numbers. Changes are saved automatically in
the tool's relational database. The attached synsets can be reviewed, changed
or deleted later. Additionally, GAPED pictures may be browsed in the tool's
user interface using simple commands where previously attached WordNet synsets
are displayed alongside the pictures. Stored annotations can be exported from
the tool's database to different data formats and used in 3rd party
applications if needed. Since GAPED does not define keywords of individual
pictures but only a general category of picture groups, GWAT represents a
significant improvement towards development of comprehensive picture semantics.
The tool was developed with open technologies WordNet API, Apache, PHP5 and
MySQL. It is freely available for scientific and non-commercial use.

 <dc:description>  The ability to efficiently search pictures with annotated semantics and
emotion is an important problem for Human-Computer Interaction with
considerable interdisciplinary significance. Accuracy and speed of the
multimedia retrieval process depends on the chosen metadata annotation model.
The quality of such multifaceted retrieval is opposed to the potential
complexity of data setup procedures and development of multimedia annotations.
Additionally, a recent study has shown that databases of emotionally annotated
multimedia are still being predominately searched manually which highlights the
need to study this retrieval modality. To this regard we present a study with N
= 75 participants aimed to evaluate the influence of keywords and dimensional
emotions in manual retrieval of pictures. The study showed that if the
multimedia database is comparatively small emotional annotations are sufficient
to achieve a fast retrieval despite comparatively lesser overall accuracy. In a
larger dataset semantic annotations became necessary for efficient retrieval
although they contributed to a slower beginning of the search process. The
experiment was performed in a controlled environment with a team of psychology
experts. The results were statistically consistent with validates measures of
the participants' perceptual speed.

 <dc:description>  Multimedia documents such as text, images, sounds or videos elicit emotional
responses of different polarity and intensity in exposed human subjects. These
stimuli are stored in affective multimedia databases. The problem of emotion
processing is an important issue in Human-Computer Interaction and different
interdisciplinary studies particularly those related to psychology and
neuroscience. Accurate prediction of users' attention and emotion has many
practical applications such as the development of affective computer
interfaces, multifaceted search engines, video-on-demand, Internet
communication and video games. To this regard we present results of a study
with N=10 participants to investigate the capability of standardized affective
multimedia databases in stimulation of emotion. Each participant was exposed to
picture and video stimuli with previously determined semantics and emotion.
During exposure participants' physiological signals were recorded and estimated
for emotion in an off-line analysis. Participants reported their emotion states
after each exposure session. The a posteriori and a priori emotion values were
compared. The experiment showed, among other reported results, that carefully
designed video sequences induce a stronger and more accurate emotional reaction
than pictures. Individual participants' differences greatly influence the
intensity and polarity of experienced emotion.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores novel approaches for improving the spatial codification
for the pooling of local descriptors to solve the semantic segmentation
problem. We propose to partition the image into three regions for each object
to be described: Figure, Border and Ground. This partition aims at minimizing
the influence of the image context on the object description and vice versa by
introducing an intermediate zone around the object contour. Furthermore, we
also propose a richer visual descriptor of the object by applying a Spatial
Pyramid over the Figure region. Two novel Spatial Pyramid configurations are
explored: Cartesian-based and crown-based Spatial Pyramids. We test these
approaches with state-of-the-art techniques and show that they improve the
Figure-Ground based pooling in the Pascal VOC 2011 and 2012 semantic
segmentation challenges.

 <dc:description>  We present a robust and real-time monocular six degree of freedom
relocalization system. Our system trains a convolutional neural network to
regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image in an end-to-end manner
with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation. The algorithm can
operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking 5ms per frame to compute. It
obtains approximately 2m and 6 degree accuracy for large scale outdoor scenes
and 0.5m and 10 degree accuracy indoors. This is achieved using an efficient 23
layer deep convnet, demonstrating that convnets can be used to solve
complicated out of image plane regression problems. This was made possible by
leveraging transfer learning from large scale classification data. We show the
convnet localizes from high level features and is robust to difficult lighting,
motion blur and different camera intrinsics where point based SIFT registration
fails. Furthermore we show how the pose feature that is produced generalizes to
other scenes allowing us to regress pose with only a few dozen training
examples. PoseNet code, dataset and an online demonstration is available on our
project webpage, at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/relocalisation/

 <dc:description>  Place recognition is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision,
and has become a key part in mobile robotics and autonomous driving
applications for performing loop closure in visual SLAM systems. Moreover, the
difficulty of recognizing a revisited location increases with appearance
changes caused, for instance, by weather or illumination variations, which
hinders the long-term application of such algorithms in real environments. In
this paper we present a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained for the
first time with the purpose of recognizing revisited locations under severe
appearance changes, which maps images to a low dimensional space where
Euclidean distances represent place dissimilarity. In order for the network to
learn the desired invariances, we train it with triplets of images selected
from datasets which present a challenging variability in visual appearance. The
triplets are selected in such way that two samples are from the same location
and the third one is taken from a different place. We validate our system
through extensive experimentation, where we demonstrate better performance than
state-of-art algorithms in a number of popular datasets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider edge colorings of the complete graph, where the
vertices are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and each color class $E_i$ is defined by
a semi-algebraic relation of constant complexity on the point set. One of our
main results is a multicolor regularity lemma: For any $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$, the
vertex set of any such edge colored complete graph with $m$ colors can be
equitably partitioned into at most $(m/\varepsilon)^c$ parts, such that all but
at most an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the pairs of parts are monochromatic
between them. Here $c&gt;0$ is a constant that depends on the dimension $d$ and
the complexity of the semi-algebraic relations. This generalizes a theorem of
Alon, Pach, Pinchasi, Radoi\v{c}i\'c and Sharir, and Fox, Pach, and Suk. As an
application, we prove the following result.
  For fixed integers $p$ and $q$ with $2\leq q \leq {p\choose 2}$, a
$(p,q)$-coloring is an edge-coloring of a complete graph in which every $p$
vertices induce at least $q$ distinct colors. The function $f^{\ast}(n,p,q)$ is
the minimum integer $m$ such that there is a $(p,q)$-coloring of $K_n$ with at
most $m$ colors, where the vertices of $K_n$ are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and
each color class can be defined as a semi-algebraic relation of constant
complexity. Here we show that $f^{\ast}(n,p,\lceil\log p\rceil + 1) \geq
\Omega\left(n^{\frac{1}{c\log^2p}}\right),$ and $f^{\ast}(n,p, \lceil\log
p\rceil) \leq O(\log n)$, thus determining the exact value of $q$ at which
$f^{\ast}(n,p,q)$ changes from logarithmic to polynomial in $n$.
  We also show the following result on a distinct distances problem of
Erd\H{o}s. Let $V$ be an $n$-element planar point set such that any $p$ members
of $V$ determine at least ${p\choose 2} - p + 6$ distinct distances. Then $V$
determines at least $ n^{\frac{8}{7} - o(1)}$ distinct distances.

 <dc:title>Threshold Effects in Parameter Estimation from Compressed Data</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Pezeshki, Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate threshold effects associated with swapping of
signal and noise subspaces in estimating signal parameters from compressed
noisy data. The term threshold effect refers to a sharp departure of
mean-squared error from the Cramer-Rao bound when the signal-to-noise ratio
falls below a threshold SNR. In many cases, the threshold effect is caused by a
subspace swap event, when the measured data (or its sample covariance) is
better approximated by a subset of components of an orthogonal subspace than by
the components of a signal subspace. We derive analytical lower bounds on the
probability of a subspace swap in compressively measured noisy data. These
bounds guide our understanding of threshold effects and performance breakdown
for parameter estimation using compression. As a case study, we investigate
threshold effects in maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of directions of
arrival of two closely-spaced sources using co-prime subsampling. Our results
show the impact of compression on threshold SNR. A rule of thumb is that every
doubling of compression ratio brings a penalty in threshold SNR of 3 dB.

 <dc:description>  We present a classical interactive protocol that verifies the validity of a
quantum witness state for the local Hamiltonian problem. It follows from this
protocol that approximating the non-local value of a multi-player one-round
game to inverse polynomial precision is QMA-hard. Our work makes an interesting
connection between the theory of QMA-completeness and Hamiltonian complexity on
one hand and the study of non-local games and Bell inequalities on the other.

 <dc:description>  Task allocation problems have traditionally focused on cost optimization.
However, more and more attention is being given to cases in which cost should
not always be the sole or major consideration. In this paper we study a fair
task allocation problem in transportation where an optimal allocation not only
has low cost but more importantly, it distributes tasks as even as possible
among heterogeneous participants who have different capacities and costs to
execute tasks. To tackle this fair minimum cost allocation problem we analyze
and solve it in two parts using two novel polynomial-time algorithms. We show
that despite the new fairness criterion, the proposed algorithms can solve the
fair minimum cost allocation problem optimally in polynomial time. In addition,
we conduct an extensive set of experiments to investigate the trade-off between
cost minimization and fairness. Our experimental results demonstrate the
benefit of factoring fairness into task allocation. Among the majority of test
instances, fairness comes with a very small price in terms of cost.

 <dc:description>  A substantial volume of research has been devoted to studies of community
structure in networks, but communities are not the only possible form of
large-scale network structure. Here we describe a broad extension of community
structure that encompasses traditional communities but includes a wide range of
generalized structural patterns as well. We describe a principled method for
detecting this generalized structure in empirical network data and demonstrate
with real-world examples how it can be used to learn new things about the shape
and meaning of networks.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a secure communication application called
DiscoverFriends. Its purpose is to securely communicate to a group of online
friends while bypassing their respective social networking servers under a
mobile ad hoc network environment. DiscoverFriends leverages Bloom filters and
a hybrid encryption technique with a self-organized public-key management
scheme to securely identify friends and provide authentication. Additionally,
DiscoverFriends enables anonymous location check-ins by utilizing a new
cryptographic primitive called Function Secret Sharing. Finally, to the best of
our knowledge, DiscoverFriends implements and evaluates the first Android
multi-hop WiFi direct protocol using IPv6.

 <dc:title>Explicit RIP Matrices in Compressed Sensing from Algebraic Geometry</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Hao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Compressed sensing was proposed by E. J. Cand\'es, J. Romberg, T. Tao, and D.
Donoho for efficient sampling of sparse signals in 2006 and has vast
applications in signal processing. The expicit restricted isometry property
(RIP) measurement matrices are needed in practice. Since 2007 R. DeVore, J.
Bourgain et al and R. Calderbank et al have given several deterministic
cosntrcutions of RIP matrices from various mathematical objects. On the other
hand the strong coherence property of a measurement matrix was introduced by
Bajwa and Calderbank et al for the recovery of signals under the noisy
measuremnt. In this paper we propose new explicit construction of real valued
RIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing from algebraic geometry. Our
construction indicates that using more general algebraic-geometric objects
rather than curves (AG codes), RIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing
can be constructed with much smaller coherence and much bigger sparsity orders.
The RIP matrices from algebraic geometry also have a nice asymptotic bound
matching the bound from the previous constructions of Bourgain et al and the
small-bias sets. On the negative side, we prove that the RIP matrices from
DeVore's construction, its direct algebraic geometric generalization and one of
our new construction do not satisfy the strong coherence property. However we
give a modified version of AG-RIP matrices which satisfies the strong coherence
property. Therefore the new RIP matrices in compressed sensing from our
modified algebraic geometric construction can be used for the recovery of
signals from the noisy measurement.

 <dc:description>  Given a finite ring $A$ which is a free left module over a subring $R$ of
$A$, two types of $R$-bases, pseudo-self-dual bases (similar to trace
orthogonal bases) and symmetric bases, are defined which in turn are used to
define duality preserving maps from codes over $A$ to codes over $R$. Both
types of bases are generalizations of similar concepts for fields. Many
illustrative examples are given to shed light on the advantages to such
mappings as well as their abundance.

 <dc:title>Privacy through Fake yet Semantically Real Traces</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bindschaedler, Vincent</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shokri, Reza</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Camouflaging data by generating fake information is a well-known obfuscation
technique for protecting data privacy. In this paper, we focus on a very
sensitive and increasingly exposed type of data: location data. There are two
main scenarios in which fake traces are of extreme value to preserve location
privacy: publishing datasets of location trajectories, and using location-based
services. Despite advances in protecting (location) data privacy, there is no
quantitative method to evaluate how realistic a synthetic trace is, and how
much utility and privacy it provides in each scenario. Also, the lack of a
methodology to generate privacy-preserving fake traces is evident. In this
paper, we fill this gap and propose the first statistical metric and model to
generate fake location traces such that both the utility of data and the
privacy of users are preserved. We build upon the fact that, although
geographically they visit distinct locations, people have strongly semantically
similar mobility patterns, for example, their transition pattern across
activities (e.g., working, driving, staying at home) is similar. We define a
statistical metric and propose an algorithm that automatically discovers the
hidden semantic similarities between locations from a bag of real location
traces as seeds, without requiring any initial semantic annotations. We
guarantee that fake traces are geographically dissimilar to their seeds, so
they do not leak sensitive location information. We also protect contributors
to seed traces against membership attacks. Interleaving fake traces with mobile
users' traces is a prominent location privacy defense mechanism. We
quantitatively show the effectiveness of our methodology in protecting against
localization inference attacks while preserving utility of sharing/publishing
traces.

 <dc:title>SQUASH: Simple QoS-Aware High-Performance Memory Scheduler for
  Heterogeneous Systems with Hardware Accelerators</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Modern SoCs integrate multiple CPU cores and Hardware Accelerators (HWAs)
that share the same main memory system, causing interference among memory
requests from different agents. The result of this interference, if not
controlled well, is missed deadlines for HWAs and low CPU performance.
State-of-the-art mechanisms designed for CPU-GPU systems strive to meet a
target frame rate for GPUs by prioritizing the GPU close to the time when it
has to complete a frame. We observe two major problems when such an approach is
adapted to a heterogeneous CPU-HWA system. First, HWAs miss deadlines because
they are prioritized only close to their deadlines. Second, such an approach
does not consider the diverse memory access characteristics of different
applications running on CPUs and HWAs, leading to low performance for
latency-sensitive CPU applications and deadline misses for some HWAs, including
GPUs.
  In this paper, we propose a Simple Quality of service Aware memory Scheduler
for Heterogeneous systems (SQUASH), that overcomes these problems using three
key ideas, with the goal of meeting deadlines of HWAs while providing high CPU
performance. First, SQUASH prioritizes a HWA when it is not on track to meet
its deadline any time during a deadline period. Second, SQUASH prioritizes HWAs
over memory-intensive CPU applications based on the observation that the
performance of memory-intensive applications is not sensitive to memory
latency. Third, SQUASH treats short-deadline HWAs differently as they are more
likely to miss their deadlines and schedules their requests based on worst-case
memory access time estimates.
  Extensive evaluations across a wide variety of different workloads and
systems show that SQUASH achieves significantly better CPU performance than the
best previous scheduler while always meeting the deadlines for all HWAs,
including GPUs, thereby largely improving frame rates.

 <dc:description>  Represented as graphs, real networks are intricate combinations of order and
disorder. Fixing some of the structural properties of network models to their
values observed in real networks, many other properties appear as statistical
consequences of these fixed observables, plus randomness in other respects.
Here we employ the $dk$-series, a complete set of basic characteristics of the
network structure, to study the statistical dependencies between different
network properties. We consider six real networks---the Internet, US airport
network, human protein interactions, technosocial web of trust, English word
network, and an fMRI map of the human brain---and find that many important
local and global structural properties of these networks are closely reproduced
by $dk$-random graphs whose degree distributions, degree correlations, and
clustering are as in the corresponding real network. We discuss important
conceptual, methodological, and practical implications of this evaluation of
network randomness, and release software to generate $dk$-random graphs.

 <dc:description>  Digital signatures are widely used in electronic communications to secure
important tasks such as financial transactions, software updates, and legal
contracts. The signature schemes that are in use today are based on public-key
cryptography and derive their security from computational assumptions. However,
it is possible to construct unconditionally secure signature protocols. In
particular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature
schemes with security based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.
Several quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has
been explicitly generalized to more than three participants, and their security
goals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security
definitions of Swanson and Stinson (2011) so that they can apply also to the
quantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on
different verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty
signature protocols with information-theoretic security -- quantum or classical
-- must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two
existing quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security
framework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature
protocol given in Wallden-Dunjko-Kent-Andersson (2015) to the multiparty case,
proving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability.
Notably, this protocol can be implemented using any point-to-point quantum key
distribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  A secret sharing scheme is a method to store information securely and
reliably. Particularly, in a threshold secret sharing scheme, a secret is
encoded into $n$ shares, such that any set of at least $t_1$ shares suffice to
decode the secret, and any set of at most $t_2 &lt; t_1$ shares reveal no
information about the secret. Assuming that each party holds a share and a user
wishes to decode the secret by receiving information from a set of parties; the
question we study is how to minimize the amount of communication between the
user and the parties. We show that the necessary amount of communication,
termed &quot;decoding bandwidth&quot;, decreases as the number of parties that
participate in decoding increases. We prove a tight lower bound on the decoding
bandwidth, and construct secret sharing schemes achieving the bound.
Particularly, we design a scheme that achieves the optimal decoding bandwidth
when $d$ parties participate in decoding, universally for all $t_1 \le d \le
n$. The scheme is based on Shamir's secret sharing scheme and preserves its
simplicity and efficiency. In addition, we consider secure distributed storage
where the proposed communication efficient secret sharing schemes further
improve disk access complexity during decoding.

 <dc:description>  We construct a Cartesian product G x H for finite simple graphs. It satisfies
the Kuenneth formula: H^k(G x H) is a direct sum of tensor products H^i(G) x
H^j(G) with i+j=k and so p(G x H,x) = p(G,x) p(H,y) for the Poincare polynomial
p(G,x) and X(G x H) = X(G) X(H) for the Euler characteristic X(G)=p(G,-1). G1=G
x K1 has as vertices the simplices of G and a natural digraph structure. We
show that dim(G1) is larger or equal than dim(G) and G1 is homotopic to G. The
Kuenneth identity is proven using Hodge describing the harmonic forms by the
product f g of harmonic forms of G and H and uses a discrete de Rham theorem
given by a combinatorial chain homotopy between simplicial and de Rham
cohomology. We show dim(G x H) = dim(G1) + dim(H1) implying that dim(G x H) is
larger or equal than dim(G) + dim(H) as for Hausdorff dimension in the
continuum. The chromatic number c(G1) is smaller or equal than c(G) and c(G x
H) is bounded above by c(G)+c(H)-1. The automorphism group of G x H contains
Aut(G) x Aut(H). If G~H and U~V then (G x U) ~ (H x V) if ~ means homotopic:
homotopy classes can be multiplided. If G is k-dimensional geometric meaning
that all unit spheres S(x) in G are (k-1)-discrete homotopy spheres, then G1 is
k-dimensional geometric. If G is k-dimensional geometric and H is l-dimensional
geometric, then G x H is geometric of dimension (l+k). The product extends to a
ring of chains which unlike the category of graphs is closed under boundary
operation taking quotients G/A with A subset Aut(G). As we can glue graphs or
chains, joins or fibre bundles can be defined with the same features as in the
continuum, allowing to build isomorphism classes of bundles.

 <dc:title>A Bounded $p$-norm Approximation of Max-Convolution for Sub-Quadratic

 <dc:description>  Max-convolution is an important problem closely resembling standard
convolution; as such, max-convolution occurs frequently across many fields.
Here we extend the method with fastest known worst-case runtime, which can be
applied to nonnegative vectors by numerically approximating the Chebyshev norm
$\| \cdot \|_\infty$, and use this approach to derive two numerically stable
methods based on the idea of computing $p$-norms via fast convolution: The
first method proposed, with runtime in $O( k \log(k) \log(\log(k)) )$ (which is
less than $18 k \log(k)$ for any vectors that can be practically realized),
uses the $p$-norm as a direct approximation of the Chebyshev norm. The second
approach proposed, with runtime in $O( k \log(k) )$ (although in practice both
perform similarly), uses a novel null space projection method, which extracts
information from a sequence of $p$-norms to estimate the maximum value in the
vector (this is equivalent to querying a small number of moments from a
distribution of bounded support in order to estimate the maximum). The $p$-norm
approaches are compared to one another and are shown to compute an
approximation of the Viterbi path in a hidden Markov model where the transition
matrix is a Toeplitz matrix; the runtime of approximating the Viterbi path is
thus reduced from $O( n k^2 )$ steps to $O( n $k \log(k))$ steps in practice,
and is demonstrated by inferring the U.S. unemployment rate from the S&amp;P 500
stock index.

 <dc:description>  To choose restaurants and coffee shops, people are increasingly relying on
social-networking sites. In a popular site such as Foursquare or Yelp, a place
comes with descriptions and reviews, and with profile pictures of people who
frequent them. Descriptions and reviews have been widely explored in the
research area of data mining. By contrast, profile pictures have received
little attention. Previous work showed that people are able to partly guess a
place's ambiance, clientele, and activities not only by observing the place
itself but also by observing the profile pictures of its visitors. Here we
further that work by determining which visual cues people may have relied upon
to make their guesses; showing that a state-of-the-art algorithm could make
predictions more accurately than humans at times; and demonstrating that the
visual cues people relied upon partly differ from those of the algorithm.

 <dc:title>Impact of Multipath Reflections on the Performance of Indoor Visible

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Visible light communication (VLC) using light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) has been
a popular research area recently. VLC can provide a practical solution for
indoor positioning. In this paper, the impact of multipath reflections on
indoor VLC positioning is investigated, considering a complex indoor
environment with walls, floor and ceiling. For the proposed positioning system,
an LED bulb is the transmitter and a photo-diode (PD) is the receiver to detect
received signal strength (RSS) information. Combined deterministic and modified
Monte Carlo (CDMMC) method is applied to compute the impulse response of the
optical channel. Since power attenuation is applied to calculate the distance
between the transmitter and receiver, the received power from each reflection
order is analyzed. Finally, the positioning errors are estimated for all the
locations over the room and compared with the previous works where no
reflections considered. Three calibration approaches are proposed to decrease
the effect of multipath reflections.

 <dc:title>Localized eigenvectors of the non-backtracking matrix</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the case of graph partitioning, the emergence of localized eigenvectors
can cause the standard spectral method to fail. To overcome this problem, the
spectral method using a non-backtracking matrix was proposed. Based on
numerical experiments on several examples of real networks, it is clear that
the non-backtracking matrix does not exhibit localization of eigenvectors.
However, we show that localized eigenvectors of the non-backtracking matrix can
exist outside the spectral band, which may lead to deterioration in the
performance of graph partitioning.

 <dc:title>Some remarks on multiplicity codes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multiplicity codes are algebraic error-correcting codes generalizing
classical polynomial evaluation codes, and are based on evaluating polynomials
and their derivatives. This small augmentation confers upon them better local
decoding, list-decoding and local list-decoding algorithms than their classical
counterparts. We survey what is known about these codes, present some
variations and improvements, and finally list some interesting open problems.

 <dc:description>  Stackelberg security game models and associated computational tools have seen
deployment in a number of high-consequence security settings, such as LAX
canine patrols and Federal Air Marshal Service. These models focus on isolated
systems with only one defender, despite being part of a more complex system
with multiple players. Furthermore, many real systems such as transportation
networks and the power grid exhibit interdependencies between targets and,
consequently, between decision makers jointly charged with protecting them. To
understand such multidefender strategic interactions present in security, we
investigate game theoretic models of security games with multiple defenders.
Unlike most prior analysis, we focus on the situations in which each defender
must protect multiple targets, so that even a single defender's best response
decision is, in general, highly non-trivial. We start with an analytical
investigation of multidefender security games with independent targets,
offering an equilibrium and price-of-anarchy analysis of three models with
increasing generality. In all models, we find that defenders have the incentive
to over-protect targets, at times significantly. Additionally, in the simpler
models, we find that the price of anarchy is unbounded, linearly increasing
both in the number of defenders and the number of targets per defender.
Considering interdependencies among targets, we develop a novel mixed-integer
linear programming formulation to compute a defender's best response, and make
use of this formulation in approximating Nash equilibria of the game. We apply
this approach towards computational strategic analysis of several models of
networks representing interdependencies, including real-world power networks.
Our analysis shows how network structure and the probability of failure spread
determine the propensity of defenders to over- or under-invest in security.

 <dc:title>Computing Individual Discrete Logarithms Faster in GF$(p^n)$ with the
  NFS-DL Algorithm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guillevic, Aurore</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Number Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Number Field Sieve (NFS) algorithm is the best known method to compute
discrete logarithms (DL) in finite fields $\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$, with $p$ medium
to large and $n \geq 1$ small. This algorithm comprises four steps: polynomial
selection, relation collection, linear algebra and finally, individual
logarithm computation. The first step outputs two polynomials defining two
number fields, and a map from the polynomial ring over the integers modulo each
of these polynomials to $\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$. After the relation collection and
linear algebra phases, the (virtual) logarithm of a subset of elements in each
number field is known. Given the target element in $\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$, the
fourth step computes a preimage in one number field. If one can write the
target preimage as a product of elements of known (virtual) logarithm, then one
can deduce the discrete logarithm of the target. As recently shown by the
Logjam attack, this final step can be critical when it can be computed very
quickly. But we realized that computing an individual DL is much slower in
medium-and large-characteristic non-prime fields $\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$ with $n
\geq 3$, compared to prime fields and quadratic fields $\mathbb{F}\_{p^2}$. We
optimize the first part of individual DL: the \emph{booting step}, by reducing
dramatically the size of the preimage norm. Its smoothness probability is
higher, hence the running-time of the booting step is much improved. Our method
is very efficient for small extension fields with $2 \leq n \leq 6$ and applies
to any $n \textgreater{} 1$, in medium and large characteristic.

 <dc:description>  To overcome the performance degradation of adaptive filtering algorithms in
the presence of impulsive noise, a novel normalized sign algorithm (NSA) based
on a convex combination strategy, called NSA-NSA, is proposed in this paper.
The proposed algorithm is capable of solving the conflicting requirement of
fast convergence rate and low steady-state error for an individual NSA filter.
To further improve the robustness to impulsive noises, a mixing parameter
updating formula based on a sign cost function is derived. Moreover, a tracking
weight transfer scheme of coefficients from a fast NSA filter to a slow NSA
filter is proposed to speed up the convergence rate. The convergence behavior
and performance of the new algorithm are verified by theoretical analysis and
simulation studies.

 <dc:title>A Practical Guide to Randomized Matrix Computations with MATLAB
  Implementations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Matrix operations such as matrix inversion, eigenvalue decomposition,
singular value decomposition are ubiquitous in real-world applications.
Unfortunately, many of these matrix operations so time and memory expensive
that they are prohibitive when the scale of data is large. In real-world
applications, since the data themselves are noisy, machine-precision matrix
operations are not necessary at all, and one can sacrifice a reasonable amount
of accuracy for computational efficiency.
  In recent years, a bunch of randomized algorithms have been devised to make
matrix computations more scalable. Mahoney (2011) and Woodruff (2014) have
written excellent but very technical reviews of the randomized algorithms.
Differently, the focus of this manuscript is on intuition, algorithm
derivation, and implementation. This manuscript should be accessible to people
with knowledge in elementary matrix algebra but unfamiliar with randomized
matrix computations. The algorithms introduced in this manuscript are all
summarized in a user-friendly way, and they can be implemented in lines of
MATLAB code. The readers can easily follow the implementations even if they do
not understand the maths and algorithms.

 <dc:title>Enumeration Reducibility in Closure Spaces with Applications to Logic

 <dc:description>  In many instances in first order logic or computable algebra, classical
theorems show that many problems are undecidable for general structures, but
become decidable if some rigidity is imposed on the structure. For example, the
set of theorems in many finitely axiomatisable theories is nonrecursive, but
the set of theorems for any finitely axiomatisable complete theory is
recursive. Finitely presented groups might have an nonrecursive word problem,
but finitely presented simple groups have a recursive word problem. In this
article we introduce a topological framework based on closure spaces to show
that many of these proofs can be obtained in a similar setting. We will show in
particular that these statements can be generalized to cover arbitrary
structures, with no finite or recursive presentation/axiomatization. This
generalizes in particular work by Kuznetsov and others. Examples from first
order logic and symbolic dynamics will be discussed at length.

 <dc:description>  SYM-ILDL is a numerical software package that computes incomplete $LDL^{T}$
(or `ILDL') factorizations of symmetric indefinite and real skew-symmetric
matrices. The core of the algorithm is a Crout variant of incomplete LU (ILU),
originally introduced and implemented for symmetric matrices by [Li and Saad,
Crout versions of ILU factorization with pivoting for sparse symmetric
matrices, Transactions on Numerical Analysis 20, pp. 75--85, 2005]. Our code is
economical in terms of storage and it deals with real skew-symmetric matrices
as well, in addition to symmetric ones. The package is written in C++ and it is
templated, open source, and includes a MATLAB interface. The code includes
built-in RCM and AMD reordering, two equilibration strategies, threshold
Bunch-Kaufman pivoting and rook pivoting, as well as a wrapper to MC64, a
popular matching based equilibration and reordering algorithm. We also include
two built-in iterative solvers: SQMR preconditioned with ILDL, or MINRES
preconditioned with a symmetric positive definite preconditioner based on the
ILDL factorization.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we give an overview for the shared task at the 4th CCF
Conference on Natural Language Processing \&amp; Chinese Computing (NLPCC 2015):
Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging for micro-blog
texts. Different with the popular used newswire datasets, the dataset of this
shared task consists of the relatively informal micro-texts. The shared task
has two sub-tasks: (1) individual Chinese word segmentation and (2) joint
Chinese word segmentation and POS Tagging. Each subtask has three tracks to
distinguish the systems with different resources. We first introduce the
dataset and task, then we characterize the different approaches of the
participating systems, report the test results, and provide a overview analysis
of these results. An online system is available for open registration and
evaluation at http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpcc2015.

 <dc:description>  Distances to compact sets are widely used in the field of Topological Data
Analysis for inferring geometric and topological features from point clouds. In
this context, the distance to a probability measure (DTM) has been introduced
by Chazal et al. (2011) as a robust alternative to the distance a compact set.
In practice, the DTM can be estimated by its empirical counterpart, that is the
distance to the empirical measure (DTEM). In this paper we give a tight control
of the deviation of the DTEM. Our analysis relies on a local analysis of
empirical processes. In particular, we show that the rates of convergence of
the DTEM directly depends on the regularity at zero of a particular quantile
fonction which contains some local information about the geometry of the
support. This quantile function is the relevant quantity to describe precisely
how difficult is a geometric inference problem. Several numerical experiments
illustrate the convergence of the DTEM and also confirm that our bounds are
tight.

 <dc:description>  Hardware-aware design and optimization is crucial in exploiting emerging
architectures for PDE-based computational fluid dynamics applications. In this
work, we study optimizations aimed at acceleration of OpenFOAM-based
applications on emerging hybrid heterogeneous platforms. OpenFOAM uses MPI to
provide parallel multi-processor functionality, which scales well on
homogeneous systems but does not fully utilize the potential per-node
performance on hybrid heterogeneous platforms. In our study, we use two
OpenFOAM applications, icoFoam and laplacianFoam, both based on Krylov
iterative methods. We propose a number of optimizations of the dominant kernel
of the Krylov solver, aimed at acceleration of the overall execution of the
applications on modern GPU-accelerated heterogeneous platforms. Experimental
results show that the proposed hybrid implementation significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art implementation.

 <dc:title>Learning with Symmetric Label Noise: The Importance of Being Unhinged</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>van Rooyen, Brendan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Convex potential minimisation is the de facto approach to binary
classification. However, Long and Servedio [2010] proved that under symmetric
label noise (SLN), minimisation of any convex potential over a linear function
class can result in classification performance equivalent to random guessing.
This ostensibly shows that convex losses are not SLN-robust. In this paper, we
propose a convex, classification-calibrated loss and prove that it is
SLN-robust. The loss avoids the Long and Servedio [2010] result by virtue of
being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss, where
one does not clamp at zero; hence, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that
the optimal unhinged solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised
SVM, and is the limiting solution for any convex potential; this implies that
strong l2 regularisation makes most standard learners SLN-robust. Experiments
confirm the SLN-robustness of the unhinged loss.

 <dc:description>  RAR uses classic symmetric encryption algorithm SHA-1 hashing and AES
algorithm for encryption, and the only method of password recovery is brute
force, which is very time-consuming. In this paper, we present an approach
using GPUs to speed up the password recovery process. However, because the
major calculation and time-consuming part, SHA-1 hashing, is hard to be
parallelized, so this paper adopts coarse granularity parallel. That is, one
GPU thread is responsible for the validation of one password. We mainly use
three optimization methods to optimize this parallel version: asynchronous
parallel between CPU and GPU, redundant calculations and conditional statements
reduction, and the usage of registers optimization. Experiment result shows
that the final version reaches 43~57 times speedup on an AMD FirePro W8000 GPU,
compared to a well-optimized serial version on Intel Core i5 CPU.

 <dc:description>  We study a multi-server model with $n$ flexible servers and $n$ queues,
connected through a bipartite graph, where the level of flexibility is captured
by the graph's average degree, $d_n$. Applications in content replication in
data centers, skill-based routing in call centers, and flexible supply chains
are among our main motivations.
  We focus on the scaling regime where the system size $n$ tends to infinity,
while the overall traffic intensity stays fixed. We show that a large capacity
region and an asymptotically vanishing queueing delay are simultaneously
achievable even under limited flexibility ($d_n \ll n$). Our main results
demonstrate that, when $d_n\gg \ln n$, a family of expander-graph-based
flexibility architectures has a capacity region that is within a constant
factor of the maximum possible, while simultaneously ensuring a diminishing
queueing delay for all arrival rate vectors in the capacity region. Our
analysis is centered around a new class of virtual-queue-based scheduling
policies that rely on dynamically constructed job-to-server assignments on the
connectivity graph. For comparison, we also analyze a natural family of modular
architectures, which is simpler but has provably weaker performance.

 <dc:description>  Natural images can be viewed as patchworks of different textures, where the
local image statistics is roughly stationary within a small neighborhood but
otherwise varies from region to region. In order to model this variability, we
first applied the parametric texture algorithm of Portilla and Simoncelli to
image patches of 64X64 pixels in a large database of natural images such that
each image patch is then described by 655 texture parameters which specify
certain statistics, such as variances and covariances of wavelet coefficients
or coefficient magnitudes within that patch.
  To model the statistics of these texture parameters, we then developed
suitable nonlinear transformations of the parameters that allowed us to fit
their joint statistics with a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We find that
the first 200 principal components contain more than 99% of the variance and
are sufficient to generate textures that are perceptually extremely close to
those generated with all 655 components. We demonstrate the usefulness of the
model in several ways: (1) We sample ensembles of texture patches that can be
directly compared to samples of patches from the natural image database and can
to a high degree reproduce their perceptual appearance. (2) We further
developed an image compression algorithm which generates surprisingly accurate
images at bit rates as low as 0.14 bits/pixel. Finally, (3) We demonstrate how
our approach can be used for an efficient and objective evaluation of samples
generated with probabilistic models of natural images.

 <dc:description>  Impulsive dynamical systems is a well-established area of dynamical systems
theory, and it is used in this work to analyze several basic properties of
reset control systems: existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous
dependence on the initial condition (well-posedness). The work scope is about
reset control systems with a linear and time-invariant base system, and a
zero-crossing resetting law. A necessary and sufficient condition for existence
and uniqueness of solutions, based on the well-posedness of reset instants, is
developed. As a result, it is shown that reset control systems (with strictly
proper plants) do no have Zeno solutions. It is also shown that full reset and
partial reset (with a special structure) always produce well-posed reset
instants. Moreover, a definition of continuous dependence on the initial
condition is developed, and also a sufficient condition for reset control
systems to satisfy that property. Finally, this property is used to analyze
sensitivity of reset control systems to sensor noise. This work also includes a
number of illustrative examples motivating the key concepts and main results.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved great success in
various computer vision and pattern recognition applications, including those
for handwritten Chinese character recognition (HCCR). However, most current
DCNN-based HCCR approaches treat the handwritten sample simply as an image
bitmap, ignoring some vital domain-specific information that may be useful but
that cannot be learnt by traditional networks. In this paper, we propose an
enhancement of the DCNN approach to online HCCR by incorporating a variety of
domain-specific knowledge, including deformation, non-linear normalization,
imaginary strokes, path signature, and 8-directional features. Our contribution
is twofold. First, these domain-specific technologies are investigated and
integrated with a DCNN to form a composite network to achieve improved
performance. Second, the resulting DCNNs with diversity in their domain
knowledge are combined using a hybrid serial-parallel (HSP) strategy.
Consequently, we achieve a promising accuracy of 97.20% and 96.87% on
CASIA-OLHWDB1.0 and CASIA-OLHWDB1.1, respectively, outperforming the best
results previously reported in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Numerous problems in machine learning are formulated as optimization with
manifold constraints. In this paper, we propose the Manifold alternating
directions method of multipliers (MADMM), an extension of the classical ADMM
scheme for manifold-constrained non-smooth optimization problems and show its
application to several challenging problems in dimensionality reduction, data
analysis, and manifold learning.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things paradigm envisions the pervasive interconnection and
cooperation of smart things over the current and future Internet
infrastructure. The Internet of Things is, thus, the evolution of the Internet
to cover the real-world, enabling many new services that will improve people's
everyday lives, spawn new businesses and make buildings, cities and transport
smarter. Smart things allow indeed for ubiquitous data collection or tracking,
but these useful features are also examples of privacy threats that are already
now limiting the success of the Internet of Things vision when not implemented
correctly. These threats involve new challenges such as the pervasive
privacy-aware management of personal data or methods to control or avoid
ubiquitous tracking and profiling. This paper analyzes the privacy issues in
the Internet of Things in detail. To this end, we first discuss the evolving
features and trends in the Internet of Things with the goal of scrutinizing
their privacy implications. Second, we classify and examine privacy threats in
this new setting, pointing out the challenges that need to be overcome to
ensure that the Internet of Things becomes a reality.

 <dc:description>  The enhancement and detection of elongated structures in noisy image data is
relevant for many biomedical applications. To handle complex crossing
structures in 2D images, 2D orientation scores were introduced, which already
showed their use in a variety of applications. Here we extend this work to 3D
orientation scores. First, we construct the orientation score from a given
dataset, which is achieved by an invertible coherent state type of transform.
For this transformation we introduce 3D versions of the 2D cake-wavelets, which
are complex wavelets that can simultaneously detect oriented structures and
oriented edges. For efficient implementation of the different steps in the
wavelet creation we use a spherical harmonic transform. Finally, we show some
first results of practical applications of 3D orientation scores.

 <dc:description>  An \emph{asteroidal triple} is a set of three independent vertices in a graph
such that any two vertices in the set are connected by a path which avoids the
neighbourhood of the third.
  A classical result by Lekkerkerker and Boland \cite{6} showed that interval
graphs are precisely the chordal graphs that do not have asteroidal triples.
  Interval graphs are chordal, as are the \emph{directed path graphs} and the
\emph{path graphs}.
  Similar to Lekkerkerker and Boland, Cameron, Ho\'{a}ng, and L\'{e}v\^{e}que
\cite{4} gave a characterization of directed path graphs by a &quot;special type&quot; of
asteroidal triple, and asked whether or not there was such a characterization
for path graphs.
  We give strong evidence that asteroidal triples alone are insufficient to
characterize the family of path graphs, and give a new characterization of path
graphs via a forbidden induced subgraph family that we call \emph{sun systems}.
  Key to our new characterization is the study of \emph{asteroidal sets} in sun
systems, which are a natural generalization of asteroidal triples.
  Our characterization of path graphs by forbidding sun systems also
generalizes a characterization of directed path graphs by forbidding odd suns
that was given by Chaplick et al.~\cite{9}.

 <dc:description>  A theory of how agents can come to understand a language is presented. If
understanding a sentence $\alpha$ is to associate an operator with $\alpha$
that transforms the representational state of the agent as intended by the
sender, then coming to know a language involves coming to know the operators
that correspond to the meaning of any sentence. This involves a higher order
operator that operates on the possible transformations that operate on the
representational capacity of the agent. We formalize these constructs using
concepts and diagrams analogous to category theory.

 <dc:description>  The polyhedral model provides a powerful mathematical abstraction to enable
effective optimization of loop nests with respect to a given optimization goal,
e.g., exploiting parallelism. Unexploited reduction properties are a frequent
reason for polyhedral optimizers to assume parallelism prohibiting dependences.
To our knowledge, no polyhedral loop optimizer available in any production
compiler provides support for reductions. In this paper, we show that
leveraging the parallelism of reductions can lead to a significant performance
increase. We give a precise, dependence based, definition of reductions and
discuss ways to extend polyhedral optimization to exploit the associativity and
commutativity of reduction computations. We have implemented a
reduction-enabled scheduling approach in the Polly polyhedral optimizer and
evaluate it on the standard Polybench 3.2 benchmark suite. We were able to
detect and model all 52 arithmetic reductions and achieve speedups up to
2.21$\times$ on a quad core machine by exploiting the multidimensional
reduction in the BiCG benchmark.

 <dc:description>  A Bayesian framework is proposed to define flexible coupling models for joint
tensor decompositions of multiple data sets. Under this framework, a natural
formulation of the data fusion problem is to cast it in terms of a joint
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. Data driven scenarios of joint posterior
distributions are provided, including general Gaussian priors and non Gaussian
coupling priors. We present and discuss implementation issues of algorithms
used to obtain the joint MAP estimator. We also show how this framework can be
adapted to tackle the problem of joint decompositions of large datasets. In the
case of a conditional Gaussian coupling with a linear transformation, we give
theoretical bounds on the data fusion performance using the Bayesian Cramer-Rao
bound. Simulations are reported for hybrid coupling models ranging from simple
additive Gaussian models, to Gamma-type models with positive variables and to
the coupling of data sets which are inherently of different size due to
different resolution of the measurement devices.

 <dc:description>  This work explores the rate-reliability-complexity limits of the quasi-static
K-user multiple access channel (MAC), with or without feedback. Using high-SNR
asymptotics, the work first derives bounds on the computational resources
required to achieve near-optimal (ML-based) decoding performance. It then
bounds the (reduced) complexity needed to achieve any (including suboptimal)
diversity-multiplexing performance tradeoff (DMT) performance, and finally
bounds the same complexity, in the presence of feedback-aided user selection.
This latter effort reveals the ability of a few bits of feedback not only to
improve performance, but also to reduce complexity. In this context, the
analysis reveals the interesting finding that proper calibration of user
selection can allow for near-optimal ML-based decoding, with complexity that
need not scale exponentially in the total number of codeword bits. The derived
bounds constitute the best known performance-vs-complexity behavior to date for
ML-based MAC decoding, as well as a first exploration of the
complexity-feedback-performance interdependencies in multiuser settings.

 <dc:description>  A generic construction of linear codes over finite fields has recently
received a lot of attention, and many one-weight, two-weight and three-weight
codes with good error correcting capability have been produced with this
generic approach. The first objective of this paper is to establish
relationships among some classes of linear codes obtained with this approach,
so that the parameters of some classes of linear codes can be derived from
those of other classes with known parameters. In this way, linear codes with
new parameters will be derived. The second is to present a class of
three-weight binary codes and consider their applications in secret sharing.

 <dc:description>  The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the prevalent programming model used
on today's supercomputers. Therefore, MPI library developers are looking for
the best possible performance (shortest run-time) of individual MPI functions
across many different supercomputer architectures. Several MPI benchmark suites
have been developed to assess the performance of MPI implementations.
Unfortunately, the outcome of these benchmarks is often neither reproducible
nor statistically sound. To overcome these issues, we show which experimental
factors have an impact on the run-time of blocking collective MPI operations
and how to control them. We address the problem of process and clock
synchronization in MPI benchmarks. Finally, we present a new experimental
method that allows us to obtain reproducible and statistically sound MPI
measurements.

many free variables modulo $\alpha$-equivalence form a final coalgebra for a
functor on the category of nominal sets. Here we investigate the rational
fixpoint of that functor. We prove that it is formed by all rational
$\lambda$-trees, i.e. those $\lambda$-trees which have only finitely many
subtrees (up to isomorphism). This yields a corecursion principle that allows
the definition of operations such as substitution on rational $\lambda$-trees.

of issues, where each member of the society may vote for one of several
positions on each issue, but the combination of votes on the various issues is
restricted to a set of feasible voting patterns. We require the aggregation to
be supportive, i.e. for every issue $j$ the corresponding component $f_j$ of
every aggregator on every issue should satisfy $f_j(x_1, ,\ldots, x_n) \in
\{x_1, ,\ldots, x_n\}$. We prove that, in such a set-up, non-dictatorial
aggregation of votes in a society of some size is possible if and only if
either non-dictatorial aggregation is possible in a society of only two members
or a ternary aggregator exists that either on every issue $j$ is a majority
operation, i.e. the corresponding component satisfies $f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x)
= f_j(y,x,x) =x, \forall x,y$, or on every issue is a minority operation, i.e.
the corresponding component satisfies $f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x) = f_j(y,x,x) =y,
\forall x,y.$ We then introduce a notion of uniformly non-dictatorial
aggregator, which is defined to be an aggregator that on every issue, and when
restricted to an arbitrary two-element subset of the votes for that issue,
differs from all projection functions. We first give a characterization of sets
of feasible voting patterns that admit a uniformly non-dictatorial aggregator.
Then making use of Bulatov's dichotomy theorem for conservative constraint
satisfaction problems, we connect social choice theory with combinatorial
complexity by proving that if a set of feasible voting patterns $X$ has a
uniformly non-dictatorial aggregator of some arity then the multi-sorted
conservative constraint satisfaction problem on $X$, in the sense introduced by
Bulatov and Jeavons, with each issue representing a sort, is tractable;
otherwise it is NP-complete.

 <dc:title>Pignistic Probability Transforms for Mixes of Low- and High-Probability
  Events</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sudano, John J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In some real world information fusion situations, time critical decisions
must be made with an incomplete information set. Belief function theories
(e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, Transferable Belief Model) have been
shown to provide a reasonable methodology for processing or fusing the
quantitative clues or information measurements that form the incomplete
information set. For decision making, the pignistic (from the Latin pignus, a
bet) probability transform has been shown to be a good method of using Beliefs
or basic belief assignments (BBAs) to make decisions. For many systems, one
need only address the most-probable elements in the set. For some critical
systems, one must evaluate the risk of wrong decisions and establish safe
probability thresholds for decision making. This adds a greater complexity to
decision making, since one must address all elements in the set that are above
the risk decision threshold. The problem is greatly simplified if most of the
probabilities fall below this threshold. Finding a probability transform that
properly represents mixes of low- and high-probability events is essential.
This article introduces four new pignistic probability transforms with an
implementation that uses the latest values of Beliefs, Plausibilities, or BBAs
to improve the pignistic probability estimates. Some of them assign smaller
values of probabilities for smaller values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets
pignistic transform. They also assign higher probability values for larger
values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. These probability
transforms will assign a value of probability that converges faster to the
values below the risk threshold. A probability information content (PIC)
variable is also introduced that assigns an information content value to any
set of probability. Four operators are defined to help simplify the
derivations.

 <dc:description>  Network steganography conceals the transfer of sensitive information within
unobtrusive data in computer networks. So-called micro protocols are
communication protocols placed within the payload of a network steganographic
transfer. They enrich this transfer with features such as reliability, dynamic
overlay routing, or performance optimization --- just to mention a few. We
present different design approaches for the embedding of hidden channels with
micro protocols in digitized audio signals under consideration of different
requirements. On the basis of experimental results, our design approaches are
compared, and introduced into a protocol engineering approach for micro
protocols.

 <dc:description>  The completion of matrices with missing values under the rank constraint is a
non-convex optimization problem. A popular convex relaxation is based on
minimization of the nuclear norm (sum of singular values) of the matrix. For
this relaxation, an important question is whether the two optimization problems
lead to the same solution. This question was addressed in the literature mostly
in the case of random positions of missing elements and random known elements.
In this contribution, we analyze the case of structured matrices with fixed
pattern of missing values, in particular, the case of Hankel and quasi-Hankel
matrix completion, which appears as a subproblem in the computation of
symmetric tensor canonical polyadic decomposition. We extend existing results
on completion of rank-one real Hankel matrices to completion of rank-r complex
Hankel and quasi-Hankel matrices.

 <dc:description>  Crowdsourcing models applied to work on mobile devices continuously reach new
ways of solving sophisticated problems, now with a use of portable advanced
devices, where users are not limited to a stationary use. There exists an open
problem of quality in crowdsourcing models due the inexperienced or malicious
workers. In this paper, we propose a model and a short specification of a
platform for a bundled widely available crowdsourcing mechanism, which tries to
utilize workers individual characteristics to maximum. Analyzed solution relies
on geographical data classified by localization category. Secondly, we profile
mobile workers by precisely analyzing their activity history. Results of this
research will make an impact on better understanding the latent potential of
mobile devices users. It makes for not only better quality in results, but also
opens a possibility of implementing a &quot;twitch crowdsourcing&quot; or emergency
relief systems. Special tasks assigned to owners of mobile devices can help
those, which are in need of help, making them the task creators.

 <dc:description>  News reports of the last few years indicated that several intelligence
agencies are able to monitor large networks or entire portions of the Internet
backbone. Such a powerful adversary has only recently been considered by the
academic literature. In this paper, we propose a new adversary model for
Location Based Services (LBSs). The model takes into account an unauthorized
third party, different from the LBS provider itself, that wants to infer the
location and monitor the movements of a LBS user. We show that such an
adversary can extrapolate the position of a target user by just analyzing the
size and the timing of the encrypted traffic exchanged between that user and
the LBS provider. We performed a thorough analysis of a widely deployed
location based app that comes pre-installed with many Android devices:
GoogleNow. The results are encouraging and highlight the importance of devising
more effective countermeasures against powerful adversaries to preserve the
privacy of LBS users.

 <dc:description>  Current applications have produced graphs on the order of hundreds of
thousands of nodes and millions of edges. To take advantage of such graphs, one
must be able to find patterns, outliers and communities. These tasks are better
performed in an interactive environment, where human expertise can guide the
process. For large graphs, though, there are some challenges: the excessive
processing requirements are prohibitive, and drawing hundred-thousand nodes
results in cluttered images hard to comprehend. To cope with these problems, we
propose an innovative framework suited for any kind of tree-like graph visual
design. GMine integrates (a) a representation for graphs organized as
hierarchies of partitions - the concepts of SuperGraph and Graph-Tree; and (b)
a graph summarization methodology - CEPS. Our graph representation deals with
the problem of tracing the connection aspects of a graph hierarchy with sub
linear complexity, allowing one to grasp the neighborhood of a single node or
of a group of nodes in a single click. As a proof of concept, the visual
environment of GMine is instantiated as a system in which large graphs can be
investigated globally and locally.

 <dc:title>Query by String word spotting based on character bi-gram indexing</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a segmentation-free query by string word spotting
method. Both the documents and query strings are encoded using a recently
proposed word representa- tion that projects images and strings into a common
atribute space based on a pyramidal histogram of characters(PHOC). These
attribute models are learned using linear SVMs over the Fisher Vector
representation of the images along with the PHOC labels of the corresponding
strings. In order to search through the whole page, document regions are
indexed per character bi- gram using a similar attribute representation. On top
of that, we propose an integral image representation of the document using a
simplified version of the attribute model for efficient computation. Finally we
introduce a re-ranking step in order to boost retrieval performance. We show
state-of-the-art results for segmentation-free query by string word spotting in
single-writer and multi-writer standard datasets

 <dc:description>  Gy{\'a}rf{\'a}s et al. and Zaker have proven that the Grundy number of a
graph $G$ satisfies $\Gamma(G)\ge t$ if and only if $G$ contains an induced
subgraph called a $t$-atom.The family of $t$-atoms has bounded order and
contains a finite number of graphs.In this article, we introduce equivalents of
$t$-atoms for b-coloring and partial Grundy coloring.This concept is used to
prove that determining if $\varphi(G)\ge t$ and $\partial\Gamma(G)\ge t$ (under
conditions for the b-coloring), for a graph $G$, is in XP with parameter $t$.We
illustrate the utility of the concept of $t$-atoms by giving results on
b-critical vertices and edges, on b-perfect graphs and on graphs of girth at
least $7$.

 <dc:description>  An $i$-packing in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices at pairwise distance
greater than $i$. For a nondecreasing sequence of integers
$S=(s\_{1},s\_{2},\ldots)$, the $S$-packing chromatic number of a graph $G$ is
the least integer $k$ such that there exists a coloring of $G$ into $k$ colors
where each set of vertices colored $i$, $i=1,\ldots, k$, is an $s\_i$-packing.
This paper describes various subdivisions of an $i$-packing into $j$-packings
($j\textgreater{}i$) for the hexagonal, square and triangular lattices. These
results allow us to bound the $S$-packing chromatic number for these graphs,
with more precise bounds and exact values for sequences $S=(s\_{i},
i\in\mathbb{N}^{*})$, $s\_{i}=d+ \lfloor (i-1)/n \rfloor$.

 <dc:description>  With stereoscopic displays, a depth sensation that is too strong could impede
visual comfort and result in fatigue or pain. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a
technology which records brain activity. We used it to develop a novel
brain-computer interface that monitors users' states in order to reduce visual
strain. We present the first proof-of-concept system that discriminates
comfortable conditions from uncomfortable ones during stereoscopic vision using
EEG. It reacts within 1s to depth variations, achieving 63% accuracy on average
and 74% when 7 consecutive variations are measured. This study could lead to
adaptive systems that automatically suit stereoscopic displays to users and
viewing conditions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a unifying framework for type systems for process calculi. The
core of the system provides an accurate correspondence between essentially
functional processes and linear logic proofs; fragments of this system
correspond to previously known connections between proofs and processes. We
show how the addition of extra logical axioms can widen the class of typeable
processes in exchange for the loss of some computational properties like
lock-freeness or termination, allowing us to see various well studied systems
(like i/o types, linearity, control) as instances of a general pattern. This
suggests unified methods for extending existing type systems with new features
while staying in a well structured environment and constitutes a step towards
the study of denotational semantics of processes using proof-theoretical
methods.

understanding for the visualization design space. The new organization of
concepts that we introduce is our main contribution: a grammar for the
visualization design based on the review of former works and of classical and
state-of-the-art techniques. Like so, the paper is presented as a survey whose
structure introduces a new conceptualization for the space of techniques
concerning visual analysis.

 <dc:description>  Nanoscale resistive memories are expected to fuel dense integration of
electronic synapses for large-scale neuromorphic system. To realize such a
brain-inspired computing chip, a compact CMOS spiking neuron that performs
in-situ learning and computing while driving a large number of resistive
synapses is desired. This work presents a novel leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
design which implements the dual-mode operation of current integration and
synaptic drive, with a single opamp and enables in-situ learning with crossbar
resistive synapses. The proposed design was implemented in a 0.18 $\mu$m CMOS
technology. Measurements show neuron's ability to drive a thousand resistive
synapses, and demonstrate an in-situ associative learning. The neuron circuit
occupies a small area of 0.01 mm$^2$ and has an energy-efficiency of 9.3
pJ$/$spike$/$synapse.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in
which data at training and test time come from similar but different
distributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain
adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved,
predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the
training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea
in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data
from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled
target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach
promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main
learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the
shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be
achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard
layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture
can be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent,
and can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning
packages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct
classification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification),
where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is
achieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the
context of person re-identification application.

 <dc:description>  We consider staged self-assembly systems, in which square-shaped tiles can be
added to bins in several stages. Within these bins, the tiles may connect to
each other, depending on the glue types of their edges. Previous work by
Demaine et al. showed that a relatively small number of tile types suffices to
produce arbitrary shapes in this model. However, these constructions were only
based on a spanning tree of the geometric shape, so they did not produce full
connectivity of the underlying grid graph in the case of shapes with holes;
designing fully connected assemblies with a polylogarithmic number of stages
was left as a major open problem. We resolve this challenge by presenting new
systems for staged assembly that produce fully connected polyominoes in O(log^2
n) stages, for various scale factors and temperature {\tau} = 2 as well as
{\tau} = 1. Our constructions work even for shapes with holes and uses only a
constant number of glues and tiles. Moreover, the underlying approach is more
geometric in nature, implying that it promised to be more feasible for shapes
with compact geometric description.

 <dc:description>  The paper describes clustering problems from the combinatorial viewpoint. A
brief systemic survey is presented including the following: (i) basic
clustering problems (e.g., classification, clustering, sorting, clustering with
an order over cluster), (ii) basic approaches to assessment of objects and
object proximities (i.e., scales, comparison, aggregation issues), (iii) basic
approaches to evaluation of local quality characteristics for clusters and
total quality characteristics for clustering solutions, (iv) clustering as
multicriteria optimization problem, (v) generalized modular clustering
framework, (vi) basic clustering models/methods (e.g., hierarchical clustering,
k-means clustering, minimum spanning tree based clustering, clustering as
assignment, detection of clisue/quasi-clique based clustering, correlation
clustering, network communities based clustering), Special attention is
targeted to formulation of clustering as multicriteria optimization models.
Combinatorial optimization models are used as auxiliary problems (e.g.,
assignment, partitioning, knapsack problem, multiple choice problem,
morphological clique problem, searching for consensus/median for structures).
Numerical examples illustrate problem formulations, solving methods, and
applications. The material can be used as follows: (a) a research survey, (b) a
fundamental for designing the structure/architecture of composite modular
clustering software, (c) a bibliography reference collection, and (d) a
tutorial.

 <dc:title>A Geometric Interpretation of the Boolean Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi
  Algorithm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Linahan, Jeff</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm is an iterative improvement
technique for finding the minimum distance between two convex objects. It can
easily be extended to work with concave objects and return the pair of closest
points. [4] The key operation of GJK is testing whether a Voronoi region of a
simplex contains the origin or not. In this paper we show that, in the context
where one is interested only in the Boolean value of whether two convex objects
intersect, and not in the actual distance between them, the number of test
cases in GJK can be significantly reduced. This results in a simpler and more
efficient algorithm that can be used in many computational geometry
applications.

 <dc:description>  The severity of amplification attacks has grown in recent years. Since 2013
there have been at least two attacks which involved over 300Gbps of attack
traffic. This paper offers an analysis of these and many other amplification
attacks. We compare a wide selection of different proposals for detecting and
preventing amplification attacks, as well as proposals for tracing the
attackers. Since source IP spoofing plays an important part in almost all of
the attacks mentioned, a survey on the state of the art in spoofing defenses is
also presented. This work acts as an introduction into amplification attacks
and source IP address spoofing. By combining previous works into a single
comprehensive bibliography, and with our concise discussion, we hope to prevent
redundant work and encourage others to find practical solutions for defending
against future amplification attacks.

 <dc:title>An Accuracy-Assured Privacy-Preserving Recommender System for Internet

 <dc:description>  Recommender systems, tool for predicting users' potential preferences by
computing history data and users' interests, show an increasing importance in
various Internet applications such as online shopping. As a well-known
recommendation method, neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering has
attracted considerable attention recently. The risk of revealing users' private
information during the process of filtering has attracted noticeable research
interests. Among the current solutions, the probabilistic techniques have shown
a powerful privacy preserving effect. When facing $k$ Nearest Neighbour attack,
all the existing methods provide no data utility guarantee, for the
introduction of global randomness. In this paper, to overcome the problem of
recommendation accuracy loss, we propose a novel approach, Partitioned
Probabilistic Neighbour Selection, to ensure a required prediction accuracy
while maintaining high security against $k$NN attack. We define the sum of $k$
neighbours' similarity as the accuracy metric alpha, the number of user
partitions, across which we select the $k$ neighbours, as the security metric
beta. We generalise the $k$ Nearest Neighbour attack to beta k Nearest
Neighbours attack. Differing from the existing approach that selects neighbours
across the entire candidate list randomly, our method selects neighbours from
each exclusive partition of size $k$ with a decreasing probability. Theoretical
and experimental analysis show that to provide an accuracy-assured
recommendation, our Partitioned Probabilistic Neighbour Selection method yields
a better trade-off between the recommendation accuracy and system security.

 <dc:title>A Faster Algorithm to Build New Users Similarity List in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neighbourhood-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been applied in the
industry for several decades, because of the easy implementation and high
recommendation accuracy. As the core of neighbourhood-based CF, the task of
dynamically maintaining users' similarity list is challenged by cold-start
problem and scalability problem. Recently, several methods are presented on
solving the two problems. However, these methods applied an $O(n^2)$ algorithm
to compute the similarity list in a special case, where the new users, with
enough recommendation data, have the same rating list. To address the problem
of large computational cost caused by the special case, we design a faster
($O(\frac{1}{125}n^2)$) algorithm, TwinSearch Algorithm, to avoid computing and
sorting the similarity list for the new users repeatedly to save the
computational resources. Both theoretical and experimental results show that
the TwinSearch Algorithm achieves better running time than the traditional
method.

 <dc:description>  Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Test is a set of standardized questions designed
to evaluate human intelligence. Verbal comprehension questions appear very
frequently in IQ tests, which measure human's verbal ability including the
understanding of the words with multiple senses, the synonyms and antonyms, and
the analogies among words. In this work, we explore whether such tests can be
solved automatically by artificial intelligence technologies, especially the
deep learning technologies that are recently developed and successfully applied
in a number of fields. However, we found that the task was quite challenging,
and simply applying existing technologies (e.g., word embedding) could not
achieve a good performance, mainly due to the multiple senses of words and the
complex relations among words. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
framework consisting of three components. First, we build a classifier to
recognize the specific type of a verbal question (e.g., analogy,
classification, synonym, or antonym). Second, we obtain distributed
representations of words and relations by leveraging a novel word embedding
method that considers the multi-sense nature of words and the relational
knowledge among words (or their senses) contained in dictionaries. Third, for
each type of questions, we propose a specific solver based on the obtained
distributed word representations and relation representations. Experimental
results have shown that the proposed framework can not only outperform existing
methods for solving verbal comprehension questions but also exceed the average
performance of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers involved in the study. The
results indicate that with appropriate uses of the deep learning technologies
we might be a further step closer to the human intelligence.

 <dc:title>Core-competitive Auctions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  One of the major drawbacks of the celebrated VCG auction is its low (or zero)
revenue even when the agents have high value for the goods and a {\em
competitive} outcome could have generated a significant revenue. A competitive
outcome is one for which it is impossible for the seller and a subset of buyers
to `block' the auction by defecting and negotiating an outcome with higher
payoffs for themselves. This corresponds to the well-known concept of {\em
core} in cooperative game theory.
  In particular, VCG revenue is known to be not competitive when the goods
being sold have complementarities. A bottleneck here is an impossibility result
showing that there is no auction that simultaneously achieves competitive
prices (a core outcome) and incentive-compatibility.
  In this paper we try to overcome the above impossibility result by asking the
following natural question: is it possible to design an incentive-compatible
auction whose revenue is comparable (even if less) to a competitive outcome?
Towards this, we define a notion of {\em core-competitive} auctions. We say
that an incentive-compatible auction is $\alpha$-core-competitive if its
revenue is at least $1/\alpha$ fraction of the minimum revenue of a
core-outcome. We study the Text-and-Image setting. In this setting, there is an
ad slot which can be filled with either a single image ad or $k$ text ads. We
design an $O(\ln \ln k)$ core-competitive randomized auction and an
$O(\sqrt{\ln(k)})$ competitive deterministic auction for the Text-and-Image
setting. We also show that both factors are tight.

in {0, 1, X}. This limits the amount of abstraction that can be achieved, and
presents inherent limitations to scaling. The main contribution of this paper
is to show how much more abstract lattices can be derived automatically from
RTL descriptions, and how a model checker for the general theory of STE
instantiated with such abstract lattices can be implemented in practice. This
gives us the first practical word-level STE engine, called STEWord. Experiments
on a set of designs similar to those used in industry show that STEWord scales
better than word-level BMC and also bit-level STE.

 <dc:description>  This paper examines the security vulnerabilities and threats imposed by the
inherent open nature of wireless communications and to devise efficient defense
mechanisms for improving the wireless network security. We first summarize the
security requirements of wireless networks, including their authenticity,
confidentiality, integrity and availability issues. Next, a comprehensive
overview of security attacks encountered in wireless networks is presented in
view of the network protocol architecture, where the potential security threats
are discussed at each protocol layer. We also provide a survey of the existing
security protocols and algorithms that are adopted in the existing wireless
network standards, such as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and the long-term
evolution (LTE) systems. Then, we discuss the state-of-the-art in
physical-layer security, which is an emerging technique of securing the open
communications environment against eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer.
We also introduce the family of various jamming attacks and their
counter-measures, including the constant jammer, intermittent jammer, reactive
jammer, adaptive jammer and intelligent jammer. Additionally, we discuss the
integration of physical-layer security into existing authentication and
cryptography mechanisms for further securing wireless networks. Finally, some
technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are
summarized and the future trends in wireless security are discussed.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of cross-domain image retrieval, considering the
following practical application: given a user photo depicting a clothing image,
our goal is to retrieve the same or attribute-similar clothing items from
online shopping stores. This is a challenging problem due to the large
discrepancy between online shopping images, usually taken in ideal
lighting/pose/background conditions, and user photos captured in uncontrolled
conditions. To address this problem, we propose a Dual Attribute-aware Ranking
Network (DARN) for retrieval feature learning. More specifically, DARN consists
of two sub-networks, one for each domain, whose retrieval feature
representations are driven by semantic attribute learning. We show that this
attribute-guided learning is a key factor for retrieval accuracy improvement.
In addition, to further align with the nature of the retrieval problem, we
impose a triplet visual similarity constraint for learning to rank across the
two sub-networks. Another contribution of our work is a large-scale dataset
which makes the network learning feasible. We exploit customer review websites
to crawl a large set of online shopping images and corresponding offline user
photos with fine-grained clothing attributes, i.e., around 450,000 online
shopping images and about 90,000 exact offline counterpart images of those
online ones. All these images are collected from real-world consumer websites
reflecting the diversity of the data modality, which makes this dataset unique
and rare in the academic community. We extensively evaluate the retrieval
performance of networks in different configurations. The top-20 retrieval
accuracy is doubled when using the proposed DARN other than the current popular
solution using pre-trained CNN features only (0.570 vs. 0.268).

 <dc:title>Fast Computation of PERCLOS and Saccadic Ratio</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dasgupta, Anirban</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This thesis describes the development of fast algorithms for the computation
of PERcentage CLOSure of eyes (PERCLOS) and Saccadic Ratio (SR). PERCLOS and SR
are two ocular parameters reported to be measures of alertness levels in human
beings. PERCLOS is the percentage of time in which at least 80% of the eyelid
remains closed over the pupil. Saccades are fast and simultaneous movement of
both the eyes in the same direction. SR is the ratio of peak saccadic velocity
to the saccadic duration. This thesis addresses the issues of image based
estimation of PERCLOS and SR, prevailing in the literature such as illumination
variation, poor illumination conditions, head rotations etc. In this work,
algorithms for real-time PERCLOS computation has been developed and implemented
on an embedded platform. The platform has been used as a case study for
assessment of loss of attention in automotive drivers. The SR estimation has
been carried out offline as real-time implementation requires high frame rates
of processing which is difficult to achieve due to hardware limitations. The
accuracy in estimation of the loss of attention using PERCLOS and SR has been
validated using brain signals, which are reported to be an authentic cue for
estimating the state of alertness in human beings. The major contributions of
this thesis include database creation, design and implementation of fast
algorithms for estimating PERCLOS and SR on embedded computing platforms.

 <dc:description>  We study the computational complexity of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods for high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression under sparsity
constraints. We first show that a Bayesian approach can achieve
variable-selection consistency under relatively mild conditions on the design
matrix. We then demonstrate that the statistical criterion of posterior
concentration need not imply the computational desideratum of rapid mixing of
the MCMC algorithm. By introducing a truncated sparsity prior for variable
selection, we provide a set of conditions that guarantee both
variable-selection consistency and rapid mixing of a particular
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The mixing time is linear in the number of
covariates up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof controls the spectral gap of
the Markov chain by constructing a canonical path ensemble that is inspired by
the steps taken by greedy algorithms for variable selection.

 <dc:description>  We consider a cooperative wireless network comprised of a source, a
destination and multiple relays operating in the presence of an eavesdropper,
which attempts to tap the source-destination transmission. We propose
multi-relay selection scheme for protecting the source against eavesdropping.
More specifically, multi-relay selection allows multiple relays to
simultaneously forward the source's transmission to the destination, differing
from the conventional single-relay selection where only the best relay is
chosen to assist the transmission from the source to destination. For the
purpose of comparison, we consider the classic direct transmission and
single-relay selection as benchmark schemes. We derive closed-form expressions
of the intercept probability and outage probability for the direct transmission
as well as for the single-relay and multi-relay selection schemes over Rayleigh
fading channels. It is demonstrated that as the outage requirement is relaxed,
the intercept performance of the three schemes improves and vice versa,
implying that there is a \emph{security versus reliability trade-off} (SRT). We
also show that both the single-relay and multi-relay selection schemes
outperform the direct transmission in terms of SRT, demonstrating the advantage
of the relay selection schemes for protecting the source's transmission against
the eavesdropping attacks. Finally, upon increasing the number of relays, the
SRTs of both the single-relay and multi-relay selection schemes improve
significantly and as expected, multi-relay selection outperforms single-relay
selection.

 <dc:description>  This article examines the secrecy coding aided wireless communications from a
source to a destination in the presence of an eavesdropper from a
security-reliability tradeoff (SRT) perspective. Explicitly, the security is
quantified in terms of the intercept probability experienced at the
eavesdropper, while the outage probability encountered at the destination is
used to measure the transmission reliability. We characterize the SRT of
conventional direct transmission from the source to the destination and show
that if the outage probability is increased, the intercept probability
decreases, and vice versa. We first demonstrate that the employment of relay
nodes for assisting the source-destination transmissions is capable of
defending against eavesdropping, followed by quantifying the benefits of
single-relay selection (SRS) as well as of multi-relay selection (MRS) schemes.
More specifically, in the SRS scheme, only the single &quot;best&quot; relay is selected
for forwarding the source signal to the destination, whereas the MRS scheme
allows multiple relays to participate in this process. It is illustrated that
both the SRS and MRS schemes achieve a better SRT than the conventional direct
transmission, especially upon increasing the number of relays. Numerical
results also show that as expected, the MRS outperforms the SRS in terms of its
SRT. Additionally, we present some open challenges and future directions for
the wireless relay aided physical-layer security.

 <dc:title>Salient Object Detection via Augmented Hypotheses</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose using \textit{augmented hypotheses} which consider
objectness, foreground and compactness for salient object detection. Our
algorithm consists of four basic steps. First, our method generates the
objectness map via objectness hypotheses. Based on the objectness map, we
estimate the foreground margin and compute the corresponding foreground map
which prefers the foreground objects. From the objectness map and the
foreground map, the compactness map is formed to favor the compact objects. We
then derive a saliency measure that produces a pixel-accurate saliency map
which uniformly covers the objects of interest and consistently separates fore-
and background. We finally evaluate the proposed framework on two challenging
datasets, MSRA-1000 and iCoSeg. Our extensive experimental results show that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:title>Supervised Fine Tuning for Word Embedding with Integrated Knowledge</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Learning vector representation for words is an important research field which
may benefit many natural language processing tasks. Two limitations exist in
nearly all available models, which are the bias caused by the context
definition and the lack of knowledge utilization. They are difficult to tackle
because these algorithms are essentially unsupervised learning approaches.
Inspired by deep learning, the authors propose a supervised framework for
learning vector representation of words to provide additional supervised fine
tuning after unsupervised learning. The framework is knowledge rich approacher
and compatible with any numerical vectors word representation. The authors
perform both intrinsic evaluation like attributional and relational similarity
prediction and extrinsic evaluations like the sentence completion and sentiment
analysis. Experiments results on 6 embeddings and 4 tasks with 10 datasets show
that the proposed fine tuning framework may significantly improve the quality
of the vector representation of words.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present an alternative approach to symbolic segmentation;
instead of implementing a new method we approach symbolic segmentation as an
algorithm selection problem. That is, let there be $n$ available algorithms for
symbolic segmentation, a selection mechanism forms a set of input features and
image attributes and selects on a case by case basis the best algorithm. The
selection mechanism is demonstrated from within an algorithm framework where
the selection is done in a set of various algorithm networks. Two sets of
experiments are performed and in both cases we demonstrate that the algorithm
selection allows to increase the result of the symbolic segmentation by a
considerable amount.

 <dc:description>  Designing 3D User Interfaces (UI) requires adequate evaluation tools to
ensure good usability and user experience. While many evaluation tools are
already available and widely used, existing approaches generally cannot provide
continuous and objective measures of usa-bility qualities during interaction
without interrupting the user. In this paper, we propose to use brain (with
ElectroEncephaloGraphy) and physiological (ElectroCardioGraphy, Galvanic Skin
Response) signals to continuously assess the mental effort made by the user to
perform 3D object manipulation tasks. We first show how this mental effort
(a.k.a., mental workload) can be estimated from such signals, and then measure
it on 8 participants during an actual 3D object manipulation task with an input
device known as the CubTile. Our results suggest that monitoring workload
enables us to continuously assess the 3DUI and/or interaction technique
ease-of-use. Overall, this suggests that this new measure could become a useful
addition to the repertoire of available evaluation tools, enabling a finer
grain assessment of the ergonomic qualities of a given 3D user interface.

 <dc:description>  Recent work on relationship-based access control has begun to show how it can
be applied to general computing systems, as opposed to simply being employed
for social networking applications. The use of relationships to determine
authorization policies enables more powerful policies to be defined than those
based solely on the commonly used concept of role membership. The
relationships, paths and principal matching (RPPM) model described here is a
formal access control model using relationships and a two-stage request
evaluation process. We make use of path conditions, which are similar to
regular expressions, to define policies. We then employ non-deterministic
finite automata to determine which policies are applicable to a request. The
power and robustness of the RPPM model allows us to include contextual
information in the authorization process (through the inclusion of logical
entities) and allows us to support desirable policy foundations such as
separation of duty and Chinese Wall. Additionally, the RPPM model naturally
supports a caching mechanism which has significant impact on request evaluation
performance.

 <dc:description>  Heisenberg-like and Fisher-information-based uncertainty relations which
extend and generalize previous similar expressions are obtained for $N$-fermion
$d$-dimensional systems. The contributions of both spatial and spin degrees of
freedom are taken into account. The accuracy of some of these generalized
spinned uncertainty-like relations is numerically examined for a large number
of atomic and molecular systems.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we define binary block codes over subsets of real algebras
obtained by the Cayley-Dickson process and we provide an algorithm to obtain
codes with a better rate. This algorithm offers more flexibility than other
methods known until now, similar to Lenstra algorithm on elliptic curves
compared with Pollard algorithm.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes SEPIA, a tool for automated proof generation in Coq.
SEPIA combines model inference with interactive theorem proving. Existing proof
corpora are modelled using state-based models inferred from tactic sequences.
These can then be traversed automatically to identify proofs. The SEPIA system
is described and its performance evaluated on three Coq datasets. Our results
show that SEPIA provides a useful complement to existing automated tactics in
Coq.

 <dc:description>  According to the World Economic Forum, the diffusion of unsubstantiated
rumors on online social media is one of the main threats for our society.
  The disintermediated paradigm of content production and consumption on online
social media might foster the formation of homophile communities
(echo-chambers) around specific worldviews. Such a scenario has been shown to
be a vivid environment for the diffusion of false claims, in particular with
respect to conspiracy theories. Not rarely, viral phenomena trigger naive (and
funny) social responses -- e.g., the recent case of Jade Helm 15 where a simple
military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of the civil war
in the US. In this work, we address the emotional dynamics of collective
debates around distinct kind of news -- i.e., science and conspiracy news --
and inside and across their respective polarized communities (science and
conspiracy news).
  Our findings show that comments on conspiracy posts tend to be more negative
than on science posts. However, the more the engagement of users, the more they
tend to negative commenting (both on science and conspiracy). Finally, zooming
in at the interaction among polarized communities, we find a general negative
pattern. As the number of comments increases -- i.e., the discussion becomes
longer -- the sentiment of the post is more and more negative.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address two optimisation problems arising in the context of
city logistics and two-level transportation systems. The two-echelon vehicle
routing problem and the two-echelon location routing problem seek to produce
vehicle itineraries to deliver goods to customers, with transits through
intermediate facilities. To efficiently solve these problems, we propose a
hybrid metaheuristic which combines enumerative local searches with
destroy-and-repair principles, as well as some tailored operators to optimise
the selections of intermediate facilities. We conduct extensive computational
experiments to investigate the contribution of these operators to the search
performance, and measure the performance of the method on both problem classes.
The proposed algorithm finds the current best known solutions, or better ones,
for 95% of the two-echelon vehicle routing problem benchmark instances.
Overall, for both problems, it achieves high-quality solutions within short
computing times. Finally, for future reference, we resolve inconsistencies
between different versions of benchmark instances, document their differences,
and provide them all online in a unified format.

improve the image processing capability of micro-computer system. This paper
studies the parallelism of the different stages of decimation in time radix 2
FFT algorithm, designs the butterfly and scramble kernels and implements 2D FFT
on GPU. The experiment result demonstrates the validity and advantage over
general CPU, especially in the condition of large input size. The approach can

 <dc:description>  Finite element method (FEM) is one of the most important numerical methods in
modern engineering design and analysis. Since traditional serial FEM is
difficult to solve large FE problems efficiently and accurately,
high-performance parallel FEM has become one of the essential way to solve
practical engineering problems. Based on MiniFE program, which is released by
National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center(NERSC), this work analyzes
concrete steps, key computing pattern and parallel mechanism of parallel FEM.
According to experimental results, this work analyzes the proportion of
calculation amount of each module and concludes the main performance bottleneck
of the program. Based on that, we optimize the MiniFE program on a server
platform. The optimization focuses on the bottleneck of the program - SpMV
kernel, and uses an efficient storage format named BCRS. Moreover, an improving
plan of hybrid MPI+OpenMP programming is provided. Experimental results show
that the optimized program performs better in both SpMV kernel and
synchronization. It can increase the performance of the program, on average, by
8.31%. Keywords : finite element, parallel, MiniFE, SpMV, performance

 <dc:title>On the Linear Extension Complexity of Regular n-gons</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose new lower and upper bounds on the linear extension
complexity of regular $n$-gons. Our bounds are based on the equivalence between
the computation of (i) an extended formulation of size $r$ of a polytope $P$,
and (ii) a rank-$r$ nonnegative factorization of a slack matrix of the polytope
$P$. The lower bound is based on an improved bound for the rectangle covering
number (also known as the boolean rank) of the slack matrix of the $n$-gons.
The upper bound is a slight improvement of the result of Fiorini, Rothvoss and
Tiwary [Extended Formulations for Polygons, Discrete Comput. Geom. 48(3), pp.
658-668, 2012]. The difference with their result is twofold: (i) our proof uses
a purely algebraic argument while Fiorini et al. used a geometric argument, and
(ii) we improve the base case allowing us to reduce their upper bound $2
\left\lceil \log_2(n) \right\rceil$ by one when $2^{k-1} &lt; n \leq
2^{k-1}+2^{k-2}$ for some integer $k$. We conjecture that this new upper bound
is tight, which is suggested by numerical experiments for small $n$. Moreover,
this improved upper bound allows us to close the gap with the best known lower
bound for certain regular $n$-gons (namely, $9 \leq n \leq 13$ and $21 \leq n
\leq 24$) hence allowing for the first time to determine their extension
complexity.

 <dc:title>The Number of Distinct Subpalindromes in Random Words</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We prove that a random word of length $n$ over a $k$-ary fixed alphabet
contains, on expectation, $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ distinct palindromic factors. We
study this number of factors, $E(n,k)$, in detail, showing that the limit
$\lim_{n\to\infty}E(n,k)/\sqrt{n}$ does not exist for any $k\ge2$,
$\liminf_{n\to\infty}E(n,k)/\sqrt{n}=\Theta(1)$, and
$\limsup_{n\to\infty}E(n,k)/\sqrt{n}=\Theta(\sqrt{k})$. Such a complicated
behaviour stems from the asymmetry between the palindromes of even and odd
length. We show that a similar, but much simpler, result on the expected number
of squares in random words holds. We also provide some experimental data on the
number of palindromic factors in random words.

 <dc:description>  General-purpose multiprocessors (as, in our case, Intel IvyBridge and Intel
Haswell) increasingly add GPU computing power to the former multicore
architectures. When used for embedded applications (for us, Synthetic aperture
radar) with intensive signal processing requirements, they must constantly
compute convolution algorithms, such as the famous Fast Fourier Transform. Due
to its &quot;fractal&quot; nature (the typical butterfly shape, with larger FFTs defined
as combination of smaller ones with auxiliary data array transpose functions),
one can hope to compute analytically the size of the largest FFT that can be
performed locally on an elementary GPU compute block. Then, the full
application must be organized around this given building block size. Now, due
to phenomena involved in the data transfers between various memory levels
across CPUs and GPUs, the optimality of such a scheme is only loosely
predictable (as communications tend to overcome in time the complexity of
computations). Therefore a mix of (theoretical) analytic approach and
(practical) runtime validation is here needed. As we shall illustrate, this
occurs at both stage, first at the level of deciding on a given elementary FFT
block size, then at the full application level.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of angle-robust joint transmit waveform and receive
filter design for colocated Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar, in the
presence of signal-dependent interferences. The design problem is cast as a
max-min optimization problem to maximize the worst-case output
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) with respect to the unknown
angle of the target of interest. Based on rank-one relaxation and semi-definite
programming (SDP) representation of a nonnegative trigonometric polynomial, a
cyclic optimization algorithm is proposed to tackle this problem. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical examples.

Theorem. It states that a graph is a point in some geometrical space, called
orbit space. Orbit spaces are well investigated and easier to explore than the
original graph space. We derive a number of geometrical results from the orbit
space representation, translate them to the graph space, and indicate their
significance and usefulness in statistical pattern recognition.

 <dc:title>Controllability of isotropic viscoelastic bodies of Maxwell-Boltzmann
  type</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pandolfi, Luciano</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider a viscoelastic three dimensional body (of
Maxwell-Boltzmann type) controlled on (part of) the boundary. We assume that
the material is isotropic and homogeneous. If the body is elastic (i.e. no
dissipation due to past memory), controllability has been studied by several
authors. We prove that the viscoelastic body inherits the controllability
properties of the corresponding purely elastic system. The proof relays on
cosine operator methods combined with moment theory.

 <dc:description>  We propose a technique for learning representations of parser states in
transition-based dependency parsers. Our primary innovation is a new control
structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks---the stack LSTM. Like the
conventional stack data structures used in transition-based parsing, elements
can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in
addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents.
This lets us formulate an efficient parsing model that captures three facets of
a parser's state: (i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words,
(ii) the complete history of actions taken by the parser, and (iii) the
complete contents of the stack of partially built tree fragments, including
their internal structures. Standard backpropagation techniques are used for
training and yield state-of-the-art parsing performance.

 <dc:description>  Learning to count is a learning strategy that has been recently proposed in
the literature for dealing with problems where estimating the number of object
instances in a scene is the final objective. In this framework, the task of
learning to detect and localize individual object instances is seen as a harder
task that can be evaded by casting the problem as that of computing a
regression value from hand-crafted image features. In this paper we explore the
features that are learned when training a counting convolutional neural network
in order to understand their underlying representation. To this end we define a
counting problem for MNIST data and show that the internal representation of
the network is able to classify digits in spite of the fact that no direct
supervision was provided for them during training. We also present preliminary
results about a deep network that is able to count the number of pedestrians in
a scene.

 <dc:title>An Analogy Based Method for Freight Forwarding Cost Estimation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Straight, Kevin A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The author explored estimation by analogy (EBA) as a means of estimating the
cost of international freight consignment. A version of the k-Nearest Neighbors
algorithm (k-NN) was tested by predicting job costs from a database of over
5000 actual jobs booked by an Irish freight forwarding firm over a seven year
period. The effect of a computer intensive training process on overall accuracy
of the method was found to be insignificant when the method was implemented
with four or fewer neighbors. Overall, the accuracy of the analogy based
method, while still significantly less accurate than manually working up
estimates, might be worthwhile to implement in practice, depending labor costs
in an adopting firm. A simulation model was used to compare manual versus
analytical estimation methods. The point of indifference occurs when it takes a
firm more than 1.5 worker hours to prepare a manual estimate (at current Irish
labor costs). Suggestions are given for future experiments to improve the
sampling policy of the method to improve accuracy and to improve overall
scalability.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a strategy for semi-supervised image classification
that leverages unsupervised representation learning and co-training. The
strategy, that is called CURL from Co-trained Unsupervised Representation
Learning, iteratively builds two classifiers on two different views of the
data. The two views correspond to different representations learned from both
labeled and unlabeled data and differ in the fusion scheme used to combine the
image features. To assess the performance of our proposal, we conducted several
experiments on widely used data sets for scene and object recognition. We
considered three scenarios (inductive, transductive and self-taught learning)
that differ in the strategy followed to exploit the unlabeled data. As image
features we considered a combination of GIST, PHOG, and LBP as well as features
extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network. Moreover, two embodiments of
CURL are investigated: one using Ensemble Projection as unsupervised
representation learning coupled with Logistic Regression, and one based on
LapSVM. The results show that CURL clearly outperforms other supervised and
semi-supervised learning methods in the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the possibility of deriving metric trace semantics in a
coalgebraic framework. First, we generalize a technique for systematically
lifting functors from the category Set of sets to the category PMet of
pseudometric spaces, showing under which conditions also natural
transformations, monads and distributive laws can be lifted. By exploiting some
recent work on an abstract determinization, these results enable the derivation
of trace metrics starting from coalgebras in Set. More precisely, for a
coalgebra on Set we determinize it, thus obtaining a coalgebra in the
Eilenberg-Moore category of a monad. When the monad can be lifted to PMet, we
can equip the final coalgebra with a behavioral distance. The trace distance
between two states of the original coalgebra is the distance between their
images in the determinized coalgebra through the unit of the monad. We show how
our framework applies to nondeterministic automata and probabilistic automata.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a blind deconvolution scheme based on statistical
wavelet estimation. We assume no prior knowledge of the wavelet, and do not
select a reflector from the signal. Instead, the wavelet (ultrasound pulse) is
statistically estimated from the signal itself by a kurtosis-based metric. This
wavelet is then used to deconvolve the RF (radiofrequency) signal through
Wiener filtering, and the resultant zero phase trace is subjected to spectral
broadening by Autoregressive Spectral Extrapolation (ASE). These steps increase
the time resolution of diffraction techniques. Results on synthetic and real
cases show the robustness of the proposed method.

 <dc:title>Blocked rank-revealing QR factorizations: How randomized sampling can be
  used to avoid single-vector pivoting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Martinsson, P. G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a matrix $A$ of size $m\times n$, the manuscript describes a algorithm
for computing a QR factorization $AP=QR$ where $P$ is a permutation matrix, $Q$
is orthonormal, and $R$ is upper triangular. The algorithm is blocked, to allow
it to be implemented efficiently. The need for single vector pivoting in
classical algorithms for computing QR factorizations is avoided by the use of
randomized sampling to find blocks of pivot vectors at once. The advantage of
blocking becomes particularly pronounced when $A$ is very large, and possibly
stored out-of-core, or on a distributed memory machine. The manuscript also
describes a generalization of the QR factorization that allows $P$ to be a
general orthonormal matrix. In this setting, one can at moderate cost compute a
\textit{rank-revealing} factorization where the mass of $R$ is concentrated to
the diagonal entries. Moreover, the diagonal entries of $R$ closely approximate
the singular values of $A$. The algorithms described have asymptotic flop count
$O(m\,n\,\min(m,n))$, just like classical deterministic methods. The scaling
constant is slightly higher than those of classical techniques, but this is
more than made up for by reduced communication and the ability to block the
computation.

 <dc:title>A Quasi-Random Approach to Matrix Spectral Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ben-Or, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Eldar, Lior</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Inspired by the quantum computing algorithms for Linear Algebra problems
[HHL,TaShma] we study how the simulation on a classical computer of this type
of &quot;Phase Estimation algorithms&quot; performs when we apply it to solve the
Eigen-Problem of Hermitian matrices. The result is a completely new, efficient
and stable, parallel algorithm to compute an approximate spectral decomposition
of any Hermitian matrix. The algorithm can be implemented by Boolean circuits
in $O(\log^2 n)$ parallel time with a total cost of $O(n^{\omega+1})$ Boolean
operations. This Boolean complexity matches the best known rigorous $O(\log^2
n)$ parallel time algorithms, but unlike those algorithms our algorithm is
(logarithmically) stable, so further improvements may lead to practical
implementations.
  All previous efficient and rigorous approaches to solve the Eigen-Problem use
randomization to avoid bad condition as we do too. Our algorithm makes further
use of randomization in a completely new way, taking random powers of a unitary
matrix to randomize the phases of its eigenvalues. Proving that a tiny Gaussian
perturbation and a random polynomial power are sufficient to ensure almost
pairwise independence of the phases $(\mod (2\pi))$ is the main technical
contribution of this work. This randomization enables us, given a Hermitian
matrix with well separated eigenvalues, to sample a random eigenvalue and
produce an approximate eigenvector in $O(\log^2 n)$ parallel time and
$O(n^\omega)$ Boolean complexity. We conjecture that further improvements of
our method can provide a stable solution to the full approximate spectral
decomposition problem with complexity similar to the complexity (up to a
logarithmic factor) of sampling a single eigenvector.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: Replacing previous version: parallel algorithm runs in total
  complexity $n^{\omega+1}$ and not $n^{\omega}$. However, the depth of the
  implementing circuit is $\log^2(n)$: hence comparable to fastest
  eigen-decomposition algorithms known</dc:description>

 <dc:title>Formation Stabilization with Collision Avoidance of Complex Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sarkar, Soumic</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kar, Indra Narayan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Two different aspects of formation control of multiple agents subjected to
linear transformation have been addressed in this paper. We consider a set of
complex single integrator systems so that the dimension of the system reduces
to half as opposed to the vector representation in Cartesian coordinate system.
We first design a stable formation controller in an attempt to solve the
formation control turned to stabilization problem and then find a collision
avoidance controller in the transformed domain, respectively. Different linear
transformations are used to facilitate the formation control task in a
different way. For example Jacobi transformation is used to separate the shape
control and trajectory control. The inverse of the transformation must have
nonzero eigenvalues with both positive and negative real parts which may lead
the system to instability. If the inverse of the transformation appears in
closed loop then a diagonal stabilizing matrix is required to reassign the
eigenvalues of the inverse of transformation in the right half of complex
plane. The algorithm to find such stabilizing matrix is provided. We then
define a matrix of potential in the actual domain which is the stepping stone
to find a matrix of potential in the transformed domain. Thus collision
avoidance controller can be designed directly in the transformed domain. The
mathematical proof is given that both the actual and transformed system behaves
identically. Simulation results are provided to support our claim.

 <dc:description>  The growth of Chinese Interpreting Studies (CIS) has been robust over the
past two decades; this is reflected in the total number of research papers
produced. This paper takes a scientometric approach to assessing the
production, themes and theoretical influences of those papers over time. The
most productive authors, universities, and regions, as well as patterns of
research collaboration, were analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the CIS
landscape. This study reveals that the general culture of the discipline
remained constant throughout the period, none of its theoretical influences or
topics having gained significantly in popularity. However, certain limitations
in the way research is conducted (lack of collaboration, inadequate academic
policies, etc.) hinder its potential for future growth.

implementing computational interpreting of natural language aiming to model the
meanings of words and phrases. Unlike other approaches, we attempt to define
the meanings of text fragments in a composable and computer interpretable way.
We discuss models and ideas for detecting different types of semantic
incomprehension and choosing the interpretation that makes most sense in a
given context. Knowledge representation is designed for handling
context-sensitive and uncertain / imprecise knowledge, and for easy
accommodation of new information. It stores quantitative information capturing
the essence of the concepts, because it is crucial for working with natural
language understanding and reasoning. Still, the representation is general
enough to allow for new knowledge to be learned, and even generated by the
system. The article concludes by discussing some reasoning-related topics:
possible approaches to generation of new abstract concepts, and describing
situations and concepts in words (e.g. for specifying interpretation
difficulties).

 <dc:description>  In large databases, creating user interface for browsing or performing
insertion, deletion or modification of data is very costly in terms of
programming. In addition, each modification of an access control policy causes
many potential and unpredictable side effects which cause rule conflicts or
security breaches that affect the corresponding user interfaces as well. While
changes to access control policies in databases are inevitable, having a
dynamic system that generates interface according to the latest access control
policies become increasingly valuable. Lack of such a system leads to
unauthorized access to data and eventually violates the privacy of data owners.
In this work, we discuss a dynamic interface that applies Role Based Access
Control (RBAC) policies as the output of policy analysis and limits the amount
of information that users have access according to the policies defined for
roles. This interface also shows security administrators the effect of their
changes from the user's point of view while minimizing the cost by generating
the interface automatically.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Similarity search in math is to find mathematical expressions that are
similar to a user's query. We conceptualized the similarity factors between
mathematical expressions, and proposed an approach to math similarity search
(MSS) by defining metrics based on those similarity factors [11]. Our
preliminary implementation indicated the advantage of MSS compared to
non-similarity based search. In order to more effectively and efficiently
search similar math expressions, MSS is further optimized. This paper focuses
on performance evaluation and optimization of MSS. Our results show that the
proposed optimization process significantly improved the performance of MSS
with respect to both relevance ranking and recall.

 <dc:description>  A mass of traces of human activities show rich dynamic patterns. In this
article, we comprehensively investigate the dynamic patterns of 50 thousands of
researchers' activities in Sciencenet, the largest multi-disciplinary academic
community in China. Through statistical analyses, we found that (i) there
exists a power-law scaling between the frequency of visits to an academic forum
and the number of corresponding visitors, with the exponent being about 1.33;
(ii) the expansion process of academic forums obeys the Heaps' law, namely the
number of distinct visited forums to the number of visits grows in a power-law
form with exponent being about 0.54; (iii) the probability distributions of
time intervals and the number of visits taken to revisit the same academic
forum both follow power-laws, indicating the existence of memory effect in
academic forum activities. On the basis of these empirical results, we propose
a dynamic model that incorporates the exploration, preferential return and
memory effect, which can well reproduce the observed scaling laws.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by quite recent research involving the relationship between the
dimension of a poset and graph-theoretic properties of its cover graph, we show
that for every $d\geq 1$, if $P$ is a poset and the dimension of a subposet $B$
of $P$ is at most $d$ whenever the cover graph of $B$ is a block of the cover
graph of $P$, then the dimension of $P$ is at most $d+2$. We also construct
examples which show that this inequality is best possible. We consider the
proof of the upper bound to be fairly elegant and relatively compact. However,
we know of no simple proof for the lower bound, and our argument requires a
powerful tool known as the Product Ramsey Theorem. As a consequence, our
constructions involve posets of enormous size.

 <dc:title>A Security-assured Accuracy-maximised Privacy Preserving Collaborative
  Filtering Recommendation Algorithm</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The neighbourhood-based Collaborative Filtering is a widely used method in
recommender systems. However, the risks of revealing customers' privacy during
the process of filtering have attracted noticeable public concern recently.
Specifically, $k$NN attack discloses the target user's sensitive information by
creating $k$ fake nearest neighbours by non-sensitive information. Among the
current solutions against $k$NN attack, the probabilistic methods showed a
powerful privacy preserving effect. However, the existing probabilistic methods
neither guarantee enough prediction accuracy due to the global randomness, nor
provide assured security enforcement against $k$NN attack. To overcome the
problems of current probabilistic methods, we propose a novel approach,
Partitioned Probabilistic Neighbour Selection, to ensure a required security
guarantee while achieving the optimal prediction accuracy against $k$NN attack.
In this paper, we define the sum of $k$ neighbours' similarity as the accuracy
metric $\alpha$, the number of user partitions, across which we select the $k$
neighbours, as the security metric $\beta$. Differing from the present methods
that globally selected neighbours, our method selects neighbours from each
group with exponential differential privacy to decrease the magnitude of noise.
Theoretical and experimental analysis show that to achieve the same security
guarantee against $k$NN attack, our approach ensures the optimal prediction
accuracy.

 <dc:title>The Application of Non-Cooperative Stackelberg Game Theory in Behavioral
  Science: Social Optimality with any Number of Players</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Smith, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Here we present a ground-breaking new postulate for game theory. The first
part of this postulate contains the axiomatic observation that all games are
created by a designer, whether they are: e.g., (dynamic/static) or
(stationary/non-stationary) or (sequential/one-shot) non-cooperative games, and
importantly, whether or not they are intended to represent a non-cooperative
Stackelberg game, they can be mapped to a Stackelberg game. I.e., the game
designer is the leader who is totally rational and honest, and the followers
are mapped to the players of the designed game. If now the game designer, or
&quot;the leader&quot; in the Stackelberg context, adopts a pure strategy, we postulate
the following second part following from axiomatic observation of ultimate game
leadership, where empirical insight leads to the second part of this postulate.
Importantly, implementing a non-cooperative Stackelberg game, with a very
honest and rational leader results in social optimality for all players
(followers), assuming pure strategy across all followers and leader, and that
the leader is totally rational, honest, and is able to achieve a minimum amount
of competency in leading this game, with any finite number of iterations of
leading this finite game.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image
captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model
produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series
prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must
learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating
natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand
both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models
that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes.
Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state
that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window.
Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train,
and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network
architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled
successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on
long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have
demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image
captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey,
we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first
yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When
appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to
provide a self-contained explication of the state of the art together with a
historical perspective and references to primary research.

 <dc:description>  From network topologies to online social networks, many of today's most
sensitive datasets are captured in large graphs. A significant challenge facing
owners of these datasets is how to share sensitive graphs with collaborators
and authorized users, e.g. network topologies with network equipment vendors or
Facebook's social graphs with academic collaborators. Current tools can provide
limited node or edge privacy, but require modifications to the graph that
significantly reduce its utility.
  In this work, we propose a new alternative in the form of graph watermarks.
Graph watermarks are small graphs tailor-made for a given graph dataset, a
secure graph key, and a secure user key. To share a sensitive graph G with a
collaborator C, the owner generates a watermark graph W using G, the graph key,
and C's key as input, and embeds W into G to form G'. If G' is leaked by C,its
owner can reliably determine if the watermark W generated for C does in fact
reside inside G', thereby proving C is responsible for the leak. Graph
watermarks serve both as a deterrent against data leakage and a method of
recourse after a leak. We provide robust schemes for creating, embedding and
extracting watermarks, and use analysis and experiments on large, real graphs
to show that they are unique and difficult to forge. We study the robustness of
graph watermarks against both single and powerful colluding attacker models,
then propose and empirically evaluate mechanisms to dramatically improve
resilience.

 <dc:title>An Analysis of the Matching Hypothesis in Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The matching hypothesis in social psychology claims that people are more
likely to form a committed relationship with someone equally attractive.
Previous works on stochastic models of human mate choice process indicate that
patterns supporting the matching hypothesis could occur even when similarity is
not the primary consideration in seeking partners. Yet, most if not all of
these works concentrate on fully-connected systems. Here we extend the analysis
to networks. Our results indicate that the correlation of the couple's
attractiveness grows monotonically with the increased average degree and
decreased degree diversity of the network. This correlation is lower in sparse
networks than in fully-connected systems, because in the former less attractive
individuals who find partners are likely to be coupled with ones who are more
attractive than them. The chance of failing to be matched decreases
exponentially with both the attractiveness and the degree. The matching
hypothesis may not hold when the degree-attractiveness correlation is present,
which can give rise to negative attractiveness correlation. Finally, we find
that the ratio between the number of matched couples and the size of the
maximum matching varies non-monotonically with the average degree of the
network. Our results reveal the role of network topology in the process of
human mate choice and bring insights into future investigations of different
matching processes in networks.

 <dc:description>  We study bracketing numbers for spaces of bounded convex functions in the
$L_p$ norms. We impose no Lipschitz constraint. Previous results gave bounds
when the domain of the functions is a hyperrectangle. We extend these results
to the case wherein the domain is a polytope. Bracketing numbers are crucial
quantities for understanding asymptotic behavior for many statistical
nonparametric estimators. Our results are of interest in particular in many
multidimensional estimation problems based on convexity shape constraints.

 <dc:description>  For centuries quality of life was a subject of studies across different
disciplines. However, only with the emergence of a digital era, it became
possible to investigate this topic on a larger scale. Over time it became clear
that quality of life not only depends on one, but on three relatively different
parameters: social, economic and well-being measures. In this study we focus
only on the first two, since the last one is often very subjective and
consequently hard to measure. Using a complete set of bank card transactions
recorded by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) during 2011 in Spain, we
first create a feature space by defining various meaningful characteristics of
a particular area performance through activity of its businesses, residents and
visitors. We then evaluate those quantities by considering available official
statistics for Spanish provinces (e.g., housing prices, unemployment rate, life
expectancy) and investigate whether they can be predicted based on our feature
space. For the purpose of prediction, our study proposes a supervised machine
learning approach. Our finding is that there is a clear correlation between
individual spending behavior and official socioeconomic indexes denoting
quality of life. Moreover, we believe that this modus operandi is useful to
understand, predict and analyze the impact of human activity on the wellness of
our society on scales for which there is no consistent official statistics
available (e.g., cities and towns, districts or smaller neighborhoods).

 <dc:description>  This paper reports on the comparison of the subject and object of verbs in
their usage between phishing emails and legitimate emails. The purpose of this
research is to explore whether the syntactic structures and subjects and
objects of verbs can be distinguishable features for phishing detection. To
achieve the objective, we have conducted two series of experiments: the
syntactic similarity for sentences, and the subject and object of verb
comparison. The results of the experiments indicated that both features can be
used for some verbs, but more work has to be done for others.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a higher level representation for videos aiming at video
genre retrieval. In video genre retrieval, there is a challenge that videos may
comprise multiple categories, for instance, news videos may be composed of
sports, documentary, and action. Therefore, it is interesting to encode the
distribution of such genres in a compact and effective manner. We propose to
create a visual dictionary using a genre classifier. Each visual word in the
proposed model corresponds to a region in the classification space determined
by the classifier's model learned on the training frames. Therefore, the video
feature vector contains a summary of the activations of each genre in its
contents. We evaluate the bag-of-genres model for video genre retrieval, using
the dataset of MediaEval Tagging Task of 2012. Results show that the proposed
model increases the quality of the representation being more compact than
existing features.

 <dc:description>  Nonconvex optimization problems such as the ones in training deep neural
networks suffer from a phenomenon called saddle point proliferation. This means
that there are a vast number of high error saddle points present in the loss
function. Second order methods have been tremendously successful and widely
adopted in the convex optimization community, while their usefulness in deep
learning remains limited. This is due to two problems: computational complexity
and the methods being driven towards the high error saddle points. We introduce
a novel algorithm specially designed to solve these two issues, providing a
crucial first step to take the widely known advantages of Newton's method to
the nonconvex optimization community, especially in high dimensional settings.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a SLaT (Smoothing, Lifting and Thresholding) method
with three stages for multiphase segmentation of color images corrupted by
different degradations: noise, information loss, and blur. At the first stage,
a convex variant of the Mumford-Shah model is applied to each channel to obtain
a smooth image. We show that the model has unique solution under the different
degradations. In order to properly handle the color information, the second
stage is dimension lifting where we consider a new vector-valued image composed
of the restored image and its transform in the secondary color space with
additional information. This ensures that even if the first color space has
highly correlated channels, we can still have enough information to give good
segmentation results. In the last stage, we apply multichannel thresholding to
the combined vector-valued image to find the segmentation. The number of phases
is only required in the last stage, so users can choose or change it all
without the need of solving the previous stages again. Experiments demonstrate
that our SLaT method gives excellent results in terms of segmentation quality
and CPU time in comparison with other state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a generalized longest common subsequence problem,
in which a constraining sequence of length $s$ must be included as a substring
and the other constraining sequence of length $t$ must be excluded as a
subsequence of two main sequences and the length of the result must be maximal.
For the two input sequences $X$ and $Y$ of lengths $n$ and $m$, and the given
two constraining sequences of length $s$ and $t$, we present an $O(nmst)$ time
dynamic programming algorithm for solving the new generalized longest common
subsequence problem. The time complexity can be reduced further to cubic time
in a more detailed analysis. The correctness of the new algorithm is proved.

 <dc:description>  Widely-deployed encryption-based security prevents unauthorized decoding, but
does not ensure undetectability of communication. However, covert, or low
probability of detection/intercept (LPD/LPI) communication is crucial in many
scenarios ranging from covert military operations and the organization of
social unrest, to privacy protection for users of wireless networks. In
addition, encrypted data or even just the transmission of a signal can arouse
suspicion, and even the most theoretically robust encryption can often be
defeated by a determined adversary using non-computational methods such as
side-channel analysis. Various covert communication techniques were developed
to address these concerns, including steganography for finite-alphabet
noiseless applications and spread-spectrum systems for wireless communications.
After reviewing these covert communication systems, this article discusses new
results on the fundamental limits of their capabilities, as well as provides a
vision for the future of such systems.

 <dc:description>  Autostackability for finitely presented groups is a topological property of
the Cayley graph combined with formal language theoretic restrictions, that
implies solvability of the word problem. The class of autostackable groups is
known to include all asynchronously automatic groups with respect to a
prefix-closed normal form set, and all groups admitting finite complete
rewriting systems. Although groups in the latter two classes all satisfy the
homological finiteness condition $FP_\infty$, we show that the class of
autostackable groups includes a group that is not of type $FP_3$. We also show
that the class of autostackable groups is closed under graph products and
extensions.

 <dc:description>  Motivation: The consistent amount of different types of omics data requires
novel methods of analysis and data integration. In this work we describe
Regression2Net, a computational approach to analyse gene expression and
methylation profiles via regression analysis and network-based techniques.
  Results: We identified 284 and 447 unique candidate genes potentially
associated to the Glioblastoma pathology from two networks inferred from mixed
genetic datasets. In-depth biological analysis of these networks reveals genes
that are related to energy metabolism, cell cycle control (AATF), immune system
response and several types of cancer. Importantly, we observed significant
over- representation of cancer related pathways including glioma especially in
the methylation network. This confirms the strong link between methylation and
glioblastomas. Potential glioma suppressor genes ACCN3 and ACCN4 linked to
NBPF1 neuroblastoma breakpoint family have been identified in our expression
network. Numerous ABC transporter genes (ABCA1, ABCB1) present in the
expression network suggest drug resistance of glioblastoma tumors.

 <dc:description>  In the standard Random Surfer Model, the teleportation matrix is necessary to
ensure that the final PageRank vector is well-defined. The introduction of this
matrix, however, results in serious problems and imposes fundamental
limitations to the quality of the ranking vectors. In this work, building on
the recently proposed NCDawareRank framework, we exploit the decomposition of
the underlying space into blocks, and we derive easy to check necessary and
sufficient conditions for random surfing without teleportation.

 <dc:description>  It is well-known that the problem of recognizing an ESS in a symmetric
bimatrix game is coNP-complete. In this paper, we show that recognizing an ESS
even in doubly symmetric bimatrix games is also coNP-complete. Our result
further implies that recognizing asymptotically stable equilibria of the
replicator dynamic in this class of games is also a coNP-complete problem.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: I am withdrawing the claim that NP = coNP. The community working on
  the hardness of nonlinear optimization problems uses the term &quot;NP-hard&quot; to
  mean hardness under Turing (rather than Karp) reductions and does not
  distinguish between &quot;NP-hard&quot; and &quot;coNP-hard&quot; problems. Therefore, my proof
  that NP = coNP has a flaw in its argument. The rest of the results are
  correct though</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  The fusion techniques that utilize multiple feature sets to form new features
that are often more robust and contain useful information for future processing
are referred to as feature fusion. The term data fusion is applied to the class
of techniques used for combining decisions obtained from multiple feature sets

 <dc:description>  Clustering problems are considered amongst the prominent challenges in
statistics and computational science. Clustering of nodes in wireless sensor
networks which is used to prolong the life-time of networks is one of the
difficult tasks of clustering procedure. In order to perform nodes clustering,
a number of nodes are determined as cluster heads and other ones are joined to
one of these heads, based on different criteria e.g. Euclidean distance. So
far, different approaches have been proposed for this process, where swarm and
evolutionary algorithms contribute in this regard. In this study, a novel
algorithm is proposed based on Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) for
clustering procedure. In the proposed method, the performance of the standard
AFSA is improved by increasing balance between local and global searches.
Furthermore, a new mechanism has been added to the base algorithm for improving
convergence speed in clustering problems. Performance of the proposed technique
is compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques in this field and the
outcomes indicate the supremacy of the proposed technique.

 <dc:title>Discovering similar Twitter accounts using semantics</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  On daily basis, millions of Twitter accounts post a vast number of tweets
including numerous Twitter entities (mentions, replies, hashtags, photos,
URLs). Many of these entities are used in common by many accounts. The more
common entities are found in the messages of two different accounts, the more
similar, in terms of content or interest, they tend to be. Towards this
direction, we introduce a methodology for discovering and suggesting similar
Twitter accounts, based entirely on their disseminated content in terms of
Twitter entities used. The methodology is based exclusively on semantic
representation protocols and related technologies. An ontological schema is
also described towards the semantification of the Twitter accounts and their
entities.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel method for the reconstruction of a neural network
connectivity using calcium fluorescence data. We introduce a fast unsupervised
method to integrate different networks that reconstructs structural
connectivity from neuron activity. Our method improves the state-of-the-art
reconstruction method General Transfer Entropy (GTE). We are able to better
eliminate indirect links, improving therefore the quality of the network via a
normalization and ensemble process of GTE and three new informative features.
The approach is based on a simple combination of networks, which is remarkably
fast. The performance of our approach is benchmarked on simulated time series
provided at the connectomics challenge and also submitted at the public
competition.

 <dc:description>  The efficient and effective monitoring of mobile networks is vital given the
number of users who rely on such networks and the importance of those networks.
The purpose of this paper is to present a monitoring scheme for mobile networks
based on the use of rules and decision tree data mining classifiers to upgrade
fault detection and handling. The goal is to have optimisation rules that
improve anomaly detection. In addition, a monitoring scheme that relies on
Bayesian classifiers was also implemented for the purpose of fault isolation
and localisation. The data mining techniques described in this paper are
intended to allow a system to be trained to actually learn network fault rules.
The results of the tests that were conducted allowed for the conclusion that
the rules were highly effective to improve network troubleshooting.

 <dc:description>  One important application of the Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) is target
tracking, the aim of this application is converging to an event or object in an
area. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient distributed sensor
activation protocol based on predicted location technique, called Intelligent
Distributed Sensor Activation Algorithm (IDSA). The proposed algorithm predicts
the location of target in the next time interval, by analyzing current location
and movement history of the target, this prediction is done by computational
intelligence. The fewest essential number of sensor nodes within the predicted
location will be activated to cover the target. The results show that the
proposed method outperforms the existing methods such as Na\&quot;ive and DSA in
terms of energy consumption and the number of nodes that was involved in
tracking the target.

 <dc:description>  The Web Geometry Laboratory, (WGL), is a blended-learning, collaborative and
adaptive, Web environment for geometry. It integrates a well known dynamic
geometry system. In a collaborative session, exchange of geometrical and
textual information between the user engaged in the session is possible. In a
normal work session (stand-alone mode), all the geometric steps done by the
students are recorded, alongside the navigation information, allowing, in a
latter stage, their teachers to &quot;play back&quot; the students sessions, using that
info to assert the students level and adjust the teaching strategies to each
individual student. Teachers can register and begin using one of the public
servers, defining students, preparing materials to be released to the students,
open collaborative sessions, etc. Using an action research methodology the WGL
system is being developed, validated through case-studies, and further
improved, in a cycle where the implementation steps are intertwined with case
studies.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, the size of the Internet is experiencing rapid growth. As of
December 2014, the number of global Internet websites has more than 1 billion
and all kinds of information resources are integrated together on the Internet,
however,the search engine is to be a necessary tool for all users to retrieve
useful information from vast amounts of web data. Generally speaking, a
complete search engine includes the crawler system, index building systems,
sorting systems and retrieval system. At present there are many open source
implementation of search engine, such as lucene, solr, katta, elasticsearch,
solandra and so on. The crawler system and sorting system is indispensable for
any kind of search engine and in order to guarantee its efficiency, the former
needs to update crawled vast amounts of data and the latter requires real-time
to build index on newly crawled web pages and calculae its corresponding
PageRank value. It is unlikely to accomplish such huge computation tasks
depending on a single hardware implementation of the crawler system and sorting
system,from which aspect, the distributed cluster technology is brought to the
front. In this paper, we use the hadoop Map - Reduce computing framework to
implement a distributed crawler system, and use the GraphLite, a distributed
synchronous graph-computing framework, to achieve the real-time computation in
getting the PageRank value of the new crawled web page.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a basis of rational polynomial-like functions
$P_0,\ldots,P_{n-1}$ for the free module of functions $Z/nZ\to Z/mZ$. We then
characterize the subfamily of congruence preserving functions as the set of
linear combinations of the functions $lcm(k)\,P_k$ where $lcm(k)$ is the least
common multiple of $2,\ldots,k$ (viewed in $Z/mZ$). As a consequence, when
$n\geq m$, the number of such functions is independent of $n$.

 <dc:description>  Team performance is a ubiquitous area of inquiry in the social sciences, and
it motivates the problem of team selection -- choosing the members of a team
for maximum performance. Influential work of Hong and Page has argued that
testing individuals in isolation and then assembling the highest-scoring ones
into a team is not an effective method for team selection. For a broad class of
performance measures, based on the expected maximum of random variables
representing individual candidates, we show that tests directly measuring
individual performance are indeed ineffective, but that a more subtle family of
tests used in isolation can provide a constant-factor approximation for team
performance. These new tests measure the 'potential' of individuals, in a
precise sense, rather than performance; to our knowledge they represent the
first time that individual tests have been shown to produce near-optimal teams
for a non-trivial team performance measure. We also show families of
subdmodular and supermodular team performance functions for which no test
applied to individuals can produce near-optimal teams, and discuss implications
for submodular maximization via hill-climbing.

 <dc:title>Resolvability in E{\gamma} with Applications to Lossy Compression and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the amount of randomness needed for an input process to approximate
a given output distribution of a channel in the $E_{\gamma}$ distance. A
general one-shot achievability bound for the precision of such an approximation
is developed. In the i.i.d.~setting where $\gamma=\exp(nE)$, a (nonnegative)
randomness rate above $\inf_{Q_{\sf U}: D(Q_{\sf X}||\pi_{\sf X})\le E}
\{D(Q_{\sf X}||\pi_{\sf X})+I(Q_{\sf U},Q_{\sf X|U})-E\}$ is necessary and
sufficient to asymptotically approximate the output distribution $\pi_{\sf
X}^{\otimes n}$ using the channel $Q_{\sf X|U}^{\otimes n}$, where $Q_{\sf
U}\to Q_{\sf X|U}\to Q_{\sf X}$. The new resolvability result is then used to
derive a one-shot upper bound on the error probability in the rate distortion
problem, and a lower bound on the size of the eavesdropper list to include the
actual message in the wiretap channel problem. Both bounds are asymptotically
tight in i.i.d.~settings.

 <dc:title>Labeled compression schemes for extremal classes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  It is a long-standing open problem whether there always exists a compression
scheme whose size is of the order of the Vapnik-Chervonienkis (VC) dimension
$d$. Recently compression schemes of size exponential in $d$ have been found
for any concept class of VC dimension $d$. Previously, compression schemes of
size $d$ have been given for maximum classes, which are special concept classes
whose size equals an upper bound due to Sauer-Shelah. We consider a
generalization of maximum classes called extremal classes. Their definition is
based on a powerful generalization of the Sauer-Shelah bound called the
Sandwich Theorem, which has been studied in several areas of combinatorics and
computer science. The key result of the paper is a construction of a sample
compression scheme for extremal classes of size equal to their VC dimension. We
also give a number of open problems concerning the combinatorial structure of
extremal classes and the existence of unlabeled compression schemes for them.

 <dc:title>Using curvature to distinguish between surface reflections and vessel
  contents in computer vision based recognition of materials in transparent
  vessels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eppel, Sagi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The recognition of materials and objects inside transparent containers using
computer vision has a wide range of applications, ranging from industrial
bottles filling to the automation of chemistry laboratory. One of the main
challenges in such recognition is the ability to distinguish between image
features resulting from the vessels surface and image features resulting from
the material inside the vessel. Reflections and the functional parts of a
vessels surface can create strong edges that can be mistakenly identified as
corresponding to the vessel contents, and cause recognition errors. The ability
to evaluate whether a specific edge in an image stems from the vessels surface
or from its contents can considerably improve the ability to identify materials
inside transparent vessels. This work will suggest a method for such
evaluation, based on the following two assumptions: 1) Areas of high curvature
on the vessel surface are likely to cause strong edges due to changes in
reflectivity, as is the appearance of functional parts (e.g. corks or valves).
2) Most transparent vessels (bottles, glasses) have high symmetry
(cylindrical). As a result the curvature angle of the vessels surface at each
point of the image is similar to the curvature angle of the contour line of the
vessel in the same row in the image. These assumptions, allow the
identification of image regions with strong edges corresponding to the vessel
surface reflections. Combining this method with existing image analysis methods
for detecting materials inside transparent containers allows considerable
improvement in accuracy.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an open source tool for testing the recognition accuracy
of Chinese handwriting input methods. The tool consists of two modules, namely
the PC and Android mobile client. The PC client reads handwritten samples in
the computer, and transfers them individually to the Android client in
accordance with the socket communication protocol. After the Android client
receives the data, it simulates the handwriting on screen of client device, and
triggers the corresponding handwriting recognition method. The recognition
accuracy is recorded by the Android client. We present the design principles
and describe the implementation of the test platform. We construct several test
datasets for evaluating different handwriting recognition systems, and conduct
an objective and comprehensive test using six Chinese handwriting input methods
with five datasets. The test results for the recognition accuracy are then
compared and analyzed.

classification of YouTube videos in order to predict the evolution of videos'
view-count. This classification allows to identify important factors of the

 <dc:title>A Deterministic Analysis of Decimation for Sigma-Delta Quantization of

 <dc:creator>Daubechies, Ingrid</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Saab, Rayan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study Sigma-Delta ($\Sigma\Delta$) quantization of oversampled bandlimited
functions. We prove that digitally integrating blocks of bits and then
down-sampling, a process known as decimation, can efficiently encode the
associated $\Sigma\Delta$ bit-stream. It allows a large reduction in the
bit-rate while still permitting good approximation of the underlying
bandlimited function via an appropriate reconstruction kernel. Specifically, in
the case of stable $r$th order $\Sigma\Delta$ schemes we show that the
reconstruction error decays exponentially in the bit-rate. For example, this
result applies to the 1-bit, greedy, first-order $\Sigma\Delta$ scheme.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Timing and cache side channels provide powerful attacks against many
sensitive operations including cryptographic implementations. Existing defenses
cannot protect against all classes of such attacks without incurring
prohibitive performance overhead. A popular strategy for defending against all
classes of these attacks is to modify the implementation so that the timing and
cache access patterns of every hardware instruction is independent of the
secret inputs. However, this solution is architecture-specific, brittle, and
difficult to get right. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a robust
low-overhead technique for mitigating timing and cache channels. Our solution
requires only minimal source code changes and works across multiple
languages/platforms. We report the experimental results of applying our
solution to protect several C, C++, and Java programs. Our results demonstrate
that our solution successfully eliminates the timing and cache side-channel
leaks while incurring significantly lower performance overhead than existing
approaches.

 <dc:title>Hamiltonian Cycles in Linear-Convex Supergrid Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A supergrid graph is a finite induced subgraph of the infinite graph
associated with the two-dimensional supergrid. The supergrid graphs contain
grid graphs and triangular grid graphs as subgraphs. The Hamiltonian cycle
problem for grid and triangular grid graphs was known to be NP-complete. In the
past, we have shown that the Hamiltonian cycle problem for supergrid graphs is
also NP-complete. The Hamiltonian cycle problem on supergrid graphs can be
applied to control the stitching trace of computerized sewing machines. In this
paper, we will study the Hamiltonian cycle property of linear-convex supergrid
graphs which form a subclass of supergrid graphs. A connected graph is called
$k$-connected if there are $k$ vertex-disjoint paths between every pair of
vertices, and is called locally connected if the neighbors of each vertex in it
form a connected subgraph. In this paper, we first show that any 2-connected,
linear-convex supergrid graph is locally connected. We then prove that any
2-connected, linear-convex supergrid graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of generating correlated random variables in a
distributed fashion, where communication is constrained to a cascade network.
The first node in the cascade observes an i.i.d. sequence $X^n$ locally before
initiating communication along the cascade. All nodes share bits of common
randomness that are independent of $X^n$. We consider secure synthesis - random
variables produced by the system appear to be appropriately correlated and
i.i.d. even to an eavesdropper who is cognizant of the communication
transmissions. We characterize the optimal tradeoff between the amount of
common randomness used and the required rates of communication. We find that
not only does common randomness help, its usage exceeds the communication rate
requirements. The most efficient scheme is based on a superposition codebook,
with the first node selecting messages for all downstream nodes. We also
provide a fleeting view of related problems, demonstrating how the optimal rate
region may shrink or expand.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular for the
task of language understanding. In this task, a semantic tagger is deployed to
associate a semantic label to each word in an input sequence. The success of
RNN may be attributed to its ability to memorize long-term dependence that
relates the current-time semantic label prediction to the observations many
time instances away. However, the memory capacity of simple RNNs is limited
because of the gradient vanishing and exploding problem. We propose to use an
external memory to improve memorization capability of RNNs. We conducted
experiments on the ATIS dataset, and observed that the proposed model was able
to achieve the state-of-the-art results. We compare our proposed model with
alternative models and report analysis results that may provide insights for
future research.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sequence-to-sequence translation methods based on generation with a
side-conditioned language model have recently shown promising results in
several tasks. In machine translation, models conditioned on source side words
have been used to produce target-language text, and in image captioning, models
conditioned images have been used to generate caption text. Past work with this
approach has focused on large vocabulary tasks, and measured quality in terms
of BLEU. In this paper, we explore the applicability of such models to the
qualitatively different grapheme-to-phoneme task. Here, the input and output
side vocabularies are small, plain n-gram models do well, and credit is only
given when the output is exactly correct. We find that the simple
side-conditioned generation approach is able to rival the state-of-the-art, and
we are able to significantly advance the stat-of-the-art with bi-directional
long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks that use the same alignment
information that is used in conventional approaches.

 <dc:description>  The current formulation of the optimal scheduling of appliance energy
consumption uses as optimization variables the vectors of appliances' scheduled
energy consumption over equally-divided time slots of a day, which does not
take into account the atomicity of appliances' operations (i.e., the
unsplittable nature of appliances' operations and resulting energy
consumption). In this paper, we provide a new formulation of atomic scheduling
of energy consumption based on the optimal routing framework; the flow
configurations of users over multiple paths between the common source and
destination nodes of a ring network are used as optimization variables, which
indicate the starting times of scheduled energy consumption, and optimal
scheduling problems are now formulated in terms of the user flow
configurations. Because the atomic optimal scheduling results in a
Boolean-convex problem for a convex objective function, we propose a successive
convex relaxation technique for efficient calculation of an approximate
solution, where we iteratively drop fractional-valued elements and apply convex
relaxation to the resulting problem until we find a feasible suboptimal
solution. Numerical results for the cost and peak-to-average ratio minimization
problems demonstrate that the successive convex relaxation technique can
provide solutions close to, often identical to, global optimal solutions.

 <dc:description>  Interconnection networks of parallel systems are used for servicing traf- fic
generated by different applications, often belonging to different users. When
multiple traffic flows contend for channel bandwidth, the scheduling algorithm
regulating the access to that channel plays a key role in ensur- ing that each
flow obtains the required quality of service. Fairness is a highly desirable
property for a scheduling algorithm. We show that using the Relative Fairness
Bound as a fairness measure may lead to decrease in throughput and increase in
latency. We propose an alternative metric to evaluate the fairness and avoid
the drawback of Relative Fairness Bound.

 <dc:description>  Consider an energy-harvesting receiver that uses the same received signal
both for decoding information and for harvesting energy, which is employed to
power its circuitry. In the scenario where the receiver has limited battery
size, a signal with bursty energy content may cause power outage at the
receiver since the battery will drain during intervals with low signal energy.
In this paper, we consider a discrete memoryless channel and characterize
achievable information rates when the energy content in each codeword is
regularized by ensuring that sufficient energy is carried within every subblock
duration. In particular, we study constant subblock-composition codes (CSCCs)
where all subblocks in every codeword have the same fixed composition, and this
subblock-composition is chosen to maximize the rate of information transfer
while meeting the energy requirement. Compared to constant composition codes
(CCCs), we show that CSCCs incur a rate loss and that the error exponent for
CSCCs is also related to the error exponent for CCCs by the same rate loss
term. We show that CSCC capacity can be improved by allowing different
subblocks to have different composition while still meeting the subblock energy
constraint. We provide numerical examples highlighting the tradeoff between
delivery of sufficient energy to the receiver and achieving high information
transfer rates. It is observed that the ability to use energy in real-time
imposes less of penalty than the ability to use information in real-time.

 <dc:description>  Quaternion-valued wireless communication systems have been studied in the
past. Although progress has been made in this promising area, a crucial missing
link is lack of effective and efficient quaternion-valued signal processing
algorithms for channel equalization and beamforming. With most recent
developments in quaternion-valued signal processing, in this work, we fill the
gap to solve the problem by studying two quaternion-valued adaptive algorithms:
one is the reference signal based quaternion-valued least mean square (QLMS)
algorithm and the other one is the quaternion-valued constant modulus algorithm
(QCMA). The quaternion-valued Wiener solution for possible block-based
calculation is also derived. Simulation results are provided to show the
working of the system.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we consider the problem of detecting a high dimensional
signal based on compressed measurements with physical layer secrecy guarantees.
We assume that the network operates in the presence of an eavesdropper who
intends to discover the state of the nature being monitored by the system. We
design measurement matrices which maximize the detection performance of the
network while guaranteeing a certain level of secrecy. We solve the measurement
matrix design problem under three different scenarios: $a)$ signal is known,
$b)$ signal lies in a low dimensional subspace, and $c)$ signal is sparse. It
is shown that the security performance of the system can be improved by using
optimized measurement matrices along with artificial noise injection based
techniques.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by tensions between data privacy for individual citizens, and
societal priorities such as counterterrorism and the containment of infectious
disease, we introduce a computational model that distinguishes between parties
for whom privacy is explicitly protected, and those for whom it is not (the
targeted subpopulation). The goal is the development of algorithms that can
effectively identify and take action upon members of the targeted subpopulation
in a way that minimally compromises the privacy of the protected, while
simultaneously limiting the expense of distinguishing members of the two groups
via costly mechanisms such as surveillance, background checks, or medical
testing. Within this framework, we provide provably privacy-preserving
algorithms for targeted search in social networks. These algorithms are natural
variants of common graph search methods, and ensure privacy for the protected
by the careful injection of noise in the prioritization of potential targets.
We validate the utility of our algorithms with extensive computational
experiments on two large-scale social network datasets.

 <dc:description>  Benchmarking digital watermarking algorithms is not an easy task because
different applications of digital watermarking often have very different sets
of requirements and trade-offs between conflicting requirements. While there
have been some general-purpose digital watermarking benchmarking systems
available, they normally do not support complicated benchmarking tasks and
cannot be easily reconfigured to work with different watermarking algorithms
and testing conditions. In this paper, we propose OR-Benchmark, an open and
highly reconfigurable general-purpose digital watermarking benchmarking
framework, which has the following two key features: 1) all the interfaces are
public and general enough to support all watermarking applications and
benchmarking tasks we can think of; 2) end users can easily extend the
functionalities and freely configure what watermarking algorithms are tested,
what system components are used, how the benchmarking process runs, and what
results should be produced. We implemented a prototype of this framework as a
MATLAB software package and used it to benchmark a number of digital
watermarking algorithms involving two types of watermarks for content
authentication and self-restoration purposes. The benchmarking results
demonstrated the advantages of the proposed benchmarking framework, and also
gave us some useful insights about existing image authentication and
self-restoration watermarking algorithms which are an important but less
studied topic in digital watermarking.

 <dc:description>  Considering the raising socio-economic burden of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), timely and evidence-driven public policy decision making and
communication of the latest guidelines pertaining to the treatment and
management of the disorder is crucial. Yet evidence suggests that policy makers
and medical practitioners do not always have a good understanding of the
practices and relevant beliefs of ASD-afflicted individuals' carers who often
follow questionable recommendations and adopt advice poorly supported by
scientific data. The key goal of the present work is to explore the idea that
Twitter, as a highly popular platform for information exchange, could be used
as a data-mining source to learn about the population affected by ASD -- their
behaviour, concerns, needs etc. To this end, using a large data set of over 11
million harvested tweets as the basis for our investigation, we describe a
series of experiments which examine a range of linguistic and semantic aspects
of messages posted by individuals interested in ASD. Our findings, the first of
their nature in the published scientific literature, strongly motivate
additional research on this topic and present a methodological basis for
further work.

 <dc:description>  Let G be a simple graph with vertex set V(G). A subset S of V(G) is
independent if no two vertices from S are adjacent. The graph G is known to be
a Konig-Egervary if alpha(G) + mu(G)= |V(G)|, where alpha(G) denotes the size
of a maximum independent set and mu(G) is the cardinality of a maximum
matching. Let Omega(G) denote the family of all maximum independent sets, and f
be the function from the set of subcollections Gamma of Omega(G) such that
f(Gamma) = (the cardinality of the union of elements of Gamma) + (the
cardinality of the intersection of elements of Gamma). Our main finding claims
that f is &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;-increasing, where the preorder {Gamma1} &lt;&lt; {Gamma2} means that
the union of all elements of {Gamma1} is a subset of the union of all elements
of {Gamma2}, while the intersection of all elements of {Gamma2} is a subset of
the intersection of all elements of {Gamma1}. Let us say that a family {Gamma}
is a Konig-Egervary collection if f(Gamma) = 2*alpha(G). We conclude with the
observation that for every graph G each subcollection of a Konig-Egervary
collection is Konig-Egervary as well.

 <dc:description>  Diffusion of information, behavioral patterns or innovations follows diverse
pathways depending on a number of conditions, including the structure of the
underlying social network, the sensitivity to peer pressure and the influence
of media. Here we study analytically and by simulations a general model that
incorporates threshold mechanism capturing sensitivity to peer pressure, the
effect of `immune' nodes who never adopt, and a perpetual flow of external
information. While any constant, non-zero rate of dynamically-introduced
spontaneous adopters leads to global spreading, the kinetics by which the
asymptotic state is approached shows rich behavior. In particular we find that,
as a function of the immune node density, there is a transition from fast to
slow spreading governed by entirely different mechanisms. This transition
happens below the percolation threshold of network fragmentation, and has its
origin in the competition between cascading behavior induced by adopters and
blocking due to immune nodes. This change is accompanied by a percolation
transition of the induced clusters.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mrs. Gerber's Lemma lower bounds the entropy at the output of a binary
symmetric channel in terms of the entropy of the input process. In this paper,
we lower bound the output entropy via a different measure of input uncertainty,
pertaining to the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) prediction cost of the
input process. We show that in many cases our bound is tighter than the one
obtained from Mrs. Gerber's Lemma. As an application, we evaluate the bound for
binary hidden Markov processes, and obtain new estimates for the entropy rate.

 <dc:description>  Let G be a simple graph with vertex set V(G). A subset S of V(G) is
independent if no two vertices from S are adjacent. By Ind(G) we mean the
family of all independent sets of G while core(G) and corona(G) denote the
intersection and the union of all maximum independent sets, respectively. The
number d(X)= |X|-|N(X)| is the difference of the set of vertices X, and an
independent set A is critical if d(A)=max{d(I):I belongs to Ind(G)} (Zhang,
1990). Let ker(G) and diadem(G) be the intersection and union, respectively, of
all critical independent sets of G (Levit and Mandrescu, 2012). In this paper,
we present various connections between critical unions and intersections of
maximum independent sets of a graph. These relations give birth to new
characterizations of Koenig-Egervary graphs, some of them involving ker(G),
core(G), corona(G), and diadem(G).

 <dc:description>  We introduce Synapse motivated by the needs to estimate and emulate workload
execution characteristics on high-performance and distributed heterogeneous
resources. Synapse has a platform independent application profiler, and the
ability to emulate profiled workloads on a variety of heterogeneous resources.
Synapse is used as a proxy application (or &quot;representative application&quot;) for
real workloads, with the added advantage that it can be tuned at arbitrary
levels of granularity in ways that are simply not possible using real
applications. Experiments show that automated profiling using Synapse
represents application characteristics with high fidelity. Emulation using
Synapse can reproduce the application behavior in the original runtime
environment, as well as reproducing properties when used in a different
run-time environments.

 <dc:title>Communication Complexity of Permutation-Invariant Functions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by the quest for a broader understanding of communication
complexity of simple functions, we introduce the class of
&quot;permutation-invariant&quot; functions. A partial function $f:\{0,1\}^n \times
\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1,?\}$ is permutation-invariant if for every bijection
$\pi:\{1,\ldots,n\} \to \{1,\ldots,n\}$ and every $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in
\{0,1\}^n$, it is the case that $f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) =
f(\mathbf{x}^{\pi}, \mathbf{y}^{\pi})$. Most of the commonly studied functions
in communication complexity are permutation-invariant. For such functions, we
present a simple complexity measure (computable in time polynomial in $n$ given
an implicit description of $f$) that describes their communication complexity
up to polynomial factors and up to an additive error that is logarithmic in the
input size. This gives a coarse taxonomy of the communication complexity of
simple functions. Our work highlights the role of the well-known lower bounds
of functions such as 'Set-Disjointness' and 'Indexing', while complementing
them with the relatively lesser-known upper bounds for 'Gap-Inner-Product'
(from the sketching literature) and 'Sparse-Gap-Inner-Product' (from the recent
work of Canonne et al. [ITCS 2015]). We also present consequences to the study
of communication complexity with imperfectly shared randomness where we show
that for total permutation-invariant functions, imperfectly shared randomness
results in only a polynomial blow-up in communication complexity after an
additive $O(\log \log n)$ overhead.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe an approach to create a diverse set of predictions with spectral
learning of latent-variable PCFGs (L-PCFGs). Our approach works by creating
multiple spectral models where noise is added to the underlying features in the
training set before the estimation of each model. We describe three ways to
decode with multiple models. In addition, we describe a simple variant of the
spectral algorithm for L-PCFGs that is fast and leads to compact models. Our
experiments for natural language parsing, for English and German, show that we
get a significant improvement over baselines comparable to state of the art.
For English, we achieve the $F_1$ score of 90.18, and for German we achieve the
$F_1$ score of 83.38.

natural language descriptions for 10,738 images. This dataset, the Visual
Madlibs dataset, is collected using automatically produced fill-in-the-blank
templates designed to gather targeted descriptions about: people and objects,
their appearances, activities, and interactions, as well as inferences about
the general scene or its broader context. We provide several analyses of the
Visual Madlibs dataset and demonstrate its applicability to two new description
generation tasks: focused description generation, and multiple-choice
question-answering for images. Experiments using joint-embedding and deep
learning methods show promising results on these tasks.

 <dc:description>  At sub-20nm technologies CMOS scaling faces severe challenges primarily due
to fundamental device scaling limitations, interconnection overhead and complex
manufacturing. Migration to 3D has been long sought as a possible pathway to
continue scaling, however, intrinsic requirements of CMOS are not compatible
for fine-grained 3D integration. We proposed a truly fine-grained 3D integrated
circuit fabric called Skybridge that solves nanoscale challenges and achieves
orders of magnitude benefits over CMOS. In Skybridge, device, circuit,
connectivity, thermal management and manufacturing issues are addressed in an
integrated 3D compatible manner. At the core of Skybridge assembly are uniform
vertical nanowires, which are functionalized with architected features for
fabric integration. All active components are created primarily using
sequential material deposition steps on these nanowires. Lithography and doping
are performed prior to any functionalization and their precision requirements
are significantly reduced. This paper introduces Skybridge manufacturing
pathway that is developed based on extensive process, device simulations and
experimental metrology, and uses established processes. Experimental
demonstrations of key process steps are also shown.

 <dc:description>  In this work we compare semi-discrete formulations to obtain numerical
solutions for the 1D Burgers equation. The formulations consist in the
discretization of the time-domain via multi-stage methods of second and fourth
order: R_{11} and R_{22} Pad\'e approximants, and of the spatial-domain via
finite element methods: least-squares (MEFMQ), Galerkin (MEFG) and
Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG). Knowing the analytical solutions of
the 1D Burgues equation, for different initial and boundary conditions,
analyzes were performed for numerical errors from L_{2} and L_{\infinity} norm.
We found that the R_{22} Pad\'e approximants, added to the MEFMQ, MEFG, and
SUPG formulations, increased the region of convergence of the numerical
solutions, and showed greater accuracy when compared to the solutions obtained
by the R_{11} Pad\'e approximants. We note that the R_{22} Pad\'e approximants
softened the oscillations of the numerical solutions associated to the MEFG and
SUPG formulations.

 <dc:title>Compressing Communication in Distributed Protocols</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kalai, Yael Tauman</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show how to compress communication in distributed protocols in which
parties do not have private inputs. More specifically, we present a generic
method for converting any protocol in which parties do not have private inputs,
into another protocol where each message is {\em &quot;short&quot;} while preserving the
same number of rounds, the same communication pattern, the same output
distribution, and the same resilience to error. Assuming that the output lies
in some universe of size $M$, in our resulting protocol each message consists
of only $\mathsf{poly}{\log}(M,n,d)$ many bits, where $n$ is the number of
parties and $d$ is the number of rounds. Our transformation works in the full
information model, in the presence of either static or adaptive Byzantine
faults.
  In particular, our result implies that for any such $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-round
distributed protocol which generates outputs in a universe of size
$\mathsf{poly}(n)$, long messages are not needed, and messages of length
$\mathsf{poly}{\log}(n)$ suffice. In other words, in this regime, any
distributed task that can be solved in the $\mathcal{LOCAL}$ model, can also be
solved in the $\mathcal{CONGEST}$ model with the \emph{same} round complexity
and security guarantees.
  As a corollary, we conclude that for any $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-round collective
coin-flipping protocol, leader election protocol, or selection protocols,
messages of length $\mathsf{poly}{\log}(n)$ suffice (in the presence of either
static or adaptive Byzantine faults).

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show that designing sparse $H_\infty$ controllers, in a discrete (LTI)
setting, is easy when the controller is assumed to be an FIR filter. In this
case, the problem reduces to a static output feedback problem with equality
constraints. We show how to obtain an initial guess, for the controller, and
then provide a simple algorithm that alternates between two (convex)
feasibility programs until converging, when the problem is feasible, to a
suboptimal $H_\infty$ controller that is automatically stable. As FIR filters
contain the information of their impulse response in their coefficients, it is
easy to see that our results provide a path of least resistance to designing
sparse robust controllers for continuous-time plants, via system identification
methods.

 <dc:description>  Many scientific data-intensive applications perform iterative computations on
array data. There exist multiple engines specialized for array processing.
These engines efficiently support various types of operations, but none
includes native support for iterative processing. In this paper, we develop a
model for iterative array computations and a series of optimizations. We
evaluate the benefits of an optimized, native support for iterative array
processing on the SciDB engine and real workloads from the astronomy domain.

 <dc:description>  A version of the dueling bandit problem is addressed in which a Condorcet
winner may not exist. Two algorithms are proposed that instead seek to minimize
regret with respect to the Copeland winner, which, unlike the Condorcet winner,
is guaranteed to exist. The first, Copeland Confidence Bound (CCB), is designed
for small numbers of arms, while the second, Scalable Copeland Bandits (SCB),
works better for large-scale problems. We provide theoretical results bounding
the regret accumulated by CCB and SCB, both substantially improving existing
results. Such existing results either offer bounds of the form $O(K \log T)$
but require restrictive assumptions, or offer bounds of the form $O(K^2 \log
T)$ without requiring such assumptions. Our results offer the best of both
worlds: $O(K \log T)$ bounds without restrictive assumptions.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is strongly affected
by outliers and a lot of effort has been put into robustification of PCA. In
this paper we present a new algorithm for robust PCA minimizing the trimmed
reconstruction error. By directly minimizing over the Stiefel manifold, we
avoid deflation as often used by projection pursuit methods. In distinction to
other methods for robust PCA, our method has no free parameter and is
computationally very efficient. We illustrate the performance on various
datasets including an application to background modeling and subtraction. Our
method performs better or similar to current state-of-the-art methods while
being faster.

 <dc:description>  Securely sharing and managing personal content is a challenging task in
multi-device environments. In this paper, we design and implement a new
platform called Personal Content Networking (PCN). Our work is inspired by
Content-Centric Networking (CCN) because we aim to enable access to personal
content using its name instead of its location. The unique challenge of PCN is
to support secure file operations such as replication, updates, and access
control over distributed untrusted devices. The primary contribution of this
work is the design and implementation of a secure content management platform
that supports secure updates, replications, and fine-grained content-centric
access control of files. Furthermore, we demonstrate its feasibility through a
prototype implementation on the CCNx skeleton.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by recent successes of deep learning in computer vision, we propose
a novel framework for encoding time series as different types of images,
namely, Gramian Angular Summation/Difference Fields (GASF/GADF) and Markov
Transition Fields (MTF). This enables the use of techniques from computer
vision for time series classification and imputation. We used Tiled
Convolutional Neural Networks (tiled CNNs) on 20 standard datasets to learn
high-level features from the individual and compound GASF-GADF-MTF images. Our
approaches achieve highly competitive results when compared to nine of the
current best time series classification approaches. Inspired by the bijection
property of GASF on 0/1 rescaled data, we train Denoised Auto-encoders (DA) on
the GASF images of four standard and one synthesized compound dataset. The
imputation MSE on test data is reduced by 12.18%-48.02% when compared to using
the raw data. An analysis of the features and weights learned via tiled CNNs
and DAs explains why the approaches work.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We derive the optimal signaling for a multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
full-duplex two-way channel under the imperfect transmit front-end chain. We
characterize the two-way rates of the channel by using a game-theoretical
approach, where we focus on the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region
and Nash equilibia (NE). For a MISO full-duplex two-way channel, we prove that
beamforming is an optimal transmission strategy which can achieve any point on
the Pareto boundary. Furthermore, we present a closed-form expression for the
optimal beamforming weights. In our numerical examples we quantify gains in the
achievable rates of the proposed beamforming over the zero-forcing beamforming.
For a general MIMO full-duplex channel, we establish the existence of NE and
present a condition for the uniqueness of NE. We then propose an iterative
water-filling algorithm which is capable of reaching NE. Through simulations
the threshold of the self-interference level is found, below which the
full-duplex NE outperforms the half-duplex TDMA.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose to employ the convolutional neural network (CNN)
for the image question answering (QA). Our proposed CNN provides an end-to-end
framework with convolutional architectures for learning not only the image and
question representations, but also their inter-modal interactions to produce
the answer. More specifically, our model consists of three CNNs: one image CNN
to encode the image content, one sentence CNN to compose the words of the
question, and one multimodal convolution layer to learn their joint
representation for the classification in the space of candidate answer words.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model on the DAQUAR and COCO-QA
datasets, which are two benchmark datasets for the image QA, with the
performances significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:title>On Distributive Subalgebras of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Calculi</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Qualitative calculi play a central role in representing and reasoning about
qualitative spatial and temporal knowledge. This paper studies distributive
subalgebras of qualitative calculi, which are subalgebras in which (weak)
composition distributives over nonempty intersections. It has been proven for
RCC5 and RCC8 that path consistent constraint network over a distributive
subalgebra is always minimal and globally consistent (in the sense of strong
$n$-consistency) in a qualitative sense. The well-known subclass of convex
interval relations provides one such an example of distributive subalgebras.
This paper first gives a characterisation of distributive subalgebras, which
states that the intersection of a set of $n\geq 3$ relations in the subalgebra
is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every two of these relations is
nonempty. We further compute and generate all maximal distributive subalgebras
for Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, RCC5 and RCC8, Cardinal Relation Algebra,
and Rectangle Algebra. Lastly, we establish two nice properties which will play
an important role in efficient reasoning with constraint networks involving a
large number of variables.

 <dc:description>  Learning and inferring features that generate sensory input is a task
continuously performed by cortex. In recent years, novel algorithms and
learning rules have been proposed that allow neural network models to learn
such features from natural images, written text, audio signals, etc. These
networks usually involve deep architectures with many layers of hidden neurons.
Here we review recent advancements in this area emphasizing, amongst other
things, the processing of dynamical inputs by networks with hidden nodes and
the role of single neuron models. These points and the questions they arise can
provide conceptual advancements in understanding of learning in the cortex and
the relationship between machine learning approaches to learning with hidden
nodes and those in cortical circuits.

increase the accuracy, we use Harris-Laplace detector to identify the interest
regions of image. Then, we build the Region-Based Image Retrieval (RBIR). For
the efficient image storage and retrieval, we encode images into binary
signatures. The binary signature of a image is created from its interest
regions. Furthermore, this paper also provides an algorithm for image retrieval
on S-tree by comparing the images' signatures on a metric similarly to EMD
(earth mover's distance). Finally, we evaluate the created models on COREL's
images.

 <dc:description>  Representation learning of knowledge bases (KBs) aims to embed both entities
and relations into a low-dimensional space. Most existing methods only consider
direct relations in representation learning. We argue that multiple-step
relation paths also contain rich inference patterns between entities, and
propose a path-based representation learning model. This model considers
relation paths as translations between entities for representation learning,
and addresses two key challenges: (1) Since not all relation paths are
reliable, we design a path-constraint resource allocation algorithm to measure
the reliability of relation paths. (2) We represent relation paths via semantic
composition of relation embeddings. Experimental results on real-world datasets
show that, as compared with baselines, our model achieves significant and
consistent improvements on knowledge base completion and relation extraction
from text.

 <dc:title>Operational axioms for diagonalizing states</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In quantum theory every state can be diagonalized, i.e. decomposed as a
convex combination of perfectly distinguishable pure states. This elementary
structure plays an ubiquitous role in quantum mechanics, quantum information
theory, and quantum statistical mechanics, where it provides the foundation for
the notions of majorization and entropy. A natural question then arises: can we
reconstruct these notions from purely operational axioms? We address this
question in the framework of general probabilistic theories, presenting a set
of axioms that guarantee that every state can be diagonalized. The first axiom
is Causality, which ensures that the marginal of a bipartite state is well
defined. Then, Purity Preservation states that the set of pure transformations
is closed under composition. The third axiom is Purification, which allows to
assign a pure state to the composition of a system with its environment.
Finally, we introduce the axiom of Pure Sharpness, stating that for every
system there exists at least one pure effect occurring with unit probability on
some state. For theories satisfying our four axioms, we show a constructive
algorithm for diagonalizing every given state. The diagonalization result
allows us to formulate a majorization criterion that captures the
convertibility of states in the operational resource theory of purity, where
random reversible transformations are regarded as free operations.

 <dc:description>  Social interactions vary in time and appear to be driven by intrinsic
mechanisms, which in turn shape the emerging structure of the social network.
Large-scale empirical observations of social interaction structure have become
possible only recently, and modelling their dynamics is an actual challenge.
Here we propose a temporal network model which builds on the framework of
activity-driven time-varying networks with memory. The model also integrates
key mechanisms that drive the formation of social ties - social reinforcement,
focal closure and cyclic closure, which have been shown to give rise to
community structure and the global connectedness of the network. We compare the
proposed model with a real-world time-varying network of mobile phone
communication and show that they share several characteristics from
heterogeneous degrees and weights to rich community structure. Further, the
strong and weak ties that emerge from the model follow similar weight-topology
correlations as real-world social networks, including the role of weak ties.

 <dc:description>  The potential to gain business insights from graph-structured data through
graph analytics is increasingly attracting companies from a variety of
industries, ranging from web companies to traditional enterprise businesses. To
analyze a graph, a user often executes isolated graph queries using a dedicated
interface---a procedural graph programming interface or a declarative graph
query language. The results are then returned and displayed using a specific
visualization technique. This follows the classical ad-hoc
Query$\rightarrow$Result interaction paradigm and often requires multiple query
iterations until an interesting aspect in the graph data is identified. This is
caused on the one hand by the schema flexibility of graph data and on the other
hand by the intricacies of declarative graph query languages. To lower the
burden for the user to explore an unknown graph without prior knowledge of a
graph query language, visual graph exploration provides an effective and
intuitive query interface to navigate through the graph interactively.
  We demonstrate GRAPHVISTA, a graph visualization and exploration tool that
can seamlessly combine ad-hoc querying and interactive graph exploration within
the same query session. In our demonstration, conference attendees will see
GRAPHVISTA running against a large real-world graph data set. They will start
by identifying entry points of interest with the help of ad-hoc queries and
will then discover the graph interactively through visual graph exploration.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the structure-and-motion problem, that requires to find
camera motion and 3D struc- ture from point matches. A new pipeline, dubbed
Samantha, is presented, that departs from the prevailing sequential paradigm
and embraces instead a hierarchical approach. This method has several
advantages, like a provably lower computational complexity, which is necessary
to achieve true scalability, and better error containment, leading to more
stability and less drift. Moreover, a practical autocalibration procedure
allows to process images without ancillary information. Experiments with real
data assess the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the method.

 <dc:description>  Quantum theory was discovered in an adventurous way, under the urge to solve
puzzles-like the spectrum of the blackbody radiation-that haunted the physics
community at the beginning of the 20th century. It soon became clear, though,
that quantum theory was not just a theory of specific physical systems, but
rather a new language of universal applicability. Can this language be
reconstructed from first principles? Can we arrive at it from logical
reasoning, instead of ad hoc guesswork? A positive answer was provided in Refs.
[1, 2], where we put forward six principles that identify quantum theory
uniquely in a broad class of theories. We first defined a class of &quot;theories of
information&quot;, constructed as extensions of probability theory in which events
can be connected into networks. In this framework, we formulated the six
principles as rules governing the control and the accessibility of information.
Directly from these rules, we reconstructed a number of quantum information
features, and eventually, the whole Hilbert space framework. In short, our
principles characterize quantum theory as the theory of information that allows
for maximal control of randomness.

 <dc:title>Monolingually Derived Phrase Scores for Phrase Based SMT Using Neural

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose two new features for estimating phrase-based
machine translation parameters from mainly monolingual data. Our method is
based on two recently introduced neural network vector representation models
for words and sentences. It is the first time that these models have been used
in an end to end phrase-based machine translation system. Scores obtained from
our method can recover more than 80% of BLEU loss caused by removing phrase
table probabilities. We also show that our features combined with the phrase
table probabilities improve the BLEU score by absolute 0.74 points.

 <dc:description>  Network-assisted device-to-device communication is a promising technology for
improving the performance of proximity-based services. This paper demonstrates
how the integration of device-to-device communications and dynamic
time-division duplex can improve the energy efficiency of future cellular
networks, leading to a greener system operation and a prolonged battery
lifetime of mobile devices. We jointly optimize the mode selection,
transmission period and power allocation to minimize the energy consumption
(from both a system and a device perspective) while satisfying a certain rate
requirement. The radio resource management problems are formulated as
mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. Although they are known to be
NP-hard in general, we exploit the problem structure to design efficient
algorithms that optimally solve several problem cases. For the remaining cases,
a heuristic algorithm that computes near-optimal solutions while respecting
practical constraints on execution times and signaling overhead is also
proposed. Simulation results confirm that the combination of device-to-device
and flexible time-division-duplex technologies can significantly enhance
spectrum and energy-efficiency of next generation cellular systems.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new method from number fields and codes to construct dense
packings in the Euclidean spaces. Via the canonical $\mathbb{Q}$-embedding of
arbitrary number field $K$ into $\mathbb{R}^{[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$, both the prime
ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ and its residue field $\kappa$ can be embedded as discrete
subsets in $\mathbb{R}^{[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$. Thus we can concatenate the embedding
image of the Cartesian product of $n$ copies of $\mathfrak{p}$ together with
the image of a length $n$ code over $\kappa$. This concatenation leads to a
packing in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$. Moreover, we extend
the single concatenation to multiple concatenation to obtain dense packings and
asymptotically good packing families. For instance, with the help of \Magma{},
we construct one $256$-dimension packing denser than the Barnes-Wall lattice
BW$_{256}$.

 <dc:description>  In hadoop, the job scheduling is an independent module, users can design
their own job scheduler based on their actual application requirements, thereby
meet their specific business needs. Currently, hadoop has three schedulers:
FIFO, computing capacity scheduling and fair scheduling policy, all of them are
take task allocation strategy that considerate data locality simply. They
neither support data locality well nor fully apply to all cases of jobs
scheduling. In this paper, we took the concept of resources-prefetch into
consideration, and proposed a job scheduling algorithm based on data locality.
By estimate the remaining time to complete a task, compared with the time to
transfer a resources block, to preselect candidate nodes for task allocation.
Then we preselect a non-local map tasks from the unfinished job queue as
resources-prefetch tasks. Getting information of resources blocks of
preselected map task, select a nearest resources blocks from the candidate node
and transferred to local through network. Thus we would ensure data locality
good enough. Eventually, we design a experiment and proved resources-prefetch
method can guarantee good job data locality and reduce the time to complete the
job to a certain extent.

 <dc:description>  Let $\omega=(-1+\sqrt{-3})/2$. For any lattice $P\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^n$,
$\mathcal{P}=P+\omega P$ is a subgroup of $\mathcal{O}_K^n$, where
$\mathcal{O}_K=\mathbb{Z}[\omega]\subseteq \mathbb{C}$. As $\mathbb{C}$ is
naturally isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathcal{P}$ can be regarded as a
lattice in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Let $P$ be a multiplicative lattice (principal
lattice or congruence lattice) introduced by Rosenbloom and Tsfasman. We
concatenate a family of special codes with $t_{\mathfrak{P}}^\ell\cdot(P+\omega
P)$, where $t_{\mathfrak{P}}$ is the generator of a prime ideal $\mathfrak{P}$
of $\mathcal{O}_K$. Applying this concatenation to a family of principal
lattices, we obtain a new family with asymptotic density exponent
$\lambda\geqslant-1.26532182283$, which is better than $-1.87$ given by
Rosenbloom and Tsfasman considering only principal lattice families. For a new
family based on congruence lattices, the result is $\lambda\geqslant
-1.26532181404$, which is better than $-1.39$ by considering only congruence
lattice families.

 <dc:description>  We solve the problem of identifying (reconstructing) network topology from
steady state network measurements. Concretely, given only a data matrix
$\mathbf{X}$ where the $X_{ij}$ entry corresponds to flow in edge $i$ in
configuration (steady-state) $j$, we wish to find a network structure for which
flow conservation is obeyed at all the nodes. This models many network problems
involving conserved quantities like water, power, and metabolic networks. We
show that identification is equivalent to learning a model $\mathbf{A_n}$ which
captures the approximate linear relationships between the different variables
comprising $\mathbf{X}$ (i.e. of the form $\mathbf{A_n X \approx 0}$) such that
$\mathbf{A_n}$ is full rank (highest possible) and consistent with a network
node-edge incidence structure. The problem is solved through a sequence of
steps like estimating approximate linear relationships using Principal
Component Analysis, obtaining f-cut-sets from these approximate relationships,
and graph realization from f-cut-sets (or equivalently f-circuits). Each step
and the overall process is polynomial time. The method is illustrated by
identifying topology of a water distribution network. We also study the extent
of identifiability from steady-state data.

 <dc:description>  When dealing with massive data sorting, we usually use Hadoop which is a
framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across
clusters of computers using simple programming models. A common approach in
implement of big data sorting is to use shuffle and sort phase in MapReduce
based on Hadoop. However, if we use it directly, the efficiency could be very
low and the load imbalance can be a big problem. In this paper we carry out an
experimental study of an optimization and analysis of large scale data sorting
algorithm based on hadoop. In order to reach optimization, we use more than 2
rounds MapReduce. In the first round, we use a MapReduce to take sample
randomly. Then we use another MapReduce to order the data uniformly, according
to the results of the first round. If the data is also too big, it will turn
back to the first round and keep on. The experiments show that, it is better to
use the optimized algorithm than shuffle of MapReduce to sort large scale data.

 <dc:description>  In this work we address a game theoretic variant of the shortest path
problem, in which two decision makers (players) move together along the edges
of a graph from a given starting vertex to a given destination. The two players
take turns in deciding in each vertex which edge to traverse next. The decider
in each vertex also has to pay the cost of the chosen edge. We want to
determine the path where each player minimizes its costs taking into account
that also the other player acts in a selfish and rational way. Such a solution
is a subgame perfect equilibrium and can be determined by backward induction in
the game tree of the associated finite game in extensive form.
  We show that the decision problem associated with such a path is
PSPACE-complete even for bipartite graphs both for the directed and the
undirected version. The latter result is a surprising deviation from the
complexity status of the closely related game Geography.
  On the other hand, we can give polynomial time algorithms for directed
acyclic graphs and for cactus graphs even in the undirected case. The latter is
based on a decomposition of the graph into components and their resolution by a
number of fairly involved dynamic programming arrays. Finally, we give some
arguments about closing the gap of the complexity status for graphs of bounded
treewidth.

 <dc:description>  Social media is a rich source of rumours and corresponding community
reactions. Rumours reflect different characteristics, some shared and some
individual. We formulate the problem of classifying tweet level judgements of
rumours as a supervised learning task. Both supervised and unsupervised domain
adaptation are considered, in which tweets from a rumour are classified on the
basis of other annotated rumours. We demonstrate how multi-task learning helps
achieve good results on rumours from the 2011 England riots.

 <dc:title>An Efficient Algorithm for Video Super-Resolution Based On a Sequential

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a novel procedure for video super-resolution, that
is the recovery of a sequence of high-resolution images from its low-resolution
counterpart. Our approach is based on a &quot;sequential&quot; model (i.e., each
high-resolution frame is supposed to be a displaced version of the preceding
one) and considers the use of sparsity-enforcing priors. Both the recovery of
the high-resolution images and the motion fields relating them is tackled. This
leads to a large-dimensional, non-convex and non-smooth problem. We propose an
algorithmic framework to address the latter. Our approach relies on fast
gradient evaluation methods and modern optimization techniques for
non-differentiable/non-convex problems. Unlike some other previous works, we
show that there exists a provably-convergent method with a complexity linear in
the problem dimensions. We assess the proposed optimization method on {several
video benchmarks and emphasize its good performance with respect to the state
of the art.}

 <dc:title>Constraint Satisfaction and Semilinear Expansions of Addition over the

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A semilinear relation is a finite union of finite intersections of open and
closed half-spaces over, for instance, the reals, the rationals, or the
integers. Semilinear relations have been studied in connection with algebraic
geometry, automata theory, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We consider semilinear
relations over the rationals and the reals. Under this assumption, the
computational complexity of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is known
for all finite sets containing R+={(x,y,z) | x+y=z}, &lt;=, and {1}. These
problems correspond to expansions of the linear programming feasibility
problem. We generalise this result and fully determine the complexity for all
finite sets of semilinear relations containing R+. This is accomplished in part
by introducing an algorithm, based on computing affine hulls, which solves a
new class of semilinear CSPs in polynomial time. We further analyse the
complexity of linear optimisation over the solution set and the existence of
integer solutions.

 <dc:title>Robust Face Recognition with Structural Binary Gradient Patterns</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Weilin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yin, Hujun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a computationally efficient yet powerful binary framework
for robust facial representation based on image gradients. It is termed as
structural binary gradient patterns (SBGP). To discover underlying local
structures in the gradient domain, we compute image gradients from multiple
directions and simplify them into a set of binary strings. The SBGP is derived
from certain types of these binary strings that have meaningful local
structures and are capable of resembling fundamental textural information. They
detect micro orientational edges and possess strong orientation and locality
capabilities, thus enabling great discrimination. The SBGP also benefits from
the advantages of the gradient domain and exhibits profound robustness against
illumination variations. The binary strategy realized by pixel correlations in
a small neighborhood substantially simplifies the computational complexity and
achieves extremely efficient processing with only 0.0032s in Matlab for a
typical face image. Furthermore, the discrimination power of the SBGP can be
enhanced on a set of defined orientational image gradient magnitudes, further
enforcing locality and orientation. Results of extensive experiments on various
benchmark databases illustrate significant improvements of the SBGP based
representations over the existing state-of-the-art local descriptors in the
terms of discrimination, robustness and complexity. Codes for the SBGP methods
will be available at

 <dc:description>  This work is concerned with regular languages defined over large alphabets,
either infinite or just too large to be expressed enumeratively. We define a
generic model where transitions are labeled by elements of a finite partition
of the alphabet. We then extend Angluin's L* algorithm for learning regular
languages from examples for such automata. We have implemented this algorithm
and we demonstrate its behavior where the alphabet is a subset of the natural
or real numbers. We sketch the extension of the algorithm to a class of
languages over partially ordered alphabets.

 <dc:title>Optimal Communication of States of Dynamical Systems over Gaussian
  Channels with Noisy Feedback: The Scalar Case</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gattami, Ather</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of communicating the state of a dynamical system via
a Shannon Gaussian channel. The receiver, which acts as both a decoder and
estimator, observes the noisy measurement of the channel output and makes an
optimal estimate of the state of the dynamical system in the minimum mean
square sense. Noisy feedback from the receiver to the transmitter is present.
The transmitter observes the noise-corrupted feedback message from the receiver
together with a possibly noisy measurement of the state the dynamical system.
These measurements are then used to encode the message to be transmitted over a
noisy Gaussian channel, where a per symbol power constraint is imposed on the
transmitted message. Thus, we get a mixed problem of Shannon's source-channel
coding problem and a sort of Kalman filtering problem. In particular, we
consider two feedback instances, one being feedback of receiver measurements
and the second being the receiver's state estimates. We show that optimal
encoders and decoders are linear filters with a finite memory and we give
explicitly the state space realizations of the optimal filters. For the case
where the transmitter has access to noisy measurements of the state, we derive
a separation principle for the optimal communication scheme. Furthermore, we
investigate the presence of noiseless feedback or no feedback from the receiver
to the transmitter. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a
stationary solution are also given for the feedback cases considered.

 <dc:title>Cut-Set Bounds for Multimessage Multicast Networks with Independent
  Channels and Zero-Delay Edges</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fong, Silas L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a communication network consisting of nodes and directed edges
that connect the nodes. The network may contain cycles. The communications are
slotted where the duration of each time slot is equal to the maximum
propagation delay experienced by the edges. The edges with negligible delays
are allowed to be operated before the other edges in each time slot. For any
pair of adjacent edges $(\ell, i)$ and $(i,j)$ where $(\ell,i)$ terminates at
node $i$ and $(i,j)$ originates from node $i$, we say $(\ell,i)$ incurs zero
delay on $(i,j)$ if $(\ell,i)$ is operated before $(i,j)$; otherwise, we say
$(\ell,i)$ incurs a unit delay on $(i,j)$. In the classical model, every edge
incurs a unit delay on every adjacent edge and the cut-set bound is a
well-known outer bound on the capacity region. In this paper, we investigate
the multimessage multicast network (MMN) consisting of independent channels
where each channel is associated with a set of edges and each edge may incur
zero delay on some other edges. Our result reveals that the capacity region of
the MMN with independent channels and zero-delay edges lies within the
classical cut-set bound despite a violation of the unit-delay assumption.

 <dc:description>  As businesses increasingly rely on social networking sites to engage with
their customers, it is crucial to understand and counter reputation
manipulation activities, including fraudulently boosting the number of Facebook
page likes using like farms. To this end, several fraud detection algorithms
have been proposed and some deployed by Facebook that use graph co-clustering
to distinguish between genuine likes and those generated by farm-controlled
profiles. However, as we show in this paper, these tools do not work well with
stealthy farms whose users spread likes over longer timespans and like popular
pages, aiming to mimic regular users. We present an empirical analysis of the
graph-based detection tools used by Facebook and highlight their shortcomings
against more sophisticated farms. Next, we focus on characterizing content
generated by social networks accounts on their timelines, as an indicator of
genuine versus fake social activity. We analyze a wide range of features
extracted from timeline posts, which we group into two main classes: lexical
and non-lexical. We postulate and verify that like farm accounts tend to often
re-share content, use fewer words and poorer vocabulary, and more often
generate duplicate comments and likes compared to normal users. We extract
relevant lexical and non-lexical features and and use them to build a
classifier to detect like farms accounts, achieving significantly higher
accuracy, namely, at least 99% precision and 93% recall.

 <dc:description>  We extend the concept of graph isomorphisms to multilayer networks with any
number of &quot;aspects&quot; (i.e., types of layering). In developing this
generalization, we identify multiple types of isomorphisms. For example, in
multilayer networks with a single aspect, permuting vertex labels, layer
labels, and both vertex labels and layer labels each yield different
isomorphism relations between multilayer networks. Multilayer network
isomorphisms lead naturally to defining isomorphisms in any of the numerous
types of networks that can be represented as a multilayer network, and we
thereby obtain isomorphisms for multiplex networks, temporal networks, networks
with both of these features, and more. We reduce each of the multilayer network
isomorphism problems to a graph isomorphism problem, where the size of the
graph isomorphism problem grows linearly with the size of the multilayer
network isomorphism problem. One can thus use software that has been developed
to solve graph isomorphism problems as a practical means for solving multilayer
network isomorphism problems. Our theory lays a foundation for extending many
network analysis methods --- including motifs, graphlets, structural roles, and
network alignment --- to any multilayer network.

 <dc:description>  One of the main challenges in Zero-Shot Learning of visual categories is
gathering semantic attributes to accompany images. Recent work has shown that
learning from textual descriptions, such as Wikipedia articles, avoids the
problem of having to explicitly define these attributes. We present a new model
that can classify unseen categories from their textual description.
Specifically, we use text features to predict the output weights of both the
convolutional and the fully connected layers in a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN). We take advantage of the architecture of CNNs and learn features
at different layers, rather than just learning an embedding space for both
modalities, as is common with existing approaches. The proposed model also
allows us to automatically generate a list of pseudo- attributes for each
visual category consisting of words from Wikipedia articles. We train our
models end-to-end us- ing the Caltech-UCSD bird and flower datasets and
evaluate both ROC and Precision-Recall curves. Our empirical results show that
the proposed model significantly outperforms previous methods.

 <dc:description>  Fix an ordinary abelian variety defined over a finite field. The ideal class
group of its endomorphism ring acts freely on the set of isogenous varieties
with same endomorphism ring, by complex multiplication. Any subgroup of the
class group, and generating set thereof, induces an isogeny graph on the orbit
of the variety for this subgroup. We compute (under the Generalized Riemann
Hypothesis) some bounds on the norms of prime ideals generating it, such that
the associated graph has good expansion properties.
  We use these graphs, together with a recent algorithm of Dudeanu, Jetchev and
Robert for computing explicit isogenies in genus 2, to prove random
self-reducibility of the discrete logarithm problem within the subclasses of
principally polarizable ordinary abelian surfaces with fixed endomorphism ring.
In addition, we remove the heuristics in the complexity analysis of an
algorithm of Galbraith for explicitly computing isogenies between two elliptic
curves in the same isogeny class, and extend it to a more general setting
including genus 2.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider how to automatically create pleasing photo collages
created by placing a set of images on a limited canvas area. The task is
formulated as an optimization problem. Differently from existing
state-of-the-art approaches, we here exploit subjective experiments to model
and learn pleasantness from user preferences. To this end, we design an
experimental framework for the identification of the criteria that need to be
taken into account to generate a pleasing photo collage. Five different
thematic photo datasets are used to create collages using state-of-the-art
criteria. A first subjective experiment where several subjects evaluated the
collages, emphasizes that different criteria are involved in the subjective
definition of pleasantness. We then identify new global and local criteria and
design algorithms to quantify them. The relative importance of these criteria
are automatically learned by exploiting the user preferences, and new collages
are generated. To validate our framework, we performed several psycho-visual
experiments involving different users. The results shows that the proposed
framework allows to learn a novel computational model which effectively encodes
an inter-user definition of pleasantness. The learned definition of
pleasantness generalizes well to new photo datasets of different themes and
sizes not used in the learning. Moreover, compared with two state of the art
approaches, the collages created using our framework are preferred by the
majority of the users.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel approach for medical synonym extraction. We
aim to integrate the term embedding with the medical domain knowledge for
healthcare applications. One advantage of our method is that it is very
scalable. Experiments on a dataset with more than 1M term pairs show that the
proposed approach outperforms the baseline approaches by a large margin.

 <dc:title>Desirability and the birth of incomplete preferences</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zaffalon, Marco</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Miranda, Enrique</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We establish an equivalence between two seemingly different theories: one is
the traditional axiomatisation of incomplete preferences on horse lotteries
based on the mixture independence axiom; the other is the theory of desirable
gambles developed in the context of imprecise probability. The equivalence
allows us to revisit incomplete preferences from the viewpoint of desirability
and through the derived notion of coherent lower previsions. On this basis, we
obtain new results and insights: in particular, we show that the theory of
incomplete preferences can be developed assuming only the existence of a worst
act---no best act is needed---, and that a weakened Archimedean axiom suffices
too; this axiom allows us also to address some controversy about the regularity
assumption (that probabilities should be positive---they need not), which
enables us also to deal with uncountable possibility spaces; we show that it is
always possible to extend in a minimal way a preference relation to one with a
worst act, and yet the resulting relation is never Archimedean, except in a
trivial case; we show that the traditional notion of state independence
coincides with the notion called strong independence in imprecise
probability---this leads us to give much a weaker definition of state
independence than the traditional one; we rework and uniform the notions of
complete preferences, beliefs, values; we argue that Archimedeanity does not
capture all the problems that can be modelled with sets of expected utilities
and we provide a new notion that does precisely that. Perhaps most importantly,
we argue throughout that desirability is a powerful and natural setting to
model, and work with, incomplete preferences, even in case of non-Archimedean
problems. This leads us to suggest that desirability, rather than preference,
should be the primitive notion at the basis of decision-theoretic
axiomatisations.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of jointly sparse support recovery with 1-bit
compressive measurements in a sensor network. Sensors are assumed to observe
sparse signals having the same but unknown sparse support. Each sensor
quantizes its measurement vector element-wise to 1-bit and transmits the
quantized observations to a fusion center. We develop a computationally
tractable support recovery algorithm which minimizes a cost function defined in
terms of the likelihood function and the $l_{1,\infty}$ norm. We observe that
even with noisy 1-bit measurements, jointly sparse support can be recovered
accurately with multiple sensors each collecting only a small number of
measurements.

 <dc:description>  The simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem is considered in
three dimensions. The proposed algorithm, differential geometric SLAM
(DG-SLAM), employs methods from differential geometry to propagate the state
and map estimates. Unlike EKF SLAM, the proposed filter is provably
asymptotically stable under the assumption of no measurement noise or biases.
The robustness of the DG-SLAM algorithm is assessed in simulation with
measurement noise. The simulation demonstrates successful localization and
mapping.

 <dc:description>  Many Big Data applications in business and science require the management and
analysis of huge amounts of graph data. Previous approaches for graph analytics
such as graph databases and parallel graph processing systems (e.g., Pregel)
either lack sufficient scalability or flexibility and expressiveness. We are
therefore developing a new end-to-end approach for graph data management and
analysis based on the Hadoop ecosystem, called Gradoop (Graph analytics on
Hadoop). Gradoop is designed around the so-called Extended Property Graph Data
Model (EPGM) supporting semantically rich, schema-free graph data within many
distinct graphs. A set of high-level operators is provided for analyzing both
single graphs and collections of graphs. Based on these operators, we propose a
domain-specific language to define analytical workflows. The Gradoop graph
store is currently utilizing HBase for distributed storage of graph data in
Hadoop clusters. An initial version of Gradoop has been used to analyze graph
data for business intelligence and social network analysis.

 <dc:description>  There has been significant recent work on the theory and application of
randomized coordinate descent algorithms, beginning with the work of Nesterov
[SIAM J. Optim., 22(2), 2012], who showed that a random-coordinate selection
rule achieves the same convergence rate as the Gauss-Southwell selection rule.
This result suggests that we should never use the Gauss-Southwell rule, as it
is typically much more expensive than random selection. However, the empirical
behaviours of these algorithms contradict this theoretical result: in
applications where the computational costs of the selection rules are
comparable, the Gauss-Southwell selection rule tends to perform substantially
better than random coordinate selection. We give a simple analysis of the
Gauss-Southwell rule showing that---except in extreme cases---it's convergence
rate is faster than choosing random coordinates. Further, in this work we (i)
show that exact coordinate optimization improves the convergence rate for
certain sparse problems, (ii) propose a Gauss-Southwell-Lipschitz rule that
gives an even faster convergence rate given knowledge of the Lipschitz
constants of the partial derivatives, (iii) analyze the effect of approximate
Gauss-Southwell rules, and (iv) analyze proximal-gradient variants of the
Gauss-Southwell rule.

difficulties of students to write scientific papers to present the results of
their research practices. In addition, they repeatedly have doubts about the

providing a kind of guide for computer science students to effectively present

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dense deployment of base stations (BSs) and multi-antenna techniques are
considered key enablers for future mobile networks. Meanwhile, spectrum sharing
techniques and utilization of higher frequency bands make more bandwidth
available. An important question for future system design is which element is
more effective than others. In this paper, we introduce the concept of
technical rate of substitution (TRS) from microeconomics and study the TRS of
spectrum in terms of BS density and antenna number per BS. Numerical results
show that TRS becomes higher with increasing user data rate requirement,
suggesting that spectrum is the most effective means of provisioning extremely
fast mobile broadband.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a multilingual study on, per single post of microblog
text, (a) how much can be said, (b) how much is written in terms of characters
and bytes, and (c) how much is said in terms of information content in posts by
different organizations in different languages. Focusing on three different
languages (English, Chinese, and Japanese), this research analyses Weibo and
Twitter accounts of major embassies and news agencies. We first establish our
criterion for quantifying &quot;how much can be said&quot; in a digital text based on the
openly available Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the translated
subtitles from TED talks. These parallel corpora allow us to determine the
number of characters and bits needed to represent the same content in different
languages and character encodings. We then derive the amount of information
that is actually contained in microblog posts authored by selected accounts on
Weibo and Twitter. Our results confirm that languages with larger character
sets such as Chinese and Japanese contain more information per character than
English, but the actual information content contained within a microblog text
varies depending on both the type of organization and the language of the post.
We conclude with a discussion on the design implications of microblog text
limits for different languages.

 <dc:description>  Recording experiments and decoding algorithms are presented for evaluating
the bit-error-rate of state-of-the-art magnetic bitpatterned media. The
recording experiments are performed with a static tester and conventional
hard-disk-drive heads. As the reader dimensions are larger than the bit
dimensions in both the down-track and the cross-track directions, a
two-dimensional bit decoding algorithm is required. Two such algorithms are
presented in details together with the methodology implemented to accurately
retrieve island positions during recording. Using these techniques, a 1.6
Td/in$^2$ magnetic bit pattern media is demonstrated to support 2D bit error
rates below 1e-2 under shingled magnetic recording conditions.

 <dc:title>A Riemannian low-rank method for optimization over semidefinite matrices
  with block-diagonal constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new algorithm to solve optimization problems of the form $\min
f(X)$ for a smooth function $f$ under the constraints that $X$ is positive
semidefinite and the diagonal blocks of $X$ are small identity matrices. Such
problems often arise as the result of relaxing a rank constraint (lifting). In
particular, many estimation tasks involving phases, rotations, orthonormal
bases or permutations fit in this framework, and so do certain relaxations of
combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut. The proposed algorithm exploits the
facts that (1) such formulations admit low-rank solutions, and (2) their
rank-restricted versions are smooth optimization problems on a Riemannian
manifold. Combining insights from both the Riemannian and the convex geometries
of the problem, we characterize when second-order critical points of the smooth
problem reveal KKT points of the semidefinite problem. We compare against state
of the art, mature software and find that, on certain interesting problem
instances, what we call the staircase method is orders of magnitude faster, is
more accurate and scales better. Code is available.

 <dc:title>On Quantum Generalizations of Information-Theoretic Measures and their

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Information-theoretic measures such as relative entropy and correlation are
extremely useful when modeling or analyzing the interaction of probabilistic
systems. We survey the quantum generalization of 5 such measures and point out
some of their commonalities and interpretations. In particular we find the
application of information theory to distributional semantics useful. By
modeling the distributional meaning of words as density operators rather than
vectors, more of their semantic structure may be exploited. Furthermore,
properties of and interactions between words such as ambiguity, similarity and
entailment can be simulated more richly and intuitively when using methods from
quantum information theory.

 <dc:description>  Bag-of-Distributed-Tasks (BoDT) application is the collection of identical
and independent tasks each of which requires a piece of input data located
around the world. As a result, Cloud computing offers an ef- fective way to
execute BoT application as it not only consists of multiple geographically
distributed data centres but also allows a user to pay for what she actually
uses only. In this paper, BoDT on the Cloud using virtually unlimited cloud
resources. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to find an execution plan that
takes budget constraints into account. Compared with other approaches, with the
same given budget, our algorithm is able to reduce the overall execution time
up to 50%.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the coexistence of two technologies that have
been put forward for the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks, namely,
network-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communications and massive MIMO
(multiple-input multiple-output). Potential benefits of both technologies are
known individually, but the tradeoffs resulting from their coexistence have not
been adequately addressed. To this end, we assume that D2D users reuse the
downlink resources of cellular networks in an underlay fashion. In addition,
multiple antennas at the BS are used in order to obtain precoding gains and
simultaneously support multiple cellular users using multiuser or massive MIMO
technique. Two metrics are considered, namely the average sum rate (ASR) and
energy efficiency (EE). We derive tractable and directly computable expressions
and study the tradeoffs between the ASR and EE as functions of the number of BS
antennas, the number of cellular users and the density of D2D users within a
given coverage area. Our results show that both the ASR and EE behave
differently in scenarios with low and high density of D2D users, and that
coexistence of underlay D2D communications and massive MIMO is mainly
beneficial in low densities of D2D users.

 <dc:title>On Slepian--Wolf Theorem with Interaction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kozachinskiy, Alexander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we study interactive &quot;one-shot&quot; analogues of the classical
Slepian-Wolf theorem. Alice receives a value of a random variable $X$, Bob
receives a value of another random variable $Y$ that is jointly distributed
with $X$. Alice's goal is to transmit $X$ to Bob (with some error probability
$\varepsilon$). Instead of one-way transmission, which is studied in the
classical coding theory, we allow them to interact. They may also use shared
randomness.
  We show, that Alice can transmit $X$ to Bob in expected $H(X|Y) +
2\sqrt{H(X|Y)} + O(\log_2\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right))$ number of bits.
Moreover, we show that every one-round protocol $\pi$ with information
complexity $I$ can be compressed to the (many-round) protocol with expected
communication about $I + 2\sqrt{I}$ bits. This improves a result by Braverman
and Rao \cite{braverman2011information}, where they had $5\sqrt{I}$. Further,
we show how to solve this problem (transmitting $X$) using $3H(X|Y) +
O(\log_2\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right))$ bits and $4$ rounds on average.
This improves a result of~\cite{brody2013towards}, where they had $4H(X|Y) +
O(\log1/\varepsilon)$ bits and 10 rounds on average.
  In the end of the paper we discuss how many bits Alice and Bob may need to
communicate on average besides $H(X|Y)$. The main question is whether the upper
bounds mentioned above are tight. We provide an example of $(X, Y)$, such that
transmission of $X$ from Alice to Bob with error probability $\varepsilon$
requires $H(X|Y) + \Omega\left(\log_2\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)$
bits on average.

 <dc:description>  We introduce two Python frameworks to train neural networks on large
datasets: Blocks and Fuel. Blocks is based on Theano, a linear algebra compiler
with CUDA-support. It facilitates the training of complex neural network models
by providing parametrized Theano operations, attaching metadata to Theano's
symbolic computational graph, and providing an extensive set of utilities to
assist training the networks, e.g. training algorithms, logging, monitoring,
visualization, and serialization. Fuel provides a standard format for machine
learning datasets. It allows the user to easily iterate over large datasets,
performing many types of pre-processing on the fly.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in spatial and temporal networks have enabled researchers to
more-accurately describe many real-world systems such as urban transport
networks. In this paper, we study the response of real-world spatio-temporal
networks to random error and systematic attack, taking a unified view of their
spatial and temporal performance. We propose a model of spatio-temporal paths
in time-varying spatially embedded networks which captures the property that,
as in many real-world systems, interaction between nodes is non-instantaneous
and governed by the space in which they are embedded. Through numerical
experiments on three real-world urban transport systems, we study the effect of
node failure on a network's topological, temporal and spatial structure. We
also demonstrate the broader applicability of this framework to three other
classes of network. To identify weaknesses specific to the behaviour of a
spatio-temporal system, we introduce centrality measures that evaluate the
importance of a node as a structural bridge and its role in supporting
spatio-temporally efficient flows through the network. This exposes the complex
nature of fragility in a spatio-temporal system, showing that there is a
variety of failure modes when a network is subject to systematic attacks.

 <dc:description>  We use first-order perturbation theory to provide a local linear relation
between the circuit parameters and the poles of an RLC network. The sensitivity
matrix, which defines this relationship, is obtained from the systems
eigenvectors and the derivative of its eigenvalues. In general, the sensitivity
matrix is related to the equilibrium fluctuations of the system. In particular,
it may be used as the basis for a statistical model to efficiently predict the
sensitivity of the circuit response to small component variations. The method
is illustrated with a calculation of conditional probabilities by Monte Carlo
Simulation.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies how close random graphs are typically to their
expectations. We interpret this question through the concentration of the
adjacency and Laplacian matrices in the spectral norm. We study inhomogeneous
Erd\&quot;os-R\'enyi random graphs on $n$ vertices, where edges form independently
and possibly with different probabilities $p_{ij}$. Sparse random graphs whose
expected degrees are $o(\log n)$ fail to concentrate; the obstruction is caused
by vertices with abnormally high and low degrees. We show that concentration
can be restored if we regularize the degrees of such vertices, and one can do
this in various ways. As an example, let us reweight or remove enough edges to
make all degrees bounded above by $O(d)$ where $d=\max np_{ij}$. Then we show
that the resulting adjacency matrix $A'$ concentrates with the optimal rate:
$\|A' - \mathbb{E} A\| = O(\sqrt{d})$. Similarly, if we make all degrees
bounded below by $d$ by adding weight $d/n$ to all edges, then the resulting
Laplacian concentrates with the optimal rate: $\|L(A') - L(\mathbb{E} A')\| =
O(1/\sqrt{d})$. Our approach is based on Grothendieck-Pietsch factorization,
using which we construct a new decomposition of random graphs. We illustrate
the concentration results with an application to the community detection
problem in the analysis of networks.

 <dc:description>  We design a new, fast algorithm for agnostically learning univariate
probability distributions whose densities are well approximated by piecewise
polynomial functions. Let $f$ be the density function of an arbitrary
univariate distribution, and suppose that $f$ is $\mathrm{OPT}$-close in
$L_1$-distance to an unknown piecewise polynomial function with $t$ interval
pieces and degree $d$. Our algorithm draws $n = O(t(d+1)/\epsilon^2)$ samples
from $f$, runs in time $\tilde{O}(n \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d))$, and with
probability at least $9/10$ outputs an $O(t)$-piecewise degree-$d$ hypothesis
$h$ that is $4 \cdot \mathrm{OPT} +\epsilon$ close to $f$.
  Our general algorithm yields (nearly) sample-optimal and nearly-linear time
estimators for a wide range of structured distribution families over both
continuous and discrete domains in a unified way. For most of our applications,
these are the first sample-optimal and nearly-linear time estimators in the
literature. As a consequence, our work resolves the sample and computational
complexities of a broad class of inference tasks via a single &quot;meta-algorithm&quot;.
Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm performs very well
in practice.
  Our algorithm consists of three &quot;levels&quot;: (i) At the top level, we employ an
iterative greedy algorithm for finding a good partition of the real line into
the pieces of a piecewise polynomial. (ii) For each piece, we show that the
sub-problem of finding a good polynomial fit on the current interval can be
solved efficiently with a separation oracle method. (iii) We reduce the task of
finding a separating hyperplane to a combinatorial problem and give an
efficient algorithm for this problem. Combining these three procedures gives a
density estimation algorithm with the claimed guarantees.

blocking edge} for $M$ if $x$ is either unmatched or strictly prefers $y$ to
its current partner in $M$, and $y$ is either unmatched or strictly prefers $x$
to its current partner in $M$ or is indifferent between them. A matching is
{\em strongly stable} if there is no blocking edge with respect to it. We
present an algorithm for the generation of all strongly stable matchings, thus
solving an open problem already stated in the book by Gusfield and Irving
\cite{GI}. It has previously been shown that strongly stable matchings form a
distributive lattice and although the number of strongly stable matchings can
be exponential in the number of vertices, we show that there exists a partial
order with $O(m)$ elements representing all strongly stable matchings, where
$m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph. We give two algorithms that
construct two such representations: one in $O(nm^2)$ time and the other in
$O(nm)$ time, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph. Note that
the construction of the second representation has the same time complexity as
that of computing a single strongly stable matching.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce the \emph{robust random number generation} problem
where the goal is to design an abstract tile assembly system (aTAM system)
whose terminal assemblies can be split into $n$ partitions such that a
resulting assembly of the system lies within each partition with probability
1/$n$, regardless of the relative concentration assignment of the tile types in
the system. First, we show this is possible for $n=2$ (a \emph{robust fair coin
flip}) within the aTAM, and that such systems guarantee a worst case
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ space usage. We accompany our primary construction with
variants that show trade-offs in space complexity, initial seed size,
temperature, tile complexity, bias, and extensibility, and also prove some
negative results. As an application, we combine our coin-flip system with a
result of Chandran, Gopalkrishnan, and Reif to show that for any positive
integer $n$, there exists a $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ tile system that assembles a
constant-width linear assembly of expected length $n$ for any concentration
assignment. We then extend our robust fair coin flip result to solve the
problem of robust random number generation in the aTAM for all $n$. Two
variants of robust random bit generation solutions are presented: an unbounded
space solution and a bounded space solution which incurs a small bias. Further,
we consider the harder scenario where tile concentrations change arbitrarily at
each assembly step and show that while this is not possible in the aTAM, the
problem can be solved by exotic tile assembly models from the literature.

 <dc:title>Group buying with bundle discounts: computing efficient, stable and fair

 <dc:description>  We model a market in which nonstrategic vendors sell items of different types
and offer bundles at discounted prices triggered by demand volumes. Each buyer
acts strategically in order to maximize her utility, given by the difference
between product valuation and price paid. Buyers report their valuations in
terms of reserve prices on sets of items, and might be willing to pay prices
different than the market price in order to subsidize other buyers and to
trigger discounts. The resulting price discrimination can be interpreted as a
redistribution of the total discount. We consider a notion of stability that
looks at unilateral deviations, and show that efficient allocations - the ones
maximizing the social welfare - can be stabilized by prices that enjoy
desirable properties of rationality and fairness. These dictate that buyers pay
higher prices only to subsidize others who contribute to the activation of the
desired discounts, and that they pay premiums over the discounted price
proportionally to their surplus - the difference between their current utility
and the utility of their best alternative. Therefore, the resulting price
discrimination appears to be desirable to buyers. Building on this existence
result, and letting N, M and c be the numbers of buyers, vendors and product
types, we propose a O(N^2+NM^c) algorithm that, given an efficient allocation,
computes prices that are rational and fair and that stabilize the market. The
algorithm first determines the redistribution of the discount between groups of
buyers with an equal product choice, and then computes single buyers' prices.
Our results show that if a desirable form of price discrimination is
implemented then social efficiency and stability can coexists in a market
presenting subtle externalities, and computing individual prices from market
prices is tractable.

 <dc:title>Multi-Version Coding - An Information Theoretic Perspective of
  Consistent Distributed Storage</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Zhiying</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Cadambe, Viveck R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In applications of distributed storage systems to distributed computing and
implementation of key- value stores, the following property, usually referred
to as consistency in computer science and engineering, is an important
requirement: as the data stored changes, the latest version of the data must be
accessible to a client that connects to the storage system. An information
theoretic formulation called multi-version coding is introduced in the paper,
in order to study storage costs of consistent distributed storage systems.
Multi-version coding is characterized by {\nu} totally ordered versions of a
message, and a storage system with n servers. At each server, values
corresponding to an arbitrary subset of the {\nu} versions are received and
encoded. For any subset of c servers in the storage system, the value
corresponding to the latest common version, or a later version as per the total
ordering, among the c servers is required to be decodable. An achievable
multi-version code construction via linear coding and a converse result that
shows that the construction is approximately tight, are provided. An
implication of the converse is that there is an inevitable price, in terms of
storage cost, to ensure consistency in distributed storage systems.

 <dc:description>  This paper provides an approximate online adaptive solution to the
infinite-horizon optimal tracking problem for control-affine continuous-time
nonlinear systems with unknown drift dynamics. Model-based reinforcement
learning is used to relax the persistence of excitation condition. Model-based
reinforcement learning is implemented using a concurrent learning-based system
identifier to simulate experience by evaluating the Bellman error over
unexplored areas of the state space. Tracking of the desired trajectory and
convergence of the developed policy to a neighborhood of the optimal policy are
established via Lyapunov-based stability analysis. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique.

 <dc:title>An Iterative On-Line Mechanism for Demand-Side Aggregation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chapman, Archie C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Verbic, Gregor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers a demand-side aggregation scheme specifically for large
numbers of small loads, such as households and small and medium-sized
businesses. We introduce a novel auction format, called a staggered clock-proxy
auction (SCPA), for on-line scheduling of these loads. This is a two phase
format, consisting of: a sequence of overlapping iterative ascending-price
clock auctions, one for each time-slot over a finite decision horizon, and; a
set of proxy auctions that begin at the termination of each individual clock
auction, and which determine the final price and allocation for each time-slot.
The overlapping design of the clock phases grant bidders the ability to
effectively bid on inter-temporal bundles of electricity use, thereby focusing
on the most relevant parts of the price-quantity space. Since electricity is a
divisible good, the proxy auction uses demand-schedule bids, which the
aggregator uses to compute a uniform-price partial competitive equilibrium for
each time slot. We show that, under mild assumptions on the bidders' utilities
functions, the proxy phase implements the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves outcome, which
makes straightforward bidding in the proxy phase a Bayes-Nash equilibrium.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the SCPA in a scenario comprised of household
agents with three different utility function types, and show how the mechanism
enables efficient on-line energy use scheduling.

 <dc:description>  The Continuous Skolem Problem asks whether a real-valued function satisfying
a linear differential equation has a zero in a given interval of real numbers.
This is a fundamental reachability problem for continuous linear dynamical
systems, such as linear hybrid automata and continuous-time Markov chains.
Decidability of the problem is currently open---indeed decidability is open
even for the sub-problem in which a zero is sought in a bounded interval. In
this paper we show decidability of the bounded problem subject to Schanuel's
Conjecture, a unifying conjecture in transcendental number theory. We
furthermore analyse the unbounded problem in terms of the frequencies of the
differential equation, that is, the imaginary parts of the characteristic
roots. We show that the unbounded problem can be reduced to the bounded problem
if there is at most one rationally linearly independent frequency, or if there
are two rationally linearly independent frequencies and all characteristic
roots are simple. We complete the picture by showing that decidability of the
unbounded problem in the case of two (or more) rationally linearly independent
frequencies would entail a major new effectiveness result in Diophantine
approximation, namely computability of the Diophantine-approximation types of
all real algebraic numbers.

 <dc:description>  We present a three-pronged approach to improving Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT), building on recent success in the application of neural
networks to SMT. First, we propose new features based on neural networks to
model various non-local translation phenomena. Second, we augment the
architecture of the neural network with tensor layers that capture important
higher-order interaction among the network units. Third, we apply multitask
learning to estimate the neural network parameters jointly. Each of our
proposed methods results in significant improvements that are complementary.
The overall improvement is +2.7 and +1.8 BLEU points for Arabic-English and
Chinese-English translation over a state-of-the-art system that already
includes neural network features.

 <dc:description>  Can we develop a computer algorithm that assesses the creativity of a
painting given its context within art history? This paper proposes a novel
computational framework for assessing the creativity of creative products, such
as paintings, sculptures, poetry, etc. We use the most common definition of
creativity, which emphasizes the originality of the product and its influential
value. The proposed computational framework is based on constructing a network
between creative products and using this network to infer about the originality
and influence of its nodes. Through a series of transformations, we construct a
Creativity Implication Network. We show that inference about creativity in this
network reduces to a variant of network centrality problems which can be solved
efficiently. We apply the proposed framework to the task of quantifying
creativity of paintings (and sculptures). We experimented on two datasets with
over 62K paintings to illustrate the behavior of the proposed framework. We
also propose a methodology for quantitatively validating the results of the
proposed algorithm, which we call the &quot;time machine experiment&quot;.

 <dc:description>  GROMACS is a widely used package for biomolecular simulation, and over the
last two decades it has evolved from small-scale efficiency to advanced
heterogeneous acceleration and multi-level parallelism targeting some of the
largest supercomputers in the world. Here, we describe some of the ways we have
been able to realize this through the use of parallelization on all levels,
combined with a constant focus on absolute performance. Release 4.6 of GROMACS
uses SIMD acceleration on a wide range of architectures, GPU offloading
acceleration, and both OpenMP and MPI parallelism within and between nodes,
respectively. The recent work on acceleration made it necessary to revisit the
fundamental algorithms of molecular simulation, including the concept of
neighborsearching, and we discuss the present and future challenges we see for
exascale simulation - in particular a very fine-grained task parallelism. We
also discuss the software management, code peer review and continuous
integration testing required for a project of this complexity.

 <dc:description>  Large-scale retrieval systems are often implemented as a cascading sequence
of phases -- a first filtering step, in which a large set of candidate
documents are extracted using a simple technique such as Boolean matching
and/or static document scores; and then one or more ranking steps, in which the
pool of documents retrieved by the filter is scored more precisely using dozens
or perhaps hundreds of different features. The documents returned to the user
are then taken from the head of the final ranked list. Here we examine methods
for measuring the quality of filtering and preliminary ranking stages, and show
how to use these measurements to tune the overall performance of the system.
Standard top-weighted metrics used for overall system evaluation are not
appropriate for assessing filtering stages, since the output is a set of
documents, rather than an ordered sequence of documents. Instead, we use an
approach in which a quality score is computed based on the discrepancy between
filtered and full evaluation. Unlike previous approaches, our methods do not
require relevance judgments, and thus can be used with virtually any query set.
We show that this quality score directly correlates with actual differences in
measured effectiveness when relevance judgments are available. Since the
quality score does not require relevance judgments, it can be used to identify
queries that perform particularly poorly for a given filter. Using these
methods, we explore a wide range of filtering options using thousands of
queries, categorize the relative merits of the different approaches, and
identify useful parameter combinations.

 <dc:description>  When we try to solve a system of linear equations, we can consider a simple
iterative algorithm in which an equation including only one variable is chosen
at each step, and the variable is fixed to the value satisfying the equation.
The dynamics of this algorithm is captured by the peeling algorithm. Analyses
of the peeling algorithm on random hypergraphs are required for many problems,
e.g., the decoding threshold of low-density parity check codes, the inverting
threshold of Goldreich's pseudorandom generator, the load threshold of cuckoo
hashing, etc. In this work, we deal with random hypergraphs including
superlinear number of hyperedges, and derive the tight threshold for the
succeeding of the peeling algorithm. For the analysis, Wormald's method of
differential equations, which is commonly used for analyses of the peeling
algorithm on random hypergraph with linear number of hyperedges, cannot be used
due to the superlinear number of hyperedges. A new method called the evolution
of the moment generating function is proposed in this work.

 <dc:description>  The speed of a quantum random number generator is essential for practical
applications, such as high-speed quantum key distribution systems. Here, we
push the speed of a quantum random number generator to 68 Gbps by operating a
laser around its threshold level. To achieve the rate, not only high-speed
photodetector and high sampling rate are needed, but also a very stable
interferometer is required. A practical interferometer with active feedback
instead of common temperature control is developed to meet requirement of
stability. Phase fluctuations of the laser are measured by the interferometer
with a photodetector, and then digitalized to raw random numbers with a rate of
80 Gbps. The min-entropy of the raw data is evaluated by modeling the system
and is used to quantify the quantum randomness of the raw data. The bias of the
raw data caused by other signals, such as classical and detection noises, can
be removed by Toeplitz-matrix hashing randomness extraction. The final random
numbers can pass through the standard randomness tests. Our demonstration shows
that high-speed quantum random number generators are ready for practical usage.

 <dc:description>  We consider a new family of codes, termed asymmetric Lee distance codes, that
arise in the design and implementation of DNA-based storage systems and systems
with parallel string transmission protocols. The codewords are defined over a
quaternary alphabet, although the results carry over to other alphabet sizes;
furthermore, symbol confusability is dictated by their underlying binary
representation. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we demonstrate that the
new distance represents a linear combination of the Lee and Hamming distance
and derive upper bounds on the size of the codes under this metric based on
linear programming techniques. Second, we propose a number of code
constructions which imply lower bounds.

 <dc:description>  Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries that canextract
implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs. Most of the
navigational query languages used in the RDF community, e.g. property paths in
W3C SPARQL 1.1 and nested regular expressions in nSPARQL, are based on the
regular expressions. It is known that regular expressions have limited
expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generation-queries,
are not expressible with regular expressions. To overcome this limitation, in
this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped
with context-free grammars. The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive
than property paths and nested expressions. The additional expressivity can be
used for modelling graph similarities, graph summarization and ontology
alignment. Despite the increasing expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL still
enjoys a low computational complexity and can be evaluated efficiently.

 <dc:description>  Most of existing rendezvous algorithms generate channel-hopping sequences
based on the whole channel set. They are inefficient when the set of available
channels is a small subset of the whole channel set. We propose a new algorithm
called ZOS which uses three types of elementary sequences (namely, Zero-type,
One-type, and S-type) to generate channel-hopping sequences based on the set of
available channels. ZOS provides guaranteed rendezvous without any additional
requirements. The maximum time-to-rendezvous of ZOS is upper-bounded by
O(m1*m2*log2M) where M is the number of all channels and m1 and m2 are the
numbers of available channels of two users.

 <dc:title>An objective prior that unifies objective Bayes and information-based

 <dc:description>  There are three principle paradigms of statistical inference: (i) Bayesian,
(ii) information-based and (iii) frequentist inference. We describe an
objective prior (the weighting or $w$-prior) which unifies objective Bayes and
information-based inference. The $w$-prior is chosen to make the marginal
probability an unbiased estimator of the predictive performance of the model.
This definition has several other natural interpretations. From the perspective
of the information content of the prior, the $w$-prior is both uniformly and
maximally uninformative. The $w$-prior can also be understood to result in a
uniform density of distinguishable models in parameter space. Finally we
demonstrate the the $w$-prior is equivalent to the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) for regular models in the asymptotic limit. The $w$-prior appears to be
generically applicable to statistical inference and is free of {\it ad hoc}
regularization. The mechanism for suppressing complexity is analogous to AIC:
model complexity reduces model predictivity. We expect this new objective-Bayes
approach to inference to be widely-applicable to machine-learning problems
including singular models.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
employ iterative nonlinear optimization methods to compute an estimate for
robot poses. While these techniques often work well in practice, they do not
provide guarantees on the quality of the estimate. This paper shows that
Lagrangian duality is a powerful tool to assess the quality of a given
candidate solution. Our contribution is threefold. First, we discuss a revised
formulation of the SLAM inference problem. We show that this formulation is
probabilistically grounded and has the advantage of leading to an optimization
problem with quadratic objective. The second contribution is the derivation of
the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem. The SLAM dual problem is a (convex)
semidefinite program, which can be solved reliably and globally by
off-the-shelf solvers. The third contribution is to discuss the relation
between the original SLAM problem and its dual. We show that from the dual
problem, one can evaluate the quality (i.e., the suboptimality gap) of a
candidate SLAM solution, and ultimately provide a certificate of optimality.
Moreover, when the duality gap is zero, one can compute a guaranteed optimal
SLAM solution from the dual problem, circumventing non-convex optimization. We
present extensive (real and simulated) experiments supporting our claims and
discuss practical relevance and open problems.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two new greedy sensor placement algorithms, named minimum
nonzero eigenvalue pursuit (MNEP) and maximal projection on minimum eigenspace
(MPME), for linear inverse problems, with greater emphasis on the MPME
algorithm for performance comparison with existing approaches. We select the
sensing locations one-by-one. In this way, the least number of required sensors
can be determined by checking whether the estimation accuracy is satisfied
after each sensing location is determined. The minimum eigenspace is defined as
the eigenspace associated with the minimum eigenvalue of the dual observation
matrix. For each sensing location, the projection of its observation vector
onto the minimum eigenspace is shown to be monotonically decreasing w.r.t. the
worst case error variance (WCEV) of the estimated parameters. We select the
sensing location whose observation vector has the maximum projection onto the
minimum eigenspace of the current dual observation matrix. The proposed MPME is
shown to be one of the most computationally efficient algorithms. Our
Monte-Carlo simulations showed that MPME outperforms the convex relaxation
method [1], the SparSenSe method [2], and the FrameSense method [3] in terms of
WCEV and the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated parameters, especially
when the number of available sensor nodes is very limited.

 <dc:description>  Convex optimization is a powerful tool for resource allocation and signal
processing in wireless networks. As the network density is expected to
drastically increase in order to accommodate the exponentially growing mobile
data traffic, performance optimization problems are entering a new era
characterized by a high dimension and/or a large number of constraints, which
poses significant design and computational challenges. In this paper, we
present a novel two-stage approach to solve large-scale convex optimization
problems for dense wireless cooperative networks, which can effectively detect
infeasibility and enjoy modeling flexibility. In the proposed approach, the
original large-scale convex problem is transformed into a standard cone
programming form in the first stage via matrix stuffing, which only needs to
copy the problem parameters such as channel state information (CSI) and
quality-of-service (QoS) requirements to the pre-stored structure of the
standard form. The capability of yielding infeasibility certificates and
enabling parallel computing is achieved by solving the homogeneous self-dual
embedding of the primal-dual pair of the standard form. In the solving stage,
the operator splitting method, namely, the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), is adopted to solve the large-scale homogeneous self-dual
embedding. Compared with second-order methods, ADMM can solve large-scale
problems in parallel with modest accuracy within a reasonable amount of time.
Simulation results will demonstrate the speedup, scalability, and reliability
of the proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-art modeling
frameworks and solvers.

 <dc:description>  We reconstruct a controllable model of a person from a large photo collection
that captures his or her {\em persona}, i.e., physical appearance and behavior.
The ability to operate on unstructured photo collections enables modeling a
huge number of people, including celebrities and other well photographed people
without requiring them to be scanned. Moreover, we show the ability to drive or
{\em puppeteer} the captured person B using any other video of a different
person A. In this scenario, B acts out the role of person A, but retains
his/her own personality and character. Our system is based on a novel
combination of 3D face reconstruction, tracking, alignment, and multi-texture
modeling, applied to the puppeteering problem. We demonstrate convincing
results on a large variety of celebrities derived from Internet imagery and
video.

 <dc:description>  The pattern maximum likelihood (PML) estimate, introduced by Orlitsky et al.,
is an estimate of the multiset of probabilities in an unknown probability
distribution $\mathbf{p}$, the estimate being obtained from $n$ i.i.d. samples
drawn from $\mathbf{p}$. The PML estimate involves solving a difficult
optimization problem over the set of all probability mass functions (pmfs) of
finite support. In this paper, we describe an interesting phase transition
phenomenon in the PML estimate: at a certain sharp threshold, the uniform
distribution goes from being a local maximum to being a local minimum for the
optimization problem in the estimate. We go on to consider the question of
whether a similar phase transition phenomenon also exists in the Bethe
approximation of the PML estimate, the latter being an approximation method
with origins in statistical physics. We show that the answer to this question
is a qualified &quot;Yes&quot;. Our analysis involves the computation of the mean and
variance of the $(i,j)$th entry, $a_{i,j}$, in a random $k \times k$
non-negative integer matrix $A$ with row and column sums all equal to $M$,
drawn according to a distribution that assigns to $A$ a probability
proportional to $\prod_{i,j} \frac{(M-a_{i,j})!}{a_{i,j}!}$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce an optimum approach for querying similar images
on large digital-image databases. Our work is based on RBIR (region-based image
retrieval) method which uses multiple regions as the key to retrieval images.
This method significantly improves the accuracy of queries. However, this also
increases the cost of computing. To reduce this expensive computational cost,
we implement binary signature encoder which maps an image to its identification
in binary. In order to fasten the lookup, binary signatures of images are
classified by the help of S-kGraph. Finally, our work is evaluated on COREL's
images.

 <dc:description>  With faster connection speed, Internet users are now making social network a
huge reservoir of texts, images and video clips (GIF). Sentiment analysis for
such online platform can be used to predict political elections, evaluates
economic indicators and so on. However, GIF sentiment analysis is quite
challenging, not only because it hinges on spatio-temporal visual
contentabstraction, but also for the relationship between such abstraction and
final sentiment remains unknown.In this paper, we dedicated to find out such
relationship.We proposed a SentiPairSequence basedspatiotemporal visual
sentiment ontology, which forms the midlevel representations for GIFsentiment.
The establishment process of SentiPair contains two steps. First, we construct
the Synset Forest to define the semantic tree structure of visual sentiment
label elements. Then, through theSynset Forest, we organically select and
combine sentiment label elements to form a mid-level visual sentiment
representation. Our experiments indicate that SentiPair outperforms other
competing mid-level attributes. Using SentiPair, our analysis frameworkcan
achieve satisfying prediction accuracy (72.6%). We also opened ourdataset
(GSO-2015) to the research community. GSO-2015 contains more than 6,000
manually annotated GIFs out of more than 40,000 candidates. Each is labeled
with both sentiment and SentiPair Sequence.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of remote sensing satellites, a huge repository of remotely
sensed images is available. Change detection in remotely sensed images has been
an active research area as it helps us understand the transitions that are
taking place on the Earths surface. This paper discusses the methods and their
classifications proposed by various researchers for change detection. Since use
of soft computing based techniques are now very popular among research
community, this paper also presents a classification based on learning
techniques used in soft-computing methods for change detection.

 <dc:title>Comparing Victims of Phishing and Malware Attacks: Unraveling Risk
  Factors and Possibilities for Situational Crime Prevention</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Leukfeldt, Eric Rutger</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper compares the risk factors for becoming a victim of two types of
phishing: high-tech phishing (using malicious software) and low-tech phishing
(using e-mails and telephone calls). These risk factors are linked to
possibilities for situational crime prevention. Data from a cybercrime victim
survey in the Netherlands (n=10,316) is used. Based on routine activity theory,
the multivariate analyses include thirty variables. The findings show
situational crime prevention has to be aimed at groups other than just the
users themselves. Criminals are primarily interested in popular online places
and the onus is on the owners of these virtual places to protect their visitors
from getting infected.

 <dc:description>  The appearance of large geolocated communication datasets has recently
increased our understanding of how social networks relate to their physical
space. However, many recurrently reported properties, such as the spatial
clustering of network communities, have not yet been systematically tested at
different scales. In this work we analyze the social network structure of over
25 million phone users from three countries at three different scales: country,
provinces and cities. We consistently find that this last urban scenario
presents significant differences to common knowledge about social networks.
First, the emergence of a giant component in the network seems to be controlled
by whether or not the network spans over the entire urban border, almost
independently of the population or geographic extension of the city. Second,
urban communities are much less geographically clustered than expected. These
two findings shed new light on the widely-studied searchability in
self-organized networks. By exhaustive simulation of decentralized search
strategies we conclude that urban networks are searchable not through
geographical proximity as their country-wide counterparts, but through an
homophily-driven community structure.

 <dc:title>Optimal Regret Analysis of Thompson Sampling in Stochastic Multi-armed

 <dc:description>  We discuss a multiple-play multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in which several
arms are selected at each round. Recently, Thompson sampling (TS), a randomized
algorithm with a Bayesian spirit, has attracted much attention for its
empirically excellent performance, and it is revealed to have an optimal regret
bound in the standard single-play MAB problem. In this paper, we propose the
multiple-play Thompson sampling (MP-TS) algorithm, an extension of TS to the
multiple-play MAB problem, and discuss its regret analysis. We prove that MP-TS
for binary rewards has the optimal regret upper bound that matches the regret
lower bound provided by Anantharam et al. (1987). Therefore, MP-TS is the first
computationally efficient algorithm with optimal regret. A set of computer
simulations was also conducted, which compared MP-TS with state-of-the-art
algorithms. We also propose a modification of MP-TS, which is shown to have
better empirical performance.

 <dc:description>  Shape analysis methods have in the past few years become very popular, both
for theoretical exploration as well as from an application point of view.
Originally developed for planar curves, these methods have been expanded to
higher dimensional curves, surfaces, activities, character motions and many
other objects. In this paper, we develop a framework for shape analysis of
curves in Lie groups for problems of computer animations. In particular, we
will use these methods to find cyclic approximations of non-cyclic character
animations and interpolate between existing animations to generate new ones.

 <dc:title>Error Correction for Index Coding With Coded Side Information</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Byrne, Eimear</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Calderini, Marco</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Index coding is a source coding problem in which a broadcaster seeks to meet
the different demands of several users, each of whom is assumed to have some
prior information on the data held by the sender. If the sender knows its
clients' requests and their side-information sets, then the number of packet
transmissions required to satisfy all users' demands can be greatly reduced if
the data is encoded before sending. The collection of side-information indices
as well as the indices of the requested data is described as an instance of the
index coding with side-information (ICSI) problem. The encoding function is
called the index code of the instance, and the number of transmissions employed
by the code is referred to as its length. The main ICSI problem is to determine
the optimal length of an index code for and instance. As this number is hard to
compute, bounds approximating it are sought, as are algorithms to compute
efficient index codes. Two interesting generalizations of the problem that have
appeared in the literature are the subject of this work. The first of these is
the case of index coding with coded side information, in which linear
combinations of the source data are both requested by and held as users'
side-information. The second is the introduction of error-correction in the
problem, in which the broadcast channel is subject to noise.
  In this paper we characterize the optimal length of a scalar or vector linear
index code with coded side information (ICCSI) over a finite field in terms of
a generalized min-rank and give bounds on this number based on constructions of
random codes for an arbitrary instance. We furthermore consider the length of
an optimal error correcting code for an instance of the ICCSI problem and
obtain bounds on this number, both for the Hamming metric and for rank-metric
errors. We describe decoding algorithms for both categories of errors.

 <dc:description>  A significant performance reduction is often observed in speech recognition
when the rate of speech (ROS) is too low or too high. Most of present
approaches to addressing the ROS variation focus on the change of speech
signals in dynamic properties caused by ROS, and accordingly modify the dynamic
model, e.g., the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov model (HMM).
However, an abnormal ROS changes not only the dynamic but also the static
property of speech signals, and thus can not be compensated for purely by
modifying the dynamic model. This paper proposes an ROS learning approach based
on deep neural networks (DNN), which involves an ROS feature as the input of
the DNN model and so the spectrum distortion caused by ROS can be learned and
compensated for. The experimental results show that this approach can deliver
better performance for too slow and too fast utterances, demonstrating our
conjecture that ROS impacts both the dynamic and the static property of speech.
In addition, the proposed approach can be combined with the conventional HMM
transition adaptation method, offering additional performance gains.

 <dc:title>Conspiratorial beliefs observed through entropy principles</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel approach framed in terms of information theory and entropy
to tackle the issue of conspiracy theories propagation. We start with the
report of an event (such as 9/11 terroristic attack) represented as a series of
individual strings of information denoted respectively by two-state variable
Ei=+/-1, i=1,..., N. Assigning Ei value to all strings, the initial order
parameter and entropy are determined. Conspiracy theorists comment on the
report, focusing repeatedly on several strings Ek and changing their meaning
(from -1 to +1). The reading of the event is turned fuzzy with an increased
entropy value. Beyond some threshold value of entropy, chosen by simplicity to
its maximum value, meaning N/2 variables with Ei=1, doubt prevails in the
reading of the event and the chance is created that an alternative theory might
prevail. Therefore, the evolution of the associated entropy is a way to measure
the degree of penetration of a conspiracy theory. Our general framework relies
on online content made voluntarily available by crowds of people, in response
to some news or blog articles published by official news agencies. We apply
different aggregation levels (comment, person, discussion thread) and discuss
the associated patterns of entropy change.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the generalized labeled
multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter by combining the prediction and update into a
single step. In contrast to the original approach which involves separate
truncations in the prediction and update steps, the proposed implementation
requires only one single truncation for each iteration, which can be performed
using a standard ranked optimal assignment algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a
new truncation technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods such as
Gibbs sampling, which drastically reduces the complexity of the filter. The
superior performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive
numerical studies.

 <dc:description>  In the classic gossip-based model of communication for disseminating
information in a network, in each time unit, every node $u$ is allowed to
contact a single random neighbor $v$. If $u$ knows the data (rumor) to be
disseminated, it disperses it to $v$ (known as PUSH) and if it does not, it
requests it from $v$ (known as PULL). While in the classic gossip model, each
node is only allowed to contact a single neighbor in each time unit, each node
can possibly be contacted by many neighboring nodes.
  In the present paper, we consider a restricted model where at each node only
one incoming request can be served. As long as only a single piece of
information needs to be disseminated, this does not make a difference for push
requests. It however has a significant effect on pull requests. In the paper,
we therefore concentrate on this weaker pull version, which we call 'restricted
pull'.
  We distinguish two versions of the restricted pull protocol depending on
whether the request to be served among a set of pull requests at a given node
is chosen adversarially or uniformly at random. As a first result, we prove an
exponential separation between the two variants. We show that there are
instances where if an adversary picks the request to be served, the restricted
pull protocol requires a polynomial number of rounds whereas if the winning
request is chosen uniformly at random, the restricted pull protocol only
requires a polylogarithmic number of rounds to inform the whole network.
Further, as the main technical contribution, we show that if the request to be
served is chosen randomly, the slowdown of using restricted pull versus using
the classic pull protocol can w.h.p. be upper bounded by $O(\Delta / \delta
\log n)$, where $\Delta$ and $\delta$ are the largest and smallest degree of
the network.

 <dc:description>  This article presents an analysis of the influence of context information on
dialog act recognition. We performed experiments on the widely explored
Switchboard corpus, as well as on data annotated according to the recent ISO
24617-2 standard. The latter was obtained from the Tilburg DialogBank and
through the mapping of the annotations of a subset of the Let's Go corpus. We
used a classification approach based on SVMs, which had proved successful in
previous work and allowed us to limit the amount of context information
provided. This way, we were able to observe the influence patterns as the
amount of context information increased. Our base features consisted of
n-grams, punctuation, and wh-words. Context information was obtained from one
to five preceding segments and provided either as n-grams or dialog act
classifications, with the latter typically leading to better results and more
stable influence patterns. In addition to the conclusions about the importance
and influence of context information, our experiments on the Switchboard corpus
also led to results that advanced the state-of-the-art on the dialog act
recognition task on that corpus. Furthermore, the results obtained on data
annotated according to the ISO 24617-2 standard define a baseline for future
work and contribute for the standardization of experiments in the area.

 <dc:title>Machine Learning Based Auto-tuning for Enhanced OpenCL Performance
  Portability</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Heterogeneous computing, which combines devices with different architectures,
is rising in popularity, and promises increased performance combined with
reduced energy consumption. OpenCL has been proposed as a standard for
programing such systems, and offers functional portability. It does, however,
suffer from poor performance portability, code tuned for one device must be
re-tuned to achieve good performance on another device. In this paper, we use
machine learning-based auto-tuning to address this problem. Benchmarks are run
on a random subset of the entire tuning parameter configuration space, and the
results are used to build an artificial neural network based model. The model
can then be used to find interesting parts of the parameter space for further
search. We evaluate our method with different benchmarks, on several devices,
including an Intel i7 3770 CPU, an Nvidia K40 GPU and an AMD Radeon HD 7970
GPU. Our model achieves a mean relative error as low as 6.1%, and is able to
find configurations as little as 1.3% worse than the global minimum.

 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency and its optimization constitute critical tasks in the
design of low-power wireless networks. The present work is devoted to the error
rate analysis and energy-efficiency optimization of regenerative cooperative
networks in the presence of multipath fading under spatial correlation. To this
end, exact and asymptotic analytic expressions are firstly derived for the
symbol-error-rate of $M{-}$ary quadrature amplitude and $M{-}$ary phase shift
keying modulations assuming a dual-hop decode-and-forward relay system,
spatially correlated Nakagami${-}m$ multipath fading and maximum ratio
combining. The derived expressions are subsequently employed in quantifying the
energy consumption of the considered system, incorporating both transmit energy
and the energy consumed by the transceiver circuits, as well as in deriving the
optimal power allocation formulation for minimizing energy consumption under
certain quality-of-service requirements. A relatively harsh path-loss model,
that also accounts for realistic device-to-device communications, is adopted in
numerical evaluations and various useful insights are provided for the design
of future low-energy wireless networks deployments. Indicatively, it is shown
that depending on the degree of spatial correlation, severity of fading,
transmission distance, relay location and power allocation strategy, target
performance can be achieved with large overall energy reduction compared to
direct transmission reference.

 <dc:description>  Peer grading is the process of students reviewing each others' work, such as
homework submissions, and has lately become a popular mechanism used in massive
open online courses (MOOCs). Intrigued by this idea, we used it in a course on
algorithms and data structures at the University of Hamburg. Throughout the
whole semester, students repeatedly handed in submissions to exercises, which
were then evaluated both by teaching assistants and by a peer grading
mechanism, yielding a large dataset of teacher and peer grades. We applied
different statistical and machine learning methods to aggregate the peer grades
in order to come up with accurate final grades for the submissions (supervised
and unsupervised, methods based on numeric scores and ordinal rankings).
Surprisingly, none of them improves over the baseline of using the mean peer
grade as the final grade. We discuss a number of possible explanations for
these results and present a thorough analysis of the generated dataset.

 <dc:title>Deterministic Communication in Radio Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Czumaj, Artur</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Davies, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we improve the deterministic complexity of two fundamental
communication primitives in the classical model of ad-hoc radio networks with
unknown topology: broadcasting and wake-up. We consider an unknown radio
network, in which all nodes have no prior knowledge about network topology, and
know only the size of the network $n$, the maximum in-degree of any node
$\Delta$, and the eccentricity of the network $D$.
  For such networks, we first give an algorithm for wake-up, in both directed
and undirected networks, based on the existence of small universal
synchronizers. This algorithm runs in $O(\frac{\min\{n, D \Delta\} \log n \log
\Delta}{\log\log \Delta})$ time, improving over the previous best $O(n
\log^2n)$-time result across all ranges of parameters, but particularly when
maximum in-degree is small.
  Next, we introduce a new combinatorial framework of block synchronizers and
prove the existence of such objects of low size. Using this framework, we
design a new deterministic algorithm for the fundamental problem of
\emph{broadcasting}, running in $O(n \log D \log\log\frac{D \Delta}{n})$ time.
This is the fastest known algorithm for the problem, improving upon the $O(n
\log n \log \log n)$-time algorithm of De Marco (2010) and the $O(n \log^2
D)$-time algorithm due to Czumaj and Rytter (2003), the previous fastest
results for directed networks. It is also the first to come within a
log-logarithmic factor of the $\Omega(n \log D)$ lower bound due to Clementi et
al. (2003).
  Our results also have direct implications on the fastest deterministic leader
election and clock synchronization algorithms in both directed and undirected
radio networks, tasks which are commonly used as building blocks for more
complex procedures.

 <dc:title>Stochastic And-Or Grammars: A Unified Framework and Logic Perspective</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tu, Kewei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Stochastic And-Or grammars (AOG) extend traditional stochastic grammars of
language to model other types of data such as images and events. In this paper
we propose a representation framework of stochastic AOGs that is agnostic to
the type of the data being modeled and thus unifies various domain-specific
AOGs. Many existing grammar formalisms and probabilistic models in natural
language processing, computer vision, and machine learning can be seen as
special cases of this framework. We also propose a domain-independent inference
algorithm of stochastic context-free AOGs and show its tractability under a
reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we provide two interpretations of
stochastic context-free AOGs as a subset of probabilistic logic, which connects
stochastic AOGs to the field of statistical relational learning and clarifies
their relation with a few existing statistical relational models.

 <dc:description>  This article presents a methodology that automatically derives a
combinatorial specification for a permutation class C, given its basis B of
excluded patterns and the set of simple permutations in C, when these sets are
both finite. This is achieved considering both pattern avoidance and pattern
containment constraints in permutations. The obtained specification yields a
system of equations satisfied by the generating function of C, this system
being always positive and algebraic. It also yields a uniform random sampler of
permutations in C. The method presented is fully algorithmic.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a multiplex proportional-integral approach, for
solving consensus problems in networks of heterogeneous nodes dynamics affected
by constant disturbances. The proportional and integral actions are deployed on
two different layers across the network, each with its own topology. Sufficient
conditions for convergence are derived that depend upon the structure of the
network, the parameters characterizing the control layers and the node
dynamics. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated using a
power network model as a representative example.

 <dc:description>  We answer an open question in the theory of degrees of infinite sequences
with respect to transducibility by finite-state transducers. An initial study
of this partial order of degrees was carried out in (Endrullis, Hendriks, Klop,
2011), but many basic questions remain unanswered. One of the central questions
concerns the existence of atom degrees, other than the degree of the `identity
sequence' 1 0^0 1 0^1 1 0^2 1 0^3 .... A degree is called an `atom' if below it
there is only the bottom degree 0, which consists of the ultimately periodic
sequences. We show that also the degree of the `squares sequence' 1 0^0 1 0^1 1
0^4 1 0^9 1 0^{16} ... is an atom. As the main tool for this result we
characterise the transducts of `spiralling' sequences and their degrees. We use
this to show that every transduct of a `polynomial sequence' either is in 0 or
can be transduced back to a polynomial sequence for a polynomial of the same
order.

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming (PILP) is a rel- atively unexplored
area of Statistical Relational Learning which extends classic Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP). This work introduces SkILL, a Stochastic Inductive Logic
Learner, which takes probabilistic annotated data and produces First Order
Logic theories. Data in several domains such as medicine and bioinformatics
have an inherent degree of uncer- tainty, that can be used to produce models
closer to reality. SkILL can not only use this type of probabilistic data to
extract non-trivial knowl- edge from databases, but it also addresses
efficiency issues by introducing a novel, efficient and effective search
strategy to guide the search in PILP environments. The capabilities of SkILL
are demonstrated in three dif- ferent datasets: (i) a synthetic toy example
used to validate the system, (ii) a probabilistic adaptation of a well-known
biological metabolism ap- plication, and (iii) a real world medical dataset in
the breast cancer domain. Results show that SkILL can perform as well as a
deterministic ILP learner, while also being able to incorporate probabilistic
knowledge that would otherwise not be considered.

 <dc:description>  In analogy to Brownian computers we explicitly show how to construct
stochastic models, which mimic the behaviour of a general purpose computer (a
Turing machine). Our models are discrete state systems obeying a Markovian
master equation, which are logically reversible and have a well-defined and
consistent thermodynamic interpretation. The resulting master equation, which
describes a simple one-step process on an enormously large state space, allows
us to thoroughly investigate the thermodynamics of computation for this
situation. Especially, in the stationary regime we can well approximate the
master equation by a simple Fokker-Planck equation in one dimension. We then
show that the entropy production rate at steady state can be made arbitrarily
small, but the total (integrated) entropy production is finite and grows

 <dc:title>Extreme Compressive Sampling for Covariance Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of estimating the covariance of a collection
of vectors using only extremely compressed measurements of each vector. An
estimator based on back-projections of these compressive samples is proposed
and analyzed. A distribution-free analysis shows that by observing just a
single compressive measurement of each vector, one can consistently estimate
the covariance matrix, in both infinity and spectral norm, and this same
analysis leads to precise rates of convergence in both norms. Via
information-theoretic techniques, lower bounds showing that this estimator is
minimax-optimal for both infinity and spectral norm estimation problems are
established. These results are also specialized to give matching upper and
lower bounds for estimating the population covariance of a collection of
Gaussian vectors, again in the compressive measurement model. The analysis
conducted in this paper shows that the effective sample complexity for this
problem is scaled by a factor of $m^2/d^2$ where $m$ is the compression
dimension and $d$ is the ambient dimension. Applications to subspace learning
(Principal Components Analysis) and learning over distributed sensor networks
are also discussed.

 <dc:title>Compressive Sensing with Prior Support Quality Information and
  Application to Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Temporal Correlation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rao, Xiongbin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lau, Vincent K. N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of compressive sensing (CS) recovery
with a prior support and the prior support quality information available.
Different from classical works which exploit prior support blindly, we shall
propose novel CS recovery algorithms to exploit the prior support adaptively
based on the quality information. We analyze the distortion bound of the
recovered signal from the proposed algorithm and we show that a better quality
prior support can lead to better CS recovery performance. We also show that the
proposed algorithm would converge in $\mathcal{O}\left(\log\mbox{SNR}\right)$
steps. To tolerate possible model mismatch, we further propose some robustness
designs to combat incorrect prior support quality information. Finally, we
apply the proposed framework to sparse channel estimation in massive MIMO
systems with temporal correlation to further reduce the required pilot training
overhead.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation based on user preferences is a common task for e-commerce
websites. New recommendation algorithms are often evaluated by offline
comparison to baseline algorithms such as recommending random or the most
popular items. Here, we investigate how these algorithms themselves perform and
compare to the operational production system in large scale online experiments
in a real-world application. Specifically, we focus on recommending travel
destinations at Booking.com, a major online travel site, to users searching for
their preferred vacation activities. To build ranking models we use
multi-criteria rating data provided by previous users after their stay at a
destination. We implement three methods and compare them to the current
baseline in Booking.com: random, most popular, and Naive Bayes. Our general
conclusion is that, in an online A/B test with live users, our Naive-Bayes
based ranker increased user engagement significantly over the current online
system.

 <dc:description>  Each human face is unique. It has its own shape, topology, and distinguishing
features. As such, developing and testing facial tracking systems are
challenging tasks. The existing face recognition and tracking algorithms in
Computer Vision mainly specify concrete situations according to particular
goals and applications, requiring validation methodologies with data that fits
their purposes. However, a database that covers all possible variations of
external and factors does not exist, increasing researchers' work in acquiring
their own data or compiling groups of databases.
  To address this shortcoming, we propose a methodology for facial data
acquisition through definition of fundamental variables, such as subject
characteristics, acquisition hardware, and performance parameters. Following
this methodology, we also propose two protocols that allow the capturing of
facial behaviors under uncontrolled and real-life situations. As validation, we
executed both protocols which lead to creation of two sample databases: FdMiee
(Facial database with Multi input, expressions, and environments) and FACIA
(Facial Multimodal database driven by emotional induced acting).
  Using different types of hardware, FdMiee captures facial information under
environmental and facial behaviors variations. FACIA is an extension of FdMiee
introducing a pipeline to acquire additional facial behaviors and speech using
an emotion-acting method. Therefore, this work eases the creation of adaptable
database according to algorithm's requirements and applications, leading to
simplified validation and testing processes.

 <dc:description>  As people store more personal data in their smartphones, the consequences of
having it stolen or lost become an increasing concern. A typical
counter-measure to avoid this risk is to set up a secret code that has to be
entered to unlock the device after a period of inactivity. However, for blind
users, PINs and passwords are inadequate, since entry 1) consumes a non-trivial
amount of time, e.g. using screen readers, 2) is susceptible to observation,
where nearby people can see or hear the secret code, and 3) might collide with
social norms, e.g. disrupting personal interactions. Tap-based authentication
methods have been presented and allow unlocking to be performed in a short time
and support naturally occurring inconspicuous behavior (e.g. concealing the
device inside a jacket) by being usable with a single hand. This paper presents
a study with blind users (N = 16) where an authentication method based on tap
phrases is evaluated. Results showed the method to be usable and to support the
desired inconspicuity.

 <dc:description>  Sustained oscillations observed in power systems can damage equipment,
degrade the power quality and increase the risks of cascading blackouts. There
are several mechanisms that can give rise to oscillations, each requiring
different countermeasure to suppress or eliminate the oscillation. This work
develops mathematical framework for analysis of sustained oscillations and
identifies statistical signatures of each mechanism, based on which a novel
oscillation diagnosis method is developed via real-time processing of phasor
measurement units (PMUs) data. Case studies show that the proposed method can
accurately identify the exact mechanism for sustained oscillation, and
meanwhile provide insightful information to locate the oscillation sources.

 <dc:description>  Suppose there is a large collection of items, each with an associated cost
and an inherent utility that is revealed only once we commit to selecting it.
Given a budget on the cumulative cost of the selected items, how can we pick a
subset of maximal value? This task generalizes several important problems such
as multi-arm bandits, active search and the knapsack problem. We present an
algorithm, GP-Select, which utilizes prior knowledge about similarity be- tween
items, expressed as a kernel function. GP-Select uses Gaussian process
prediction to balance exploration (estimating the unknown value of items) and
exploitation (selecting items of high value). We extend GP-Select to be able to
discover sets that simultaneously have high utility and are diverse. Our
preference for diversity can be specified as an arbitrary monotone submodular
function that quantifies the diminishing returns obtained when selecting
similar items. Furthermore, we exploit the structure of the model updates to
achieve an order of magnitude (up to 40X) speedup in our experiments without
resorting to approximations. We provide strong guarantees on the performance of
GP-Select and apply it to three real-world case studies of industrial
relevance: (1) Refreshing a repository of prices in a Global Distribution
System for the travel industry, (2) Identifying diverse, binding-affine
peptides in a vaccine de- sign task and (3) Maximizing clicks in a web-scale
recommender system by recommending items to users.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a natural generalization of the well-known
problems Cluster Editing and Bicluster Editing, whose parameterized versions
have been intensively investigated in the recent literature. The generalized
problem, called Mixed Cluster Editing or ${\cal M}$-Cluster Editing, is
formulated as follows. Let ${\cal M}$ be a family of graphs. Given a graph $G$
and a nonnegative integer $k$, transform $G$, through a sequence of at most $k$
edge editions, into a target graph $G'$ with the following property: $G'$ is a
vertex-disjoint union of graphs $G_1, G_2, \ldots$ such that every $G_i$ is a
member of ${\cal M}$. The graph $G'$ is called a mixed cluster graph or ${\cal
M}$-cluster graph. Let ${\cal K}$ denote the family of complete graphs, ${\cal
KL}$ the family of complete $l$-partite graphs ($l \geq 2$), and $\L={\cal K}
\cup {\cal KL}$. In this work we focus on the case ${\cal M} = {\cal L}$. Using
modular decomposition techniques previously applied to Cluster/Bicluster
Editing, we present a linear-time algorithm to construct a problem kernel for
the parameterized version of ${\cal L}$-Cluster Editing. Keywords: bicluster
graphs, cluster graphs, edge edition problems, edge modification problems,
fixed-parameter tractability, NP-complete problems.

 <dc:description>  The Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) secure key exchange system has been
introduced as a simple, very low cost and efficient classical physical
alternative to quantum key distribution systems. The ideal system uses only a
few electronic components - identical resistor pairs, switches and
interconnecting wires - to guarantee perfectly protected data transmission. We
show that a generalized KLJN system can provide unconditional security even if
it is used with significantly less limitations. The more universal conditions
ease practical realizations considerably and support more robust protection
against attacks. Our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical
simulations.

 <dc:description>  In micro-blogging platforms, people can connect with others and have
conversations on a wide variety of topics. However, because of homophily and
selective exposure, users tend to connect with like-minded people and only read
agreeable information. Motivated by this scenario, in this paper we study the
diversity of intermediary topics, which are latent topics estimated from user
generated content. These topics can be used as features in recommender systems
aimed at introducing people of diverse political viewpoints. We conducted a
case study on Twitter, considering the debate about a sensitive issue in Chile,
where we quantified homophilic behavior in terms of political discussion and
then we evaluated the diversity of intermediary topics in terms of political
stances of users.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we classify and derive closed formulas for geometric elements
of quadrics in rational B\'ezier triangular form (such as the center, the conic
at infinity, the vertex and the axis of paraboloids and the principal planes),
using just the control vertices and the weights for the quadric patch. The
results are extended also to quadric tensor product patches. Our results rely
on using techniques from projective algebraic geometry to find suitable
bilinear forms for the quadric in a coordinate-free fashion, considering a
pencil of quadrics that are tangent to the given quadric along a conic. Most of
the information about the quadric is encoded in one coefficient, involving the
weights of the patch, which allows us to tell apart oval from ruled quadrics.
This coefficient is also relevant to determine the affine type of the quadric.
Spheres and quadrics of revolution are characterised within this framework.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a pre-processing and a distance which improve the
performance of machine learning algorithms working on independent and
identically distributed stochastic processes. We introduce a novel
non-parametric approach to represent random variables which splits apart
dependency and distribution without losing any information. We also propound an
associated metric leveraging this representation and its statistical estimate.
Besides experiments on synthetic datasets, the benefits of our contribution is
illustrated through the example of clustering financial time series, for
instance prices from the credit default swaps market. Results are available on
the website www.datagrapple.com and an IPython Notebook tutorial is available
at www.datagrapple.com/Tech for reproducible research.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces &quot;swiveled Renyi entropies&quot; as an alternative to the
Renyi entropic quantities put forward in [Berta et al., Phys. Rev. A 91, 022333
(2015)]. What distinguishes the swiveled Renyi entropies from the prior
proposal of Berta et al. is that there is an extra degree of freedom: an
optimization over unitary rotations with respect to particular fixed bases
(swivels). A consequence of this extra degree of freedom is that the swiveled
Renyi entropies are ordered, which is an important property of the Renyi family
of entropies. The swiveled Renyi entropies are however generally discontinuous
at $\alpha=1$ and do not converge to the von Neumann entropy-based measures in
the limit as $\alpha\rightarrow1$, instead bounding them from above and below.
Particular variants reduce to known Renyi entropies, such as the Renyi relative
entropy or the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy, but also lead to ordered
Renyi conditional mutual informations and ordered Renyi generalizations of a
relative entropy difference. Refinements of entropy inequalities such as
monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity follow as a
consequence of the aforementioned properties of the swiveled Renyi entropies.
Due to the lack of convergence at $\alpha=1$, it is unclear whether the
swiveled Renyi entropies would be useful in one-shot information theory, so
that the present contribution represents partial progress toward this goal.

 <dc:description>  In this tutorial, the basics of game theory are introduced along with an
overview of its most recent and emerging applications in signal processing. One
of the main features of this contribution is to gather in a single paper some
fundamental game-theoretic notions and tools which, over the past few years,
have become widely spread over a large number of papers. In particular, both
strategic-form and coalition-form games are described in details while the key
connections and differences between them are outlined. Moreover, a particular
attention is also devoted to clarify the connections between strategic-form
games and distributed optimization and learning algorithms. Beyond an
introduction to the basic concepts and main solution approaches, several
carefully designed examples are provided to allow a better understanding of how
to apply the described tools.

 <dc:description>  The threshold model is a simple but classic model of contagion spreading in
complex social systems. To capture the complex nature of social influencing we
investigate numerically and analytically the transition in the behavior of
threshold-limited cascades in the presence of multiple initiators as the
distribution of thresholds is varied between the two extreme cases of identical
thresholds and a uniform distribution. We accomplish this by employing a
truncated normal distribution of the nodes' thresholds and observe a
non-monotonic change in the cascade size as we vary the standard deviation.
Further, for a sufficiently large spread in the threshold distribution, the
tipping-point behavior of the social influencing process disappears and is
replaced by a smooth crossover governed by the size of initiator set. We
demonstrate that for a given size of the initiator set, there is a specific
variance of the threshold distribution for which an opinion spreads optimally.
Furthermore, in the case of synthetic graphs we show that the spread
asymptotically becomes independent of the system size, and that global cascades
can arise just by the addition of a single node to the initiator set.

 <dc:title>Unsupervised Learning on Neural Network Outputs: with Application in
  Zero-shot Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lu, Yao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The outputs of a trained neural network contain much richer information than
just an one-hot classifier. For example, a neural network might give an image
of a dog the probability of one in a million of being a cat but it is still
much larger than the probability of being a car. To reveal the hidden structure
in them, we apply two unsupervised learning algorithms, PCA and ICA, to the
outputs of a deep Convolutional Neural Network trained on the ImageNet of 1000
classes. The PCA/ICA embedding of the object classes reveals their visual
similarity and the PCA/ICA components can be interpreted as common visual
features shared by similar object classes. For an application, we proposed a
new zero-shot learning method, in which the visual features learned by PCA/ICA
are employed. Our zero-shot learning method achieves the state-of-the-art
results on the ImageNet of over 20000 classes.

 <dc:title>One-Bit Compressive Sensing with Partial Support</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Compressive Sensing framework maintains relevance even when the available
measurements are subject to extreme quantization, as is exemplified by the
so-called one-bit compressed sensing framework which aims to recover a signal
from measurements reduced to only their sign-bit. In applications, it is often
the case that we have some knowledge of the structure of the signal beforehand,
and thus would like to leverage it to attain more accurate and efficient
recovery. This work explores avenues for incorporating such partial-support
information into the one-bit setting. Experimental results demonstrate that
newly proposed methods of this work yield improved signal recovery even for
varying levels of accuracy in the prior information. This work is thus the
first to provide recovery mechanisms that efficiently use prior signal
information in the one-bit reconstruction setting.

 <dc:description>  This paper tackles the problem of endogenous link prediction for Knowledge
Base completion. Knowledge Bases can be represented as directed graphs whose
nodes correspond to entities and edges to relationships. Previous attempts
either consist of powerful systems with high capacity to model complex
connectivity patterns, which unfortunately usually end up overfitting on rare
relationships, or in approaches that trade capacity for simplicity in order to
fairly model all relationships, frequent or not. In this paper, we propose
Tatec a happy medium obtained by complementing a high-capacity model with a
simpler one, both pre-trained separately and then combined. We present several
variants of this model with different kinds of regularization and combination
strategies and show that this approach outperforms existing methods on
different types of relationships by achieving state-of-the-art results on four
benchmarks of the literature.

 <dc:description>  In applied game theory the motivation of players is a key element. It is
encoded in the payoffs of the game form and often based on utility functions.
But there are cases were formal descriptions in the form of a utility function
do not exist. In this paper we introduce a representation of games where
players' goals are modeled based on so-called higher-order functions. Our
representation provides a general and powerful way to mathematically summarize
players' intentions. In our framework utility functions as well as preference
relations are special cases to describe players' goals. We show that in
higher-order functions formal descriptions of players may still exist where
utility functions do not using a classical example, a variant of Keynes' beauty
contest. We also show that equilibrium conditions based on Nash can be easily
adapted to our framework. Lastly, this framework serves as a stepping stone to
powerful tools from computer science that can be usefully applied to economic
game theory in the future such as computational and computability aspects.

 <dc:description>  Classical decision theory models behaviour in terms of utility maximisation
where utilities represent rational preference relations over outcomes. However,
empirical evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that we need to go
beyond this framework. We propose to represent goals by higher-order functions
or operators that take other functions as arguments where the max and argmax
operators are special cases. Our higher-order functions take a context function
as their argument where a context represents a process from actions to
outcomes. By that we can define goals being dependent on the actions and the
process in addition to outcomes only. This formulation generalises outcome
based preferences to context-dependent goals. We show how to uniformly
represent within our higher-order framework classical utility maximisation but
also various other extensions that have been debated in economics.

 <dc:description>  Distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) combines the array
gain of coherent MIMO processing with the proximity gains of distributed
antenna setups. In this paper, we analyze how transceiver hardware impairments
affect the downlink with maximum ratio transmission. We derive closed-form
spectral efficiencies expressions and study their asymptotic behavior as the
number of the antennas increases. We prove a scaling law on the hardware
quality, which reveals that massive MIMO is resilient to additive distortions,
while multiplicative phase noise is a limiting factor. It is also better to
have separate oscillators at each antenna than one per BS.

 <dc:description>  Conventional TCP performance is significantly impaired under long latency
and/or constrained bandwidth. While small Pacific Island states on satellite
links experience this in the extreme, small populations and remoteness often
rule out submarine fibre connections and their communities struggle to reap the
benefits of the Internet. Network-coded TCP (TCP/NC) can increase goodput under
high latency and packet loss, but has not been used to tunnel conventional TCP
and UDP across satellite links before. We report on a feasibility study aimed
at determining expected goodput gain across such TCP/NC tunnels into island
targets on geostationary and medium earth orbit satellite links.

 <dc:description>  How would a cellular network designed for high energy efficiency look like?
To answer this fundamental question, we model cellular networks using
stochastic geometry and optimize the energy efficiency with respect to the
density of base stations, the number of antennas and users per cell, the
transmit power levels, and the pilot reuse. The highest efficiency is neither
achieved by a pure small-cell approach, nor by a pure massive MIMO solution.
Interestingly, it is the combination of these approaches that provides the
highest energy efficiency; small cells contributes by reducing the propagation
losses while massive MIMO enables multiplexing of users with controlled

 <dc:description>  The conventional control paradigm for a heat pump with a less efficient
auxiliary heating element is to keep its temperature set point constant during
the day. This constant temperature set point ensures that the heat pump
operates in its more efficient heat-pump mode and minimizes the risk of
activating the less efficient auxiliary heating element. As an alternative to a
constant set-point strategy, this paper proposes a learning agent for a
thermostat with a set-back strategy. This set-back strategy relaxes the
set-point temperature during convenient moments, e.g. when the occupants are
not at home. Finding an optimal set-back strategy requires solving a sequential
decision-making process under uncertainty, which presents two challenges. A
first challenge is that for most residential buildings a description of the
thermal characteristics of the building is unavailable and challenging to
obtain. A second challenge is that the relevant information on the state, i.e.
the building envelope, cannot be measured by the learning agent. In order to
overcome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with
a batch reinforcement learning technique. The proposed approach is validated
for two building types with different thermal characteristics for heating in
the winter and cooling in the summer. The simulation results indicate that the
proposed learning agent can reduce the energy consumption by 4-9% during 100
winter days and by 9-11% during 80 summer days compared to the conventional
constant set-point strategy

 <dc:title>Performing Bayesian Risk Aggregation using Discrete Approximation
  Algorithms with Graph Factorization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lin, Peng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Risk aggregation is a popular method used to estimate the sum of a collection
of financial assets or events, where each asset or event is modelled as a
random variable. Applications, in the financial services industry, include
insurance, operational risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis, but the
problem is widely encountered in many other application domains. This thesis
has contributed two algorithms to perform Bayesian risk aggregation when model
exhibit hybrid dependency and high dimensional inter-dependency. The first
algorithm operates on a subset of the general problem, with an emphasis on
convolution problems, in the presence of continuous and discrete variables (so
called hybrid models) and the second algorithm offer a universal method for
general purpose inference over much wider classes of Bayesian Network models.

 <dc:description>  Natural language generation of coherent long texts like paragraphs or longer
documents is a challenging problem for recurrent networks models. In this
paper, we explore an important step toward this generation task: training an
LSTM (Long-short term memory) auto-encoder to preserve and reconstruct
multi-sentence paragraphs. We introduce an LSTM model that hierarchically
builds an embedding for a paragraph from embeddings for sentences and words,
then decodes this embedding to reconstruct the original paragraph. We evaluate
the reconstructed paragraph using standard metrics like ROUGE and Entity Grid,
showing that neural models are able to encode texts in a way that preserve
syntactic, semantic, and discourse coherence. While only a first step toward
generating coherent text units from neural models, our work has the potential
to significantly impact natural language generation and
summarization\footnote{Code for the three models described in this paper can be

 <dc:description>  We consider proportional fair rate allocation in a heterogeneous network with
a mix of LTE and 802.11 cells which supports multipath and multihomed operation
(simultaneous connection of a user device to multiple LTE BSs and 802.11 APs).
We show that the utility fair optimisation problem is non-convex but that a
global optimum can be found by solving a sequence of convex optimisations in a
distributed fashion. The result is a principled approach to offload from LTE to
802.11 and for exploiting LTE/802.11 path diversity to meet user traffic
demands.

 <dc:description>  As we aim at alleviating the curse of high-dimensionality, subspace learning
is becoming more popular. Existing approaches use either information about
global or local structure of the data, and few studies simultaneously focus on
global and local structures as the both of them contain important information.
In this paper, we propose a global and local structure preserving sparse
subspace learning (GLoSS) model for unsupervised feature selection. The model
can simultaneously realize feature selection and subspace learning. In
addition, we develop a greedy algorithm to establish a generic combinatorial
model, and an iterative strategy based on an accelerated block coordinate
descent is used to solve the GLoSS problem. We also provide whole iterate
sequence convergence analysis of the proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive
experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to show the superiority of the
proposed approach over several state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection
approaches.

 <dc:title>Quizz: Targeted crowdsourcing with a billion (potential) users</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We describe Quizz, a gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously
assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them. Quizz
operates by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a
user answers the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the user's competence. To
acquire new knowledge, Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not
have a known answer; the answers given by competent users provide useful
signals for selecting the correct answers for these questions. Quizz actively
tries to identify knowledgeable users on the Internet by running advertising
campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting capabilities of existing,
publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies the contributions
of the users using information theory and sends feedback to the
advertisingsystem about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting
mechanism to further optimize ad placement.
  Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand users, confirm that we can
crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized topics, as the
advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired expertise
and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that examine
the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for having
short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute.
Finally, our cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is
below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while
offering the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential
users all over the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized
expertise that is not typically available through existing labor marketplaces.

 <dc:description>  While neural networks have been successfully applied to many NLP tasks the
resulting vector-based models are very difficult to interpret. For example it's
not clear how they achieve {\em compositionality}, building sentence meaning
from the meanings of words and phrases. In this paper we describe four
strategies for visualizing compositionality in neural models for NLP, inspired
by similar work in computer vision. We first plot unit values to visualize
compositionality of negation, intensification, and concessive clauses, allow us
to see well-known markedness asymmetries in negation. We then introduce three
simple and straightforward methods for visualizing a unit's {\em salience}, the
amount it contributes to the final composed meaning: (1) gradient
back-propagation, (2) the variance of a token from the average word node, (3)
LSTM-style gates that measure information flow. We test our methods on
sentiment using simple recurrent nets and LSTMs. Our general-purpose methods
may have wide applications for understanding compositionality and other
semantic properties of deep networks , and also shed light on why LSTMs
outperform simple recurrent nets,

 <dc:description>  Neuromorphic systems that densely integrate CMOS spiking neurons and
nano-scale memristor synapses open a new avenue of brain-inspired computing.
Existing silicon neurons have molded neural biophysical dynamics but are
incompatible with memristor synapses, or used extra training circuitry thus
eliminating much of the density advantages gained by using memristors, or were
energy inefficient. Here we describe a novel CMOS spiking leaky
integrate-and-fire neuron circuit. Building on a reconfigurable architecture
with a single opamp, the described neuron accommodates a large number of
memristor synapses, and enables online spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
learning with optimized power consumption. Simulation results of an 180nm CMOS
design showed 97% power efficiency metric when realizing STDP learning in
10,000 memristor synapses with a nominal 1M{\Omega} memristance, and only
13{\mu}A current consumption when integrating input spikes. Therefore, the
described CMOS neuron contributes a generalized building block for large-scale
brain-inspired neuromorphic systems.

 <dc:title>Do Multi-Sense Embeddings Improve Natural Language Understanding?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Learning a distinct representation for each sense of an ambiguous word could
lead to more powerful and fine-grained models of vector-space representations.
Yet while `multi-sense' methods have been proposed and tested on artificial
word-similarity tasks, we don't know if they improve real natural language
understanding tasks. In this paper we introduce a multi-sense embedding model
based on Chinese Restaurant Processes that achieves state of the art
performance on matching human word similarity judgments, and propose a
pipelined architecture for incorporating multi-sense embeddings into language
understanding.
  We then test the performance of our model on part-of-speech tagging, named
entity recognition, sentiment analysis, semantic relation identification and
semantic relatedness, controlling for embedding dimensionality. We find that
multi-sense embeddings do improve performance on some tasks (part-of-speech
tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness) but not on
others (named entity recognition, various forms of sentiment analysis). We
discuss how these differences may be caused by the different role of word sense
information in each of the tasks. The results highlight the importance of
testing embedding models in real applications.

 <dc:description>  In pattern mining, the main challenge is the exponential explosion of the set
of patterns. Typically, to solve this problem, a constraint for pattern
selection is introduced. One of the first constraints proposed in pattern
mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is an
anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its
superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern
selection are not (anti-)monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate
patterns satisfying these constraints. In this paper we introduce the notion of
projection-antimonotonicity and $\theta$-$\Sigma\o\phi\iota\alpha$ algorithm
that allows efficient generation of the best patterns for some nonmonotonic
constraints. In this paper we consider stability and $\Delta$-measure, which
are nonmonotonic constraints, and apply them to interval tuple datasets. In the
experiments, we compute best interval tuple patterns w.r.t. these measures and
show the advantage of our approach over postfiltering approaches.

 <dc:description>  A neuromorphic chip that combines CMOS analog spiking neurons and memristive
synapses offers a promising solution to brain-inspired computing, as it can
provide massive neural network parallelism and density. Previous hybrid analog
CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and
thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of
memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and
post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe
a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses
to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines
integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements
competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in-situ
plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits
recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit
simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it
realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient
brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive
computing.

 <dc:description>  Whole Body Operational Space Control (WBOSC) is a pioneering algorithm in the
field of human-centered Whole-Body Control (WBC). It enables floating-base
highly-redundant robots to achieve unified motion/force control of one or more
operational space objectives while adhering to physical constraints. Limited
studies exist on the software architecture and APIs that enable WBOSC to
perform and be integrated into a larger system. In this paper we address this
by presenting ControlIt!, a new open-source software framework for WBOSC.
Unlike previous implementations, ControlIt! is multi-threaded to increase servo
frequencies on standard PC hardware. A new parameter binding mechanism enables
tight integration between ControlIt! and external processes via an extensible
set of transport protocols. To support a new robot, only two plugins and a URDF
model needs to be provided --- the rest of ControlIt! remains unchanged. New
WBC primitives can be added by writing a Task or Constraint plugin.
ControlIt!'s capabilities are demonstrated on Dreamer, a 16-DOF torque
controlled humanoid upper body robot containing both series elastic and
co-actuated joints, and using it to perform a product disassembly task. Using
this testbed, we show that ControlIt! can achieve average servo latencies of
about 0.5ms when configured with two Cartesian position tasks, two orientation
tasks, and a lower priority posture task. This is significantly higher than the
5ms that was achieved using UTA-WBC, the prototype implementation of WBOSC that
is both application and platform-specific. Variations in the product's position
is handled by updating the goal of the Cartesian position task. ControlIt!'s
source code is released under an LGPL license and we hope it will be adopted
and maintained by the WBC community for the long term as a platform for WBC
development and integration.

 <dc:title>On bicluster aggregation and its benefits for enumerative solutions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Biclustering involves the simultaneous clustering of objects and their
attributes, thus defining local two-way clustering models. Recently, efficient
algorithms were conceived to enumerate all biclusters in real-valued datasets.
In this case, the solution composes a complete set of maximal and non-redundant
biclusters. However, the ability to enumerate biclusters revealed a challenging
scenario: in noisy datasets, each true bicluster may become highly fragmented
and with a high degree of overlapping. It prevents a direct analysis of the
obtained results. To revert the fragmentation, we propose here two approaches
for properly aggregating the whole set of enumerated biclusters: one based on
single linkage and the other directly exploring the rate of overlapping. Both
proposals were compared with each other and with the actual state-of-the-art in
several experiments, and they not only significantly reduced the number of
biclusters but also consistently increased the quality of the solution.

 <dc:title>An Improved Upper Bound on Maximal Clique Listing via Rectangular Fast
  Matrix Multiplication</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The first output-sensitive algorithm for the Maximal Clique Listing problem
was given by Tsukiyama et.al. in 1977. As any algorithm falling within the
Reverse Search paradigm, it performs a DFS visit of a directed tree (the
RS-tree) having the objects to be listed (i.e. maximal cliques) as its nodes.
In a recursive implementation, the RS-tree corresponds to the recursion tree of
the algorithm. The time delay is given by the cost of generating the next child
of a node, and Tsukiyama showed it is $O(mn)$. In 2004, Makino and Uno
sharpened the time delay to $O(n^{\omega})$ by generating all the children of a
node in one single shot performed by computing a \emph{square} fast matrix
multiplication. In this paper, we further improve the asymptotics for the
exploration of the same RS-tree by grouping the offsprings' computation even
further. Our idea is to rely on rectangular fast matrix multiplication in order
to compute all children of $n^2$ nodes in one shot. According to the current
upper bounds on fast matrix multiplication, with this the time delay improves
from $O(n^{2.3728639})$ to $O(n^{2.093362})$.

 <dc:description>  We initiate a study of a relaxed version of the standard Erdos-Renyi random
graph model, where each edge may depend on a few other edges. We call such
graphs &quot;dependent random graphs&quot;. Our main result in this direction is a
thorough understanding of the clique number of dependent random graphs. We also
obtain bounds for the chromatic number. Surprisingly, many of the standard
properties of random graphs also hold in this relaxed setting. We show that
with high probability, a dependent random graph will contain a clique of size
$\frac{(1-o(1))\log n}{\log(1/p)}$, and the chromatic number will be at most
$\frac{n \log(1/1-p)}{\log n}$.
  As an application and second main result, we give a new communication
protocol for the k-player Multiparty Pointer Jumping (MPJ_k) problem in the
number-on-the-forehead (NOF) model. Multiparty Pointer Jumping is one of the
canonical NOF communication problems, yet even for three players, its
communication complexity is not well understood. Our protocol for MPJ_3 costs
$O(\frac{n\log\log n}{\log n})$ communication, improving on a bound of Brody
and Chakrabarti [BC08]. We extend our protocol to the non-Boolean pointer
jumping problem $\widehat{MPJ}_k$, achieving an upper bound which is o(n) for
any $k &gt;= 4$ players. This is the first o(n) bound for $\widehat{MPJ}_k$ and
improves on a bound of Damm, Jukna, and Sgall [DJS98] which has stood for
almost twenty years.

 <dc:title>A Convex Optimization Approach to Smooth Trajectories for Motion

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the recent past, several sampling-based algorithms have been proposed to
compute trajectories that are collision-free and dynamically-feasible. However,
the outputs of such algorithms are notoriously jagged. In this paper, by
focusing on robots with car-like dynamics, we present a fast and simple
heuristic algorithm, named Convex Elastic Smoothing (CES) algorithm, for
trajectory smoothing and speed optimization. The CES algorithm is inspired by
earlier work on elastic band planning and iteratively performs shape and speed
optimization. The key feature of the algorithm is that both optimization
problems can be solved via convex programming, making CES particularly fast. A
range of numerical experiments show that the CES algorithm returns high-quality
solutions in a matter of a few hundreds of milliseconds and hence appears
amenable to a real-time implementation.

 <dc:title>Bilinear Random Projections for Locality-Sensitive Binary Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Saehoon</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a popular data-independent indexing
method for approximate similarity search, where random projections followed by
quantization hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the
probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each
other than for those that are far apart. Most of high-dimensional visual
descriptors for images exhibit a natural matrix structure. When visual
descriptors are represented by high-dimensional feature vectors and long binary
codes are assigned, a random projection matrix requires expensive complexities
in both space and time. In this paper we analyze a bilinear random projection
method where feature matrices are transformed to binary codes by two smaller
random projection matrices. We base our theoretical analysis on extending
Raginsky and Lazebnik's result where random Fourier features are composed with
random binary quantizers to form locality sensitive binary codes. To this end,
we answer the following two questions: (1) whether a bilinear random projection
also yields similarity-preserving binary codes; (2) whether a bilinear random
projection yields performance gain or loss, compared to a large linear
projection. Regarding the first question, we present upper and lower bounds on
the expected Hamming distance between binary codes produced by bilinear random
projections. In regards to the second question, we analyze the upper and lower
bounds on covariance between two bits of binary codes, showing that the
correlation between two bits is small. Numerical experiments on MNIST and
Flickr45K datasets confirm the validity of our method.

 <dc:description>  Path queries on a knowledge graph can be used to answer compositional
questions such as &quot;What languages are spoken by people living in Lisbon?&quot;.
However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts (edges) which disrupts path
queries. Recent models for knowledge base completion impute missing facts by
embedding knowledge graphs in vector spaces. We show that these models can be
recursively applied to answer path queries, but that they suffer from cascading
errors. This motivates a new &quot;compositional&quot; training objective, which
dramatically improves all models' ability to answer path queries, in some cases
more than doubling accuracy. On a standard knowledge base completion task, we
also demonstrate that compositional training acts as a novel form of structural
regularization, reliably improving performance across all base models (reducing
errors by up to 43%) and achieving new state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  We consider the communication capacity of wireline networks for a two-unicast
traffic pattern. The network has two sources and two destinations with each
source communicating a message to its own destination, subject to the capacity
constraints on the directed edges of the network. We propose a simple outer
bound for the problem that we call the Generalized Network Sharing (GNS) bound.
We show this bound is the tightest edge-cut bound for two-unicast networks and
is tight in several bottleneck cases, though it is not tight in general. We
also show that the problem of computing the GNS bound is NP-complete. Finally,
we show that despite its seeming simplicity, the two-unicast problem is as hard
as the most general network coding problem. As a consequence, linear coding is
insufficient to achieve capacity for general two-unicast networks, and
non-Shannon inequalities are necessary for characterizing capacity of general
two-unicast networks.

 <dc:description>  Resource scheduling in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is one of the keys
for large-scale Cloud applications. Extensive research on all issues in real
environment is extremely difficult because it requires developers to consider
network infrastructure and the environment, which may be beyond the control. In
addition, the network conditions cannot be controlled or predicted. Performance
evaluations of workload models and Cloud provisioning algorithms in a
repeatable manner under different configurations are difficult. Therefore,
simulators are developed. To understand and apply better the state-of-the-art
of cloud computing simulators, and to improve them, we study four known
open-source simulators. They are compared in terms of architecture, modeling
elements, simulation process, performance metrics and scalability in
performance. Finally, a few challenging issues as future research trends are
outlined.

 <dc:description>  For a learning task, data can usually be collected from different sources or
be represented from multiple views. For example, laboratory results from
different medical examinations are available for disease diagnosis, and each of
them can only reflect the health state of a person from a particular
aspect/view. Therefore, different views provide complementary information for
learning tasks. An effective integration of the multi-view information is
expected to facilitate the learning performance. In this paper, we propose a
general predictor, named multi-view machines (MVMs), that can effectively
include all the possible interactions between features from multiple views. A
joint factorization is embedded for the full-order interaction parameters which
allows parameter estimation under sparsity. Moreover, MVMs can work in
conjunction with different loss functions for a variety of machine learning
tasks. A stochastic gradient descent method is presented to learn the MVM
model. We further illustrate the advantages of MVMs through comparison with
other methods for multi-view classification, including support vector machines
(SVMs), support tensor machines (STMs) and factorization machines (FMs).

 <dc:title>Multi-Objective Optimization for Self-Adjusting Weighted Gradient in

 <dc:description>  Much of the focus in machine learning research is placed in creating new
architectures and optimization methods, but the overall loss function is seldom
questioned. This paper interprets machine learning from a multi-objective
optimization perspective, showing the limitations of the default linear
combination of loss functions over a data set and introducing the hypervolume
indicator as an alternative. It is shown that the gradient of the hypervolume
is defined by a self-adjusting weighted mean of the individual loss gradients,
making it similar to the gradient of a weighted mean loss but without requiring
the weights to be defined a priori. This enables an inner boosting-like
behavior, where the current model is used to automatically place higher weights
on samples with higher losses but without requiring the use of multiple models.
Results on a denoising autoencoder show that the new formulation is able to
achieve better mean loss than the direct optimization of the mean loss,
providing evidence to the conjecture that self-adjusting the weights creates a
smoother loss surface.

 <dc:description>  We present a new and effective approach for Hyperspectral Image (HSI)
classification and clutter detection, overcoming a few long-standing challenges
presented by HSI data characteristics. Residing in a high-dimensional spectral
attribute space, HSI data samples are known to be strongly correlated in their
spectral signatures, exhibit nonlinear structure due to several physical laws,
and contain uncertainty and noise from multiple sources. In the presented
approach, we generate an adaptive, structurally enriched representation
environment, and employ the locally linear embedding (LLE) in it. There are two
structure layers external to LLE. One is feature space embedding: the HSI data
attributes are embedded into a discriminatory feature space where
spatio-spectral coherence and distinctive structures are distilled and
exploited to mitigate various difficulties encountered in the native
hyperspectral attribute space. The other structure layer encloses the ranges of
algorithmic parameters for LLE and feature embedding, and supports a
multiplexing and integrating scheme for contending with multi-source
uncertainty. Experiments on two commonly used HSI datasets with a small number
of learning samples have rendered remarkably high-accuracy classification
results, as well as distinctive maps of detected clutter regions.

 <dc:description>  Over the last years, dictionary learning method has been extensively applied
to deal with various computer vision recognition applications, and produced
state-of-the-art results. However, when the data instances of a target domain
have a different distribution than that of a source domain, the dictionary
learning method may fail to perform well. In this paper, we address the
cross-domain visual recognition problem and propose a simple but effective
unsupervised domain adaption approach, where labeled data are only from source
domain. In order to bring the original data in source and target domain into
the same distribution, the proposed method forcing nearest coupled data between
source and target domain to have identical sparse representations while jointly
learning dictionaries for each domain, where the learned dictionaries can
reconstruct original data in source and target domain respectively. So that
sparse representations of original data can be used to perform visual
recognition tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard
datasets. Our method performs on par or better than competitive
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  In cognitive radio networks, rendezvous is a fundamental operation by which
two cognitive users establish a communication link on a commonly-available
channel for communications. Some existing rendezvous algorithms can guarantee
that rendezvous can be completed within finite time and they generate
channel-hopping (CH) sequences based on the whole channel set. However, some
channels may not be available (e.g., they are being used by the licensed users)
and these existing algorithms would randomly replace the unavailable channels
in the CH sequence. This random replacement is not effective, especially when
the number of unavailable channels is large. In this paper, we design a new
rendezvous algorithm that attempts rendezvous on the available channels only
for faster rendezvous. This new algorithm, called Interleaved Sequences based
on Available Channel set (ISAC), constructs an odd sub-sequence and an even
sub-sequence and interleaves these two sub-sequences to compose a CH sequence.
We prove that ISAC provides guaranteed rendezvous (i.e., rendezvous can be
achieved within finite time). We derive the upper bound on the maximum
time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) to be O(m) (m is not greater than Q) under the
symmetric model and O(mn) (n is not greater than Q) under the asymmetric model,
where m and n are the number of available channels of two users and Q is the
total number of channels (i.e., all potentially available channels). We conduct
extensive computer simulation to demonstrate that ISAC gives significantly
smaller MTTR than the existing algorithms.

 <dc:title>Impact of Frequency Selectivity on the Information Rate Performance of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the impact of frequency-selectivity on the gap
between the required per-user transmit power in the residual CFO scenario (i.e.
after CFO estimation/compensation at the base-station (BS) from [6]) and that
in the ideal/zero CFO scenario, for a fixed per-user information rate, in
single-carrier massive MU-MIMO uplink systems with the TR-MRC receiver.
Information theoretic analysis reveals that this gap decreases with increasing
frequency-selectivity of the channel. Also, in the residual CFO scenario, an
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{M})$ array gain is still achievable ($M$ is the number of BS
antennas) in frequency-selective channels with imperfect channel estimates.

 <dc:description>  Much of the recent progress in Vision-to-Language (V2L) problems has been
achieved through a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This approach does not explicitly represent
high-level semantic concepts, but rather seeks to progress directly from image
features to text. We propose here a method of incorporating high-level concepts
into the very successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art performance in both image
captioning and visual question answering. We also show that the same mechanism
can be used to introduce external semantic information and that doing so
further improves performance. In doing so we provide an analysis of the value
of high level semantic information in V2L problems.

 <dc:description>  Random linear network coding (RLNC) is asymptotically throughput optimal in
the wireless broadcast of a block of packets from a sender to a set of
receivers, but suffers from heavy computational load and packet decoding delay.
To mitigate this problem while maintaining good throughput, we partition the
packet block into disjoint generations after broadcasting the packets uncoded
once and collecting one round of feedback about receivers' packet reception
state. We prove the NP-hardness of the optimal partitioning problem by using a
hypergraph coloring approach, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm for
its solution. Simulations show that our algorithm outperforms existing
solutions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce an approach for analyzing the variation of features generated by
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with respect to scene factors that occur
in natural images. Such factors may include object style, 3D viewpoint, color,
and scene lighting configuration. Our approach analyzes CNN feature responses
corresponding to different scene factors by controlling for them via rendering
using a large database of 3D CAD models. The rendered images are presented to a
trained CNN and responses for different layers are studied with respect to the
input scene factors. We perform a decomposition of the responses based on
knowledge of the input scene factors and analyze the resulting components. In
particular, we quantify their relative importance in the CNN responses and
visualize them using principal component analysis. We show qualitative and
quantitative results of our study on three CNNs trained on large image
datasets: AlexNet, Places, and Oxford VGG. We observe important differences
across the networks and CNN layers for different scene factors and object
categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our analysis based on
computer-generated imagery translates to the network representation of natural
images.

 <dc:title>Distance estimation with efference copies and optical flow maneuvers: a
  stability-based strategy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>de Croon, G. C. H. E.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The visual cue of optical flow plays a major role in the navigation of flying
insects, and is increasingly studied for use by small flying robots as well. A
major problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance
estimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to
distance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed to
estimate distances with monocular optical flow and knowledge of the control
inputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control
gain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the
distance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop first
starts to exhibit self-induced oscillations, eventually leading to instability.
The proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two major
attractive characteristics. First, self-induced oscillations are easy for the
robot to detect and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be
estimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i.e., around hover. The
stability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and with
a Parrot AR drone 2.0. It is shown that it can be used to: (1) trigger a final
approach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2)
estimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire
landing if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the
'edge of oscillation'.

 <dc:description>  We consider broadcasting a block of packets to multiple wireless receivers
under random packet erasures using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC).
The sender first broadcasts each packet uncoded once, then generates coded
packets according to receivers' feedback about their missing packets. We focus
on strict IDNC (S-IDNC), where each coded packet includes at most one missing
packet of every receiver. But we will also compare it with general IDNC
(G-IDNC), where this condition is relaxed. We characterize two fundamental
performance limits of S-IDNC: 1) the number of transmissions to complete the
broadcast, and 2) the average delay for a receiver to decode a packet. We
derive a closed-form expression for the expected minimum number of
transmissions in terms of the number of packets and receivers and the erasure
probability. We prove that it is NP-hard to minimize the decoding delay of
S-IDNC. We also derive achievable upper bounds on the above two performance
limits. We show that G-IDNC can outperform S-IDNC %in terms of the number of
transmissions without packet erasures, but not necessarily with packet
erasures. Next, we design optimal and heuristic S-IDNC transmission schemes and
coding algorithms with full/intermittent receiver feedback. We present
simulation results to corroborate the developed theory and compare with
existing schemes.

 <dc:description>  Real software, the kind working programmers produce by the kLOC to solve
real-world problems, tends to be &quot;natural&quot;, like speech or natural language; it
tends to be highly repetitive and predictable. Researchers have captured this
naturalness of software through statistical models and used them to good effect
in suggestion engines, porting tools, coding standards checkers, and idiom
miners. This suggests that code that appears improbable, or surprising, to a
good statistical language model is &quot;unnatural&quot; in some sense, and thus possibly
suspicious. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis. We consider a large
corpus of bug fix commits (ca.~8,296), from 10 different Java projects, and we
focus on its language statistics, evaluating the naturalness of buggy code and
the corresponding fixes. We find that code with bugs tends to be more entropic
(i.e., unnatural), becoming less so as bugs are fixed. Focusing on highly
entropic lines is similar in cost-effectiveness to some well-known static bug
finders (PMD, FindBugs) and ordering warnings from these bug finders using an
entropy measure improves the cost-effectiveness of inspecting code implicated
in warnings. This suggests that entropy may be a valid language-independent and
simple way to complement the effectiveness of PMD or FindBugs, and that
search-based bug-fixing methods may benefit from using entropy both for
fault-localization and searching for fixes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose the Structured Deep Neural Network (Structured DNN)
as a structured and deep learning algorithm, learning to find the best
structured object (such as a label sequence) given a structured input (such as
a vector sequence) by globally considering the mapping relationships between
the structure rather than item by item.
  When automatic speech recognition is viewed as a special case of such a
structured learning problem, where we have the acoustic vector sequence as the
input and the phoneme label sequence as the output, it becomes possible to
comprehensively learned utterance by utterance as a whole, rather than frame by
frame.
  Structured Support Vector Machine (structured SVM) was proposed to perform
ASR with structured learning previously, but limited by the linear nature of
SVM. Here we propose structured DNN to use nonlinear transformations in
multi-layers as a structured and deep learning algorithm. It was shown to beat
structured SVM in preliminary experiments on TIMIT.

builds a similar measure between images based on EMD (Earth Mover's Distance).
Besides, the paper proceeded to create the S-tree based on the similar measure
EMD to store the image's binary signatures to quickly query image signature
data. From there, the paper build an image retrieval algorithm and CBIR
(Content-Based Image Retrieval) based on a similar measure EMD and S-tree.
Based on this theory, the paper proceeded to build application and experimental
assessment of the process of querying image on the database system which have

 <dc:description>  This chapter approaches the image retrieval system on the base of the colors
of image. It creates fuzzy signature to describe the color of image on color
space HSV and builds fuzzy Hamming distance (FHD) to evaluate the similarity
between the images. In order to reduce the storage space and speed up the
search of similar images, it aims to create S-tree to store fuzzy signature
relies on FHD and builds image retrieval algorithm on S-tree. Then, it provides
the content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and an image retrieval method on FHD
and S-tree. Last but not least, based on this theory, it also presents an
application and experimental assessment of the process of querying similar
image on the database system over 10,000 images.

 <dc:description>  The ad hoc coordination problem is to design an autonomous agent which is
able to achieve optimal flexibility and efficiency in a multiagent system with
no mechanisms for prior coordination. We conceptualise this problem formally
using a game-theoretic model, called the stochastic Bayesian game, in which the
behaviour of a player is determined by its private information, or type. Based
on this model, we derive a solution, called Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc
Coordination (HBA), which utilises the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in
a planning procedure to find optimal actions in the sense of Bellman optimal
control. We evaluate HBA in a multiagent logistics domain called level-based
foraging, showing that it achieves higher flexibility and efficiency than
several alternative algorithms. We also report on a human-machine experiment at
a public science exhibition in which the human participants played repeated
Prisoner's Dilemma and Rock-Paper-Scissors against HBA and alternative
algorithms, showing that HBA achieves equal efficiency and a significantly
higher welfare and winning rate.

 <dc:description>  The interest in statistical machine translation systems increases currently
due to political and social events in the world. A proposed Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) based model that can be used to translate a sentence from the
source Language (English) to the target language (Arabic) automatically through
efficiently incorporating different statistical and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) models such as language model, alignment model, phrase based model,
reordering model, and translation model. These models are combined to enhance
the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT). Many implementation
tools have been used in this work such as Moses, Gizaa++, IRSTLM, KenLM, and
BLEU. Based on the implementation, evaluation of this model, and comparing the
generated translation with other implemented machine translation systems like
Google Translate, it was proved that this proposed model has enhanced the
results of the statistical machine translation, and forms a reliable and
efficient model in this field of research.

 <dc:title>Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  It is known that the learning rate is the most important hyper-parameter to
tune for training deep neural networks. This paper describes a new method for
setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically
eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the
global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate,
this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary
values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves
improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer
iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate &quot;reasonable
bounds&quot; -- linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few
epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets,
and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. These
are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.

 <dc:description>  Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example, free
samples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or
&quot;seed nodes&quot;), with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it.
One way to formalize marketers' objective is through influence maximization (or
IM), whose goal is to find the best seed nodes to activate under a fixed
budget, so that the number of people who get influenced in the end is
maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probability that a user
influences another one. However, this probability information may be
unavailable or incomplete. In this paper, we study IM in the absence of
complete information on influence probability. We call this problem Online
Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learn influence probabilities at the same
time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM, we propose a multiple-trial
approach, where (1) some seed nodes are selected based on existing influence
information; (2) an influence campaign is started with these seed nodes; and
(3) users' feedback is used to update influence information. We adopt the
Explore-Exploit strategy, which can select seed nodes using either the current
influence probability estimation (exploit), or the confidence bound on the
estimation (explore). Any existing IM algorithm can be used in this framework.
We also develop an incremental algorithm that can significantly reduce the
overhead of handling users' feedback information. Our experiments show that our
solution is more effective than traditional IM methods on the partial
information.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals also with a problem of gas absorption accompanied by an
instantaneous, irreversible reaction in the liquid layer. The well-known
methods for calculating such processes are based usually on the certain
amendments to solutions, which are obtained disregarding the chemical reaction.
Unlike the known work (1. D. Baetens, R. Van Keer, L.H. Hosten. Gas-liquid
reaction: absorption accompanied by an instantaneous, irreversible reaction//
Moving Boundaries IV, Southampton, Boston, 1997) the approach we used takes
into account the influence of reaction resulting product on the arising and
velocity of a moving reaction plane. The known results in the theory of
chemical apparatuses scaling are devoted to apparatuses with non-regular
packings mainly. However how the phases distribution over the regular packings
of chemical columns effects the heat and mass efficiency is studied lesser.
This paper deals with the methods of simulation the scaling effects applying to
chemical towers with regular packings of various types. The models for
describing the influence of initial liquid and gas distribution in chemical
columns with regular packing on the mass transfer efficiency have been
submitted. The sufficiently simple methods for evaluating the influence of
large-scale factor on the efficiency of mass transfer have been obtained. These
methods are suitable for use in engineering calculation techniques.

 <dc:title>Personalizing Universal Recurrent Neural Network Language Model with

 <dc:description>  With the popularity of mobile devices, personalized speech recognizer becomes
more realizable today and highly attractive. Each mobile device is primarily
used by a single user, so it's possible to have a personalized recognizer well
matching to the characteristics of individual user. Although acoustic model
personalization has been investigated for decades, much less work have been
reported on personalizing language model, probably because of the difficulties
in collecting enough personalized corpora. Previous work used the corpora
collected from social networks to solve the problem, but constructing a
personalized model for each user is troublesome. In this paper, we propose a
universal recurrent neural network language model with user characteristic
features, so all users share the same model, except each with different user
characteristic features. These user characteristic features can be obtained by
crowdsouring over social networks, which include huge quantity of texts posted
by users with known friend relationships, who may share some subject topics and
wording patterns. The preliminary experiments on Facebook corpus showed that
this proposed approach not only drastically reduced the model perplexity, but
offered very good improvement in recognition accuracy in n-best rescoring
tests. This approach also mitigated the data sparseness problem for
personalized language models.

on learning levels of representations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is
one kind of deep neural network. It can study concurrently. In this article, we
gave a detailed analysis of the process of CNN algorithm both the forward
process and back propagation. Then we applied the particular convolutional
neural network to implement the typical face recognition problem by java. Then,
a parallel strategy was proposed in section4. In addition, by measuring the
actual time of forward and backward computing, we analysed the maximal speed up

 <dc:description>  We address the optimal transmit power allocation problem (from the sensor
nodes (SNs) to the fusion center (FC)) for the decentralized detection of an
unknown deterministic spatially uncorrelated signal which is being observed by
a distributed wireless sensor network. We propose a novel fully distributed
algorithm, in order to calculate the optimal transmit power allocation for each
sensor node (SN) and the optimal number of quantization bits for the test
statistic in order to match the channel capacity. The SNs send their quantized
information over orthogonal uncorrelated channels to the FC which linearly
combines them and makes a final decision. What makes this scheme attractive is
that the SNs share with their neighbours just their individual transmit powers
at the current states. As a result, the SN processing complexity is further
reduced.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of soft decision fusion in a bandwidth-constrained
wireless sensor network (WSN). The WSN is tasked with the detection of an
intruder transmitting an unknown signal over a fading channel. A binary
hypothesis testing is performed using the soft decision of the sensor nodes
(SNs). Using the likelihood ratio test, the optimal soft fusion rule at the
fusion center (FC) has been shown to be the weighted distance from the soft
decision mean under the null hypothesis. But as the optimal rule requires
a-priori knowledge that is difficult to attain in practice, suboptimal fusion
rules are proposed that are realizable in practice. We show how the effect of
quantizing the test statistic can be mitigated by increasing the number of SN
samples, i.e., bandwidth can be traded off against increased latency. The
optimal power and bit allocation for the WSN is also derived. Simulation
results show that SNs with good channels are allocated more bits, while SNs
with poor channels are censored.

 <dc:description>  Specification-based regression testing of web services is an important
activity which verifies the quality of web services. A major problem in web
services is that only provider has the source code and both user and broker
only have the XML based specification. So from the perspective of user and
broker, specification based regression testing of web services is needed. The
existing techniques are code based. Due to the dynamic behavior of web
services, web services undergo maintenance and evolution process rapidly.
Retesting of web services is required in order to verify the impact of changes.
In this paper, we present an automated safe specification based regression
testing approach that uses original and modified WSDL specifications for change
identification. All the relevant test cases are selected as reusable hence our
regression test selection approach is safe.

 <dc:description>  Performance characterization is a fundamental issue in wireless networks for
real time routing, wireless network simulation, and etc. There are four basic
wireless operations that are required to be modeled, i.e., unicast, anycast,
broadcast, and multicast. As observed in many recent works, the temporal and
spatial distribution of packet receptions can have significant impact on
wireless performance involving multiple links (anycast/broadcast/multicast).
However, existing performance models and simulations overlook these two
wireless behaviors, leading to biased performance estimation and simulation
results. In this paper, we first explicitly identify the necessary
&quot;3-Dimension&quot; information for wireless performance modeling, i.e., packet
reception rate (PRR), PRR spatial distribution, and temporal distribution. We
then propose a comprehensive modeling approach considering 3-Dimension Wireless
information (called 3DW model). Further, we demonstrate the generality and wide
applications of 3DW model by two case studies: 3DWbased network simulation and
3DW-based real time routing protocol. Extensive simulation and testbed
experiments have been conducted. The results show that 3DW model achieves much
more accurate performance estimation for both anycast and broadcast/multicast.
3DW-based simulation can effectively reserve the end-to-end performance metric
of the input empirical traces. 3DW-based routing can select more efficient
senders, achieving better transmission efficiency.

 <dc:description>  We present the first study of robustness of systems that are both timed as
well as reactive (I/O). We study the behavior of such timed I/O systems in the
presence of &quot;uncertain inputs&quot; and formalize their robustness using the
analytic notion of Lipschitz continuity. Thus, a timed I/O system is
K-(Lipschitz) robust if the perturbation in its output is at most K times the
perturbation in its input. We quantify input and output perturbation using
&quot;similarity functions&quot; over timed words such as the timed version of the
Manhattan distance and the Skorokhod distance. We consider two models of timed
I/O systems --- timed transducers and asynchronous sequential circuits. While
K-robustness is undecidable even for discrete transducers, we identify a class
of timed transducers which admits a polynomial space decision procedure for
K-robustness. For asynchronous sequential circuits, we reduce K-robustness
w.r.t. timed Manhattan distances to K-robusness of discrete letter-to-letter
transducers and show PSPACE-compeleteness of the problem.

 <dc:description>  The shortest path between two concepts in a taxonomic ontology is commonly
used to represent the semantic distance between concepts in the edge-based
semantic similarity measures. In the past, the edge counting is considered to
be the default method for the path computation, which is simple, intuitive and
has low computational complexity. However, a large lexical taxonomy of such as
WordNet has the irregular densities of links between concepts due to its broad
domain but. The edge counting-based path computation is powerless for this
non-uniformity problem. In this paper, we advocate that the path computation is
able to be separated from the edge-based similarity measures and form various
general computing models. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of
non-uniformity of concept density in a large taxonomic ontology, we propose a
new path computing model based on the compensation of local area density of
concepts, which is equal to the number of direct hyponyms of the subsumers of
concepts in their shortest path. This path model considers the local area
density of concepts as an extension of the edge-based path and converts the
local area density divided by their depth into the compensation for edge-based
path with an adjustable parameter, which idea has been proven to be consistent
with the information theory. This model is a general path computing model and
can be applied in various edge-based similarity algorithms. The experiment
results show that the proposed path model improves the average correlation
between edge-based measures with human judgments on Miller and Charles
benchmark from less than 0.8 to more than 0.85, and has a big advantage in
efficiency than information content (IC) computation in a dynamic ontology,
thereby successfully solving the non-uniformity problem of taxonomic ontology.

 <dc:description>  Community structures in collaboration networks reflect the natural tendency
of individuals to organize their work in groups in order to better achieve
common goals. In most of the cases, individuals exploit their connections to
introduce themselves to new areas of interests, giving rise to multifaceted
collaborations which span different fields. In this paper, we analyse
collaborations in science and among movie actors as multiplex networks, where
the layers represent respectively research topics and movie genres, and we show
that communities indeed coexist and overlap at the different layers of such
systems. We then propose a model to grow multiplex networks based on two
mechanisms of intra and inter-layer triadic closure which mimic the real
processes by which collaborations evolve. We show that our model is able to
explain the multiplex community structure observed empirically, and we infer
the strength of the two underlying social mechanisms from real-world systems.
Being also able to correctly reproduce the values of intra-layer and
inter-layer assortativity correlations, the model contributes to a better
understanding of the principles driving the evolution of social networks.

 <dc:description>  Ontology-based data access is an approach to organizing access to a database
augmented with a logical theory. In this approach query answering proceeds
through a reformulation of a given query into a new one which can be answered
without any use of theory. Thus the problem reduces to the standard database
setting.
  However, the size of the query may increase substantially during the
reformulation. In this survey we review a recently developed framework on
proving lower and upper bounds on the size of this reformulation by employing
methods and results from Boolean circuit complexity.

 <dc:description>  Given a connected region in two-dimensional space where events of a certain
kind occur according to a certain time-varying density, we consider the problem
of setting up a network of autonomous mobile agents to detect the occurrence of
those events and possibly record them in as effective a manner as possible. We
assume that agents can communicate with one another wirelessly within a fixed
communication radius, and moreover that initially no agent has any information
regarding the event density. We introduce a new distributed algorithm for agent
control based on the notion of an execution mode, which essentially lets each
agent roam the target region either at random or following its local view of a
density-dependent gradient. Agents can switch back and forth between the two
modes, and the precise manner of such changes depends on the setting of various
parameters that can be adjusted as a function of the application at hand. We
provide simulation results on some synthetic applications especially designed
to highlight the algorithm's behavior relative to the possible execution modes.

 <dc:description>  We elucidate a close connection between the Theory of Judgment Aggregation
(more generally, Evaluation Aggregation), and a relatively young but rapidly
growing field of universal algebra, that was primarily developed to investigate
constraint satisfaction problems. Our connection yields a full classification
of non-binary evaluations into possibility and impossibility domains both under
the idempotent and the supportive conditions. Prior to the current result E.
Dokow and R. Holzman nearly classified non-binary evaluations in the supportive
case, by combinatorial means. The algebraic approach gives us new insights to
the easier binary case as well, which had been fully classified by the above
authors. Our algebraic view lets us put forth a suggestion about a
strengthening of the Non-dictatorship criterion, that helps us avoid &quot;outliers&quot;
like the affine subspace. Finally, we give upper bounds on the complexity of
computing if a domain is impossible or not (to our best knowledge no finite
time bounds were given earlier).

 <dc:description>  We deliver a call to arms for probabilistic numerical methods: algorithms for
numerical tasks, including linear algebra, integration, optimization and
solving differential equations, that return uncertainties in their
calculations. Such uncertainties, arising from the loss of precision induced by
numerical calculation with limited time or hardware, are important for much
contemporary science and industry. Within applications such as climate science
and astrophysics, the need to make decisions on the basis of computations with
large and complex data has led to a renewed focus on the management of
numerical uncertainty. We describe how several seminal classic numerical
methods can be interpreted naturally as probabilistic inference. We then show
that the probabilistic view suggests new algorithms that can flexibly be
adapted to suit application specifics, while delivering improved empirical
performance. We provide concrete illustrations of the benefits of probabilistic
numeric algorithms on real scientific problems from astrometry and astronomical
imaging, while highlighting open problems with these new algorithms. Finally,
we describe how probabilistic numerical methods provide a coherent framework
for identifying the uncertainty in calculations performed with a combination of
numerical algorithms (e.g. both numerical optimisers and differential equation
solvers), potentially allowing the diagnosis (and control) of error sources in
computations.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised feature selection has been always attracting research attention
in the communities of machine learning and data mining for decades. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised feature selection method seeking a feature
coefficient matrix to select the most distinctive features. Specifically, our
proposed algorithm integrates the Maximum Margin Criterion with a
sparsity-based model into a joint framework, where the class margin and feature
correlation are taken into account at the same time. To maximize the total data
separability while preserving minimized within-class scatter simultaneously, we
propose to embed Kmeans into the framework generating pseudo class label
information in a scenario of unsupervised feature selection. Meanwhile, a
sparsity-based model, ` 2 ,p-norm, is imposed to the regularization term to
effectively discover the sparse structures of the feature coefficient matrix.
In this way, noisy and irrelevant features are removed by ruling out those
features whose corresponding coefficients are zeros. To alleviate the local
optimum problem that is caused by random initializations of K-means, a
convergence guaranteed algorithm with an updating strategy for the clustering
indicator matrix, is proposed to iteractively chase the optimal solution.
Performance evaluation is extensively conducted over six benchmark data sets.
From plenty of experimental results, it is demonstrated that our method has
superior performance against all other compared approaches.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new approach for fast processing of SPARQL
queries on large RDF datasets containing RDF quadruples (or quads). Our
approach called RIQ employs a decrease-and-conquer strategy: Rather than
indexing the entire RDF dataset, RIQ identifies groups of similar RDF graphs
and indexes each group separately. During query processing, RIQ uses a novel
filtering index to first identify candidate groups that may contain matches for
the query. On these candidates, it executes optimized queries using a
conventional SPARQL processor to produce the final results. Our initial
performance evaluation results are promising: Using a synthetic and a real
dataset, each containing about 1.4 billion quads, we show that RIQ outperforms
RDF-3X and Jena TDB on a variety of SPARQL queries.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of detecting a change in the mean of one-dimensional
Gaussian process data. This problem is investigated in the setting of
increasing domain (customarily employed in time series analysis) and in the
setting of fixed domain (typically arising in spatial data analysis). We
propose a detection method based on the generalized likelihood ratio test
(GLRT), and show that our method achieves nearly asymptotically optimal rate in
the minimax sense, in both settings. The salient feature of the proposed method
is that it exploits in an efficient way the data dependence captured by the
Gaussian process covariance structure. When the covariance is not known, we
propose the plug-in GLRT method and derive conditions under which the method
remains asymptotically near optimal. By contrast, the standard CUSUM method,
which does not account for the covariance structure, is shown to be
asymptotically optimal only in the increasing domain. Our algorithms and
accompanying theory are applicable to a wide variety of covariance structures,
including the Matern class, the powered exponential class, and others. The
plug-in GLRT method is shown to perform well for maximum likelihood estimators
with a dense covariance matrix.

 <dc:title>Exploiting an Oracle that Reports AUC Scores in Machine Learning
  Contests</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Whitehill, Jacob</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In machine learning contests such as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual
Recognition Challenge and the KDD Cup, contestants can submit candidate
solutions and receive from an oracle (typically the organizers of the
competition) the accuracy of their guesses compared to the ground-truth labels.
One of the most commonly used accuracy metrics for binary classification tasks
is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). In this
paper we provide proofs-of-concept of how knowledge of the AUC of a set of
guesses can be used, in two different kinds of attacks, to improve the accuracy
of those guesses. On the other hand, we also demonstrate the intractability of
one kind of AUC exploit by proving that the number of possible binary labelings
of $n$ examples for which a candidate solution obtains a AUC score of $c$ grows
exponentially in $n$, for every $c\in (0,1)$.

 <dc:description>  The recent explosive growth in convolutional neural network (CNN) research
has produced a variety of new architectures for deep learning. One intriguing
new architecture is the bilinear CNN (B-CNN), which has shown dramatic
performance gains on certain fine-grained recognition problems [15]. We apply
this new CNN to the challenging new face recognition benchmark, the IARPA Janus
Benchmark A (IJB-A) [12]. It features faces from a large number of identities
in challenging real-world conditions. Because the face images were not
identified automatically using a computerized face detection system, it does
not have the bias inherent in such a database. We demonstrate the performance
of the B-CNN model beginning from an AlexNet-style network pre-trained on
ImageNet. We then show results for fine-tuning using a moderate-sized and
public external database, FaceScrub [17]. We also present results with
additional fine-tuning on the limited training data provided by the protocol.
In each case, the fine-tuned bilinear model shows substantial improvements over
the standard CNN. Finally, we demonstrate how a standard CNN pre-trained on a
large face database, the recently released VGG-Face model [20], can be
converted into a B-CNN without any additional feature training. This B-CNN
improves upon the CNN performance on the IJB-A benchmark, achieving 89.5%
rank-1 recall.

 <dc:title>Finding the Optimal Demodulator Under Implementation Constraints</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Qian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The common approach of designing a communication device is to maximize a
well-defined objective function, e.g., the channel capacity and the cut-off
rate. We propose easy-to-implement solutions for Gaussian channels that
approximate the optimal results for these maximization problems. Three topics
are addressed. First, we consider the case where the channel output is
quantized, and we find the quantization thresholds that maximize the mutual
information. The approximation derived from the asymptotic solution has a
negligible loss on the entire range of SNR when 2-PAM modulation is used, and
its quantization thresholds linearly depend on the standard deviation of noise.
We also derive a simple estimator of the relative capacity loss due to
quantization, based on the high-rate limit. Then we consider the integer
constraint on the decoding metric, and maximize the mismatched channel
capacity. We study the asymptotic solution of the optimal metric assignment and
show that the same approximation we derived in the matched decoding case still
holds for the mismatched decoder. Finally, we consider the demodulation problem
for 8PSK bit-interleaved coded modulation(BICM). We derive the approximated
optimal demodulation metrics that maximize the general cut-off rate or the
mismatched capacity using max-log approximation . The error rate performances
of the two metrics' assignments are compared, based on
Reed-Solomon-Viterbi(RSV) code, and the mismatched capacity metric turns out to
be better. The proposed approximation can be computed using an efficient
firmware algorithm, and improves the system performance of commercial chips.

 <dc:title>A Nearly Optimal and Agnostic Algorithm for Properly Learning a Mixture
  of k Gaussians, for any Constant k</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Learning a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, learning theory, and statistics. One notion of learning a GMM is
proper learning: here, the goal is to find a mixture of $k$ Gaussians
$\mathcal{M}$ that is close to the density $f$ of the unknown distribution from
which we draw samples. The distance between $\mathcal{M}$ and $f$ is typically
measured in the total variation or $L_1$-norm.
  We give an algorithm for learning a mixture of $k$ univariate Gaussians that
is nearly optimal for any fixed $k$. The sample complexity of our algorithm is
$\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$ and the running time is $(k \cdot
\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{O(k^4)} + \tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$. It is
well-known that this sample complexity is optimal (up to logarithmic factors),
and it was already achieved by prior work. However, the best known time
complexity for proper learning a $k$-GMM was
$\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{3k-1}})$. In particular, the dependence between
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ and $k$ was exponential. We significantly improve this
dependence by replacing the $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ term with a $\log
\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ while only increasing the exponent moderately. Hence, for
any fixed $k$, the $\tilde{O} (\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$ term dominates our
running time, and thus our algorithm runs in time which is nearly-linear in the
number of samples drawn. Achieving a running time of $\textrm{poly}(k,
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for proper learning of $k$-GMMs has recently been stated
as an open problem by multiple researchers, and we make progress on this
question.
  Moreover, our approach offers an agnostic learning guarantee: our algorithm
returns a good GMM even if the distribution we are sampling from is not a
mixture of Gaussians. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first
agnostic proper learning algorithm for GMMs.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a systematic approach to exploit TV white space (TVWS)
for device-to-device (D2D) communications with the aid of the existing cellular
infrastructure. The goal is to build a location-specific TVWS database, which
provides a look-up table service for any D2D link to determine its maximum
permitted emission power (MPEP) in an unlicensed digital TV (DTV) band. To
achieve this goal, the idea of mobile crowd sensing is firstly introduced to
collect active spectrum measurements from massive personal mobile devices.
Considering the incompleteness of crowd measurements, we formulate the problem
of unknown measurements recovery as a matrix completion problem and apply a
powerful fixed point continuation algorithm to reconstruct the unknown elements
from the known elements. By joint exploitation of the big spectrum data in its
vicinity, each cellular base station further implements a nonlinear support
vector machine algorithm to perform irregular coverage boundary detection of a
licensed DTV transmitter. With the knowledge of the detected coverage boundary,
an opportunistic spatial reuse algorithm is developed for each D2D link to
determine its MPEP. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can
successfully enable D2D communications in TVWS while satisfying the
interference constraint from the licensed DTV services. In addition, to our
best knowledge, this is the first try to explore and exploit TVWS inside the
DTV protection region resulted from the shadowing effect. Potential application
scenarios include communications between internet of vehicles in the
underground parking, D2D communications in hotspots such as subway, game
stadiums, and airports, etc.

 <dc:title>Recognition of Changes in SAR Images Based on Gauss-Log Ratio and MRFFCM</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alphonse, Jismy</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A modified version of MRFFCM (Markov Random Field Fuzzy C means) based SAR
(Synthetic aperture Radar) image change detection method is proposed in this
paper. It involves three steps: Difference Image (DI) generation by using
Gauss-log ratio operator, speckle noise reduction by SRAD (Speckle Reducing
Anisotropic Diffusion), and the detection of changed regions by using MRFFCM.
The proposed method is compared with existing methods such as FCM and MRFFCM
using simulated and real SAR images. The measures used for evaluation includes
Overall Error (OE), Percentage Correct Classification (PCC), Kappa Coefficient
(KC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). The
results show that the proposed method is better compared to FCM and MRFFCM
based change detection method.

 <dc:description>  Recent graph computation approaches have demonstrated that a single PC can
perform efficiently on billion-scale graphs. While these approaches achieve
scalability by optimizing I/O operations, they do not fully exploit the
capabilities of modern hard drives and processors. To overcome their
performance, in this work, we introduce the Bimodal Block Processing (BBP), an
innovation that is able to boost the graph computation by minimizing the I/O
cost even further. With this strategy, we achieved the following contributions:
(1) M-Flash, the fastest graph computation framework to date; (2) a flexible
and simple programming model to easily implement popular and essential graph
algorithms, including the first single-machine billion-scale eigensolver; and
(3) extensive experiments on real graphs with up to 6.6 billion edges,
demonstrating M-Flash's consistent and significant speedup.

 <dc:description>  High availability is no longer just a business continuity concern. Users are
increasingly dependant on devices that consume and produce data in ever
increasing volumes. A popular solution is to have a central repository which
each device accesses after centrally managed authentication. This model of use
is facilitated by cloud based file synchronisation services such as Dropbox,
OneDrive, Google Drive and Apple iCloud. Cloud architecture allows the
provisioning of storage space with &quot;always-on&quot; access. Recent concerns over
unauthorised access to third party systems and large scale exposure of private
data have made an alternative solution desirable. These events have caused
users to assess their own security practices and the level of trust placed in
third party storage services. One option is BitTorrent Sync, a cloudless
synchronisation utility provides data availability and redundancy. This utility
replicates files stored in shares to remote peers with access controlled by
keys and permissions. While lacking the economies brought about by scale,
complete control over data access has made this a popular solution. The ability
to replicate data without oversight introduces risk of abuse by users as well
as difficulties for forensic investigators. This paper suggests a methodology
for investigation and analysis of the protocol to assist in the control of data
flow across security perimeters.

of the same order such that each vertex is contained in the same number of
cliques. In this paper, we study the mixing rate of certain random walks on
such graphs and we generalize previous results of Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and

 <dc:description>  Business process enactment is generally supported by information systems that
record data about process executions, which can be extracted as event logs.
Predictive process monitoring is concerned with exploiting such event logs to
predict how running (uncompleted) cases will unfold up to their completion. In
this paper, we propose a predictive process monitoring framework for estimating
the probability that a given predicate will be fulfilled upon completion of a
running case. The predicate can be, for example, a temporal logic constraint or
a time constraint, or any predicate that can be evaluated over a completed
trace. The framework takes into account both the sequence of events observed in
the current trace, as well as data attributes associated to these events. The
prediction problem is approached in two phases. First, prefixes of previous
traces are clustered according to control flow information. Secondly, a
classifier is built for each cluster using event data to discriminate between
fulfillments and violations. At runtime, a prediction is made on a running case
by mapping it to a cluster and applying the corresponding classifier. The
framework has been implemented in the ProM toolset and validated on a log
pertaining to the treatment of cancer patients in a large hospital.

 <dc:description>  We consider a class of consensus systems driven by a nonlinear input. Such
systems arise in a class of IoT applications. Our objective in this paper is to
determine conditions under which a certain partially distributed system
converges to a Lur'e-like scalar system, and to provide a rigorous proof of its
stability. Conditions are derived for the non-uniform convergence and stability
of such a system and an example is given of a speed advisory system where such
a system arises in real engineering practice.

 <dc:title>Encoding Markov Logic Networks in Possibilistic Logic</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Markov logic uses weighted formulas to compactly encode a probability
distribution over possible worlds. Despite the use of logical formulas, Markov
logic networks (MLNs) can be difficult to interpret, due to the often
counter-intuitive meaning of their weights. To address this issue, we propose a
method to construct a possibilistic logic theory that exactly captures what can
be derived from a given MLN using maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference.
Unfortunately, the size of this theory is exponential in general. We therefore
also propose two methods which can derive compact theories that still capture
MAP inference, but only for specific types of evidence. These theories can be
used, among others, to make explicit the hidden assumptions underlying an MLN
or to explain the predictions it makes.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of deformation control of an Euler-Bernoulli
beam with in-domain actuation. The proposed control scheme consists in first
relating the system model described by an inhomogeneous partial differential
equation to a target system under a standard boundary control form. Then, a
combination of closed-loop feedback control and flatness-based motion planning
is used for stabilizing the closed-loop system around reference trajectories.
The validity of the proposed method is assessed through well-posedness and
stability analysis of the considered systems. The performance of the developed
control scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations of a
representative micro-beam.

 <dc:description>  One of the key ideas to make Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) work
effectively is to deploy advanced communication and cooperative control
technologies among the vehicles and road infrastructures. In this spirit, we
propose a consensus-based distributed speed advisory system that optimally
determines a recommended common speed for a given area in order that the group
emissions, or group battery consumptions, are minimised. Our algorithms achieve
this in a privacy-aware manner; namely, individual vehicles do not reveal
in-vehicle information to other vehicles or to infrastructure. A mobility
simulator is used to illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm, and
hardware-in-the-loop tests involving a real vehicle are given to illustrate
user acceptability and ease of the deployment.

 <dc:description>  Let $t_1,\ldots,t_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and consider the location recovery
problem: given a subset of pairwise direction observations $\{(t_i - t_j) /
\|t_i - t_j\|_2\}_{i&lt;j \in [n] \times [n]}$, where a constant fraction of these
observations are arbitrarily corrupted, find $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^n$ up to a global
translation and scale. We propose a novel algorithm for the location recovery
problem, which consists of a simple convex program over $dn$ real variables. We
prove that this program recovers a set of $n$ i.i.d. Gaussian locations exactly
and with high probability if the observations are given by an \erdosrenyi
graph, $d$ is large enough, and provided that at most a constant fraction of
observations involving any particular location are adversarially corrupted. We
also prove that the program exactly recovers Gaussian locations for $d=3$ if
the fraction of corrupted observations at each location is, up to
poly-logarithmic factors, at most a constant. Both of these recovery theorems
are based on a set of deterministic conditions that we prove are sufficient for
exact recovery.

 <dc:description>  We present a randomized algorithm for estimating the $p$th moment $F_p$ of
the frequency vector of a data stream in the general update (turnstile) model
to within a multiplicative factor of $1 \pm \epsilon$, for $p &gt; 2$, with high
constant confidence. For $0 &lt; \epsilon \le 1$, the algorithm uses space $O(
n^{1-2/p} \epsilon^{-2} + n^{1-2/p} \epsilon^{-4/p} \log (n))$ words. This
improves over the current bound of $O(n^{1-2/p} \epsilon^{-2-4/p} \log (n))$
words by Andoni et. al. in \cite{ako:arxiv10}. Our space upper bound matches
the lower bound of Li and Woodruff \cite{liwood:random13} for $\epsilon = (\log
(n))^{-\Omega(1)}$ and the lower bound of Andoni et. al. \cite{anpw:icalp13}
for $\epsilon = \Omega(1)$.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes in detail the bitonic sort algorithm,and implements the
bitonic sort algorithm based on cuda architecture.At the same time,we conduct
two effective optimization of implementation details according to the
characteristics of the GPU,which greatly improve the efficiency. Finally,we
survey the optimized Bitonic sort algorithm on the GPU with the speedup of
quick sort algorithm on the CPU.Since Quick Sort is not suitable to be
implemented in parallel,but it is more efficient than other sorting algorithms
on CPU to some extend.Hence,to see the speedup and performance,we compare
bitonic sort on GPU with quick Sort on CPU. For a series of 32-bit random
integer,the experimental results show that the acceleration of our work is
nearly 20 times.When array size is about 216,the speedup ratio is even up to
30.

 <dc:description>  Malicious peripherals designed to attack their host computers are a growing
problem. Inexpensive and powerful peripherals that attach to plug-and-play
buses have made such attacks easy to mount. Making matters worse, commodity
operating systems lack coherent defenses, and users are often unaware of the
scope of the problem. We present Cinch, a pragmatic response to this threat.
Cinch uses virtualization to attach peripheral devices to a logically separate,
untrusted machine, and includes an interposition layer between the untrusted
machine and the protected one. This layer regulates interaction with devices
according to user-configured policies. Cinch integrates with existing OSes,
enforces policies that thwart real-world attacks, and has low overhead.

 <dc:description>  Many real networks that are inferred or collected from data are incomplete
due to missing edges. Missing edges can be inherent to the dataset (Facebook
friend links will never be complete) or the result of sampling (one may only
have access to a portion of the data). The consequence is that downstream
analyses that consume the network will often yield less accurate results than
if the edges were complete. Community detection algorithms, in particular,
often suffer when critical intra-community edges are missing. We propose a
novel consensus clustering algorithm to enhance community detection on
incomplete networks. Our framework utilizes existing community detection
algorithms that process networks imputed by our link prediction based
algorithm. The framework then merges their multiple outputs into a final
consensus output. On average our method boosts performance of existing
algorithms by 7% on artificial data and 17% on ego networks collected from
Facebook.

 <dc:description>  Color image segmentation is a very emerging topic for image processing
research. Since it has the ability to present the result in a way that is much
more close to the human yes perceive, so todays more research is going on this
area. Choosing a proper color space is a very important issue for color image
segmentation process. Generally LAB and HSV are the two frequently chosen color
spaces. In this paper a comparative analysis is performed between these two
color spaces with respect to color image segmentation. For measuring their
performance, we consider the parameters: mse and psnr . It is found that HSV
color space is performing better than LAB.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We solve the satisfiability problem for a three-sorted fragment of set theory
(denoted $3LQST_0^R$), which admits a restricted form of quantification over
individual and set variables and the finite enumeration operator $\{\text{-},
\text{-}, \ldots, \text{-}\}$ over individual variables, by showing that it
enjoys a small model property, i.e., any satisfiable formula $\psi$ of
$3LQST_0^R$ has a finite model whose size depends solely on the length of
$\psi$ itself. Several set-theoretic constructs are expressible by
$3LQST_0^R$-formulae, such as some variants of the power set operator and the
unordered Cartesian product. In particular, concerning the unordered Cartesian
product, we show that when finite enumerations are used to represent the
construct, the resulting formula is exponentially shorter than the one that can
be constructed without resorting to such terms.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of recovering the subspace spanned by the first $k$
principal components of $d$-dimensional data under the streaming setting, with
a memory bound of $O(kd)$. Two families of algorithms are known for this
problem. The first family is based on the framework of stochastic gradient
descent. Nevertheless, the convergence rate of the family can be seriously
affected by the learning rate of the descent steps and deserves more serious
study. The second family is based on the power method over blocks of data, but
setting the block size for its existing algorithms is not an easy task. In this
paper, we analyze the convergence rate of a representative algorithm with
decayed learning rate (Oja and Karhunen, 1985) in the first family for the
general $k&gt;1$ case. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for the second
family that sets the block sizes automatically and dynamically with faster
convergence rate. We then conduct empirical studies that fairly compare the two
families on real-world data. The studies reveal the advantages and
disadvantages of these two families.

 <dc:description>  Today, the deployment of Web services in many enterprise applications has
gained much attention. Service network inhibits certain common properties as
they arise spontaneously and are subject to high fluctuation. The objective of
consumer is to compose services for stable business processes in coherence with
their legacy system capabilities and with better quality of services. For this
purpose we have proposed a dynamic decision model that integrates several
performance metrics and attributes to monitor the performance of service
oriented systems in order to ensure their sustainability. Based on the
available metrics, we have identified performance metrics criteria and
classified into categories like time based QoS, size based QoS, combined QoS
and estimated attributes. Then we have designed service network monitoring
ontology (SNM). Our decision model will take user query and SNM as input,
measures the performance capabilities and suggests some new performance
configurations like selected service is not available, physical resource is not
available and no maintenance will be available for the selected service for
composition.

 <dc:description>  The great prosperity of big data systems such as Hadoop in recent years makes
the benchmarking of these systems become crucial for both research and industry
communities. The complexity, diversity, and rapid evolution of big data systems
gives rise to various new challenges about how we design generators to produce
data with the 4V properties (i.e. volume, velocity, variety and veracity), as
well as implement application-specific but still comprehensive workloads.
However, most of the existing big data benchmarks can be described as attempts
to solve specific problems in benchmarking systems. This article investigates
the state-of-the-art in benchmarking big data systems along with the future
challenges to be addressed to realize a successful and efficient benchmark.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal
algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN
have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region
proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region
Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the
detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a
fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and
objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate
high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We
further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their
convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural
networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified
network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has
a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving
state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS
COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015
competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning
entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.

 <dc:description>  Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is an applied and practise-oriented field
aimed at solving real problems encountered by practitioners and bringing value
to Industry. Replication of results and findings, generalizability and external
validity, University-Industry collaboration, data sharing and creation dataset
repositories are important issues in MSR research. Research consisting of
bibliometric analysis of MSR paper shows lack of University-Industry
collaboration, deficiency of studies on closed or propriety source dataset and
lack of data as well as tool sharing by researchers. We conduct a survey of
authors of past three years of MSR conference (2012, 2013 and 2014) to collect
data on their views and suggestions to address the stated concerns. We asked 20
questions from more than 100 authors and received a response from 39 authors.
Our results shows that about one-third of the respondents always make their
dataset publicly available and about one-third believe that data sharing should
be a mandatory condition for publication in MSR conferences. Our survey reveals
that more than 50% authors used solely open-source software (OSS) dataset for
their research. More than 50% of the respondents mentioned that difficulty in
sharing Industrial dataset outside the company is one of the major impediments
in University-Industry collaboration.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate an additive video watermarking method in H.264
standard in presence of the Laplacian noise. In some applications, due to the
loss of some pixels or a region of a frame, we resort to Laplacian noise rather
than Gaussian one. The embedding is performed in the transform domain; while an
optimum and a sub-optimum decoder are derived for the proposed Laplacian model.
Simulation results show that the proposed watermarking scheme has suitable
performance with enough transparency required for watermarking applications.

most challenging problems in cloud infrastructure management, considering also
the large number of possible optimization criteria and different formulations
that could be studied. VMP literature include relevant topics such as
energy-efficiency, Service Level Agreements (SLA), cloud service markets,
Quality of Service (QoS) and carbon dioxide emissions, all of them with high
economical and ecological impact. This work presents an extensive up-to-date
review of the most relevant VMP literature in order to identify research
opportunities.

 <dc:description>  The availability of data on digital traces is growing to unprecedented sizes,
but inferring actionable knowledge from large-scale data is far from being
trivial. This is especially important for computational finance, where digital
traces of human behavior offer a great potential to drive trading strategies.
We contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates
various datasources in the design of algorithmic traders. This allows us to
derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading
strategies. We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a
cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we
include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of
the Bitcoin technology, and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social
signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence,
and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more
than 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and
exchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence
precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these
insights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very
high profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust
statistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming
the long-standing hypothesis that trading based social media sentiment has the
potential to yield positive returns on investment.

 <dc:description>  In social networks, individuals constantly drop ties and replace them by new
ones in a highly unpredictable fashion. This highly dynamical nature of social
ties has important implications for processes such as the spread of information
or of epidemics. Several studies have demonstrated the influence of a number of
factors on the intricate microscopic process of tie replacement, but the
macroscopic long-term effects of such changes remain largely unexplored. Here
we investigate whether, despite the inherent randomness at the microscopic
level, there are macroscopic statistical regularities in the long-term
evolution of social networks. In particular, we analyze the email network of a
large organization with over 1,000 individuals throughout four consecutive
years. We find that, although the evolution of individual ties is highly
unpredictable, the macro-evolution of social communication networks follows
well-defined statistical patterns, characterized by exponentially decaying
log-variations of the weight of social ties and of individuals' social
strength. At the same time, we find that individuals have social signatures and
communication strategies that are remarkably stable over the scale of several
years.

 <dc:description>  Many classification algorithms produce a classifier that is a weighted
average of kernel evaluations. When working with a high or infinite dimensional
kernel, it is imperative for speed of evaluation and storage issues that as few
training samples as possible are used in the kernel expansion. Popular existing
approaches focus on altering standard learning algorithms, such as the Support
Vector Machine, to induce sparsity, as well as post-hoc procedures for sparse
approximations. Here we adopt the latter approach. We begin with a very simple
classifier, given by the kernel mean $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{n}
\sum\limits_{i=i}^{n} y_i K(x_i,x) $$ We then find a sparse approximation to
this kernel mean via herding. The result is an accurate, easily parallelized
algorithm for learning classifiers.

 <dc:title>Backlog and Delay Reasoning in HARQ Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Akin, Sami</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, hybrid-automatic-repeat-request (HARQ) systems have been favored in
particular state-of-the-art communications systems since they provide the
practicality of error detections and corrections aligned with repeat-requests
when needed at receivers. The queueing characteristics of these systems have
taken considerable focus since the current technology demands data
transmissions with a minimum delay provisioning. In this paper, we investigate
the effects of physical layer characteristics on data link layer performance in
a general class of HARQ systems. Constructing a state transition model that
combines queue activity at a transmitter and decoding efficiency at a receiver,
we identify the probability of clearing the queue at the transmitter and the
packet-loss probability at the receiver. We determine the effective capacity
that yields the maximum feasible data arrival rate at the queue under
quality-of-service constraints. In addition, we put forward non-asymptotic
backlog and delay bounds. Finally, regarding three different HARQ protocols,
namely Type-I HARQ, HARQ-chase combining (HARQ-CC) and HARQ-incremental
redundancy (HARQ-IR), we show the superiority of HARQ-IR in delay robustness
over the others. However, we further observe that the performance gap between
HARQ-CC and HARQ-IR is quite negligible in certain cases. The novelty of our
paper is a general cross-layer analysis of these systems, considering
encoding/decoding in the physical layer and delay aspects in the data-link
layer.

the convergence behaviors of this recursive mechanism has been captured through
a tree like structure named as CVT-XOR Tree. We have analyzed how to identify

a node in different CVT-XOR Trees on defining three different matrices. Lastly,
one observation is made towards very old Mathematical problem of Goldbach

 <dc:description>  The topological structure of complex networks has fascinated researchers for
several decades, resulting in the discovery of many universal properties and
reoccurring characteristics of different kinds of networks. However, much less
is known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality
are not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.
  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution
patterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific
patterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a
&quot;one fits it all&quot; model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these
intuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables
and metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as
for interpolating graph evolutions.
  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,
this paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node
importance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality
distance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given
centrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances
reflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in
case of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.
  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and
seven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the
usefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared
to a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the
considered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the

 <dc:description>  We describe a visual programming language for defining behaviors manifested
by reified actors in a 2D virtual world that can be compiled into programs
comprised of sequences of combinators that are themselves reified as actors.
This makes it possible to build programs that build programs from components of
a few fixed types delivered by diffusion using processes that resemble
chemistry as much as computation.

 <dc:title>Multilayer Structured NMF for Spectral Unmixing of Hyperspectral Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rajabi, Roozbeh</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ghassemian, Hassan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the challenges in hyperspectral data analysis is the presence of mixed
pixels. Mixed pixels are the result of low spatial resolution of hyperspectral
sensors. Spectral unmixing methods decompose a mixed pixel into a set of
endmembers and abundance fractions. Due to nonnegativity constraint on
abundance fraction values, NMF based methods are well suited to this problem.
In this paper multilayer NMF has been used to improve the results of NMF
methods for spectral unmixing of hyperspectral data under the linear mixing
framework. Sparseness constraint on both spectral signatures and abundance
fractions matrices are used in this paper. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm
is done using synthetic and real datasets in terms of spectral angle and
abundance angle distances. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
other previously proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  We propose an abstraction-based multi-document summarization framework that
can construct new sentences by exploring more fine-grained syntactic units than
sentences, namely, noun/verb phrases. Different from existing abstraction-based
approaches, our method first constructs a pool of concepts and facts
represented by phrases from the input documents. Then new sentences are
generated by selecting and merging informative phrases to maximize the salience
of phrases and meanwhile satisfy the sentence construction constraints. We
employ integer linear optimization for conducting phrase selection and merging
simultaneously in order to achieve the global optimal solution for a summary.
Experimental results on the benchmark data set TAC 2011 show that our framework
outperforms the state-of-the-art models under automated pyramid evaluation
metric, and achieves reasonably well results on manual linguistic quality
evaluation.

 <dc:description>  Many satisfiability modulo theories solvers implement a variant of the DPLL(T
) framework which separates theory-specific reasoning from reasoning on the
propositional abstraction of the formula. Such solvers conclude that a formula
is unsatisfiable once they have learned enough theory conflicts to derive a
propositional contradiction. However some problems, such as the diamonds
problem, require learning exponentially many conflicts. We give a general
criterion for establishing lower bounds on the number of theory conflicts in
any DPLL(T ) proof for a given problem. We apply our criterion to two different
state-of-the-art symbolic partial-order encodings of a simple, yet
representative concurrency problem. Even though one of the encodings is
asymptotically smaller than the other, we establish the same exponential lower
bound proof complexity for both. Our experiments confirm this theoretical lower
bound across multiple solvers and theory combinations.

 <dc:description>  We present a new algorithm for the problem of universal gathering mobile
oblivious robots (that is, starting from any initial configuration that is not
bivalent, using any number of robots, the robots reach in a finite number of
steps the same position, not known beforehand) without relying on a common
chirality. We give very strong guaranties on the correctness of our algorithm
by proving formally that it is correct, using the COQ proof assistant. To our
knowledge, this is the first certified positive (and constructive) result in
the context of oblivious mobile robots. It demonstrates both the effectiveness
of the approach to obtain new algorithms that are truly generic, and its
managability since the amount of developped code remains human readable.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the dynamics of opinions, preferences and of culture as whole
requires more use of empirical data than has been done so far. It is clear that
an important role in driving this dynamics is played by social influence, which
is the essential ingredient of many quantitative models. Such models require
that all traits are fixed when specifying the &quot;initial cultural state&quot;.
Typically, this initial state is randomly generated, from a uniform
distribution over the set of possible combinations of traits. However, recent
work has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends
on the nature of the initial state. If the latter is sampled from empirical
data instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of
cultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of
propensity towards collective behavior in the short-term. Moreover, if the
initial state is randomized by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the
level of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the
empirical and uniformly random counterparts. The current study repeats the
analysis for multiple empirical data sets, showing that the results are
remarkably similar, although the matrix of correlations between cultural
variables clearly differs across data sets. This points towards robust
structural properties inherent in empirical cultural states, possibly due to
universal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the real world. The results
also suggest that this dynamics might be characterized by criticality and
involve mechanisms beyond social influence.

 <dc:title>The Meta Distribution of the SIR in Poisson Bipolar and Cellular
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Haenggi, Martin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The calculation of the SIR distribution at the typical receiver (or,
equivalently, the success probability of transmissions over the typical link)
in Poisson bipolar and cellular networks with Rayleigh fading is relatively
straightforward, but it only provides limited information on the success
probabilities of the individual links. This paper introduces the notion of the
meta distribution of the SIR, which is the distribution of the conditional
success probability $P$ given the point process, and provides bounds, an exact
analytical expression, and a simple approximation for it. The meta distribution
provides fine-grained information on the SIR and answers questions such as
&quot;What fraction of users in a Poisson cellular network achieve 90% link
reliability if the required SIR is 5 dB?&quot;. Interestingly, in the bipolar model,
if the transmit probability $p$ is reduced while increasing the network density
$\lambda$ such that the density of concurrent transmitters $\lambda p$ stays
constant as $p\to 0$, $P$ degenerates to a constant, i.e., all links have
exactly the same success probability in the limit, which is the one of the
typical link. In contrast, in the cellular case, if the interfering base
stations are active independently with probability $p$, the variance of $P$
approaches a non-zero constant when $p$ is reduced to $0$ while keeping the
mean success probability constant.

 <dc:description>  We study the design of fixed-parameter algorithms for problems already known
to be solvable in polynomial time. The main motivation is to get more efficient
algorithms for problems with unattractive polynomial running times. Here, we
focus on a fundamental graph problem: Longest Path, that is, given an
undirected graph, find a maximum-length path in $G$. Longest Path is NP-hard in
general but known to be solvable in $O(n^{4})$ time on $n$-vertex interval
graphs. We show how to solve Longest Path on Interval Graphs, parameterized by
vertex deletion number $k$ to proper interval graphs, in $O(k^{9}n)$ time.
Notably, Longest Path is trivially solvable in linear time on proper interval
graphs, and the parameter value $k$ can be approximated up to a factor of 4 in
linear time. From a more general perspective, we believe that using
parameterized complexity analysis may enable a refined understanding of
efficiency aspects for polynomial-time solvable problems similarly to what
classical parameterized complexity analysis does for NP-hard problems.

 <dc:description>  Data aggregators collect large amount of information about individual users
and create detailed online behavioral profiles of individuals. Behavioral
profiles benefit users by improving products and services. However, they have
also raised concerns regarding user privacy, transparency of collection
practices and accuracy of data in the profiles. To improve transparency, some
companies are allowing users to access their behavioral profiles. In this work,
we investigated behavioral profiles of users by utilizing these access
mechanisms. Using in-person interviews (n=8), we analyzed the data shown in the
profiles, elicited user concerns, and estimated accuracy of profiles. We
confirmed our interview findings via an online survey (n=100). To assess the
claim of improving transparency, we compared data shown in profiles with the
data that companies have about users. More than 70% of the participants
expressed concerns about collection of sensitive data such as credit and health
information, level of detail and how their data may be used. We found a large
gap between the data shown in profiles and the data possessed by companies. A
large number of profiles were inaccurate with as much as 80% inaccuracy. We
discuss implications for public policy management.

 <dc:description>  Microstructures forming during ternary eutectic directional solidification
processes have significant influence on the macroscopic mechanical properties
of metal alloys. For a realistic simulation, we use the well established
thermodynamically consistent phase-field method and improve it with a new grand
potential formulation to couple the concentration evolution. This extension is
very compute intensive due to a temperature dependent diffusive concentration.
We significantly extend previous simulations that have used simpler phase-field
models or were performed on smaller domain sizes. The new method has been
implemented within the massively parallel HPC framework waLBerla that is
designed to exploit current supercomputers efficiently. We apply various
optimization techniques, including buffering techniques, explicit SIMD kernel
vectorization, and communication hiding. Simulations utilizing up to 262,144
cores have been run on three different supercomputing architectures and weak
scalability results are shown. Additionally, a hierarchical, mesh-based data
reduction strategy is developed to keep the I/O problem manageable at scale.

 <dc:title>Avatar: A Time- and Space-Efficient Self-Stabilizing Overlay Network</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Berns, Andrew</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Overlay networks present an interesting challenge for fault-tolerant
computing. Many overlay networks operate in dynamic environments (e.g. the
Internet), where faults are frequent and widespread, and the number of
processes in a system may be quite large. Recently, self-stabilizing overlay
networks have been presented as a method for managing this complexity.
\emph{Self-stabilizing overlay networks} promise that, starting from any
weakly-connected configuration, a correct overlay network will eventually be
built. To date, this guarantee has come at a cost: nodes may either have high
degree during the algorithm's execution, or the algorithm may take a long time
to reach a legal configuration. In this paper, we present the first
self-stabilizing overlay network algorithm that does not incur this penalty.
Specifically, we (i) present a new locally-checkable overlay network based upon
a binary search tree, and (ii) provide a randomized algorithm for
self-stabilization that terminates in an expected polylogarithmic number of
rounds \emph{and} increases a node's degree by only a polylogarithmic factor in
expectation.

 <dc:description>  The clique-width is a measure of complexity of decomposing graphs into
certain tree-like structures. The class of graphs with bounded clique-width
contains bounded tree-width graphs. We give a polynomial time graph isomorphism
algorithm for graphs with clique-width at most three. Our work is independent
of the work by Grohe et al. \cite{grohe2015isomorphism} showing that the
isomorphism problem for graphs of bounded clique-width is polynomial time.

 <dc:description>  Generating descriptions for videos has many applications including assisting
blind people and human-robot interaction. The recent advances in image
captioning as well as the release of large-scale movie description datasets
such as MPII Movie Description allow to study this task in more depth. Many of
the proposed methods for image captioning rely on pre-trained object classifier
CNNs and Long-Short Term Memory recurrent networks (LSTMs) for generating
descriptions. While image description focuses on objects, we argue that it is
important to distinguish verbs, objects, and places in the challenging setting
of movie description. In this work we show how to learn robust visual
classifiers from the weak annotations of the sentence descriptions. Based on
these visual classifiers we learn how to generate a description using an LSTM.
We explore different design choices to build and train the LSTM and achieve the
best performance to date on the challenging MPII-MD dataset. We compare and
analyze our approach and prior work along various dimensions to better
understand the key challenges of the movie description task.

 <dc:title>A Novel Approach Towards Clustering Based Image Segmentation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bora, Dibya Jyoti</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In computer vision, image segmentation is always selected as a major research
topic by researchers. Due to its vital rule in image processing, there always
arises the need of a better image segmentation method. Clustering is an
unsupervised study with its application in almost every field of science and
engineering. Many researchers used clustering in image segmentation process.
But still there requires improvement of such approaches. In this paper, a novel
approach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give
importance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard
clustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on
choosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then
the segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is
analyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of
our original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the
performance.

We use social network analysis for creating coauthorship networks and given
that any paper must be tagged with two JEL codes, we use this information for
also structuring a thematic network. Then we calculate network metrics and find
main actors and clusters for coauthors and topics. We distinguish a gender gap
in the sample. Thematic networks show a cluster of codes and the analysis of
the cluster shows the preeminence of the tags related to trade, econometric,
distribution/poverty and health and education topics.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we develop a monocular SLAM-aware object recognition system
that is able to achieve considerably stronger recognition performance, as
compared to classical object recognition systems that function on a
frame-by-frame basis. By incorporating several key ideas including multi-view
object proposals and efficient feature encoding methods, our proposed system is
able to detect and robustly recognize objects in its environment using a single
RGB camera in near-constant time. Through experiments, we illustrate the
utility of using such a system to effectively detect and recognize objects,
incorporating multiple object viewpoint detections into a unified prediction
hypothesis. The performance of the proposed recognition system is evaluated on
the UW RGB-D Dataset, showing strong recognition performance and scalable
run-time performance compared to current state-of-the-art recognition systems.

 <dc:description>  The malicious alteration of machine time is a big challenge in computer
forensics. Detecting such changes and reconstructing the actual timeline of
events is of paramount importance. However, this can be difficult since the
attacker has many opportunities and means to hide such changes. In particular,
cloud computing, host and guest machine time can be manipulated in various ways
by an attacker. Guest virtual machines are especially vulnerable to attacks
coming from their (more privileged) host. As such, it is important to guarantee
the timeline integrity of both hosts and guests in a cloud, or at least to
ensure that the alteration of such timeline does not go undetected. In this
paper we survey the issues related to host and guest machine time integrity in
the cloud. Further, we describe a novel architecture for host and guest time
alteration detection and correction/resilience with respect to compromised
hosts and guests. The proposed framework has been implemented on an especially
built simulator. Collected results are evaluated and discussed. Performance
figures show the feasibility of our proposal.

 <dc:description>  The participatory Web has enabled the ubiquitous and pervasive access of
information, accompanied by an increase of speed and reach in information
sharing. Data dissemination services such as news aggregators are expected to
provide up-to-date, real-time information to the end users. News aggregators
are in essence recommendation systems that filter and rank news stories in
order to select the few that will appear on the users front screen at any time.
One of the main challenges in such systems is to address the recency and
latency problems, that is, to identify as soon as possible how important a news
story is. In this work we propose an integrated framework that aims at
predicting the importance of news items upon their publication with a focus on
recent and highly popular news, employing resampling strategies, and at
translating the result into concrete news rankings. We perform an extensive
experimental evaluation using real-life datasets of the proposed framework as
both a stand-alone system and when applied to news recommendations from Google
News. Additionally, we propose and evaluate a combinatorial solution to the
augmentation of official media recommendations with social information. Results
show that the proposed approach complements and enhances the news rankings
generated by state-of-the-art systems.

 <dc:description>  We develop a latent variable model and an efficient spectral algorithm
motivated by the recent emergence of very large data sets of chromatin marks
from multiple human cell types. A natural model for chromatin data in one cell
type is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM); we model the relationship between multiple
cell types by connecting their hidden states by a fixed tree of known
structure. The main challenge with learning parameters of such models is that
iterative methods such as EM are very slow, while naive spectral methods result
in time and space complexity exponential in the number of cell types. We
exploit properties of the tree structure of the hidden states to provide
spectral algorithms that are more computationally efficient for current
biological datasets. We provide sample complexity bounds for our algorithm and
evaluate it experimentally on biological data from nine human cell types.
Finally, we show that beyond our specific model, some of our algorithmic ideas
can be applied to other graphical models.

 <dc:description>  Weighted sampling without replacement has proved to be a very important tool
in designing new algorithms. Efraimidis and Spirakis (IPL 2006) presented an
algorithm for weighted sampling without replacement from data streams. Their
algorithm works under the assumption of precise computations over the interval
[0,1]. Cohen and Kaplan (VLDB 2008) used similar methods for their bottom-k
sketches.
  Efraimidis and Spirakis ask as an open question whether using finite
precision arithmetic impacts the accuracy of their algorithm. In this paper we
show a method to avoid this problem by providing a precise reduction from
k-sampling without replacement to k-sampling with replacement. We call the
resulting method Cascade Sampling.

 <dc:description>  We proposes an ultra low power wideband spectrum sensing architecture by
utilizing a one-bit quantization at the cognitive radio (CR) receiver. The
impact of this aggressive quantization is quantified and it is shown that the
proposed method is robust to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). We derive
closed-form expressions for both false alarm and detection probabilities. The
sensing performance and the analytical results are assessed through comparisons
with respective results from computer simulations. The results indicate that
the proposed method provides significant saving in power, complexity, and
sensing period on the account of an acceptable range of performance
degradation.

new prediction task, Neighbor Distribution Prediction (NDP), which aims at
predicting the distribution of the labels on neighbors of a given node and is
valuable for many different applications in heterogeneous information networks.
The challenges of NDP mainly come from three aspects: the infinity of the state
space of a neighbor distribution, the sparsity of available data, and how to
fairly evaluate the predictions. To address these challenges, we first propose
an Evolution Factor Model (EFM) for NDP, which utilizes two new structures
proposed in this paper, i.e. Neighbor Distribution Vector (NDV) to represent
the state of a given node's neighbors, and Neighbor Label Evolution Matrix
(NLEM) to capture the dynamics of a neighbor distribution, respectively. We
further propose a learning algorithm for Evolution Factor Model. To overcome
the problem of data sparsity, the learning algorithm first clusters all the
nodes and learns an NLEM for each cluster instead of for each node. For fairly
evaluating the predicting results, we propose a new metric: Virtual Accuracy
(VA), which takes into consideration both the absolute accuracy and the
predictability of a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three real
datasets from different domains validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model EFM and metric VA.

 <dc:description>  Verification of temporal logic properties plays a crucial role in proving the
desired behaviors of hybrid systems. In this paper, we propose an interval
method for verifying the properties described by a bounded linear temporal
logic. We relax the problem to allow outputting an inconclusive result when
verification process cannot succeed with a prescribed precision, and present an
efficient and rigorous monitoring algorithm that demonstrates that the problem
is decidable. This algorithm performs a forward simulation of a hybrid
automaton, detects a set of time intervals in which the atomic propositions
hold, and validates the property by propagating the time intervals. A
continuous state at a certain time computed in each step is enclosed by an
interval vector that is proven to contain a unique solution. In the
experiments, we show that the proposed method provides a useful tool for formal
analysis of nonlinear and complex hybrid systems.

 <dc:description>  Given a set \mathcal{P} of non-intersecting polygonal obstacles in

whose size is independent of n. We utilize \Omega to devise an algorithm to
compute a (1+\epsilon)-approximate Euclidean shortest path between two points
given with the description of \mathcal{P}. When \mathcal{P} comprises of convex
polygonal obstacles, we devise a (2+\epsilon)-approximation algorithm to

 <dc:title>Motion Planning in Non-Gaussian Belief Spaces (M3P): The Case of a

 <dc:description>  Planning under uncertainty is a key requirement for physical systems due to
the noisy nature of actuators and sensors. Using a belief space approach,
planning solutions tend to generate actions that result in information seeking
behavior which reduce state uncertainty. While recent work has dealt with
planning for Gaussian beliefs, for many cases, a multi-modal belief is a more
accurate representation of the underlying belief. This is particularly true in
environments with information symmetry that cause uncertain data associations
which naturally lead to a multi-modal hypothesis on the state. Thus, a planner
cannot simply base actions on the most-likely state. We propose an algorithm
that uses a Receding Horizon Planning approach to plan actions that
sequentially disambiguate the multi-modal belief to a uni-modal Gaussian and
achieve tight localization on the true state, called a Multi-Modal Motion
Planner (M3P). By combining a Gaussian sampling-based belief space planner with
M3P, and introducing a switching behavior in the planner and belief
representation, we present a holistic end-to-end solution for the belief space
planning problem. Simulation results for a 2D ground robot navigation problem
are presented that demonstrate our method's performance.

 <dc:description>  Enabling Internet connectivity for mobile objects that do not have a
permanent home or regular movements is a challenge due to their varying energy
budget, intermittent wireless connectivity, and inaccessibility. We present a
hardware and software framework that offers robust data collection, adaptive
execution of sensing tasks, and flexible remote reconfiguration of devices
deployed on nomadic mobile objects such as animals. The framework addresses the
overall complexity through a multi-tier architecture with low tier devices
operating on a tight energy harvesting budget and high tier cloud services
offering seamless delay-tolerant presentation of data to end users. Based on
our multi-year experience of applying this framework to animal tracking and
monitoring applications, we present the main challenges that we have
encountered, the design of software building blocks that address these
challenges, and examples of the data we collected on flying foxes.

 <dc:title>Approximation and Fixed Parameter Subquadratic Algorithms for Radius and
  Diameter</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Abboud, Amir</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  The radius and diameter are fundamental graph parameters. They are defined as
the minimum and maximum of the eccentricities in a graph, respectively, where
the eccentricity of a vertex is the largest distance from the vertex to another
node. In directed graphs, there are several versions of these problems. For
instance, one may choose to define the eccentricity of a node in terms of the
largest distance into the node, out of the node, the sum of the two directions
(i.e. roundtrip) and so on. All versions of diameter and radius can be solved
via solving all-pairs shortest paths (APSP), followed by a fast postprocessing
step. Solving APSP, however, on $n$-node graphs requires $\Omega(n^2)$ time
even in sparse graphs, as one needs to output $n^2$ distances.
  Motivated by known and new negative results on the impossibility of computing
these measures exactly in general graphs in truly subquadratic time, under
plausible assumptions, we search for \emph{approximation} and \emph{fixed
parameter subquadratic} algorithms, and for reasons why they do not exist.
  Our results include: - Truly subquadratic approximation algorithms for most
of the versions of Diameter and Radius with \emph{optimal} approximation
guarantees (given truly subquadratic time), under plausible assumptions. In
particular, there is a $2$-approximation algorithm for directed Radius with
one-way distances that runs in $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ time, while a
$(2-\delta)$-approximation algorithm in $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time is unlikely. -
On graphs with treewidth $k$, we can solve the problems in
$2^{O(k\log{k})}n^{1+o(1)}$ time. We show that these algorithms are near
optimal since even a $(3/2-\delta)$-approximation algorithm that runs in time
$2^{o(k)}n^{2-\epsilon}$ would refute the plausible assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model has a long history in describing
running behavior in animals and humans as well as has been used as a design
basis for robots capable of dynamic locomotion. Anchoring the SLIP for lossy
physical systems resulted in newer models which are extended versions of
original SLIP with viscous damping in the leg. However, such lossy models
require an additional mechanism for pumping energy to the system to control the
locomotion and to reach a limit-cycle. Some studies solved this problem by
adding an actively controllable torque actuation at the hip joint and this
actuation has been successively used in many robotic platforms, such as the
popular RHex robot. However, hip torque actuation produces forces on the COM
dominantly at forward direction with respect to ground, making height control
challenging especially at slow speeds. The situation becomes more severe when
the horizontal speed of the robot reaches zero, i.e. steady hoping without
moving in horizontal direction, and the system reaches to singularity in which
vertical degrees of freedom is completely lost. To this end, we propose an
extension of the lossy SLIP model with a slider-crank mechanism, SLIP- SCM,
that can generate a stable limit-cycle when the body is constrained to vertical
direction. We propose an approximate analytical solution to the nonlinear
system dynamics of SLIP- SCM model to characterize its behavior during the
locomotion. Finally, we perform a fixed-point stability analysis on SLIP-SCM
model using our approximate analytical solution and show that proposed model
exhibits stable behavior in our range of interest.

 <dc:description>  A number of elements towards a classification of the quality of emergence in
emergent collective systems are provided. By using those elements, several
classes of emergent systems are exemplified, ranging from simple aggregations
of simple parts up to complex organizations of complex collective systems. In
so doing, the factors likely to play a a significant role in the persistence of
emergence and its opposite are highlighted. From this, new elements for
discussion are identified also considering elements from the System of Leibniz.

done by asking directly to students, regardless of academic outcomes that have
been achieved in the previo us semester. This study discusses the development
of a hybrid model from fuzzy Mamdani and C4.5 algorithm to analyze the
determination of major specialization in informatics engineering courses of
Universities Raya Serang, where C4.5 algorithm is used as a shaper rule (rule)
which is used in the inference stage. Establishment of rules (decision tree)

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of multi-label classification. We
consider linear classifiers and propose to learn a prior over the space of
labels to directly leverage the performance of such methods. This prior takes
the form of a quadratic function of the labels and permits to encode both
attractive and repulsive relations between labels. We cast this problem as a
structured prediction one aiming at optimizing either the accuracies of the
predictors or the F 1-score. This leads to an optimization problem closely
related to the max-cut problem, which naturally leads to semidefinite and
spectral relaxations. We show on standard datasets how such a general prior can
improve the performances of multi-label techniques.

readily used with both data models. Based on this algorithm, we report that, in

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study resource allocation for a full-duplex (FD) radio base
station serving multiple half-duplex (HD) downlink and uplink users
simultaneously. The considered resource allocation algorithm design is
formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account minimum
required receive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) for downlink
and uplink communication and maximum tolerable SINRs at potential
eavesdroppers. The proposed optimization framework enables secure downlink and
uplink communication via artificial noise generation in the downlink for
interfering the potential eavesdroppers. We minimize the weighted sum of the
total downlink and uplink transmit power by jointly optimizing the downlink
beamformer, the artificial noise covariance matrix, and the uplink transmit
power. We adopt a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach to obtain
a tractable solution for the considered problem. The tightness of the SDP
relaxation is revealed by examining a sufficient condition for the global
optimality of the solution. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent
performance achieved by the proposed scheme and the significant transmit power
savings enabled optimization of the artificial noise covariance matrix.

 <dc:description>  Square grids are commonly used in robotics and game development as spatial
models and well known in AI community heuristic search algorithms (such as A*,
JPS, Theta* etc.) are widely used for path planning on grids. A lot of research
is concentrated on finding the shortest (in geometrical sense) paths while in
many applications finding smooth paths (rather than the shortest ones but
containing sharp turns) is preferable. In this paper we study the problem of
generating smooth paths and concentrate on angle constrained path planning. We
put angle-constrained path planning problem formally and present a new
algorithm tailored to solve it - LIAN. We examine LIAN both theoretically and
empirically. We show that it is sound and complete (under some restrictions).
We also show that LIAN outperforms the analogues when solving numerous path
planning tasks within urban outdoor navigation scenarios.

 <dc:title>Characterizing degrees of freedom through additive combinatorics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Stotz, David</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We establish a formal connection between the problem of characterizing
degrees of freedom (DoF) in constant single-antenna interference channels
(ICs), with general channel matrix, and the field of additive combinatorics.
The theory we develop is based on a recent breakthrough result by Hochman in
fractal geometry. Our first main contribution is an explicit condition on the
channel matrix to admit full, i.e., $K/2$ DoF; this condition is satisfied for
almost all channel matrices. We also provide a construction of corresponding
DoF-optimal input distributions. The second main result is a new DoF-formula
exclusively in terms of Shannon entropies. This formula is more amenable to
both analytical statements and numerical evaluations than the DoF-formula by Wu
et al., which is in terms of R\'enyi information dimension. We then use the new
DoF-formula to shed light on the hardness of finding the exact number of DoF in
ICs with rational channel coefficients, and to improve the best known bounds on
the DoF of a well-studied channel matrix.

 <dc:title>Logics of Essence and Accident</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fan, Jie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the literature, essence is formalized in two different ways, either de
dicto, or de re. Following \cite{Marcos:2005}, we adopt its de dicto
formalization: a formula is essential, if once it is true, it is necessarily
true; otherwise, it is accidental. In this article, we study the model theory
and axiomatization of the logic of essence and accident, i.e. the logic with
essence operator (or accident operator) as the only primitive modality. We show
that the logic of essence and accident is less expressive than modal logic on
non-reflexive models, but the two logics are equally expressive on reflexive
models. We prove that some frame properties are undefinable in the logic of
essence and accident, while some are. We propose the suitable bisimulation for
this logic, based on which we characterize the expressive power of this logic
within modal logic and within first-order logic. We axiomatize this logic over
various frame classes, among which the symmetric case is missing, and our
method is more suitable than those in the literature. We also find a method to
compute certain axioms used to axiomatize this logic over special frames in the
literature. As a side effect, we answer some open questions raised in
\cite{Marcos:2005}.

 <dc:description>  Context: Developers design test suites to automatically verify that software
meets its expected behaviors. Many dynamic analysis techniques are performed on
the exploitation of execution traces from test cases. However, in practice,
there is only one trace that results from the execution of one manually-written
test case.
  Objective: In this paper, we propose a new technique of test suite
refactoring, called B-Refactoring. The idea behind B-Refactoring is to split a
test case into small test fragments, which cover a simpler part of the control
flow to provide better support for dynamic analysis.
  Method: For a given dynamic analysis technique, our test suite refactoring
approach monitors the execution of test cases and identifies small test cases
without loss of the test ability. We apply B-Refactoring to assist two existing
analysis tasks: automatic repair of if-statements bugs and automatic analysis
of exception contracts.
  Results: Experimental results show that test suite refactoring can
effectively simplify the execution traces of the test suite. Three real-world
bugs that could previously not be fixed with the original test suite are fixed
after applying B-Refactoring; meanwhile, exception contracts are better
verified via applying B-Refactoring to original test suites.
  Conclusions: We conclude that applying B-Refactoring can effectively improve
the purity of test cases. Existing dynamic analysis tasks can be enhanced by
test suite refactoring.

 <dc:description>  We study the fundamental limits to communication-efficient distributed
methods for convex learning and optimization, under different assumptions on
the information available to individual machines, and the types of functions
considered. We identify cases where existing algorithms are already worst-case
optimal, as well as cases where room for further improvement is still possible.
Among other things, our results indicate that without similarity between the
local objective functions (due to statistical data similarity or otherwise)
many communication rounds may be required, even if the machines have unbounded
computational power.

 <dc:description>  Although, the fair amount of works in sentiment analysis (SA) and opinion
mining (OM) systems in the last decade and with respect to the performance of
these systems, but it still not desired performance, especially for
morphologically-Rich Language (MRL) such as Arabic, due to the complexities and
challenges exist in the nature of the languages itself. One of these challenges
is the detection of idioms or proverbs phrases within the writer text or
comment. An idiom or proverb is a form of speech or an expression that is
peculiar to itself. Grammatically, it cannot be understood from the individual
meanings of its elements and can yield different sentiment when treats as
separate words. Consequently, In order to facilitate the task of detection and
classification of lexical phrases for automated SA systems, this paper presents
AIPSeLEX a novel idioms/ proverbs sentiment lexicon for modern standard Arabic
(MSA) and colloquial. AIPSeLEX is manually collected and annotated at sentence
level with semantic orientation (positive or negative). The efforts of manually
building and annotating the lexicon are reported. Moreover, we build a
classifier that extracts idioms and proverbs, phrases from text using n-gram
and similarity measure methods. Finally, several experiments were carried out
on various data, including Arabic tweets and Arabic microblogs (hotel
reservation, product reviews, and TV program comments) from publicly available
Arabic online reviews websites (social media, blogs, forums, e-commerce web
sites) to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of AIPSeLEX.

 <dc:description>  In cellular systems, virtual multiple-input multiple-output (V-MIMO)
technology promises to achieve performance gains comparable to conventional
MIMO. In this paper, we propose cooperative relay selection algorithm based on
machine learning techniques. Willingness of user to cooperate in V-MIMO depends
on his current battery power, time and day along with incentives offered by
service provider. Every user has different criterion to participate in V-MIMO,
but allows a specific behavior pattern. Therefore, it is required to predict
willing users in the neighborhood of source user (SU), before selecting users
as cooperative nodes. Only inactive users belonging to Virtual Antenna Array
(VAA) cell of SU are assumed to cooperate. This reduces control overheads in
cooperative node discovery. In this paper, we employ prediction algorithm using
two machine learning techniques i.e. ANN and SVM to find out inactive willing
users within VAA cell. The parameters such as MSE, accuracy, precision and
recall are calculated to evaluate performance of ANN and SVM model. Prediction
using ANN has MSE of 3% with average accuracy of 97% (variance 0.37), whereas
SVM has MSE of 2.58% with average accuracy of 97.56% (variance 0.17). We also
observe that proposed prediction method reduces the node discovery time by
approximately 29%.

 <dc:description>  Recent studies have demonstrated the power of recurrent neural networks for
machine translation, image captioning and speech recognition. For the task of
capturing temporal structure in video, however, there still remain numerous
open research questions. Current research suggests using a simple temporal
feature pooling strategy to take into account the temporal aspect of video. We
demonstrate that this method is not sufficient for gesture recognition, where
temporal information is more discriminative compared to general video
classification tasks. We explore deep architectures for gesture recognition in
video and propose a new end-to-end trainable neural network architecture
incorporating temporal convolutions and bidirectional recurrence. Our main
contributions are twofold; first, we show that recurrence is crucial for this
task; second, we show that adding temporal convolutions leads to significant
improvements. We evaluate the different approaches on the Montalbano gesture
recognition dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  We propose an effective approach for spatio-temporal action localization in
realistic videos. The approach first detects proposals at the frame-level and
scores them with a combination of static and motion CNN features. It then
tracks high-scoring proposals throughout the video using a
tracking-by-detection approach. Our tracker relies simultaneously on
instance-level and class-level detectors. The tracks are scored using a
spatio-temporal motion histogram, a descriptor at the track level, in
combination with the CNN features. Finally, we perform temporal localization of
the action using a sliding-window approach at the track level. We present
experimental results for spatio-temporal localization on the UCF-Sports, J-HMDB
and UCF-101 action localization datasets, where our approach outperforms the
state of the art with a margin of 15%, 7% and 12% respectively in mAP.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the computational hardness of computing expected
outcomes and deciding (universal) (positive) almost-sure termination of
probabilistic programs. It is shown that computing lower and upper bounds of
expected outcomes is $\Sigma_1^0$- and $\Sigma_2^0$-complete, respectively.
Deciding (universal) almost-sure termination as well as deciding whether the
expected outcome of a program equals a given rational value is shown to be
$\Pi^0_2$-complete. Finally, it is shown that deciding (universal) positive
almost-sure termination is $\Sigma_2^0$-complete ($\Pi_3^0$-complete).

field. There are many applications and programs uses facial expression to
evaluate human character, judgment, feelings, and viewpoint. The process of
recognizing facial expression is a hard task due to the several circumstances
such as facial occlusions, face shape, illumination, face colors, and etc. This
paper present a PCA methodology to distinguish expressions of faces under
different circumstances and identifying it. Relies on Eigen faces technique
using standard Data base images. So as to overcome the problem of difficulty to

 <dc:description>  One of the fundamental aspects of ubiquitous computing is the instrumentation
of the real world by smart devices. This instrumentation constitutes an
opportunity to rethink the interactions between human beings and their
environment on the one hand, and between the components of this environment on
the other. In this paper we discuss what this understanding of ubiquitous
computing can bring to geographic science and particularly to GIS technology.
Our main idea is the instrumentation of the geographic environment through the
instrumentation of geographic objects composing it. And then investigate how
this instrumentation can meet the current limitations of GIS technology, and
offers a new stage of rapprochement between the earth and its abstraction. As
result, the current research work proposes a new concept we named Smart
Geographic Object SGO. The latter is a convergence point between the smart
objects and geographic objects, two concepts appertaining respectively to t

 <dc:title>A New Approach to Coding in Content Based MANETs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In content-based mobile ad hoc networks (CB-MANETs), random linear network
coding (NC) can be used to reliably disseminate large files under intermittent
connectivity. Conventional NC involves random unrestricted coding at
intermediate nodes. This however is vulnerable to pollution attacks. To avoid
attacks, a brute force approach is to restrict the mixing at the source.
However, source restricted NC generally reduces the robustness of the code in
the face of errors, losses and mobility induced intermittence. CB-MANETs
introduce a new option. Caching is common in CB MANETs and a fully reassembled
cached file can be viewed as a new source. Thus, NC packets can be mixed at all
sources (including the originator and the intermediate caches) yet still
providing protection from pollution. The hypothesis we wish to test in this
paper is whether in CB-MANETs with sufficient caches of a file, the performance
(in terms of robustness) of the restricted coding equals that of unrestricted
coding.
  In this paper, we examine and compare unrestricted coding to full cache
coding, source only coding, and no coding. As expected, we find that full cache
coding remains competitive with unrestricted coding while maintaining full
protection against pollution attacks.

 <dc:description>  A central method for analyzing the asymptotic complexity of a functional
program is to extract and then solve a recurrence that expresses evaluation
cost in terms of input size. The relevant notion of input size is often
specific to a datatype, with measures including the length of a list, the
maximum element in a list, and the height of a tree. In this work, we give a
formal account of the extraction of cost and size recurrences from higher-order
functional programs over inductive datatypes. Our approach allows a wide range
of programmer-specified notions of size, and ensures that the extracted
recurrences correctly predict evaluation cost. To extract a recurrence from a
program, we first make costs explicit by applying a monadic translation from
the source language to a complexity language, and then abstract datatype values
as sizes. Size abstraction can be done semantically, working in models of the
complexity language, or syntactically, by adding rules to a preorder judgement.
We give several different models of the complexity language, which support
different notions of size. Additionally, we prove by a logical relations
argument that recurrences extracted by this process are upper bounds for
evaluation cost; the proof is entirely syntactic and therefore applies to all
of the models we consider.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents techniques for digital image watermarking based on
eigenvalue decomposition of normal matrices. The introduced methods are
convenient and self-explanatory, achieve satisfactory results, as well as
require less and easy computations compared to some current methods. Through
the proposed methods, host images and watermarks are transformed to the space
of normal matrices, and the properties of spectral decompositions are dealt
with to obtain watermarked images. Watermark extraction is carried out via a
procedure similar to embedding. Experimental results are provided to illustrate
the reliability and robustness of the methods.

 <dc:description>  Linear Complementary Dual codes (LCD) are binary linear codes that meet their
dual trivially. We construct LCD codes using orthogonal matrices, self-dual
codes, combinatorial designs and Gray map from codes over the family of rings
$R_k$. We give a linear programming bound on the largest size of an LCD code of
given length and minimum distance. We make a table of lower bounds for this
combinatorial function for modest values of the parameters.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new method for low-rank approximation of Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverses (MPPs) of large-scale matrices using tensor networks. The
computed pseudoinverses can be useful for solving or preconditioning of
large-scale overdetermined or underdetermined systems of linear equations. The
computation is performed efficiently and stably based on the modified
alternating least squares (MALS) scheme using low-rank tensor train (TT)
decompositions and tensor network contractions. The formulated large-scale
optimization problem is reduced to sequential smaller-scale problems for which
any standard and stable algorithms can be applied. Regularization technique is
incorporated in order to alleviate ill-posedness and obtain robust low-rank
approximations. Numerical simulation results illustrate that the regularized
pseudoinverses of a wide class of non-square or nonsymmetric matrices admit
good approximate low-rank TT representations. Moreover, we demonstrated that
the computational cost of the proposed method is only logarithmic in the matrix
size given that the TT-ranks of a data matrix and its approximate pseudoinverse
are bounded. It is illustrated that a strongly nonsymmetric
convection-diffusion problem can be efficiently solved by using the
preconditioners computed by the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Cooperative ITS is enabling vehicles to communicate with the infrastructure
to provide improvements in traffic control. A promising approach consists in
anticipating the road profile and the upcoming dynamic events like traffic
lights. This topic has been addressed in the French public project Co-Drive
through functions developed by Valeo named Green Light Optimal Speed Advisor
(GLOSA). The system advises the optimal speed to pass the next traffic light
without stopping. This paper presents results of its performance in different
scenarios through simulations and real driving measurements. A scaling is done
in an urban area, with different penetration rates in vehicle and
infrastructure equipment for vehicular communication. Our simulation results
indicate that GLOSA can reduce CO2 emissions, waiting time and travel time,
both in experimental conditions and in real traffic conditions.

 <dc:description>  In this work we study the reliability and secrecy performance achievable by
practical LDPC codes over the Gaussian wiretap channel. While several works
have already addressed this problem in asymptotic conditions, i.e., under the
hypothesis of codewords of infinite length, only a few approaches exist for the
finite length regime. We propose an approach to measure the performance of
practical codes and compare it with that achievable in asymptotic conditions.
Moreover, based on the secrecy metrics we adopt to achieve this target, we
propose a code optimization algorithm which allows to design irregular LDPC
codes able to approach the ultimate performance limits even at moderately small
codeword lengths (in the order of 10000 bits).

 <dc:description>  Many classical algorithms are found until several years later to outlive the
confines in which they were conceived, and continue to be relevant in
unforeseen settings. In this paper, we show that SVRG is one such method: being
originally designed for strongly convex objectives, it is also very robust in
non-strongly convex or sum-of-non-convex settings.
  More precisely, we provide new analysis to improve the state-of-the-art
running times in both settings by either applying SVRG or its novel variant.
Since non-strongly convex objectives include important examples such as Lasso
or logistic regression, and sum-of-non-convex objectives include famous
examples such as stochastic PCA and is even believed to be related to training
deep neural nets, our results also imply better performances in these
applications.

 <dc:description>  RDF data are used to model knowledge in various areas such as life sciences,
Semantic Web, bioinformatics, and social graphs. The size of real RDF data
reaches billions of triples. This calls for a framework for efficiently
processing RDF data. The core function of processing RDF data is subgraph
pattern matching. There have been two completely different directions for
supporting efficient subgraph pattern matching. One direction is to develop
specialized RDF query processing engines exploiting the properties of RDF data
for the last decade, while the other direction is to develop efficient subgraph
isomorphism algorithms for general, labeled graphs for over 30 years. Although
both directions have a similar goal (i.e., finding subgraphs in data graphs for
a given query graph), they have been independently researched without clear
reason. We argue that a subgraph isomorphism algorithm can be easily modified
to handle the graph homomorphism, which is the RDF pattern matching semantics,
by just removing the injectivity constraint. In this paper, based on the
state-of-the-art subgraph isomorphism algorithm, we propose an in-memory
solution, TurboHOM++, which is tamed for the RDF processing, and we compare it
with the representative RDF processing engines for several RDF benchmarks in a
server machine where billions of triples can be loaded in memory. In order to
speed up TurboHOM++, we also provide a simple yet effective transformation and
a series of optimization techniques. Extensive experiments using several RDF
benchmarks show that TurboHOM++ consistently and significantly outperforms the
representative RDF engines. Specifically, TurboHOM++ outperforms its
competitors by up to five orders of magnitude.

to provide superior performance in certain human supervisory control missions.
These results motivate the need for the development of robust, reliable
usability metrics to aid in creating interfaces for use in this domain. To this
end, we conduct a pilot usability study of a particular task-based supervisory
control interface called the Research Environment for Supervisory Control of
Heterogenous Unmanned Vehicles (RESCHU). In particular, we explore the use of
eye-tracking metrics as an objective means of evaluating the RESCHU interface
and providing guidance in improving usability. Our main goals for this study
are to 1) better understand how eye-tracking can augment standard usability
metrics, 2) formulate initial models of operator behavior, and 3) identify
interesting areas of future research.

 <dc:description>  At a time when information seekers first turn to digital sources for news and
opinion, it is critical that we understand the role that social media plays in
human behavior. This is especially true when information consumers also act as
information producers and editors by their online activity. In order to better
understand the effects that editorial ratings have on online human behavior, we
report the results of a large-scale in-vivo experiment in social media. We find
that small, random rating manipulations on social media submissions created
significant changes in downstream ratings resulting in significantly different
final outcomes. Positive treatment resulted in a positive effect that increased
the final rating by 11.02% on average. Compared to the control group, positive
treatment also increased the probability of reaching a high rating (&gt;=2000) by
24.6%. Contrary to the results of related work we also find that negative
treatment resulted in a negative effect that decreased the final rating by
5.15% on average.

 <dc:description>  Cities and their transportation systems become increasingly complex and
multimodal as they grow, and it is natural to wonder if it is possible to
quantitatively characterize our difficulty to navigate in them and whether such
navigation exceeds our cognitive limits. A transition between different
searching strategies for navigating in metropolitan maps has been observed for
large, complex metropolitan networks. This evidence suggests the existence of
another limit associated to the cognitive overload and caused by large amounts
of information to process. In this light, we analyzed the world's 15 largest
metropolitan networks and estimated the information limit for determining a
trip in a transportation system to be on the order of 8 bits. Similar to the
&quot;Dunbar number,&quot; which represents a limit to the size of an individual's
friendship circle, our cognitive limit suggests that maps should not consist of
more than about $250$ connections points to be easily readable. We also show
that including connections with other transportation modes dramatically
increases the information needed to navigate in multilayer transportation
networks: in large cities such as New York, Paris, and Tokyo, more than $80\%$
of trips are above the 8-bit limit. Multimodal transportation systems in large
cities have thus already exceeded human cognitive limits and consequently the
traditional view of navigation in cities has to be revised substantially.

 <dc:description>  Current distributed representations of words show little resemblance to
theories of lexical semantics. The former are dense and uninterpretable, the
latter largely based on familiar, discrete classes (e.g., supersenses) and
relations (e.g., synonymy and hypernymy). We propose methods that transform
word vectors into sparse (and optionally binary) vectors. The resulting
representations are more similar to the interpretable features typically used
in NLP, though they are discovered automatically from raw corpora. Because the
vectors are highly sparse, they are computationally easy to work with. Most
importantly, we find that they outperform the original vectors on benchmark
tasks.

 <dc:description>  We consider classical estimators for a class of physically realizable linear
quantum systems. Optimal estimation using a complex Kalman filter for this
problem has been previously explored. Here, we study robust $H_\infty$
estimation for uncertain linear quantum systems. The estimation problem is
solved by converting it to a suitably scaled $H_\infty$ control problem. The
solution is obtained in the form of two algebraic Riccati equations. Relevant
examples involving dynamic squeezers are presented to illustrate the efficacy
of our method.

 <dc:description>  Some online advertising offers pay only when an ad elicits a response.
Randomness and uncertainty about response rates make showing those ads a risky
investment for online publishers. Like financial investors, publishers can use
portfolio allocation over multiple advertising offers to pursue revenue while
controlling risk. Allocations over multiple offers do not have a distinct
winner and runner-up, so the usual second-price mechanism does not apply. This
paper develops a pricing mechanism for portfolio allocations. The mechanism is
efficient, truthful, and rewards offers that reduce risk.

 <dc:description>  In markets for online advertising, some advertisers pay only when users
respond to ads. So publishers estimate ad response rates and multiply by
advertiser bids to estimate expected revenue for showing ads. Since these
estimates may be inaccurate, the publisher risks not selecting the ad for each
ad call that would maximize revenue. The variance of revenue can be decomposed
into two components -- variance due to `uncertainty' because the true response
rate is unknown, and variance due to `randomness' because realized response
statistics fluctuate around the true response rate. Over a sequence of many ad
calls, the variance due to randomness nearly vanishes due to the law of large
numbers. However, the variance due to uncertainty doesn't diminish.
  We introduce a technique for ad selection that augments existing estimation
and explore-exploit methods. The technique uses methods from portfolio
optimization to produce a distribution over ads rather than selecting the
single ad that maximizes estimated expected revenue. Over a sequence of similar
ad calls, ads are selected according to the distribution. This approach
decreases the effects of uncertainty and increases revenue.

 <dc:title>Capacity of the Energy Harvesting Channel with a Finite Battery</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider an energy harvesting channel, in which the transmitter is powered
by an exogenous stochastic energy harvesting process $E_t$, such that $0\leq
E_t\leq\bar{E}$, which can be stored in a battery of finite size $\bar{B}$. We
provide a simple and insightful formula for the approximate capacity of this
channel with bounded guarantee on the approximation gap independent of system
parameters. This approximate characterization of the capacity identifies two
qualitatively different operating regimes for this channel: in the large
battery regime, when $\bar{B}\geq \bar{E}$, the capacity is approximately equal
to that of an AWGN channel with an average power constraint equal to the
average energy harvesting rate, i.e. it depends only on the mean of $E_t$ and
is (almost) independent of the distribution of $E_t$ and the exact value of
$\bar{B}$. In particular, this suggests that a battery size
$\bar{B}\approx\bar{E}$ is approximately sufficient to extract the infinite
battery capacity of the system. In the small battery regime, when
$\bar{B}&lt;\bar{E}$, we clarify the dependence of the capacity on the
distribution of $E_t$ and the value of $\bar{B}$. There are three steps to
proving this result which can be of interest in their own right: 1) we
characterize the capacity of this channel as an $n$-letter mutual information
rate under various assumptions on the availability of energy arrival
information; 2) we characterize the approximately optimal online power control
policy that maximizes the long-term average throughput of the system; 3) we
show that the information-theoretic capacity of this channel is equal, within a
constant gap, to its long-term average throughput. This last result provides a
connection between the information- and communication-theoretic formulations of
the energy-harvesting communication problem that have been so far studied in
isolation.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of
models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant
to the input data in a computationally and parameter efficient manner. In this
work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which
explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This
differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional
architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially
transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any
extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show
that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance
to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes
of transformations.

 <dc:description>  We investigate if feedback can increase the capacity of an energy harvesting
communication channel where a transmitter powered by an exogenous energy
arrival process and equipped with a finite battery communicates to a receiver
over a memoryless channel. For a simple special case where the energy arrival
process is deterministic and the channel is a BEC, we explicitly compute the
feed-forward and feedback capacities and show that feedback can strictly
increase the capacity of this channel. Building on this example, we also show
that feedback can increase the capacity when the energy arrivals are i.i.d.
known noncausally at the transmitter and the receiver.

 <dc:description>  A smart meter (SM) periodically measures end-user electricity consumption and
reports it to a utility provider (UP). Despite the advantages of SMs, their use
leads to serious concerns about consumer privacy. In this paper, SM privacy is
studied by considering the presence of an energy harvesting device (EHD) as a
means of masking the user's input load. The user can satisfy part or all of
his/her energy needs from the EHD, and hence, less information can be leaked to
the UP via the SM. The EHD is typically equipped with a rechargeable energy
storage device, i.e., a battery, whose instantaneous energy content limits the
user's capability in covering his/her energy usage. Privacy is measured by the
information leaked about the user's real energy consumption when the UP
observes the energy requested from the grid, which the SM reads and reports to
the UP. The minimum information leakage rate is characterized as a computable
information theoretic single-letter expression when the EHD battery capacity is
either infinite or zero. Numerical results are presented for a discrete binary
input load to illustrate the potential privacy gains from the existence of a
storage device.

 <dc:description>  Let $f$ be a polynomial of degree $d$ in $n$ variables over a finite field
$\mathbb{F}$. The polynomial is said to be unbiased if the distribution of
$f(x)$ for a uniform input $x \in \mathbb{F}^n$ is close to the uniform
distribution over $\mathbb{F}$, and is called biased otherwise. The polynomial
is said to have low rank if it can be expressed as a composition of a few lower
degree polynomials. Green and Tao [Contrib. Discrete Math 2009] and Kaufman and
Lovett [FOCS 2008] showed that bias implies low rank for fixed degree
polynomials over fixed prime fields. This lies at the heart of many tools in
higher order Fourier analysis. In this work, we extend this result to all prime
fields (of size possibly growing with $n$). We also provide a generalization to
nonprime fields in the large characteristic case. However, we state all our
applications in the prime field setting for the sake of simplicity of
presentation.
  As an immediate application, we obtain improved bounds for a suite of
problems in effective algebraic geometry, including Hilbert nullstellensatz,
radical membership and counting rational points in low degree varieties.
  Using the above generalization to large fields as a starting point, we are
also able to settle the list decoding radius of fixed degree Reed-Muller codes
over growing fields. The case of fixed size fields was solved by Bhowmick and
Lovett [STOC 2015], which resolved a conjecture of Gopalan-Klivans-Zuckerman
[STOC 2008]. Here, we show that the list decoding radius is equal the minimum
distance of the code for all fixed degrees, even when the field size is
possibly growing with $n$.

 <dc:title>Sentence Directed Video Object Codetection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We tackle the problem of video object codetection by leveraging the weak
semantic constraint implied by sentences that describe the video content.
Unlike most existing work that focuses on codetecting large objects which are
usually salient both in size and appearance, we can codetect objects that are
small or medium sized. Our method assumes no human pose or depth information
such as is required by the most recent state-of-the-art method. We employ weak
semantic constraint on the codetection process by pairing the video with
sentences. Although the semantic information is usually simple and weak, it can
greatly boost the performance of our codetection framework by reducing the
search space of the hypothesized object detections. Our experiment demonstrates
an average IoU score of 0.423 on a new challenging dataset which contains 15
object classes and 150 videos with 12,509 frames in total, and an average IoU
score of 0.373 on a subset of an existing dataset, originally intended for
activity recognition, which contains 5 object classes and 75 videos with 8,854
frames in total.

 <dc:title>Similarity, Cardinality and Entropy for Bipolar Fuzzy Set in the
  Framework of Penta-valued Representation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Patrascu, Vasile</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper one presents new similarity, cardinality and entropy measures
for bipolar fuzzy set and for its particular forms like intuitionistic,
paraconsistent and fuzzy set. All these are constructed in the framework of
multi-valued representations and are based on a penta-valued logic that uses
the following logical values: true, false, unknown, contradictory and
ambiguous. Also a new distance for bounded real interval was defined.

 <dc:description>  In the recent years, the multilayer networks have increasingly been realized
as a more realistic framework to understand emergent physical phenomena in
complex real world systems. We analyze a massive time-varying social data drawn
from the largest film industry of the world under multilayer network framework.
The framework enables us to evaluate the versatility of actors, which turns out
to be an intrinsic property of lead actors. Versatility in dimers suggests that
working with different types of nodes are more beneficial than with similar
ones. However, the triangles yield a different relation between type of
co-actor and the success of lead nodes indicating the importance of higher
order motifs in understanding the properties of the underlying system.
Furthermore, despite the degree-degree correlations of entire networks being
neutral, multilayering picks up different values of correlation indicating
positive connotations like trust, in the recent years. Analysis of weak ties of
the industry uncovers nodes from lower degree regime being important in linking
Bollywood clusters. The framework and the tools used herein may be used for
unraveling the complexity of other real world systems.

 <dc:description>  Because Facebook is available on hundreds of millions of desktop and mobile
computing platforms around the world and because it is available on many
different kinds of platforms (from desktops and laptops running Windows, Unix,
or OS X to hand held devices running iOS, Android, or Windows Phone), it would
seem to be the perfect place to conduct steganography. On Facebook, information
hidden in image files will be further obscured within the millions of pictures
and other images posted and transmitted daily. Facebook is known to alter and
compress uploaded images so they use minimum space and bandwidth when displayed
on Facebook pages. The compression process generally disrupts attempts to use
Facebook for image steganography. This paper explores a method to minimize the
disruption so JPEG images can be used as steganography carriers on Facebook.

 <dc:description>  Training large-scale question answering systems is complicated because
training sources usually cover a small portion of the range of possible
questions. This paper studies the impact of multitask and transfer learning for
simple question answering; a setting for which the reasoning required to answer
is quite easy, as long as one can retrieve the correct evidence given a
question, which can be difficult in large-scale conditions. To this end, we
introduce a new dataset of 100k questions that we use in conjunction with
existing benchmarks. We conduct our study within the framework of Memory
Networks (Weston et al., 2015) because this perspective allows us to eventually
scale up to more complex reasoning, and show that Memory Networks can be
successfully trained to achieve excellent performance.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and specifically a variant with Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are enjoying renewed interest as a result of
successful applications in a wide range of machine learning problems that
involve sequential data. However, while LSTMs provide exceptional results in
practice, the source of their performance and their limitations remain rather
poorly understood. Using character-level language models as an interpretable
testbed, we aim to bridge this gap by providing an analysis of their
representations, predictions and error types. In particular, our experiments
reveal the existence of interpretable cells that keep track of long-range
dependencies such as line lengths, quotes and brackets. Moreover, our
comparative analysis with finite horizon n-gram models traces the source of the
LSTM improvements to long-range structural dependencies. Finally, we provide
analysis of the remaining errors and suggests areas for further study.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new gradient-domain technique for processing registered EM image
stacks to remove inter-image discontinuities while preserving intra-image
detail. To this end, we process the image stack by first performing anisotropic
smoothing along the slice axis and then solving a Poisson equation within each
slice to re-introduce the detail. The final image stack is continuous across
the slice axis and maintains sharp details within each slice. Adapting existing
out-of-core techniques for solving the linear system, we describe a parallel
algorithm with time complexity that is linear in the size of the data and space
complexity that is sub-linear, allowing us to process datasets as large as five
teravoxels with a 600 MB memory footprint.

 <dc:title>Local Nonstationarity for Efficient Bayesian Optimization</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bayesian optimization has shown to be a fundamental global optimization
algorithm in many applications: ranging from automatic machine learning,
robotics, reinforcement learning, experimental design, simulations, etc. The
most popular and effective Bayesian optimization relies on a surrogate model in
the form of a Gaussian process due to its flexibility to represent a prior over
function. However, many algorithms and setups relies on the stationarity
assumption of the Gaussian process. In this paper, we present a novel
nonstationary strategy for Bayesian optimization that is able to outperform the
state of the art in Bayesian optimization both in stationary and nonstationary
problems.

 <dc:description>  This report covers an intelligent decision support system (IDSS), which
handles an efficient and effective way to rapidly inspect containerized cargos
for defection. Defection is either cargo exposure to radiation, physical
damages such as holes, punctured surfaces, iron surface oxidation, etc. The
system uses a sorting array triangulation technique (SAT) and surface damage
detection (SDD) to conduct the inspection. This new technique saves time and
money on finding damaged goods during transportation such that, instead of
running $n$ inspections on $n$ containers, only 3 inspections per triangulation
or a ratio of $3:n$ is required, assuming $n &gt; 3$ containers. The damaged stack
in the array is virtually detected contiguous to an actually-damaged cargo by
calculating nearby distances of such cargos, delivering reliable estimates for
the whole local stack population. The estimated values on damaged, somewhat
damaged and undamaged cargo stacks, are listed and profiled after being sorted
by the program, thereby submitted to the manager for a final decision. The
report describes the problem domain and the implementation of the simulator
prototype, showing how the system operates via software, hardware with/without
human agents, conducting real-time inspections and management per se.

 <dc:description>  With the advance of fluorescence imaging technologies, recently cell
biologists are able to record the movement of protein vesicles within a living
cell. Automatic tracking of the movements of these vesicles become key for
qualitative analysis of dynamics of theses vesicles. In this thesis, we
formulate such tracking problem as video object tracking problem, and design a
dynamic programming method for tracking single object. Our experiments on
simulation data show that the method can identify a track with high accuracy
which is robust to the choose of tracking parameters and presence of high level
noise. We then extend this method to the tracking multiple objects using the
track elimination strategy. In multiple object tracking, the above approach
often fails to correctly identify a track when two tracks cross. We solve this
problem by incorporating the Kalman filter into the dynamic programming
framework. Our experiments on simulated data show that the tracking accuracy is
significantly improved.

 <dc:title>Gene selection for cancer classification using a hybrid of univariate

 <dc:description>  Various approaches to gene selection for cancer classification based on
microarray data can be found in the literature and they may be grouped into two
categories: univariate methods and multivariate methods. Univariate methods
look at each gene in the data in isolation from others. They measure the
contribution of a particular gene to the classification without considering the
presence of the other genes. In contrast, multivariate methods measure the
relative contribution of a gene to the classification by taking the other genes
in the data into consideration. Multivariate methods select fewer genes in
general. However, the selection process of multivariate methods may be
sensitive to the presence of irrelevant genes, noises in the expression and
outliers in the training data. At the same time, the computational cost of
multivariate methods is high. To overcome the disadvantages of the two types of
approaches, we propose a hybrid method to obtain gene sets that are small and
highly discriminative.
  We devise our hybrid method from the univariate Maximum Likelihood method
(LIK) and the multivariate Recursive Feature Elimination method (RFE). We
analyze the properties of these methods and systematically test the
effectiveness of our proposed method on two cancer microarray datasets. Our
experiments on a leukemia dataset and a small, round blue cell tumors dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid method. It is able to discover sets
consisting of fewer genes than those reported in the literature and at the same
time achieve the same or better prediction accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Microarray is a technology to quantitatively monitor the expression of large
number of genes in parallel. It has become one of the main tools for global
gene expression analysis in molecular biology research in recent years. The
large amount of expression data generated by this technology makes the study of
certain complex biological problems possible and machine learning methods are
playing a crucial role in the analysis process. At present, many machine
learning methods have been or have the potential to be applied to major areas
of gene expression analysis. These areas include clustering, classification,
dynamic modeling and reverse engineering.
  In this thesis, we focus our work on using machine learning methods to solve
the classification problems arising from microarray data. We first identify the
major types of the classification problems; then apply several machine learning
methods to solve the problems and perform systematic tests on real and
artificial datasets. We propose improvement to existing methods. Specifically,
we develop a multivariate and a hybrid feature selection method to obtain high
classification performance for high dimension classification problems. Using
the hybrid feature selection method, we are able to identify small sets of
features that give predictive accuracy that is as good as that from other
methods which require many more features.

 <dc:description>  For many users on social networks, one of the goals when broadcasting content
is to reach a large audience. The probability of receiving reactions to a
message differs for each user and depends on various factors, such as location,
daily and weekly behavior patterns and the visibility of the message. While
previous work has focused on overall network dynamics and message flow
cascades, the problem of recommending personalized posting times has remained
an underexplored topic of research. In this study, we formulate a when-to-post
problem, where the objective is to find the best times for a user to post on
social networks in order to maximize the probability of audience responses. To
understand the complexity of the problem, we examine user behavior in terms of
post-to-reaction times, and compare cross-network and cross-city weekly
reaction behavior for users in different cities, on both Twitter and Facebook.
We perform this analysis on over a billion posted messages and observed
reactions, and propose multiple approaches for generating personalized posting
schedules. We empirically assess these schedules on a sampled user set of 0.5
million active users and more than 25 million messages observed over a 56 day
period. We show that users see a reaction gain of up to 17% on Facebook and 4%
on Twitter when the recommended posting times are used. We open the dataset
used in this study, which includes timestamps for over 144 million posts and
over 1.1 billion reactions. The personalized schedules derived here are used in
a fully deployed production system to recommend posting times for millions of
users every day.

 <dc:title>Optimum-width upward drawings of trees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Biedl, Therese</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An upward drawing of a tree is a drawing such that no parents are below their
children. It is order-preserving if the edges to children appear in prescribed
order around each node. Chan showed that any tree has an upward
order-preserving drawing with width O(log n). In this paper, we present
linear-time algorithms that finds upward with instance-optimal width, i.e., the
width is the minimum-possible for the input tree.
  We study two different models. In the first model, the drawings need not be
order-preserving; a very simple algorithm then finds straight-line drawings of
optimal width. In the second model, the drawings must be order-preserving; and
we give an algorithm that finds optimum-width poly-line drawings, i.e., edges
are allowed to have bends. We also briefly study order-preserving upward
straight-line drawings, and show that some trees require larger width if
drawings must be straight-line.

 <dc:description>  Image Steganography is a thriving research area of information security where
secret data is embedded in images to hide its existence while getting the
minimum possible statistical detectability. This paper proposes a novel magic
least significant bit substitution method (M-LSB-SM) for RGB images. The
proposed method is based on the achromatic component (I-plane) of the
hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color model and multi-level encryption (MLE) in
the spatial domain. The input image is transposed and converted into an HSI
color space. The I-plane is divided into four sub-images of equal size,
rotating each sub-image with a different angle using a secret key. The secret
information is divided into four blocks, which are then encrypted using an MLE
algorithm (MLEA). Each sub-block of the message is embedded into one of the
rotated sub-images based on a specific pattern using magic LSB substitution.
Experimental results validate that the proposed method not only enhances the
visual quality of stego images but also provides good imperceptibility and
multiple security levels as compared to several existing prominent methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, frequency-domain analysis based on frequency sweep method is
presented for a nonlinear double integrator and a new linear integrator. All
the two types of integrators can estimate the onefold and double integrals of a
signal synchronously. With respect to the linear double integrator, the
nonlinear integrator has better estimation performance and stronger robustness.
Importantly, the integrator parameters can be regulated from the

 <dc:description>  The semantic image segmentation task presents a trade-off between test time
accuracy and training-time annotation cost. Detailed per-pixel annotations
enable training accurate models but are very time-consuming to obtain,
image-level class labels are an order of magnitude cheaper but result in less
accurate models. We take a natural step from image-level annotation towards
stronger supervision: we ask annotators to point to an object if one exists. We
incorporate this point supervision along with a novel objectness potential in
the training loss function of a CNN model. Experimental results on the PASCAL
VOC 2012 benchmark reveal that the combined effect of point-level supervision
and objectness potential yields an improvement of 12.9% mIOU over image-level
supervision. Further, we demonstrate that models trained with point-level
supervision are more accurate than models trained with image-level,
squiggle-level or full supervision given a fixed annotation budget.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider the class of multi-state autoregressive processes
that can be used to model non-stationary time-series of interest. In order to
capture different autoregressive (AR) states underlying an observed time
series, it is crucial to select the appropriate number of states. We propose a
new model selection technique based on the Gap statistics, which uses a null
reference distribution on the stable AR filters to check whether adding a new
AR state significantly improves the performance of the model. To that end, we
define a new distance measure between AR filters based on mean squared
prediction error (MSPE), and propose an efficient method to generate random
stable filters that are uniformly distributed in the coefficient space.
Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed
approach.

 <dc:description>  Deep structured output learning shows great promise in tasks like semantic
image segmentation. We proffer a new, efficient deep structured model learning
scheme, in which we show how deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be
used to estimate the messages in message passing inference for structured
prediction with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). With such CNN message
estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for
message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since
otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it
is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient
iteration. The network output dimension for message estimation is the same as
the number of classes, in contrast to the network output for general CNN
potential functions in CRFs, which is exponential in the order of the
potentials. Hence CNN message learning has fewer network parameters and is more
scalable for cases that a large number of classes are involved. We apply our
method to semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. We
achieve an intersection-over-union score of 73.4 on its test set, which is the
best reported result for methods using the VOC training images alone. This
impressive performance demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of our CNN
message learning method.

 <dc:title>Selective Greedy Equivalence Search: Finding Optimal Bayesian Networks

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce Selective Greedy Equivalence Search (SGES), a restricted version
of Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). SGES retains the asymptotic correctness of
GES but, unlike GES, has polynomial performance guarantees. In particular, we
show that when data are sampled independently from a distribution that is
perfect with respect to a DAG ${\cal G}$ defined over the observable variables
then, in the limit of large data, SGES will identify ${\cal G}$'s equivalence
class after a number of score evaluations that is (1) polynomial in the number
of nodes and (2) exponential in various complexity measures including
maximum-number-of-parents, maximum-clique-size, and a new measure called {\em
v-width} that is at least as small as---and potentially much smaller than---the
other two. More generally, we show that for any hereditary and
equivalence-invariant property $\Pi$ known to hold in ${\cal G}$, we retain the
large-sample optimality guarantees of GES even if we ignore any GES deletion
operator during the backward phase that results in a state for which $\Pi$ does
not hold in the common-descendants subgraph.

 <dc:description>  Deep networks trained on large-scale data can learn transferable features to
promote learning multiple tasks. Since deep features eventually transition from
general to specific along deep networks, a fundamental problem of multi-task
learning is how to exploit the task relatedness underlying parameter tensors
and improve feature transferability in the multiple task-specific layers. This
paper presents Multilinear Relationship Networks (MRN) that discover the task
relationships based on novel tensor normal priors over parameter tensors of
multiple task-specific layers in deep convolutional networks. By jointly
learning transferable features and multilinear relationships of tasks and
features, MRN is able to alleviate the dilemma of negative-transfer in the
feature layers and under-transfer in the classifier layer. Experiments show
that MRN yields state-of-the-art results on three multi-task learning datasets.

triggered many ICT-enabled services. Regarding this service, the complementary
ICT system involves with customers' devices, industry-wide ICT development and
nation-wide ICT infrastructure, which are difficult for any individual
organization to control. The ICT predicament is the phenomenon that the
complementary ICT system is inferior in delivering the promised service quality
of new ICT-enabled service. With the ICT predicament, companies face the
decision-making dilemma in launching the new service or postponing the launch.
This study proposes a process to resolve the decision-making dilemma regarding

 <dc:description>  The recent progress in the area of self-interference cancellation (SIC)
design has enabled the development of full-duplex (FD) single and multiple
antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a design for FD eNodeB (eNB) and
user equipment (UE) for 5G networks. The use of FD operation enables
simultaneous in-band uplink and downlink operation and thereby cutting down the
spectrum requirement by half. FD operation requires the same subcarrier
allocation to UE in both uplink and downlink. Long Term Evolution LTE) uses
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) for downlink. To enable
FD operation, we propose using single carrier frequency division multiple
access SC-FDMA) for downlink along with the conventional method of using it for
uplink. Taking advantage of channel reciprocity, singular value decomposition
(SVD) based eamforming in the downlink allows multiple users (MU) to operate on
same set of subcarriers. In uplink, frequency domain minimum mean square error
(MMSE) equalizer along with successive interference cancellation with optimal
ordering (SSIC-OO) algorithm is used to decouple signals of users operating in
the same set of subcarriers. The work includes simulations showing efficient FD
operation both at UE and eNB for downlink and uplink respectively.

 <dc:title>Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in

 <dc:description>  Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine
learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture
model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically
grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a
prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical
framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate
Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory
gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information
from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the
problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either
computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the
properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and
non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using
MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive
log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and
finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.

 <dc:title>Nested Lattice Codes for Secure Bidirectional Relaying with Asymmetric
  Channel Gains</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vatedka, Shashank</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The basic problem of secure bidirectional relaying involves two users who
want to exchange messages via an intermediate &quot;honest-but-curious&quot; relay node.
There is no direct link between the users, all communication must take place
via the relay node. The links between the user nodes and the relay are wireless
links with Gaussian noise. It is required that the users' messages be kept
secure from the relay. In prior work, we proposed coding schemes based on
nested lattices for this problem, assuming that the channel gains from the two
user nodes to the relay are identical. We also analyzed the power-rate tradeoff
for secure and reliable message exchange using our coding schemes. In this
paper, we extend our prior work to the case when the channel gains are not
necessarily identical, and are known to the relay node but perhaps not to the
users. We show that using our scheme, perfect secrecy can be obtained only for
certain values of the channel gains, and analyze the power-rate tradeoff in
these cases. We also make similar observations for our strongly-secure scheme.

 <dc:description>  For a given regular language of infinite trees, one can ask about the minimal
number of priorities needed to recognize this language with a
non-deterministic, alternating, or weak alternating parity automaton. These
questions are known as, respectively, the non-deterministic, alternating, and
weak Rabin-Mostowski index problems. Whether they can be answered effectively
is a long-standing open problem, solved so far only for languages recognizable
by deterministic automata (the alternating variant trivializes).
  We investigate a wider class of regular languages, recognizable by so-called
game automata, which can be seen as the closure of deterministic ones under
complementation and composition. Game automata are known to recognize languages
arbitrarily high in the alternating Rabin-Mostowski index hierarchy; that is,
the alternating index problem does not trivialize any more.
  Our main contribution is that all three index problems are decidable for
languages recognizable by game automata. Additionally, we show that it is
decidable whether a given regular language can be recognized by a game
automaton.

 <dc:description>  We address the issue of applying quantized compressed sensing (CS) on
low-energy telemonitoring. So far, few works studied this problem in
applications where signals were only approximately sparse. We propose a
two-stage data compressor based on quantized CS, where signals are compressed
by compressed sensing and then the compressed measurements are quantized with
only 2 bits per measurement. This compressor can greatly reduce the
transmission bit-budget. To recover signals from underdetermined, quantized
measurements, we develop a Bayesian De-quantization algorithm. It can exploit
both the model of quantization errors and the correlated structure of
physiological signals to improve the quality of recovery. The proposed data
compressor and the recovery algorithm are validated on a dataset recorded on 12
subjects during fast running. Experiment results showed that an averaged 2.596
beat per minute (BPM) estimation error was achieved by jointly using compressed
sensing with 50% compression ratio and a 2-bit quantizer. The results imply
that we can effectively transmit n bits instead of n samples, which is a
substantial improvement for low-energy wireless telemonitoring.

 <dc:description>  Kernel methods represent one of the most powerful tools in machine learning
to tackle problems expressed in terms of function values and derivatives due to
their capability to represent and model complex relations. While these methods
show good versatility, they are computationally intensive and have poor
scalability to large data as they require operations on Gram matrices. In order
to mitigate this serious computational limitation, recently randomized
constructions have been proposed in the literature, which allow the application
of fast linear algorithms. Random Fourier features (RFF) are among the most
popular and widely applied constructions: they provide an easily computable,
low-dimensional feature representation for shift-invariant kernels. Despite the
popularity of RFFs, very little is understood theoretically about their
approximation quality. In this paper, we provide a detailed finite-sample
theoretical analysis about the approximation quality of RFFs by (i)
establishing optimal (in terms of the RFF dimension, and growing set size)
performance guarantees in uniform norm, and (ii) presenting guarantees in $L^r$
($1\le r&lt;\infty$) norms. We also propose an RFF approximation to derivatives of
a kernel with a theoretical study on its approximation quality.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) work well on large datasets. But
labelled data is hard to collect, and in some applications larger amounts of
data are not available. The problem then is how to use CNNs with small data --
as CNNs overfit quickly. We present an efficient Bayesian CNN, offering better
robustness to over-fitting on small data than traditional approaches. This is
by placing a probability distribution over the CNN's kernels. We approximate
our model's intractable posterior with Bernoulli variational distributions,
requiring no additional model parameters.
  On the theoretical side, we cast dropout network training as approximate
inference in Bayesian neural networks. This allows us to implement our model
using existing tools in deep learning with no increase in time complexity,
while highlighting a negative result in the field. We show a considerable
improvement in classification accuracy compared to standard techniques and
improve on published state-of-the-art results for CIFAR-10.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel Riemannian preconditioning approach for the tensor
completion problem with rank constraint. A Riemannian metric or inner product
is proposed that exploits the least-squares structure of the cost function and
takes into account the structured symmetry in Tucker decomposition. The
specific metric allows to use the versatile framework of Riemannian
optimization on quotient manifolds to develop a preconditioned nonlinear
conjugate gradient algorithm for the problem. To this end, concrete matrix
representations of various optimization-related ingredients are listed.
Numerical comparisons suggest that our proposed algorithm robustly outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms across different problem instances encompassing
various synthetic and real-world datasets.

 <dc:description>  We define and study the problem of predicting the solution to a linear
program (LP) given only partial information about its objective and
constraints. This generalizes the problem of learning to predict the purchasing
behavior of a rational agent who has an unknown objective function, that has
been studied under the name &quot;Learning from Revealed Preferences&quot;. We give
mistake bound learning algorithms in two settings: in the first, the objective
of the LP is known to the learner but there is an arbitrary, fixed set of
constraints which are unknown. Each example is defined by an additional known
constraint and the goal of the learner is to predict the optimal solution of
the LP given the union of the known and unknown constraints. This models the
problem of predicting the behavior of a rational agent whose goals are known,
but whose resources are unknown. In the second setting, the objective of the LP
is unknown, and changing in a controlled way. The constraints of the LP may
also change every day, but are known. An example is given by a set of
constraints and partial information about the objective, and the task of the
learner is again to predict the optimal solution of the partially known LP.

 <dc:title>Color Constancy by Learning to Predict Chromaticity from Luminance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chakrabarti, Ayan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Color constancy is the recovery of true surface color from observed color,
and requires estimating the chromaticity of scene illumination to correct for
the bias it induces. In this paper, we show that the per-pixel color statistics
of natural scenes---without any spatial or semantic context---can by themselves
be a powerful cue for color constancy. Specifically, we describe an illuminant
estimation method that is built around a &quot;classifier&quot; for identifying the true
chromaticity of a pixel given its luminance (absolute brightness across color
channels). During inference, each pixel's observed color restricts its true
chromaticity to those values that can be explained by one of a candidate set of
illuminants, and applying the classifier over these values yields a
distribution over the corresponding illuminants. A global estimate for the
scene illuminant is computed through a simple aggregation of these
distributions across all pixels. We begin by simply defining the
luminance-to-chromaticity classifier by computing empirical histograms over
discretized chromaticity and luminance values from a training set of natural
images. These histograms reflect a preference for hues corresponding to smooth
reflectance functions, and for achromatic colors in brighter pixels. Despite
its simplicity, the resulting estimation algorithm outperforms current
state-of-the-art color constancy methods. Next, we propose a method to learn
the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier &quot;end-to-end&quot;. Using stochastic
gradient descent, we set chromaticity-luminance likelihoods to minimize errors
in the final scene illuminant estimates on a training set. This leads to
further improvements in accuracy, most significantly in the tail of the error
distribution.

 <dc:description>  Dysarthria is malfunctioning of motor speech caused by faintness in the human
nervous system. It is characterized by the slurred speech along with physical
impairment which restricts their communication and creates the lack of
confidence and affects the lifestyle. This paper attempt to increase the
efficiency of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for unimpaired speech
signal. It describes state of art of research into improving ASR for speakers
with dysarthria by means of incorporated knowledge of their speech production.
Hybridized approach for feature extraction and acoustic modelling technique
along with evolutionary algorithm is proposed for increasing the efficiency of
the overall system. Here number of feature vectors are varied and tested the
system performance. It is observed that system performance is boosted by
genetic algorithm. System with 16 acoustic features optimized with genetic
algorithm has obtained highest recognition rate of 98.28% with training time of
5:30:17.

 <dc:description>  Hand motion capture is a popular research field, recently gaining more
attention due to the ubiquity of RGB-D sensors. However, even most recent
approaches focus on the case of a single isolated hand. In this work, we focus
on hands that interact with other hands or objects and present a framework that
successfully captures motion in such interaction scenarios for both rigid and
articulated objects. Our framework combines a generative model with
discriminatively trained salient points to achieve a low tracking error and
with collision detection and physics simulation to achieve physically plausible
estimates even in case of occlusions and missing visual data. Since all
components are unified in a single objective function which is almost
everywhere differentiable, it can be optimized with standard optimization
techniques. Our approach works for monocular RGB-D sequences as well as setups
with multiple synchronized RGB cameras. For a qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, we captured 29 sequences with a large variety of interactions and
up to 150 degrees of freedom.

 <dc:description>  Consider estimating an unknown, but structured, signal $x_0\in R^n$ from $m$
measurement $y_i=g_i(a_i^Tx_0)$, where the $a_i$'s are the rows of a known
measurement matrix $A$, and, $g$ is a (potentially unknown) nonlinear and
random link-function. Such measurement functions could arise in applications
where the measurement device has nonlinearities and uncertainties. It could
also arise by design, e.g., $g_i(x)=\text{sign}(x+z_i)$, corresponds to noisy
1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical work of Brillinger,
and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate $x_0$ via solving the
Generalized-LASSO for some regularization parameter $\lambda&gt;0$ and some
(typically non-smooth) convex structure-inducing regularizer function. While
this approach seems to naively ignore the nonlinear function $g$, both
Brillinger (in the non-constrained case) and Plan and Vershynin have shown
that, when the entries of $A$ are iid standard normal, this is a good estimator
of $x_0$ up to a constant of proportionality $\mu$, which only depends on $g$.
In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit
expressions for the squared error, for the \emph{regularized} LASSO, that are
asymptotically \emph{precise} when $m$ and $n$ grow large. A main result is
that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear
measurements is \emph{asymptotically the same} as one whose measurements are
linear $y_i=\mu a_i^Tx_0 + \sigma z_i$, with $\mu = E\gamma g(\gamma)$ and
$\sigma^2 = E(g(\gamma)-\mu\gamma)^2$, and, $\gamma$ standard normal. To the
best of our knowledge, the derived expressions on the estimation performance
are the first-known precise results in this context. One interesting
consequence of our result is that the optimal quantizer of the measurements
that minimizes the estimation error of the LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max
quantizer.

 <dc:description>  With the prevalence of the commodity depth cameras, the new paradigm of user
interfaces based on 3D motion capturing and recognition have dramatically
changed the way of interactions between human and computers. Human action
recognition, as one of the key components in these devices, plays an important
role to guarantee the quality of user experience. Although the model-driven
methods have achieved huge success, they cannot provide a scalable solution for
efficiently storing, retrieving and recognizing actions in the large-scale
applications. These models are also vulnerable to the temporal translation and
warping, as well as the variations in motion scales and execution rates. To
address these challenges, we propose to treat the 3D human action recognition
as a video-level hashing problem and propose a novel First-Take-All (FTA)
Hashing algorithm capable of hashing the entire video into hash codes of fixed
length. We demonstrate that this FTA algorithm produces a compact
representation of the video invariant to the above mentioned variations,
through which action recognition can be solved by an efficient nearest neighbor
search by the Hamming distance between the FTA hash codes. Experiments on the
public 3D human action datasets shows that the FTA algorithm can reach a
recognition accuracy higher than 80%, with about 15 bits per frame considering
there are 65 frames per video over the datasets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the problem of decision making within a Markov
decision process (MDP) framework where risk and modeling errors are taken into
account. Our approach is to minimize a risk-sensitive conditional-value-at-risk
(CVaR) objective, as opposed to a standard risk-neutral expectation. We refer
to such problem as CVaR MDP. Our first contribution is to show that a CVaR
objective, besides capturing risk sensitivity, has an alternative
interpretation as expected cost under worst-case modeling errors, for a given
error budget. This result, which is of independent interest, motivates CVaR
MDPs as a unifying framework for risk-sensitive and robust decision making. Our
second contribution is to present an approximate value-iteration algorithm for
CVaR MDPs and analyze its convergence rate. To our knowledge, this is the first
solution algorithm for CVaR MDPs that enjoys error guarantees. Finally, we
present results from numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical
findings and show the practicality of our approach.

 <dc:title>Thresholding for Top-k Recommendation with Temporal Dynamics</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work focuses on top-k recommendation in domains where underlying data
distribution shifts overtime. We propose to learn a time-dependent bias for
each item over whatever existing recommendation engine. Such a bias learning
process alleviates data sparsity in constructing the engine, and at the same
time captures recent trend shift observed in data. We present an alternating
optimization framework to resolve the bias learning problem, and develop
methods to handle a variety of commonly used recommendation evaluation
criteria, as well as large number of items and users in practice. The proposed
algorithm is examined, both offline and online, using real world data sets
collected from the largest retailer worldwide. Empirical results demonstrate
that the bias learning can almost always boost recommendation performance. We
encourage other practitioners to adopt it as a standard component in
recommender systems where temporal dynamics is a norm.

 <dc:description>  A human computation system can be viewed as a distributed system in which the
processors are humans, called workers. Such systems harness the cognitive power
of a group of workers connected to the Internet to execute relatively simple
tasks, whose solutions, once grouped, solve a problem that systems equipped
with only machines could not solve satisfactorily. Examples of such systems are
Amazon Mechanical Turk and the Zooniverse platform. A human computation
application comprises a group of tasks, each of them can be performed by one
worker. Tasks might have dependencies among each other. In this study, we
propose a theoretical framework to analyze such type of application from a
distributed systems point of view. Our framework is established on three
dimensions that represent different perspectives in which human computation
applications can be approached: quality-of-service requirements, design and
management strategies, and human aspects. By using this framework, we review
human computation in the perspective of programmers seeking to improve the
design of human computation applications and managers seeking to increase the
effectiveness of human computation infrastructures in running such
applications. In doing so, besides integrating and organizing what has been
done in this direction, we also put into perspective the fact that the human
aspects of the workers in such systems introduce new challenges in terms of,
for example, task assignment, dependency management, and fault prevention and
tolerance. We discuss how they are related to distributed systems and other
areas of knowledge.

 <dc:title>Describing Common Human Visual Actions in Images</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Which common human actions and interactions are recognizable in monocular
still images? Which involve objects and/or other people? How many is a person
performing at a time? We address these questions by exploring the actions and
interactions that are detectable in the images of the MS COCO dataset. We make
two main contributions. First, a list of 140 common `visual actions', obtained
by analyzing the largest on-line verb lexicon currently available for English
(VerbNet) and human sentences used to describe images in MS COCO. Second, a
complete set of annotations for those `visual actions', composed of
subject-object and associated verb, which we call COCO-a (a for `actions').
COCO-a is larger than existing action datasets in terms of number of actions
and instances of these actions, and is unique because it is data-driven, rather
than experimenter-biased. Other unique features are that it is exhaustive, and
that all subjects and objects are localized. A statistical analysis of the
accuracy of our annotations and of each action, interaction and subject-object
combination is provided.

 <dc:description>  Text image super-resolution is a challenging yet open research problem in the
computer vision community. In particular, low-resolution images hamper the
performance of typical optical character recognition (OCR) systems. In this
article, we summarize our entry to the ICDAR2015 Competition on Text Image
Super-Resolution. Experiments are based on the provided ICDAR2015 TextSR
dataset and the released Tesseract-OCR 3.02 system. We report that our winning
entry of text image super-resolution framework has largely improved the OCR
performance with low-resolution images used as input, reaching an OCR accuracy
score of 77.19%, which is comparable with that of using the original
high-resolution images 78.80%.

 <dc:title>Nonlinear compressed sensing based on composite mappings and its

 <dc:creator>Yi, Jiawang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tan, Guanzheng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Classical compressed sensing (CS) allows us to recover structured signals
from far few linear measurements than traditionally prescribed, thereby
efficiently decreasing sampling rates. However, if there exist nonlinearities
in the measurements, is it still possible to recover sparse or structured
signals from the nonlinear measurements? The research of nonlinear CS is
devoted to answering this question. In this paper, unlike the existing research
angles of nonlinear CS, we study it from the perspective of mapping
decomposition, and propose a new concept, namely, nonlinear CS based on
composite mappings. Through the analysis of two forms of a nonlinear composite
mapping Phi, i.e., Phi(x) = F(Ax) and Phi(x) = AF(x), we give the requirements
respectively for the sensing matrix A and the nonlinear mapping F when
reconstructing all sparse signals exactly from the nonlinear measurements
Phi(x). Besides, we also provide a special pointwise linearization method,
which can turn the nonlinear composite mapping Phi, at each point in its
domain, into an equivalent linear composite mapping. This linearization method
can guarantee the exact recovery of all given sparse signals even if Phi is not
an injection for all sparse signals. It may help us build an algorithm
framework for the composite nonlinear CS in which we can take full advantage of
the existing recovery algorithms belonging to linear CS.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we explore the inclusion of latent random variables into the
dynamic hidden state of a recurrent neural network (RNN) by combining elements
of the variational autoencoder. We argue that through the use of high-level
latent random variables, the variational RNN (VRNN)1 can model the kind of
variability observed in highly structured sequential data such as natural
speech. We empirically evaluate the proposed model against related sequential
models on four speech datasets and one handwriting dataset. Our results show
the important roles that latent random variables can play in the RNN dynamic
hidden state.

 <dc:description>  VANETs are considered as networks of critical future importance, with the
main concern being the safety of travelers and infrastructure. A lot of methods
for coordination and channel allocation in the context of VANETs are being
introduced. As such, the need of a framework to reliably compare the relative
performances of different channel sensing, allocation and coordination schemes
which takes into account the movement of vehicles is felt. In this paper, we
introduce a framework that can be used to define and compare such schemes in a
variety of scenarios. Simulation results clearly show the robustness of our
technique by eliminating the misdetections and reducing to a great extent the
false alarms.

 <dc:description>  Ordinary least squares (OLS) is the default method for fitting linear models,
but is not applicable for problems with dimensionality larger than the sample
size. For these problems, we advocate the use of a generalized version of OLS
motivated by ridge regression, and propose two novel three-step algorithms
involving least squares fitting and hard thresholding. The algorithms are
methodologically simple to understand intuitively, computationally easy to
implement efficiently, and theoretically appealing for choosing models
consistently. Numerical exercises comparing our methods with penalization-based
approaches in simulations and data analyses illustrate the great potential of
the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:description>  DBSCAN is a very classic algorithm for data clus- tering, which is widely
used in many fields. However, with the data scale growing much more bigger than
before, the traditional serial algorithm can not meet the performance
requirement. Recently, parallel computing based on CUDA has developed very fast
and has great advantage on big data. This paper summarizes the algorithms
proposed before and improves the performance of the old DBSCAN algorithm by
using CUDA and parallel computing. The algorithm uses shared memory as much as
possible compared with other algorithms and it has very good scalability. A
data set is tested on the new version of DBSCAN. Finally, we analyze the
results and give a conclusion that our algorithm is approximately 97 times
faster than the serial version.

 <dc:description>  In this work we develop a new algorithm for regularized empirical risk
minimization. Our method extends recent techniques of Shalev-Shwartz [02/2015],
which enable a dual-free analysis of SDCA, to arbitrary mini-batching schemes.
Moreover, our method is able to better utilize the information in the data
defining the ERM problem. For convex loss functions, our complexity results
match those of QUARTZ, which is a primal-dual method also allowing for
arbitrary mini-batching schemes. The advantage of a dual-free analysis comes
from the fact that it guarantees convergence even for non-convex loss
functions, as long as the average loss is convex. We illustrate through
experiments the utility of being able to design arbitrary mini-batching
schemes.

 <dc:title>Strong converse exponents for the feedback-assisted classical capacity

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quantum entanglement can be used in a communication scheme to establish a
correlation between successive channel inputs that is impossible by classical
means. It is known that the classical capacity of quantum channels can be
enhanced by such entangled encoding schemes, but this is not always the case.
In this paper, we prove that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical
capacity of an entanglement-breaking channel even when it is assisted by a
classical feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. In doing so, we
identify a bound on the strong converse exponent, which determines the
exponentially decaying rate at which the success probability tends to zero, for
a sequence of codes with communication rate exceeding capacity. Proving a
strong converse, along with an achievability theorem, shows that the classical
capacity is a sharp boundary between reliable and unreliable communication
regimes. One of the main tools in our proof is the sandwiched Renyi relative
entropy. The same method of proof is used to derive an exponential bound on the
success probability when communicating over an arbitrary quantum channel
assisted by classical feedback, provided that the transmitter does not use
entangled encoding schemes.

 <dc:title>On approximating tree spanners that are breadth first search trees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Papoutsakis, Ioannis</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A tree $t$-spanner $T$ of a graph $G$ is a spanning tree of $G$ such that the
distance in $T$ between every pair of verices is at most $t$ times the distance
in $G$ between them. There are efficient algorithms that find a tree $t\cdot
O(\log n)$-spanner of a graph $G$, when $G$ admits a tree $t$-spanner. In this
paper, the search space is narrowed to $v$-concentrated spanning trees, a
simple family that includes all the breadth first search trees starting from
vertex $v$. In this case, it is not easy to find approximate tree spanners
within factor almost $o(\log n)$. Specifically, let $m$ and $t$ be integers,
such that $m&gt;0$ and $t\geq 7$. If there is an efficient algorithm that receives
as input a graph $G$ and a vertex $v$ and returns a $v$-concentrated tree
$t\cdot o((\log n)^{m/(m+1)})$-spanner of $G$, when $G$ admits a
$v$-concentrated tree $t$-spanner, then there is an algorithm that decides
3-SAT in quasi-polynomial time.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an abstract model of visualization and inference
processes and describe an information-theoretic measure for optimizing such
processes. In order to obtain such an abstraction, we first examined six
classes of workflows in data analysis and visualization, and identified four
levels of typical visualization components, namely disseminative,
observational, analytical and model-developmental visualization. We noticed a
common phenomenon at different levels of visualization, that is, the
transformation of data spaces (referred to as alphabets) usually corresponds to
the reduction of maximal entropy along a workflow. Based on this observation,
we establish an information-theoretic measure of cost-benefit ratio that may be
used as a cost function for optimizing a data visualization process. To
demonstrate the validity of this measure, we examined a number of successful
visualization processes in the literature, and showed that the
information-theoretic measure can mathematically explain the advantages of such
processes over possible alternatives.

 <dc:description>  Pre-training is crucial for learning deep neural networks. Most of existing
pre-training methods train simple models (e.g., restricted Boltzmann machines)
and then stack them layer by layer to form the deep structure. This layer-wise
pre-training has found strong theoretical foundation and broad empirical
support. However, it is not easy to employ such method to pre-train models
without a clear multi-layer structure,e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
This paper presents a new pre-training approach based on knowledge transfer
learning. In contrast to the layer-wise approach which trains model components
incrementally, the new approach trains the entire model as a whole but with an
easier objective function. This is achieved by utilizing soft targets produced
by a prior trained model (teacher model). Compared to the conventional
layer-wise methods, this new method does not care about the model structure, so
can be used to pre-train very complex models. Experiments on a speech
recognition task demonstrated that with this approach, complex RNNs can be well
trained with a weaker deep neural network (DNN) model. Furthermore, the new
method can be combined with conventional layer-wise pre-training to deliver
additional gains.

 <dc:description>  A simple Neural Network model is presented for end-to-end visual learning of
arithmetic operations from pictures of numbers. The input consists of two
pictures, each showing a 7-digit number. The output, also a picture, displays
the number showing the result of an arithmetic operation (e.g., addition or
subtraction) on the two input numbers. The concepts of a number, or of an
operator, are not explicitly introduced. This indicates that addition is a
simple cognitive task, which can be learned visually using a very small number
of neurons.
  Other operations, e.g., multiplication, were not learnable using this
architecture. Some tasks were not learnable end-to-end (e.g., addition with
Roman numerals), but were easily learnable once broken into two separate
sub-tasks: a perceptual \textit{Character Recognition} and cognitive
\textit{Arithmetic} sub-tasks. This indicates that while some tasks may be
easily learnable end-to-end, other may need to be broken into sub-tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on how to locate the relevant or discriminative brain
regions related with external stimulus or certain mental decease, which is also
called support identification, based on the neuroimaging data. The main
difficulty lies in the extremely high dimensional voxel space and relatively
few training samples, easily resulting in an unstable brain region discovery
(or called feature selection in context of pattern recognition). When the
training samples are from different centers and have betweencenter variations,
it will be even harder to obtain a reliable and consistent result.
Corresponding, we revisit our recently proposed algorithm based on stability
selection and structural sparsity. It is applied to the multi-center MRI data
analysis for the first time. A consistent and stable result is achieved across
different centers despite the between-center data variation while many other
state-of-the-art methods such as two sample t-test fail. Moreover, we have
empirically showed that the performance of this algorithm is robust and
insensitive to several of its key parameters. In addition, the support
identification results on both functional MRI and structural MRI are
interpretable and can be the potential biomarkers.

 <dc:description>  There is a growing demand for cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Box,
Syncplicity and SugarSync. These public cloud storage services can store
gigabytes of corporate and personal data in remote data centres around the
world, which can then be synchronized to multiple devices. This creates an
environment which is potentially conducive to security incidents, data breaches
and other malicious activities. The forensic investigation of public cloud
environments presents a number of new challenges for the digital forensics
community. However, it is anticipated that end-devices such as smartphones,
will retain data from these cloud storage services. This research investigates
how forensic tools that are currently available to practitioners can be used to
provide a practical solution for the problems related to investigating cloud
storage environments. The research contribution is threefold. First, the
findings from this research support the idea that end-devices which have been
used to access cloud storage services can be used to provide a partial view of
the evidence stored in the cloud service. Second, the research provides a
comparison of the number of files which can be recovered from different
versions of cloud storage applications. In doing so, it also supports the idea
that amalgamating the files recovered from more than one device can result in
the recovery of a more complete dataset. Third, the chapter contributes to the
documentation and evidentiary discussion of the artefacts created from specific
cloud storage applications and different versions of these applications on iOS
and Android smartphones.

 <dc:description>  Higher-dimensional automata constitute a very expressive model for concurrent
systems. In this paper, we discuss &quot;topological abstraction&quot; of
higher-dimensional automata, i.e., the replacement of HDAs by smaller ones that
can be considered equivalent from both a computer scientific and a topological
point of view. By definition, topological abstraction preserves the homotopy
type, the trace category, and the homology graph of an HDA. We establish
conditions under which cube collapses yield topological abstractions of HDAs.

 <dc:title>Confounds and Consequences in Geotagged Twitter Data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Twitter is often used in quantitative studies that identify
geographically-preferred topics, writing styles, and entities. These studies
rely on either GPS coordinates attached to individual messages, or on the
user-supplied location field in each profile. In this paper, we compare these
data acquisition techniques and quantify the biases that they introduce; we
also measure their effects on linguistic analysis and text-based geolocation.
GPS-tagging and self-reported locations yield measurably different corpora, and
these linguistic differences are partially attributable to differences in
dataset composition by age and gender. Using a latent variable model to induce
age and gender, we show how these demographic variables interact with geography
to affect language use. We also show that the accuracy of text-based
geolocation varies with population demographics, giving the best results for
men above the age of 40.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the problem of spectrum access decision-making
for the Secondary Users (SUs) in the cognitive radio networks. When the Primary
Users (PUs) are absent on certain frequency bandwidth, SUs can formulate a
queue and wait for the Base Station (BS) to serve. The queue of the SUs will be
dismissed if the PU is emerging in the system. Leveraging the queueing game
approaches, the decision-making process of the SUs that whether to queue or not
is studied. Both individual equilibrium and social optimization strategies are
derived analytically. Moreover, the optimal pricing strategy of the service
provider is investigated as well. Our proposed algorithms and corresponding
analysis are validated through simulation studies.

 <dc:description>  We present a family of gossiping algorithms whose members share the same
structure though they vary their performance in function of a combinatorial
parameter. We show that such parameter may be considered as a &quot;knob&quot;
controlling the amount of communication parallelism characterizing the
algorithms. After this we introduce procedures to operate the knob and choose
parameters matching the amount of communication channels currently provided by
the available communication system(s). In so doing we provide a robust
mechanism to tune the production of requests for communication after the
current operational conditions of the consumers of such requests. This can be
used to achieve high performance and programmatic avoidance of undesirable
events such as message collisions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Matching the profiles of a user across multiple online social networks brings
opportunities for new services and applications as well as new insights on user
online behavior, yet it raises serious privacy concerns. Prior literature has
proposed methods to match profiles and showed that it is possible to do it
accurately, but using evaluations that focused on sampled datasets only. In
this paper, we study the extent to which we can reliably match profiles in
practice, across real-world social networks, by exploiting public attributes,
i.e., information users publicly provide about themselves. Today's social
networks have hundreds of millions of users, which brings completely new
challenges as a reliable matching scheme must identify the correct matching
profile out of the millions of possible profiles. We first define a set of
properties for profile attributes--Availability, Consistency,
non-Impersonability, and Discriminability (ACID)--that are both necessary and
sufficient to determine the reliability of a matching scheme. Using these
properties, we propose a method to evaluate the accuracy of matching schemes in
real practical cases. Our results show that the accuracy in practice is
significantly lower than the one reported in prior literature. When considering
entire social networks, there is a non-negligible number of profiles that
belong to different users but have similar attributes, which leads to many
false matches. Our paper sheds light on the limits of matching profiles in the
real world and illustrates the correct methodology to evaluate matching schemes
in realistic scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Mobile devices store a diverse set of private user data and have gradually
become a hub to control users' other personal Internet-of-Things devices.
Access control on mobile devices is therefore highly important. The widely
accepted solution is to protect access by asking for a password. However,
password authentication is tedious, e.g., a user needs to input a password
every time she wants to use the device. Moreover, existing biometrics such as
face, fingerprint, and touch behaviors are vulnerable to forgery attacks.
  We propose a new touch-based biometric authentication system that is passive
and secure against forgery attacks. In our touch-based authentication, a user's
touch behaviors are a function of some random &quot;secret&quot;. The user can
subconsciously know the secret while touching the device's screen. However, an
attacker cannot know the secret at the time of attack, which makes it
challenging to perform forgery attacks even if the attacker has already
obtained the user's touch behaviors. We evaluate our touch-based authentication
system by collecting data from 25 subjects. Results are promising: the random
secrets do not influence user experience and, for targeted forgery attacks, our
system achieves 0.18 smaller Equal Error Rates (EERs) than previous touch-based
authentication.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a corpus of 7,032 sentences rated by human annotators for
formality, informativeness, and implicature on a 1-7 scale. The corpus was
annotated using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Reliability in the obtained judgments
was examined by comparing mean ratings across two MTurk experiments, and
correlation with pilot annotations (on sentence formality) conducted in a more
controlled setting. Despite the subjectivity and inherent difficulty of the
annotation task, correlations between mean ratings were quite encouraging,
especially on formality and informativeness. We further explored correlation
between the three linguistic variables, genre-wise variation of ratings and
correlations within genres, compatibility with automatic stylistic scoring, and
sentential make-up of a document in terms of style. To date, our corpus is the
largest sentence-level annotated corpus released for formality,
informativeness, and implicature.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents StegBlocks, which defines a new concept for performing
undetectable hidden communication. StegBlocks is a general approach for
constructing methods of network steganography. In StegBlocks, one has to
determine objects with defined properties which will be used to transfer hidden
messages. The objects are dependent on a specific network protocol (or
application) used as a carrier for a given network steganography method.
Moreover, the paper presents the approach to perfect undetectability of network
steganography, which was developed based on the rules of undetectability for
general steganography. The approach to undetectability of network steganography
was used to show the possibility of developing perfectly undetectable network
steganography methods using the StegBlocks concept.

 <dc:description>  Behavior Trees are commonly used to model agents for robotics and games,
where constrained behaviors must be designed by human experts in order to
guarantee that these agents will execute a specific chain of actions given a
specific set of perceptions. In such application areas, learning is a desirable
feature to provide agents with the ability to adapt and improve interactions
with humans and environment, but often discarded due to its unreliability. In
this paper, we propose a framework that uses Reinforcement Learning nodes as
part of Behavior Trees to address the problem of adding learning capabilities
in constrained agents. We show how this framework relates to Options in
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, ensuring convergence of nested learning
nodes, and we empirically show that the learning nodes do not affect the
execution of other nodes in the tree.

 <dc:description>  This paper summarizes the work done by the authors for the Zero Resource
Speech Challenge organized in the technical program of Interspeech 2015. The
goal of the challenge is to discover linguistic units directly from unlabeled
speech data. The Multi-layered Acoustic Tokenizer (MAT) proposed in this work
automatically discovers multiple sets of acoustic tokens from the given corpus.
Each acoustic token set is specified by a set of hyperparameters that describe
the model configuration. These sets of acoustic tokens carry different
characteristics of the given corpus and the language behind thus can be
mutually reinforced. The multiple sets of token labels are then used as the
targets of a Multi-target DNN (MDNN) trained on low-level acoustic features.
Bottleneck features extracted from the MDNN are used as feedback for the MAT
and the MDNN itself. We call this iterative system the Multi-layered Acoustic
Tokenizing Deep Neural Network (MAT-DNN) which generates high quality features
for track 1 of the challenge and acoustic tokens for track 2 of the challenge.

 <dc:description>  Event-specific concepts are the semantic concepts designed for the events of
interest, which can be used as a mid-level representation of complex events in
videos. Existing methods only focus on defining event-specific concepts for a
small number of predefined events, but cannot handle novel unseen events. This
motivates us to build a large scale event-specific concept library that covers
as many real-world events and their concepts as possible. Specifically, we
choose WikiHow, an online forum containing a large number of how-to articles on
human daily life events. We perform a coarse-to-fine event discovery process
and discover 500 events from WikiHow articles. Then we use each event name as
query to search YouTube and discover event-specific concepts from the tags of
returned videos. After an automatic filter process, we end up with 95,321
videos and 4,490 concepts. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
on the 95,321 videos over the 500 events, and use the model to extract deep
learning feature from video content. With the learned deep learning feature, we
train 4,490 binary SVM classifiers as the event-specific concept library. The
concepts and events are further organized in a hierarchical structure defined
by WikiHow, and the resultant concept library is called EventNet. Finally, the
EventNet concept library is used to generate concept based representation of
event videos. To the best of our knowledge, EventNet represents the first video
event ontology that organizes events and their concepts into a semantic
structure. It offers great potential for event retrieval and browsing.
Extensive experiments over the zero-shot event retrieval task when no training
samples are available show that the EventNet concept library consistently and
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (such as the 20K ImageNet
concepts trained with CNN) by a large margin up to 207%.

 <dc:description>  Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems commonly leverage bag-of-words
co-occurrence techniques to capture semantic and syntactic word relationships.
The resulting word-level distributed representations often ignore morphological
information, though character-level embeddings have proven valuable to NLP
tasks. We propose a new neural language model incorporating both word order and
character order in its embedding. The model produces several vector spaces with
meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 85.8% on a recent
word-analogy task, exceeding best published syntactic word-analogy scores by a
58% error margin. Furthermore, the model includes several parallel training
methods, most notably allowing a skip-gram network with 160 billion parameters
to be trained overnight on 3 multi-core CPUs, 14x larger than the previous
largest neural network.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a variant of (sparse) PCA in which the set of feasible support
sets is determined by a graph. In particular, we consider the following
setting: given a directed acyclic graph $G$ on $p$ vertices corresponding to
variables, the non-zero entries of the extracted principal component must
coincide with vertices lying along a path in $G$.
  From a statistical perspective, information on the underlying network may
potentially reduce the number of observations required to recover the
population principal component. We consider the canonical estimator which
optimally exploits the prior knowledge by solving a non-convex quadratic
maximization on the empirical covariance. We introduce a simple network and
analyze the estimator under the spiked covariance model. We show that side
information potentially improves the statistical complexity.
  We propose two algorithms to approximate the solution of the constrained
quadratic maximization, and recover a component with the desired properties. We
empirically evaluate our schemes on synthetic and real datasets.

 <dc:title>Wavelets and continuous wavelet transform for autostereoscopic multiview
  images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Saveljev, Vladimir</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, the reference functions for the synthesis and analysis of the
autostereoscopic multiview and integral images in three-dimensional displays we
introduced. In the current paper, we propose the wavelets to analyze such
images. The wavelets are built on the reference functions as on the scaling
functions of the wavelet analysis. The continuous wavelet transform was
successfully applied to the testing wireframe binary objects. The restored
locations correspond to the structure of the testing wireframe binary objects.

 <dc:description>  An active learner is given a class of models, a large set of unlabeled
examples, and the ability to interactively query labels of a subset of these
examples; the goal of the learner is to learn a model in the class that fits
the data well.
  Previous theoretical work has rigorously characterized label complexity of
active learning, but most of this work has focused on the PAC or the agnostic
PAC model. In this paper, we shift our attention to a more general setting --
maximum likelihood estimation. Provided certain conditions hold on the model
class, we provide a two-stage active learning algorithm for this problem. The
conditions we require are fairly general, and cover the widely popular class of
Generalized Linear Models, which in turn, include models for binary and
multi-class classification, regression, and conditional random fields.
  We provide an upper bound on the label requirement of our algorithm, and a
lower bound that matches it up to lower order terms. Our analysis shows that
unlike binary classification in the realizable case, just a single extra round
of interaction is sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance in maximum
likelihood estimation. On the empirical side, the recent work in
~\cite{Zhang12} and~\cite{Zhang14} (on active linear and logistic regression)
shows the promise of this approach.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel architecture, the &quot;stacked what-where auto-encoders&quot;
(SWWAE), which integrates discriminative and generative pathways and provides a
unified approach to supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning
without relying on sampling during training. An instantiation of SWWAE uses a
convolutional net (Convnet) (LeCun et al. (1998)) to encode the input, and
employs a deconvolutional net (Deconvnet) (Zeiler et al. (2010)) to produce the
reconstruction. The objective function includes reconstruction terms that
induce the hidden states in the Deconvnet to be similar to those of the
Convnet. Each pooling layer produces two sets of variables: the &quot;what&quot; which
are fed to the next layer, and its complementary variable &quot;where&quot; that are fed
to the corresponding layer in the generative decoder.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates on the problem of combining routing scheme and
physical layer security in multihop wireless networks with cooperative
diversity. We propose an ad-hoc natured hop-by-hop best secure relay selection
in a multihop network with several relays and an eavesdropper at each hop which
provides a safe routing scheme to transmit confidential message from
transmitter to legitimate receiver. The selection is based on the instantaneous
channel conditions of relay and eavesdropper at each hop. A theoretical
analysis is performed to derive new closed form expressions for probability of
non-zero secrecy capacity along with the exact end to end secrecy outage
probability at a normalized secrecy rate. Furthermore, we provide the
asymptotic expression to gain insights on the diversity gain.

partial differential equation models. The main aim of the present article is to
build a bridge between several point processes models (Poisson, Wold, Hawkes)
that have been proved to statistically fit real spike trains data and
age-structured partial differential equations as introduced by Pakdaman,

sizes, where the size is this of lambda terms with de Bruijn indices in a very
natural model where all the operators have size 1. For plain lambda terms, the
sequence corresponds to two families of binary trees for which we exhibit
bijections. We study also the distribution of normal forms, head normal forms
and strongly normalizing terms. In particular we show that strongly normalizing
terms are of density 0 among plain terms.

 <dc:description>  Synthesis is a particularly challenging problem for concurrent programs. At
the same time it is a very promising approach, since concurrent programs are
difficult to get right, or to analyze with traditional verification techniques.
This paper gives an introduction to distributed synthesis in the setting of
Mazurkiewicz traces, and its applications to decentralized runtime monitoring.
1 Context Modern computing systems are increasingly distributed and
heterogeneous. Software needs to be able to exploit these advances, providing
means for applications to be more performant. Traditional concurrent
programming paradigms, as in Java, are based on threads, shared-memory, and
locking mechanisms that guard access to common data. More recent paradigms like
the reactive programming model of Erlang [4] and Scala [35,36] replace shared
memory by asynchronous message passing, where sending a message is
non-blocking. In all these concurrent frameworks, writing reliable software is
a serious challenge. Programmers tend to think about code mostly in a
sequential way, and it is hard to grasp all possible schedulings of events in a
concurrent execution. For similar reasons, verification and analysis of
concurrent programs is a difficult task. Testing, which is still the main
method for error detection in software, has low coverage for concurrent
programs. The reason is that bugs in such programs are difficult to reproduce:
they may happen under very specific thread schedules and the likelihood of
taking such corner-case schedules is very low. Automated verification, such as
model-checking and other traditional exploration techniques, can handle very
limited instances of concurrent programs, mostly because of the very large
number of possible states and of possible interleavings of executions. Formal
analysis of programs requires as a prerequisite a clean mathematical model for
programs. Verification of sequential programs starts usually with an
abstraction step -- reducing the value domains of variables to finite domains,
viewing conditional branching as non-determinism, etc. Another major
simplification consists in disallowing recursion. This leads to a very robust
computational model, namely finite-state automata and regular languages.
Regular languages of words (and trees) are particularly well understood
notions. The deep connections between logic and automata revealed by the
foundational work of B\&quot;uchi, Rabin, and others, are the main ingredients in
automata-based verification .

 <dc:title>Reverse Ranking by Graph Structure: Model and Scalable Algorithms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Distances in a network capture relations between nodes and are the basis of
centrality, similarity, and influence measures. Often, however, the relevance
of a node $u$ to a node $v$ is more precisely measured not by the magnitude of
the distance, but by the number of nodes that are closer to $v$ than $u$. That
is, by the {\em rank} of $u$ in an ordering of nodes by increasing distance
from $v$.
  We identify and address fundamental challenges in rank-based graph mining. We
first consider single-source computation of reverse-ranks and design a
&quot;Dijkstra-like&quot; algorithm which computes nodes in order of increasing
approximate reverse rank while only traversing edges adjacent to returned
nodes. We then define {\em reverse-rank influence}, which naturally extends
reverse nearest neighbors influence [Korn and Muthukrishnan 2000] and builds on
a well studied distance-based influence. We present near-linear algorithms for
greedy approximate reverse-rank influence maximization. The design relies on
our single-source algorithm. Our algorithms utilize near-linear preprocessing
of the network to compute all-distance sketches. As a contribution of
independent interest, we present a novel algorithm for computing these
sketches, which have many other applications, on multi-core architectures.
  We complement our algorithms by establishing the hardness of computing {\em
exact} reverse-ranks for a single source and {\em exact} reverse-rank
influence. This implies that when using near-linear algorithms, the small
relative errors we obtain are the best we can currently hope for.
  Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation on graphs with tens of
millions of edges, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Finding a fixed point to a nonexpansive operator, i.e., $x^*=Tx^*$, abstracts
many problems in numerical linear algebra, optimization, and other areas of
scientific computing. To solve fixed-point problems, we propose ARock, an
algorithmic framework in which multiple agents (machines, processors, or cores)
update $x$ in an asynchronous parallel fashion. Asynchrony is crucial to
parallel computing since it reduces synchronization wait, relaxes communication
bottleneck, and thus speeds up computing significantly. At each step of ARock,
an agent updates a randomly selected coordinate $x_i$ based on possibly
out-of-date information on $x$. The agents share $x$ through either global
memory or communication. If writing $x_i$ is atomic, the agents can read and
write $x$ without memory locks.
  Theoretically, we show that if the nonexpansive operator $T$ has a fixed
point, then with probability one, ARock generates a sequence that converges to
a fixed points of $T$. Our conditions on $T$ and step sizes are weaker than
comparable work. Linear convergence is also obtained.
  We propose special cases of ARock for linear systems, convex optimization,
machine learning, as well as distributed and decentralized consensus problems.
Numerical experiments of solving sparse logistic regression problems are
presented.

 <dc:description>  Accurate color reproduction is important in many applications of 3D printing,
from design prototypes to 3D color copies or portraits. Although full color is
available via other technologies, multi-jet printers have greater potential for
graphical 3D printing, in terms of reproducing complex appearance properties.
However, to date these printers cannot produce full color, and doing so poses
substantial technical challenges, from the shear amount of data to the
translucency of the available color materials. In this paper, we propose an
error diffusion halftoning approach to achieve full color with multi-jet
printers, which operates on multiple isosurfaces or layers within the object.
We propose a novel traversal algorithm for voxel surfaces, which allows the
transfer of existing error diffusion algorithms from 2D printing. The resulting
prints faithfully reproduce colors, color gradients and fine-scale details.

 <dc:title>On the Feasibility of Wireless Energy Transfer Using Massive Antenna

 <dc:description>  We illustrate potential benefits of using massive antenna arrays for wireless
energy transfer (WET). Specifically, we analyze probability of outage in WET
over fading channels when a base station (BS) with multiple antennas beamforms
energy to a wireless sensor node (WSN). Our analytical results show that by
using massive antenna arrays, the range of WET can be increased for a given
target outage probability. We prove that by using multiple-antenna arrays at
the BS, a lower downlink energy is required to get the same outage performance,
resulting into savings of radiated energy. We show that for energy levels used
in WET, the outage performance with least-squares or minimum mean-square error
channel estimates is same as that obtained based on perfect channel estimates.
We observe that a strong line-of-sight component between the BS and WSN lowers
outage probability. Furthermore, by deploying more antennas at the BS, a larger
energy can be transferred reliably to the WSN at a given target outage
performance for the sensor to be able to perform its main tasks. In our
numerical examples, the RF power received at the input of the sensor is assumed
to be on the order of a mW, such that the rectenna operates at an efficiency in
the order of 50 %.

 <dc:description>  There are several efficient methods to solve linear interval polynomial
systems in the context of interval computations, however, the general case of
interval polynomial systems is not yet covered as well. In this paper we
introduce a new elimination method to solve and analyse interval polynomial
systems, in general case. This method is based on computational algebraic
geometry concepts such as polynomial ideals and Groebner basis computation.
Specially, we use the comprehensive Groebner system concept to keep the
dependencies between interval coefficients. At the end of paper, we will state
some applications of our method to evaluate its performance.

 <dc:description>  With the process of evolution, some genes will change their relative
positions in gene sequence. These &quot;jumping genes&quot; are called transposons.
Through some intuitive rules, we give a criterion to determine transposons
among gene sequences of different individuals of the same species. Then we turn
this problem into graph theory and give algorithms for different situations
with acceptable time complexities. One of these algorithms has been reported
briefly as the &quot;iteration algorithm&quot; in Kang et al.'s paper (in this paper,
transposon is called &quot;core-gene-defined genome organizational framework&quot;,
cGOF). This paper provides the omitted details and discussions on general
cases.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of Robust Least Squares Regression (RLSR) where several
response variables can be adversarially corrupted. More specifically, for a
data matrix X \in R^{p x n} and an underlying model w*, the response vector is
generated as y = X'w* + b where b \in R^n is the corruption vector supported
over at most C.n coordinates. Existing exact recovery results for RLSR focus
solely on L1-penalty based convex formulations and impose relatively strict
model assumptions such as requiring the corruptions b to be selected
independently of X.
  In this work, we study a simple hard-thresholding algorithm called TORRENT
which, under mild conditions on X, can recover w* exactly even if b corrupts
the response variables in an adversarial manner, i.e. both the support and
entries of b are selected adversarially after observing X and w*. Our results
hold under deterministic assumptions which are satisfied if X is sampled from
any sub-Gaussian distribution. Finally unlike existing results that apply only
to a fixed w*, generated independently of X, our results are universal and hold
for any w* \in R^p.
  Next, we propose gradient descent-based extensions of TORRENT that can scale
efficiently to large scale problems, such as high dimensional sparse recovery
and prove similar recovery guarantees for these extensions. Empirically we find
TORRENT, and more so its extensions, offering significantly faster recovery
than the state-of-the-art L1 solvers. For instance, even on moderate-sized
datasets (with p = 50K) with around 40% corrupted responses, a variant of our
proposed method called TORRENT-HYB is more than 20x faster than the best L1
solver.

 <dc:description>  Social media are increasingly reflecting and influencing behavior of other
complex systems. In this paper we investigate the relations between a well-know
micro-blogging platform Twitter and financial markets. In particular, we
consider, in a period of 15 months, the Twitter volume and sentiment about the
30 stock companies that form the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. We
find a relatively low Pearson correlation and Granger causality between the
corresponding time series over the entire time period. However, we find a
significant dependence between the Twitter sentiment and abnormal returns
during the peaks of Twitter volume. This is valid not only for the expected
Twitter volume peaks (e.g., quarterly announcements), but also for peaks
corresponding to less obvious events. We formalize the procedure by adapting
the well-known &quot;event study&quot; from economics and finance to the analysis of
Twitter data. The procedure allows to automatically identify events as Twitter
volume peaks, to compute the prevailing sentiment (positive or negative)
expressed in tweets at these peaks, and finally to apply the &quot;event study&quot;
methodology to relate them to stock returns. We show that sentiment polarity of
Twitter peaks implies the direction of cumulative abnormal returns. The amount
of cumulative abnormal returns is relatively low (about 1-2%), but the
dependence is statistically significant for several days after the events.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this position paper, we consider the state of computer vision research
with respect to invariance to the horizontal orientation of an image -- what we
term reflection invariance. We describe why we consider reflection invariance
to be an important property and provide evidence where the absence of this
invariance produces surprising inconsistencies in state-of-the-art systems. We
demonstrate inconsistencies in methods of object detection and scene
classification when they are presented with images and the horizontal mirror of
those images. Finally, we examine where some of the invariance is exhibited in
feature detection and descriptors, and make a case for future consideration of
reflection invariance as a measure of quality in computer vision algorithms.

 <dc:title>Strategy Complexity of Concurrent Stochastic Games with Safety and

 <dc:description>  We consider finite-state concurrent stochastic games, played by k&gt;=2 players
for an infinite number of rounds, where in every round, each player
simultaneously and independently of the other players chooses an action,
whereafter the successor state is determined by a probability distribution
given by the current state and the chosen actions. We consider reachability
objectives that given a target set of states require that some state in the
target is visited, and the dual safety objectives that given a target set
require that only states in the target set are visited. We are interested in
the complexity of stationary strategies measured by their patience, which is
defined as the inverse of the smallest nonzero probability employed. Our main
results are as follows: We show that in two-player zero-sum concurrent
stochastic games (with reachability objective for one player and the
complementary safety objective for the other player): (i) the optimal bound on
the patience of optimal and epsilon-optimal strategies, for both players is
doubly exponential; and (ii) even in games with a single nonabsorbing state
exponential (in the number of actions) patience is necessary. In general we
study the class of non-zero-sum games admitting stationary epsilon-Nash
equilibria. We show that if there is at least one player with reachability
objective, then doubly-exponential patience may be needed for epsilon-Nash
equilibrium strategies, whereas in contrast if all players have safety
objectives, the optimal bound on patience for epsilon-Nash equilibrium
strategies is only exponential.

 <dc:description>  Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning
because they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly
be used with nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The two
main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the
difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the
nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using
value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient
estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of
the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second
challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and
the value function, which are represented by neural networks.
  Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D
locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated
robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting
out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses
hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly
from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and
the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds
corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.

 <dc:description>  In Constraint Programming, global constraints allow to model and solve many
combinatorial problems. Among these constraints, several sortedness constraints
have been defined, for which propagation algorithms are available, but for
which the tractability is not settled. We show that the sort(U,V) constraint
(Older et. al, 1995) is intractable for integer variables whose domains are not
limited to intervals. As a consequence, the similar result holds for the
sort(U,V, P) constraint (Zhou, 1996). Moreover, the intractability holds even
under the stability condition present in the recently introduced
keysorting(U,V,Keys,P) constraint (Carlsson et al., 2014), and requiring that
the order of the variables with the same value in the list U be preserved in
the list V. Therefore, keysorting(U,V,Keys,P) is intractable as well.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an efficient resource allocation with user
discrimination framework for 5G Wireless Systems to allocate multiple carriers
resources among users with elastic and inelastic traffic. Each application
running on the user equipment (UE) is assigned an application utility function.
In the proposed model, different classes of user groups are considered and
users are partitioned into different groups based on the carriers coverage
area. Each user has a minimum required application rate based on its class and
the type of its application. Our objective is to allocate multiple carriers
resources optimally among users, that belong to different classes, located
within the carriers' coverage area. We use a utility proportional fairness
approach in the utility percentage of the application running on the UE. Each
user is guaranteed a minimum quality of service (QoS) with a priority criterion
that is based on user's class and the type of application running on the UE. In
addition, we prove the existence of optimal solutions for the proposed resource
allocation optimization problem and present a multi-carrier resource allocation
with user discrimination algorithm. Finally, we present simulation results for
the performance of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In the past few years, the storage and analysis of large-scale and fast
evolving networks present a great challenge. Therefore, a number of different
techniques have been proposed for sampling large networks. In general, network
exploration techniques approximate the original networks more accurately than
random node and link selection. Yet, link selection with additional subgraph
induction step outperforms most other techniques. In this paper, we apply
subgraph induction also to random walk and forest-fire sampling. We analyze
different real-world networks and the changes of their properties introduced by
sampling. We compare several sampling techniques based on the match between the
original networks and their sampled variants. The results reveal that the
techniques with subgraph induction underestimate the degree and clustering
distribution, while overestimate average degree and density of the original
networks. Techniques without subgraph induction step exhibit exactly the
opposite behavior. Hence, the performance of the sampling techniques from
random selection category compared to network exploration sampling does not
differ significantly, while clear differences exist between the techniques with
subgraph induction step and the ones without it.

 <dc:description>  The task of algorithm selection involves choosing an algorithm from a set of
algorithms on a per-instance basis in order to exploit the varying performance
of algorithms over a set of instances. The algorithm selection problem is
attracting increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in AI. Years
of fruitful applications in a number of domains have resulted in a large amount
of data, but the community lacks a standard format or repository for this data.
This situation makes it difficult to share and compare different approaches
effectively, as is done in other, more established fields. It also
unnecessarily hinders new researchers who want to work in this area. To address
this problem, we introduce a standardized format for representing algorithm
selection scenarios and a repository that contains a growing number of data
sets from the literature. Our format has been designed to be able to express a

platform, we describe a set of example experiments that build and evaluate
algorithm selection models through a common interface. The results display the
potential of algorithm selection to achieve significant performance
improvements across a broad range of problems and algorithms.

 <dc:title>On the Hardness of PCTL Satisfiability</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chakraborty, Souymodip</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper shows that the satisfiability problem for probabilistic CTL (PCTL,
for short) is undecidable. By a reduction from $1\frac{1}{2}$-player games with
PCTL winning objectives, we establish that the PCTL satisfiability problem is
${\Sigma}_1^1$-hard. We present an exponential-time algorithm for the
satisfiability of a bounded, negation-closed fragment of PCTL, and show that
the satisfiability problem for this fragment is EXPTIME-hard.

 <dc:description>  Nonlinear analysis of the phase-locked loop (PLL) based circuits is a
challenging task, thus in modern engineering literature simplified mathematical
models and simulation are widely used for their study. In this work the
limitations of numerical approach is discussed and it is shown that, e.g.
hidden oscillations may not be found by simulation. Corresponding examples in
SPICE and MatLab, which may lead to wrong conclusions concerning the
operability of PLL-based circuits, are presented.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proved to be
very effective in feature extraction and representation of images. For image
classification problems, this work aim at finding which classifier is more
competitive based on high-level deep features of images. In this report, we
have discussed the nearest neighbor, support vector machines and extreme
learning machines for image classification under deep convolutional activation
feature representation. Specifically, we adopt the benchmark object recognition
dataset from multiple sources with domain bias for evaluating different
classifiers. The deep features of the object dataset are obtained by a
well-trained CNN with five convolutional layers and three fully-connected
layers on the challenging ImageNet. Experiments demonstrate that the ELMs
outperform SVMs in cross-domain recognition tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art results are obtained by kernel ELM which outperforms SVMs with
about 4% of the average accuracy. The features and codes are available in

 <dc:description>  Maximum pseudolikelihood method has been among the most important methods for

 <dc:title>Fast ConvNets Using Group-wise Brain Damage</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lebedev, Vadim</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We revisit the idea of brain damage, i.e. the pruning of the coefficients of
a neural network, and suggest how brain damage can be modified and used to
speedup convolutional layers. The approach uses the fact that many efficient
implementations reduce generalized convolutions to matrix multiplications. The
suggested brain damage process prunes the convolutional kernel tensor in a
group-wise fashion by adding group-sparsity regularization to the standard
training process. After such group-wise pruning, convolutions can be reduced to
multiplications of thinned dense matrices, which leads to speedup. In the
comparison on AlexNet, the method achieves very competitive performance.

 <dc:description>  Recently, strong results have been demonstrated by Deep Recurrent Neural
Networks on natural language transduction problems. In this paper we explore
the representational power of these models using synthetic grammars designed to
exhibit phenomena similar to those found in real transduction problems such as
machine translation. These experiments lead us to propose new memory-based
recurrent networks that implement continuously differentiable analogues of
traditional data structures such as Stacks, Queues, and DeQues. We show that
these architectures exhibit superior generalisation performance to Deep RNNs
and are often able to learn the underlying generating algorithms in our
transduction experiments.

Upper bounds for the packing radius $r$ of a linear perfect code, in terms of
the metric parameter $p$ and the dimension $n$ are derived. For $p = 2$ and $n
= 2, 3$, we determine all radii for which there are linear perfect codes. The
non-existence results for codes in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ presented here imply
non-existence results for codes over finite alphabets $\mathbb{Z}_q$, when the

 <dc:description>  In this paper we generalize the framework of the feasible descent method

method (RC-FDM) framework. We show that the famous SDCA algorithm for
optimizing the SVM dual problem, or the stochastic coordinate descent method
for the LASSO problem, fits into the framework of RC-FDM. We prove linear
convergence for both R-FDM and RC-FDM under the weak strong convexity
assumption. Moreover, we show that the duality gap converges linearly for
RC-FDM, which implies that the duality gap also converges linearly for SDCA
applied to the SVM dual problem.

 <dc:description>  Current Internet of Things (IoT) development requires service distribution
over Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSAN) to deal with the drastic
increasing of network management complexity. Because of the specific
constraints of WSAN, centralized approaches are strongly limited. Multi-hop
communication used by WSAN introduces transmission latency, packet errors,
router congestion and security issues. As it uses local services, a
decentralized service model avoid long path communications between nodes and
applications. But the main issue is then to have such local services installed
on the desired nodes. Environment Monitoring and Management Agent (EMMA) system
proposes a set of software to deploy and to execute such services over Wireless
Sensor and Actor Networks (WSAN) through a middleware based on Resource
Oriented Architecture (ROA). Its Internet integration and the local management
of data heterogeneity are facilitated through the use of current standard
protocols such as IPv6 LoW Power Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPAN) and
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). This contribution presents EMMA
middleware, methodology and tools used to determine efficient service mapping
and its deployment.

strongly supported by the general risk bound and has very simple rules for
assigning the voters' weights. Moreover, QuadBoost exhibits a rate of decrease
of its empirical error which is slightly faster than the one achieved by
AdaBoost. The experimental results confirm the expectation of the theory that
QuadBoost is a very efficient method for learning ensembles.

 <dc:description>  Finite time analysis of the continuous system is investigated through both
stability and stabilization based on Sum of squares programming. A systematic
approach is proposed to construct Lyapunov function and Control Lyapunov
function for this objective. The Region of reaching, the set which has the
property that all trajectories starting from initial point inside it reach to
the origin in finite time, is introduced, and The largest subset of region of
reaching is estimated using Lyapunov based technique. The main results are
presented to give sufficient conditions which can be translated by
semi-definite program. These conditions are provided a feasibility problem
involving sum of squares constraints. The results of the paper are then
verified by several simulation and numerical examples. Furthermore, one
important practical application namely as a super twisting second order sliding
mode control also is presented using the proposed result to illustrate its
effectiveness.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) is a network of a number of mobile routers and
associated hosts, organized in a random fashion via wireless links. During
recent years MANET has gained enormous amount of attention and has been widely
used for not only military purposes but for search-and-rescue operations,
intelligent transportation system, data collection, virtual classrooms and
ubiquitous computing. Service Discovery is one of the most important issues in
MANET. It is defined as the process of facilitating service providers to
advertise their services in a dynamic way and to allow consumers to discover
and access those services in an efficient and scalable manner. In this paper,
we are proposing a flexible and efficient approach to service discovery for
MANET by extending the work of Torres et al. (2004)...

 <dc:description>  We analyze in this paper a random feature map based on a theory of invariance
I-theory introduced recently. More specifically, a group invariant signal
signature is obtained through cumulative distributions of group transformed
random projections. Our analysis bridges invariant feature learning with kernel
methods, as we show that this feature map defines an expected Haar integration
kernel that is invariant to the specified group action. We show how this
non-linear random feature map approximates this group invariant kernel
uniformly on a set of $N$ points. Moreover, we show that it defines a function
space that is dense in the equivalent Invariant Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
Space. Finally, we quantify error rates of the convergence of the empirical
risk minimization, as well as the reduction in the sample complexity of a
learning algorithm using such an invariant representation for signal
classification, in a classical supervised learning setting.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of enumerating the number of irreducible
transformation shift registers. We give an asymptotic formula for the number of
irreducible transformation shift registers in some special cases. Moreover, we
derive a short proof for the exact number of irreducible transformation shift
registers of order two using a recent generalization of a theorem of Carlitz.

 <dc:description>  We study the $K$-armed dueling bandit problem, a variation of the standard
stochastic bandit problem where the feedback is limited to relative comparisons
of a pair of arms. We introduce a tight asymptotic regret lower bound that is
based on the information divergence. An algorithm that is inspired by the
Deterministic Minimum Empirical Divergence algorithm (Honda and Takemura, 2010)
is proposed, and its regret is analyzed. The proposed algorithm is found to be
the first one with a regret upper bound that matches the lower bound.
Experimental comparisons of dueling bandit algorithms show that the proposed
algorithm significantly outperforms existing ones.

 <dc:description>  We present DUAL-LOCO, a communication-efficient algorithm for distributed
statistical estimation. DUAL-LOCO assumes that the data is distributed
according to the features rather than the samples. It requires only a single
round of communication where low-dimensional random projections are used to
approximate the dependences between features available to different workers. We
show that DUAL-LOCO has bounded approximation error which only depends weakly
on the number of workers. We compare DUAL-LOCO against a state-of-the-art
distributed optimization method on a variety of real world datasets and show
that it obtains better speedups while retaining good accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We investigate a local reparameterizaton technique for greatly reducing the
variance of stochastic gradients for variational Bayesian inference (SGVB) of a
posterior over model parameters, while retaining parallelizability. This local
reparameterization translates uncertainty about global parameters into local
noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch. Such
parameterizations can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is
inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster
convergence. Additionally, we explore a connection with dropout: Gaussian
dropout objectives correspond to SGVB with local reparameterization, a
scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method
allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically, we
propose variational dropout, a generalization of Gaussian dropout where the
dropout rates are learned, often leading to better models. The method is
demonstrated through several experiments.

 <dc:description>  Frequent itemset mining is an essential part of data analysis and data
mining. Recent works propose interesting SAT-based encodings for the problem of
discovering frequent itemsets. Our aim in this work is to define strategies for
adapting SAT solvers to such encodings in order to improve models enumeration.
In this context, we deeply study the effects of restart, branching heuristics
and clauses learning. We then conduct an experimental evaluation on SAT-Based
itemset mining instances to show how SAT solvers can be adapted to obtain an
efficient SAT model enumerator.

 <dc:description>  We propose a Bayesian evidence framework to facilitate transfer learning from
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our framework is
formulated on top of a least squares SVM (LS-SVM) classifier, which is simple
and fast in both training and testing, and achieves competitive performance in
practice. The regularization parameters in LS-SVM is estimated automatically
without grid search and cross-validation by maximizing evidence, which is a
useful measure to select the best performing CNN out of multiple candidates for
transfer learning; the evidence is optimized efficiently by employing Aitken's
delta-squared process, which accelerates convergence of fixed point update. The
proposed Bayesian evidence framework also provides a good solution to identify
the best ensemble of heterogeneous CNNs through a greedy algorithm. Our
Bayesian evidence framework for transfer learning is tested on 12 visual
recognition datasets and illustrates the state-of-the-art performance
consistently in terms of prediction accuracy and modeling efficiency.

 <dc:description>  The expicit restricted isometry property (RIP) measurement matrices are
needed in practical application of compressed sensing in signal processing. RIP
matrices from Reed-Solomon codes, BCH codes, orthogonal codes, expander graphs
have been proposed and analysised. On the other hand binary constant weight
codes have been studied for many years and many optimal or near-optimal small
weight and ditance constant weight codes have been determined. In this paper we
propose a new deterministic construction of RIP measurement matrices in
compressed sensing from binary and ternary contant weight codes. The sparse
orders and the number of budged rows in the new constant-weight-code-based RIP
matrices can be arbitrary. These contant-weight-code based RIP matrices have
better parameters compared with the DeVore RIP matrices when the sizes are
small.

 <dc:description>  Minimizing the number of probes is one of the main challenges in
reconstructing geometric objects with probing devices. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of using an $\omega$-wedge probing tool to determine
the exact shape and orientation of a convex polygon. An $\omega$-wedge consists
of two rays emanating from a point called the apex of the wedge and the two
rays forming an angle $\omega$. To probe with an $\omega$-wedge, we set the
direction that the apex of the probe has to follow, the line $\overrightarrow
L$, and the initial orientation of the two rays. A valid $\omega$-probe of a
convex polygon $O$ contains $O$ within the $\omega$-wedge and its outcome
consists of the coordinates of the apex, the orientation of both rays and the
coordinates of the closest (to the apex) points of contact between $O$ and each
of the rays.
  We present algorithms minimizing the number of probes and prove their
optimality. In particular, we show how to reconstruct a convex $n$-gon (with
all internal angles of size larger than $\omega$) using $2n-2$ $\omega$-probes;
if $\omega = \pi/2$, the reconstruction uses $2n-3$ $\omega$-probes. We show
that both results are optimal. Let $N_B$ be the number of vertices of $O$ whose
internal angle is at most $\omega$, (we show that $0 \leq N_B \leq 3$). We
determine the shape and orientation of a general convex $n$-gon with $N_B=1$
(respectively $N_B=2$, $N_B=3$) using $2n-1$ (respectively $2n+3$, $2n+5$)
$\omega$-probes. We prove optimality for the first case. Assuming the algorithm
knows the value of $N_B$ in advance, the reconstruction of $O$ with $N_B=2$ or
$N_B=3$ can be achieved with $2n+2$ probes,- which is optimal.

 <dc:title>Catching the head, tail, and everything in between: a streaming

 <dc:description>  The degree distribution is one of the most fundamental graph properties of
interest for real-world graphs. It has been widely observed in numerous domains
that graphs typically have a tailed or scale-free degree distribution. While
the average degree is usually quite small, the variance is quite high and there
are vertices with degrees at all scales. We focus on the problem of
approximating the degree distribution of a large streaming graph, with small
storage. We design an algorithm headtail, whose main novelty is a new estimator
of infrequent degrees using truncated geometric random variables. We give a
mathematical analysis of headtail and show that it has excellent behavior in
practice. We can process streams will millions of edges with storage less than
1% and get extremely accurate approximations for all scales in the degree
distribution.
  We also introduce a new notion of Relative Hausdorff distance between tailed
histograms. Existing notions of distances between distributions are not
suitable, since they ignore infrequent degrees in the tail. The Relative
Hausdorff distance measures deviations at all scales, and is a more suitable
distance for comparing degree distributions. By tracking this new measure, we
are able to give strong empirical evidence of the convergence of headtail.

Carpentry (SC) get more done in less time. We asked 32 questions to assess 24
former participants to analyse if SC gave them the computing skills to
accomplish this. Our research shows that time was already saved during the
workshop as it could shorten the learning process of new skills. A majority of
participants were able to use these new skills straight away and thus could
speed up their day to day work.

 <dc:description>  We consider emphatic temporal-difference learning algorithms for policy
evaluation in discounted Markov decision processes with finite spaces. Such
algorithms were recently proposed by Sutton, Mahmood, and White (2015) as an
improved solution to the problem of divergence of off-policy
temporal-difference learning with linear function approximation. We present in
this paper the first convergence proofs for two emphatic algorithms,
ETD($\lambda$) and ELSTD($\lambda$). We prove, under general off-policy
conditions, the convergence in $L^1$ for ELSTD($\lambda$) iterates, and the
almost sure convergence of the approximate value functions calculated by both
algorithms using a single infinitely long trajectory. Our analysis involves new
techniques with applications beyond emphatic algorithms leading, for example,
to the first proof that standard TD($\lambda$) also converges under off-policy
training for $\lambda$ sufficiently large.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel framework of sparse kernel learning for Support Vector
Data Description (SVDD) based anomaly detection is presented. In this work,
optimal sparse feature selection for anomaly detection is first modeled as a
Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Due to the prohibitively high
computational complexity of the MIP, it is relaxed into a Quadratically
Constrained Linear Programming (QCLP) problem. The QCLP problem can then be
practically solved by using an iterative optimization method, in which multiple
subsets of features are iteratively found as opposed to a single subset. The
QCLP-based iterative optimization problem is solved in a finite space called
the \emph{Empirical Kernel Feature Space} (EKFS) instead of in the input space
or \emph{Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space} (RKHS). This is possible because of
the fact that the geometrical properties of the EKFS and the corresponding RKHS
remain the same. Now, an explicit nonlinear exploitation of the data in a
finite EKFS is achievable, which results in optimal feature ranking.
Experimental results based on a hyperspectral image show that the proposed
method can provide improved performance over the current state-of-the-art
techniques.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of specific video event retrieval. Given a query video
of a specific event, e.g., a concert of Madonna, the goal is to retrieve other
videos of the same event that temporally overlap with the query. Our approach
encodes the frame descriptors of a video to jointly represent their appearance
and temporal order. It exploits the properties of circulant matrices to
efficiently compare the videos in the frequency domain. This offers a
significant gain in complexity and accurately localizes the matching parts of
videos. The descriptors can be compressed in the frequency domain with a
product quantizer adapted to complex numbers. In this case, video retrieval is
performed without decompressing the descriptors. We also consider the temporal
alignment of a set of videos. We exploit the matching confidence and an
estimate of the temporal offset computed for all pairs of videos by our
retrieval approach. Our robust algorithm aligns the videos on a global timeline
by maximizing the set of temporally consistent matches. The global temporal
alignment enables synchronous playback of the videos of a given scene.

 <dc:description>  Social networking websites allow users to create and share content. Big
information cascades of post resharing can form as users of these sites reshare
others' posts with their friends and followers. One of the central challenges
in understanding such cascading behaviors is in forecasting information
outbreaks, where a single post becomes widely popular by being reshared by many
users. In this paper, we focus on predicting the final number of reshares of a
given post. We build on the theory of self-exciting point processes to develop
a statistical model that allows us to make accurate predictions. Our model
requires no training or expensive feature engineering. It results in a simple
and efficiently computable formula that allows us to answer questions, in
real-time, such as: Given a post's resharing history so far, what is our
current estimate of its final number of reshares? Is the post resharing cascade
past the initial stage of explosive growth? And, which posts will be the most
reshared in the future? We validate our model using one month of complete
Twitter data and demonstrate a strong improvement in predictive accuracy over
existing approaches. Our model gives only 15% relative error in predicting
final size of an average information cascade after observing it for just one
hour.

 <dc:title>Interference as Noise: Friend or Foe?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dytso, Alex</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tuninetti, Daniela</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Devroye, Natasha</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper shows that for the two-user Gaussian Interference Channel (G-IC)
Treating Interference as Noise without Time Sharing (TINnoTS) achieves the
closure of the capacity region to within either a constant gap, or to within a
gap of the order O(logln(min(S,I))) where S is the largest Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR) on the direct links and I is the largest Interference to Noise
Ratio (INR) on the cross links. As a consequence, TINnoTS is optimal from a
generalized Degrees of Freedom (gDoF) perspective for all channel gains except
for a subset of zero measure. TINnoTS with Gaussian inputs is known to be
optimal to within 1/2 bit for a subset of the weak interference regime.
Surprisingly, this paper shows that TINnoTS is gDoG optimal in all parameter
regimes, even in the strong and very strong interference regimes where joint
decoding of Gaussian inputs is optimal. For approximate optimality of TINnoTS
in all parameter regimes it is critical to use non-Gaussian inputs. This work
thus proposes to use mixed inputs as channel inputs where a mixed input is the
sum of a discrete and a Gaussian random variable. Interestingly, compared to
the Han-Kobayashi inner bound, the discrete part of a mixed input is shown to
effectively act as a common message in the sense that, although treated as
noise, its effect on the achievable rate region is as if it were jointly
decoded together with the desired messages at a non-intended receiver. The
practical implication is that a discrete interfering input is a 'friend', while
a Gaussian interfering input is in general a 'foe'. Since TINnoTS requires
neither joint decoding nor time sharing, the results of this paper are
applicable to a variety of oblivions or asynchronous channels, such as the
block asynchronous G-IC (which is not an information stable) and the G-IC with
partial codebook knowledge at one or more receivers.

 <dc:description>  We present a fresh and broad yet simple approach towards information
retrieval in general and diagnostics in particular by applying the theory of
complex networks on multidimensional, dynamic images. We demonstrate a
successful use of our method with the time series generated from high content
thermal imaging videos of patients suffering from the aqueous deficient dry eye
(ADDE) disease. Remarkably, network analyses of thermal imaging time series of
contact lens users and patients upon whom Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis
(Lasik) surgery has been conducted, exhibit pronounced similarity with results
obtained from ADDE patients. We also propose a general framework for the
transformation of multidimensional images to networks for futuristic biometry.
Our approach is general and scalable to other fluctuation-based devices where
network parameters derived from fluctuations, act as effective discriminators
and diagnostic markers.

 <dc:description>  We investigate a non-cooperative game-theoretic model for the formation of
communication networks by selfish agents. Each agent aims for a central
position at minimum cost for creating edges. In particular, the general model
(Fabrikant et al., PODC'03) became popular for studying the structure of the
Internet or social networks. Despite its significance, locality in this game
was first studied only recently (Bil\`o et al., SPAA'14), where a worst case
locality model was presented, which came with a high efficiency loss in terms
of quality of equilibria. Our main contribution is a new and more optimistic
view on locality: agents are limited in their knowledge and actions to their
local view ranges, but can probe different strategies and finally choose the
best. We study the influence of our locality notion on the hardness of
computing best responses, convergence to equilibria, and quality of equilibria.
Moreover, we compare the strength of local versus non-local strategy-changes.
Our results address the gap between the original model and the worst case
locality variant. On the bright side, our efficiency results are in line with
observations from the original model, yet we have a non-constant lower bound on
the price of anarchy.

 <dc:description>  We revisit the choice of SGD for training deep neural networks by
reconsidering the appropriate geometry in which to optimize the weights. We
argue for a geometry invariant to rescaling of weights that does not affect the
output of the network, and suggest Path-SGD, which is an approximate steepest
descent method with respect to a path-wise regularizer related to max-norm
regularization. Path-SGD is easy and efficient to implement and leads to
empirical gains over SGD and AdaGrad.

 <dc:description>  Training structured prediction models is time-consuming. However, most
existing approaches only use a single machine, thus, the advantage of computing
power and the capacity for larger data sets of multiple machines have not been
exploited. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for distributedly
training structured support vector machines based on a distributed
block-coordinate descent method. Both theoretical and experimental results
indicate that our method is efficient.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive,
making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems. Also, conventional
networks fix the architecture before training starts; as a result, training
cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a
method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an
order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the
important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a
three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are
important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the
network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet
dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of
9x, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar
experiments with VGG-16 found that the number of parameters can be reduced by
13x, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Overfitting is the bane of data analysts, even when data are plentiful.
Formal approaches to understanding this problem focus on statistical inference
and generalization of individual analysis procedures. Yet the practice of data
analysis is an inherently interactive and adaptive process: new analyses and
hypotheses are proposed after seeing the results of previous ones, parameters
are tuned on the basis of obtained results, and datasets are shared and reused.
An investigation of this gap has recently been initiated by the authors in
(Dwork et al., 2014), where we focused on the problem of estimating
expectations of adaptively chosen functions.
  In this paper, we give a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout
(or testing) set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning
algorithm operating on a training set. Reusing a holdout set adaptively
multiple times can easily lead to overfitting to the holdout set itself. We
give an algorithm that enables the validation of a large number of adaptively
chosen hypotheses, while provably avoiding overfitting. We illustrate the
advantages of our algorithm over the standard use of the holdout set via a
simple synthetic experiment.
  We also formalize and address the general problem of data reuse in adaptive
data analysis. We show how the differential-privacy based approach given in
(Dwork et al., 2014) is applicable much more broadly to adaptive data analysis.
We then show that a simple approach based on description length can also be
used to give guarantees of statistical validity in adaptive settings. Finally,
we demonstrate that these incomparable approaches can be unified via the notion
of approximate max-information that we introduce.

 <dc:description>  Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is known to model human decisions well, with
substantial empirical evidence supporting this claim. CPT works by distorting
probabilities and is more general than the classic expected utility and
coherent risk measures. We bring this idea to a risk-sensitive reinforcement
learning (RL) setting and design algorithms for both estimation and control.
The RL setting presents two particular challenges when CPT is applied:
estimating the CPT objective requires estimations of the entire distribution of
the value function and finding a randomized optimal policy. The estimation
scheme that we propose uses the empirical distribution to estimate the
CPT-value of a random variable. We then use this scheme in the inner loop of a
CPT-value optimization procedure that is based on the well-known simulation
optimization idea of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA).
We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for all the proposed algorithms
and also illustrate the usefulness of CPT-based criteria in a traffic signal
control application.

 <dc:description>  We propose a clustering algorithm which, for input, takes data assumed to be
sampled from a uniform distribution supported on a metric space $X$, and
outputs a clustering of the data based on a topological estimate of the
connected components of $X$. The algorithm works by choosing a weighted graph
on the samples from a natural one-parameter family of graphs using an error
based on the heat operator on the graphs. The estimated connected components of
$X$ are identified as the support of the eigenfunctions of the heat operator
with eigenvalue $1$, which allows the algorithm to work without requiring the
number of expected clusters as input.

 <dc:description>  We show new limits on the efficiency of using current techniques to make
exact probabilistic inference for large classes of natural problems. In
particular we show new lower bounds on knowledge compilation to SDD and DNNF
forms. We give strong lower bounds on the complexity of SDD representations by
relating SDD size to best-partition communication complexity. We use this
relationship to prove exponential lower bounds on the SDD size for representing
a large class of problems that occur naturally as queries over probabilistic
databases. A consequence is that for representing unions of conjunctive
queries, SDDs are not qualitatively more concise than OBDDs. We also derive
simple examples for which SDDs must be exponentially less concise than FBDDs.
Finally, we derive exponential lower bounds on the sizes of DNNF
representations using a new quasipolynomial simulation of DNNFs by
nondeterministic FBDDs.

 <dc:description>  We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object
detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object
detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and
associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes
and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the
whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end
directly on detection performance.
  Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes
images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network,
Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving
double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art
detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely
to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very
general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods,
including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images
to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.

 <dc:title>Convex Optimization Approach for Stable Decomposition of Stream of
  Pulses</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bendory, Tamir</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of estimating the delays and amplitudes of
a weighted superposition of pulses, called stream of pulses. This problem is
motivated by a variety of applications, such as ultrasound and radar. This
paper shows that the recovery error of a tractable convex optimization problem
is proportional to the noise level. Additionally, the estimated delays are
clustered around the true delays. This holds provided that the pulse meets a
few mild localization properties and that a separation condition holds. If the
amplitudes are known to be positive, the separation is unnecessary. In this
case, the recovery error is proportional to the noise level and depends on the
maximal number of delays within a resolution cell.

 <dc:title>Topology-preserving digitization of n-dimensional objects by

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new cubical space model for the representation of
continuous objects and surfaces in the n-dimensional Euclidean space by
discrete sets of points. The cubical space model concerns the process of
converting a continuous object in its digital counterpart, which is a graph,
enabling us to apply notions and operations used in digital imaging to cubical
spaces. We formulate a definition of a simple n-cube and prove that deleting or
attaching a simple n-cube does not change the homotopy type of a cubical space.
Relying on these results, we design a procedure, which preserves basic
topological properties of an n-dimensional object, for constructing compressed
cubical and digital models.

 <dc:description>  Spatio-temporal data is intrinsically high dimensional, so unsupervised
modeling is only feasible if we can exploit structure in the process. When the
dynamics are local in both space and time, this structure can be exploited by
splitting the global field into many lower-dimensional &quot;light cones&quot;. We review
light cone decompositions for predictive state reconstruction, introducing
three simple light cone algorithms. These methods allow for tractable inference
of spatio-temporal data, such as full-frame video. The algorithms make few
assumptions on the underlying process yet have good predictive performance and
can provide distributions over spatio-temporal data, enabling sophisticated
probabilistic inference.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a set of new error criteria and learning approaches,
Adaptive Normalized Risk-Averting Training (ANRAT), to attack the non-convex
optimization problem in training deep neural networks (DNNs). Theoretically, we
demonstrate its effectiveness on global and local convexity lower-bounded by
the standard $L_p$-norm error. By analyzing the gradient on the convexity index
$\lambda$, we explain the reason why to learn $\lambda$ adaptively using
gradient descent works. In practice, we show how this method improves training
of deep neural networks to solve visual recognition tasks on the MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets. Without using pretraining or other tricks, we obtain results
comparable or superior to those reported in recent literature on the same tasks
using standard ConvNets + MSE/cross entropy. Performance on deep/shallow
multilayer perceptrons and Denoised Auto-encoders is also explored. ANRAT can
be combined with other quasi-Newton training methods, innovative network
variants, regularization techniques and other specific tricks in DNNs. Other
than unsupervised pretraining, it provides a new perspective to address the
non-convex optimization problem in DNNs.

 <dc:description>  We study compressed sensing (CS) signal reconstruction problems where an
input signal is measured via matrix multiplication under additive white
Gaussian noise. Our signals are assumed to be stationary and ergodic, but the
input statistics are unknown; the goal is to provide reconstruction algorithms
that are universal to the input statistics. We present a novel algorithmic
framework that combines: (i) the approximate message passing (AMP) CS
reconstruction framework, which solves the matrix channel recovery problem by
iterative scalar channel denoising; (ii) a universal denoising scheme based on
context quantization, which partitions the stationary ergodic signal denoising
into independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsequence denoising;
and (iii) a density estimation approach that approximates the probability
distribution of an i.i.d. sequence by fitting a Gaussian mixture (GM) model. In
addition to the algorithmic framework, we provide three contributions: (i)
numerical results showing that state evolution holds for non-separable Bayesian
sliding-window denoisers; (ii) an i.i.d. denoiser based on a modified GM
learning algorithm; and (iii) a universal denoiser that does not need
information about the range where the input takes values from or require the
input signal to be bounded. We provide two implementations of our universal CS
recovery algorithm with one being faster and the other being more accurate. The
two implementations compare favorably with existing universal reconstruction
algorithms in terms of both reconstruction quality and runtime.

to be quasi-concave in the relay position and this property is used to optimize
the relay position for several networks.

various types of generalized difference families. Constructing these difference

variant, where secrets and errors are binary or taken in a small interval. We
introduce a new variant of the Blum, Kalai and Wasserman algorithm, relying on
a quantization step that generalizes and fine-tunes modulus switching. In
general this new technique yields a significant gain in the constant in front
of the exponent in the overall complexity. We illustrate this by solving p
within half a day a LWE instance with dimension n = 128, modulus $q = n^2$,
Gaussian noise $\alpha = 1/(\sqrt{n/\pi} \log^2 n)$ and binary secret, using
$2^{28}$ samples, while the previous best result based on BKW claims a time
complexity of $2^{74}$ with $2^{60}$ samples for the same parameters. We then
introduce variants of BDD, GapSVP and UniqueSVP, where the target point is
required to lie in the fundamental parallelepiped, and show how the previous
algorithm is able to solve these variants in subexponential time. Moreover, we
also show how the previous algorithm can be used to solve the BinaryLWE problem
with n samples in subexponential time $2^{(\ln 2/2+o(1))n/\log \log n}$. This
analysis does not require any heuristic assumption, contrary to other algebraic
approaches; instead, it uses a variant of an idea by Lyubashevsky to generate
many samples from a small number of samples. This makes it possible to
asymptotically and heuristically break the NTRU cryptosystem in subexponential
time (without contradicting its security assumption). We are also able to solve
subset sum problems in subexponential time for density $o(1)$, which is of
independent interest: for such density, the previous best algorithm requires
exponential time. As a direct application, we can solve in subexponential time
the parameters of a cryptosystem based on this problem proposed at TCC 2010.

 <dc:description>  We present an extensive analysis of the key problem of learning optimal
reserve prices for generalized second price auctions. We describe two
algorithms for this task: one based on density estimation, and a novel
algorithm benefiting from solid theoretical guarantees and with a very
favorable running-time complexity of $O(n S \log (n S))$, where $n$ is the
sample size and $S$ the number of slots. Our theoretical guarantees are more
favorable than those previously presented in the literature. Additionally, we
show that even if bidders do not play at an equilibrium, our second algorithm
is still well defined and minimizes a quantity of interest. To our knowledge,
this is the first attempt to apply learning algorithms to the problem of
reserve price optimization in GSP auctions. Finally, we present the first
convergence analysis of empirical equilibrium bidding functions to the unique
symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibrium of a GSP.

 <dc:description>  The main objective of this work is to study mathematical properties of
computational paths. Originally proposed by de Queiroz \&amp; Gabbay (1994) as
`sequences or rewrites', computational paths are taken to be terms of the
identity type of Martin L\&quot;of's Intensional Type Theory, since these paths can
be seen as the grounds on which the propositional equality between two
computational objects stand. From this perspective, this work aims to show that
one of the properties of the identity type is present on computational paths.
We are referring to the fact that that the identity type induces a groupoid
structure, as proposed by Hofmann \&amp; Streicher (1994). Using categorical
semantics, we show that computational paths induce a groupoid structure. We
also show that computational paths are capable of inducing higher categorical
structures.

 <dc:description>  Symbolic Aggregation approXimation (SAX) has been the de facto standard
representation methods for knowledge discovery in time series on a number of
tasks and applications. So far, very little work has been done in empirically
investigating the intrinsic properties and statistical mechanics in SAX words.
In this paper, we applied several statistical measurements and proposed a new
statistical measurement, i.e. information embedding cost (IEC) to analyze the
statistical behaviors of the symbolic dynamics. Our experiments on the
benchmark datasets and the clinical signals demonstrate that SAX can always
reduce the complexity while preserving the core information embedded in the
original time series with significant embedding efficiency. Our proposed IEC
score provide a priori to determine if SAX is adequate for specific dataset,
which can be generalized to evaluate other symbolic representations. Our work
provides an analytical framework with several statistical tools to analyze,
evaluate and further improve the symbolic dynamics for knowledge discovery in
time series.

 <dc:description>  Through a particular choice of a predicate (e.g., &quot;x violated y&quot;), a writer
can subtly connote a range of implied sentiments and presupposed facts about
the entities x and y: (1) writer's perspective: projecting x as an
&quot;antagonist&quot;and y as a &quot;victim&quot;, (2) entities' perspective: y probably dislikes
x, (3) effect: something bad happened to y, (4) value: y is something valuable,
and (5) mental state: y is distressed by the event. We introduce connotation
frames as a representation formalism to organize these rich dimensions of
connotation using typed relations. First, we investigate the feasibility of
obtaining connotative labels through crowdsourcing experiments. We then present
models for predicting the connotation frames of verb predicates based on their
distributional word representations and the interplay between different types
of connotative relations. Empirical results confirm that connotation frames can
be induced from various data sources that reflect how people use language and
give rise to the connotative meanings. We conclude with analytical results that
show the potential use of connotation frames for analyzing subtle biases in
online news media.

 <dc:description>  For a Gray code in the scheme of rank modulation for flash memories, the
codewords are permutations and two consecutive codewords are obtained using a
push-to-the-top operation. We consider snake-in-the-box codes under Kendall's
$\tau$-metric, which is a Gray code capable of detecting one Kendall's
$\tau$-error. We answer two open problems posed by Horovitz and Etzion.
Firstly, we prove the validity of a construction given by them, resulting in a
snake of size $M_{2n+1}=\frac{(2n+1)!}{2}-2n+1$. Secondly, we come up with a
different construction aiming at a longer snake of size
$M_{2n+1}=\frac{(2n+1)!}{2}-2n+3$. The construction is applied successfully to
$S_7$.

 <dc:description>  It is known that any $n$-variable function on a finite prime field of
characteristic $p$ can be expressed as a polynomial over the same field with at
most $p^n$ monomials. However, it is not obvious to determine the polynomial
for a given concrete function. In this paper, we study the concrete polynomial
expressions of the carries in addition and multiplication of $p$-ary integers.
For the case of addition, our result gives a new family of symmetric
polynomials, which generalizes the known result for the binary case $p = 2$
where the carries are given by elementary symmetric polynomials. On the other
hand, for the case of multiplication of $n$ single-digit integers, we give a
simple formula of the polynomial expression for the carry to the next digit
using the Bernoulli numbers, and show that it has only $(n+1)(p-1)/2 + 1$
monomials, which is significantly fewer than the worst-case number $p^n$ of
monomials for general functions. We also discuss applications of our results to
cryptographic computation on encrypted data.

 <dc:title>Self Organizing Maps Whose Topologies Can Be Learned With Adaptive
  Binary Search Trees Using Conditional Rotations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Numerous variants of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) have been proposed in the
literature, including those which also possess an underlying structure, and in
some cases, this structure itself can be defined by the user Although the
concepts of growing the SOM and updating it have been studied, the whole issue
of using a self-organizing Adaptive Data Structure (ADS) to further enhance the
properties of the underlying SOM, has been unexplored. In an earlier work, we
impose an arbitrary, user-defined, tree-like topology onto the codebooks, which
consequently enforced a neighborhood phenomenon and the so-called tree-based
Bubble of Activity. In this paper, we consider how the underlying tree itself
can be rendered dynamic and adaptively transformed. To do this, we present
methods by which a SOM with an underlying Binary Search Tree (BST) structure
can be adaptively re-structured using Conditional Rotations (CONROT). These
rotations on the nodes of the tree are local, can be done in constant time, and
performed so as to decrease the Weighted Path Length (WPL) of the entire tree.
In doing this, we introduce the pioneering concept referred to as Neural
Promotion, where neurons gain prominence in the Neural Network (NN) as their
significance increases. We are not aware of any research which deals with the
issue of Neural Promotion. The advantages of such a scheme is that the user
need not be aware of any of the topological peculiarities of the stochastic
data distribution. Rather, the algorithm, referred to as the TTOSOM with
Conditional Rotations (TTOCONROT), converges in such a manner that the neurons
are ultimately placed in the input space so as to represent its stochastic
distribution, and additionally, the neighborhood properties of the neurons suit
the best BST that represents the data. These properties have been confirmed by
our experimental results on a variety of data sets.

 <dc:title>Guaranteed Blind Sparse Spikes Deconvolution via Lifting and Convex
  Optimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chi, Yuejie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural recordings, returns from radars and sonars, images in astronomy and
single-molecule microscopy can be modeled as a linear superposition of a small
number of scaled and delayed copies of a band-limited or diffraction-limited
point spread function, which is either determined by the nature or designed by
the users; in other words, we observe the convolution between a point spread
function and a sparse spike signal with unknown amplitudes and delays. While it
is of great interest to accurately resolve the spike signal from as few samples
as possible, however, when the point spread function is not known a priori,
this problem is terribly ill-posed. This paper proposes a convex optimization
framework to simultaneously estimate the point spread function as well as the
spike signal, by mildly constraining the point spread function to lie in a
known low-dimensional subspace. By applying the lifting trick, we obtain an
underdetermined linear system of an ensemble of signals with joint spectral
sparsity, to which atomic norm minimization is applied. Under mild randomness
assumptions of the low-dimensional subspace as well as a separation condition
of the spike signal, we prove the proposed algorithm, dubbed as AtomicLift, is
guaranteed to recover the spike signal up to a scaling factor as soon as the
number of samples is large enough. The extension of AtomicLift to handle noisy
measurements is also discussed. Numerical examples are provided to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

 <dc:description>  Feature representations, both hand-designed and learned ones, are often hard
to analyze and interpret, even when they are extracted from visual data. We
propose a new approach to study image representations by inverting them with an
up-convolutional neural network. We apply the method to shallow representations
(HOG, SIFT, LBP), as well as to deep networks. For shallow representations our
approach provides significantly better reconstructions than existing methods,
revealing that there is surprisingly rich information contained in these
features. Inverting a deep network trained on ImageNet provides several
insights into the properties of the feature representation learned by the
network. Most strikingly, the colors and the rough contours of an image can be
reconstructed from activations in higher network layers and even from the
predicted class probabilities.

 <dc:description>  Embedding words in a vector space has gained a lot of attention in recent
years. While state-of-the-art methods provide efficient computation of word
similarities via a low-dimensional matrix embedding, their motivation is often
left unclear. In this paper, we argue that word embedding can be naturally
viewed as a ranking problem due to the ranking nature of the evaluation
metrics. Then, based on this insight, we propose a novel framework WordRank
that efficiently estimates word representations via robust ranking, in which
the attention mechanism and robustness to noise are readily achieved via the
DCG-like ranking losses. The performance of WordRank is measured in word
similarity and word analogy benchmarks, and the results are compared to the
state-of-the-art word embedding techniques. Our algorithm is very competitive
to the state-of-the- arts on large corpora, while outperforms them by a
significant margin when the training set is limited (i.e., sparse and noisy).
With 17 million tokens, WordRank performs almost as well as existing methods
using 7.2 billion tokens on a popular word similarity benchmark. Our multi-node
distributed implementation of WordRank is publicly available for general usage.

verified through the numerical simulations on a quadrotor aircraft: i) through
the differentiation-integration observer, the attitude angle and the
uncertainties in attitude dynamics are estimated synchronously from the
measurements of angular velocity; ii) a control law is designed based on the
observers to drive the aircraft to track a reference trajectory.

 <dc:title>Fast Geometric Fit Algorithm for Sphere Using Exact Solution</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>YD, Sumith</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sphere fitting is a common problem in almost all science and engineering
disciplines. Most of methods available are iterative in behavior. This involves
fitting of the parameters in a least square sense or in a geometric sense. Here
we extend the methods of Thomas Chan and Landau who fitted the 2D data using
circle. This work closely resemble their work in redefining the error estimate
and solving the sphere fitting problem exactly. The solutions for center and
radius of the sphere can be found exactly and the equations can be hard coded
for high performance. We have also shown some comparison with other popular
methods and how this method behaves.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays impact factor is the significant indicator for journal evaluation.
In impact factor calculation is used number of all citations to journal,
regardless of the prestige of cited journals, however, scientific units (paper,
researcher, journal or scientific organization) cited by journals with high
impact factor or researchers with high Hirsch index are more important than
objects cited by journals without impact factor or unknown researcher. In this
paper was offered weighted impact factor for getting more accurate rankings for
journals, which consider not only quantity of citations, but also quality of
citing journals. Correlation coefficients among different indicators for
journal evaluation: impact factors by Thomson Scientific, weighted impact
factors offered by different researchers, average and medians of all citing
journals impact factors and 5-year impact factors were analysed.

 <dc:title>Estimating Posterior Ratio for Classification: Transfer Learning from

 <dc:description>  Transfer learning assumes classifiers of similar tasks share certain
parameter structures. Unfortunately, modern classifiers uses sophisticated
feature representations with huge parameter spaces which lead to costly
transfer. Under the impression that changes from one classifier to another
should be ``simple'', an efficient transfer learning criteria that only learns
the ``differences'' is proposed in this paper. We train a \emph{posterior
ratio} which turns out to minimizes the upper-bound of the target learning
risk. The model of posterior ratio does not have to share the same parameter
space with the source classifier at all so it can be easily modelled and
efficiently trained. The resulting classifier therefore is obtained by simply
multiplying the existing probabilistic-classifier with the learned posterior
ratio.

 <dc:description>  Kernel methods give powerful, flexible, and theoretically grounded approaches
to solving many problems in machine learning. The standard approach, however,
requires pairwise evaluations of a kernel function, which can lead to
scalability issues for very large datasets. Rahimi and Recht (2007) suggested a
popular approach to handling this problem, known as random Fourier features.
The quality of this approximation, however, is not well understood. We improve
the uniform error bound of that paper, as well as giving novel understandings
of the embedding's variance, approximation error, and use in some machine
learning methods. We also point out that surprisingly, of the two main variants
of those features, the more widely used is strictly higher-variance for the
Gaussian kernel and has worse bounds.

 <dc:description>  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem is generalized to definable theories,
which are not necessarily recursively enumerable, by using a couple of
syntactic-semantic notions, one is the consistency of a theory with the set of
all true $\Pi_n$-sentences or equivalently the $\Sigma_n$-soundness of the
theory, and the other is $n$-consistency the restriction of
$\omega$-consistency to the $\Sigma_n$-formulas. It is also shown that Rosser's
Incompleteness Theorem does not generally hold for definable non-recursively
enumerable theories, whence Godel-Rosser's Incompleteness Theorem is optimal in
a sense. Though the proof of the incompleteness theorem using the
$\Sigma_n$-soundness assumption is constructive, it is shown that there is no
constructive proof for the incompleteness theorem using the $n$-consistency
assumption, for $n\!&gt;\!2$.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider communication over the AWGN channel with a transmitter whose
battery is recharged with RF energy transfer at random times known to the
receiver. We assume that the recharging process is i.i.d. Bernoulli. We
characterize the capacity of this channel as the limit of an $n$-letter maximum
mutual information rate under both causal and noncausal transmitter knowledge
of the battery recharges. With noncausal knowledge, it is possible to
explicitly identify the maximizing input distribution, which we use to
demonstrate that the capacity with noncausal knowledge of the battery recharges
is strictly larger than that with causal knowledge. We then proceed to derive
explicit upper and lower bounds on the capacity, which are within 1.05
bits/s/Hz of each other for all parameter values.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, online education has been considered as one of the most
widely used IT services. Researchers in this field face many challenges in the
realm of Electronic learning services. Nowadays, many researchers in the field
of learning and eLearning study curriculum planning, considering its complexity
and the various numbers of effective parameters. The success of a curriculum is
a multifaceted issue which needs analytical modelling for precise simulations
of the different learning scenarios. In this paper, parameters involved in the
learning process will be identified and a curriculum will be propounded.
Furthermore, a Curriculum model will be proposed using the behavior of the
user, based on the logs of the server. This model will estimate the success
rate of the users while taking courses. Authentic Bayesian networks have been
used for modelling. In order to evaluate the proposed model, the data of three
consecutive semesters of 117 MS IT Students of E-Learning Center of Amirkabir
University of Technology has been used. The assessment clarifies the effects of
various parameters on the success of curriculum planning.

 <dc:description>  This paper will present an evolution of a fuzzy agent based platform which
performed products configuration. As a first step, we used the notion of
consensus to establish robust results at the end of the configuration process.
We implemented the concept of generalized consensus which implied the
consideration of consensuses from the beginning, in this way robust data are
treated during the entire process and the final result enables the designer to
distinguish the robust components and flexible ones in a set of configurations.

 <dc:description>  Richomme, Saari and Zamboni (J. Lond. Math. Soc. 83: 79-95, 2011) proved that
at every position of a Sturmian word starts an abelian power of exponent $k$
for every $k &gt; 0$. We improve on this result by studying the maximum exponents
of abelian powers and abelian repetitions (an abelian repetition is an analogue
of a fractional power) in Sturmian words. We give a formula for computing the
maximum exponent of an abelian power of abelian period $m$ starting at a given
position in any Sturmian word of rotation angle $\alpha$. vAs an analogue of
the critical exponent, we introduce the abelian critical exponent $A(s_\alpha)$
of a Sturmian word $s_\alpha$ of angle $\alpha$ as the quantity $A(s_\alpha) =
limsup\ k_{m}/m=limsup\ k'_{m}/m$, where $k_{m}$ (resp. $k'_{m}$) denotes the
maximum exponent of an abelian power (resp.~of an abelian repetition) of
abelian period $m$ (the superior limits coincide for Sturmian words). We show
that $A(s_\alpha)$ equals the Lagrange constant of the number $\alpha$. This
yields a formula for computing $A(s_\alpha)$ in terms of the partial quotients
of the continued fraction expansion of $\alpha$. Using this formula, we prove
that $A(s_\alpha) \geq \sqrt{5}$ and that the equality holds for the Fibonacci
word. We further prove that $A(s_\alpha)$ is finite if and only if $\alpha$ has
bounded partial quotients, that is, if and only if $s_{\alpha}$ is
$\beta$-power-free for some real number $\beta$. Concerning the infinite
Fibonacci word, we prove that: i) The longest prefix that is an abelian
repetition of period $F_j$, $j&gt;1$, has length $F_j( F_{j+1}+F_{j-1} +1)-2$ if
$j$ is even or $F_j( F_{j+1}+F_{j-1} )-2$ if $j$ is odd, where $F_{j}$ is the
$j$th Fibonacci number; ii) The minimum abelian period of any factor is a
Fibonacci number. Further, we derive a formula for the minimum abelian periods
of the finite Fibonacci words

 <dc:description>  Due to the presence of buffers in the inner network nodes, each congestion
event leads to buffer queueing and thus to an increasing end-to-end delay. In
the case of delay sensitive applications, a large delay might not be acceptable
and a solution to properly manage congestion events while maintaining a low
end-to-end delay is required. Delay-based congestion algorithms are a viable
solution as they target to limit the experienced end-to-end delay.
Unfortunately, they do not perform well when sharing the bandwidth with
congestion control algorithms not regulated by delay constraints (e.g.,
loss-based algorithms). Our target is to fill this gap, proposing a novel
congestion control algorithm for delay-constrained communication over best
effort packet switched networks. The proposed algorithm is able to maintain a
bounded queueing delay when competing with other delay-based flows, and avoid
starvation when competing with loss-based flows. We adopt the well-known
price-based distributed mechanism as congestion control, but: 1) we introduce a
novel non-linear mapping between the experienced delay and the price function
and 2) we combine both delay and loss information into a single price term
based on packet interarrival measurements. We then provide a stability analysis
for our novel algorithm and we show its performance in the simulation results
carried out in the NS3 framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm is able to: achieve good intra-protocol fairness properties,
control efficiently the end-to-end delay, and finally, protect the flow from
starvation when other flows cause the queuing delay to grow excessively.

 <dc:description>  LTE/4G is the next generation of cellular network which specifically aims to
improve the network performance for data traffic and is currently being rolled
out by many network operators. We present results from an extensive LTE
measurement campaign in Dublin, Ireland using a custom performance measurement
tool. Performance data was measured at a variety of locations within the city
(including cell edge locations, indoors, outdoors etc) as well as for mobile
users on public transport within the city. Using this data we derive a model of
the characteristics of link layer RTT and bandwidth vs link signal strength.
This model is suited to use for performance evaluation of applications and
services, and since it is based on real measurements it allows realistic
evaluation of performance.

 <dc:title>A study on central soft sets: Definitions and basic operations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guan, Xuechong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a new kind of soft sets related with some common decision
making problems in real life called central soft sets is introduced. Properties
of some basic operations on central soft sets are shown. It is investigated
that some classic operations between soft sets can be obtained by central soft
sets with selecting different central sets. We initiate the concepts of an
evaluation system for a parameters set and its optional solutions. An algorithm
is presented to solve such decision making problems.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of determining the best answer in
Community-based Question Answering (CQA) websites by focussing on the content.
In particular, we present a system, ACQUA [http://acqua.kmi.open.ac.uk], that
can be installed onto the majority of browsers as a plugin. The service offers
a seamless and accurate prediction of the answer to be accepted. Previous
research on this topic relies on the exploitation of community feedback on the
answers, which involves rating of either users (e.g., reputation) or answers
(e.g. scores manually assigned to answers). We propose a new technique that
leverages the content/textual features of answers in a novel way. Our approach
delivers better results than related linguistics-based solutions and manages to
match rating-based approaches. More specifically, the gain in performance is
achieved by rendering the values of these features into a discretised form. We
also show how our technique manages to deliver equally good results in
real-time settings, as opposed to having to rely on information not always
readily available, such as user ratings and answer scores. We ran an evaluation
on 21 StackExchange websites covering around 4 million questions and more than
8 million answers. We obtain 84% average precision and 70% recall, which shows
that our technique is robust, effective, and widely applicable.

 <dc:description>  The well-known approach of Bose, Ray-Chaudhuri and Hocquenghem and its
generalization by Hartmann and Tzeng are lower bounds on the minimum distance
of simple-root cyclic codes. We generalize these two bounds to the case of
repeated-root cyclic codes and present a syndrome-based burst error decoding
algorithm with guaranteed decoding radius based on an associated folded cyclic
code. Furthermore, we present a third technique for bounding the minimum
Hamming distance based on the embedding of a given repeated-root cyclic code
into a repeated-root cyclic product code. A second quadratic-time probabilistic
burst error decoding procedure based on the third bound is outlined. Index
Terms Bound on the minimum distance, burst error, efficient decoding, folded
code, repeated-root cyclic code, repeated-root cyclic product code

 <dc:title>Reproducible and User-Controlled Software Environments in HPC with Guix</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Support teams of high-performance computing (HPC) systems often find
themselves between a rock and a hard place: on one hand, they understandably
administrate these large systems in a conservative way, but on the other hand,
they try to satisfy their users by deploying up-to-date tool chains as well as
libraries and scientific software. HPC system users often have no guarantee
that they will be able to reproduce results at a later point in time, even on
the same system-software may have been upgraded, removed, or recompiled under
their feet, and they have little hope of being able to reproduce the same
software environment elsewhere. We present GNU Guix and the functional package
management paradigm and show how it can improve reproducibility and sharing
among researchers with representative use cases.
