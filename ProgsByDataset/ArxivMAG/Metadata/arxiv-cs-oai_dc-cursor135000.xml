 <dc:description>  Heterogeneous ultra-dense network (HUDN) can significantly increase the
spectral efficiency of cellular networks and cater for the explosive growth of
data traffic in the fifth-generation (5G) communications. Due to the dense
deployment of small cells (SCs), interference among neighboring cells becomes
severe. As a result, the effective resource allocation and user association
algorithms are essential to minimize inter-cell interference and optimize
network performance. However, optimizing network resources in HUDN is extremely
complicated as resource allocation and user association are coupled. Therefore,
HUDN requires low-complexity but effective resource allocation schemes to
address these issues. Hypergraph theory has been recognized as a useful
mathematical tool to model the complex relations among multiple entities. In
this article, we show how the hypergraph models can be used to effectively
tackle resource allocation problems in HUDN. We also discuss several potential
research issues in this field.

 <dc:description>  Video popularity is an essential reference for optimizing resource allocation
and video recommendation in online video services. However, there is still no
convincing model that can accurately depict a video's popularity evolution. In
this paper, we propose a dynamic popularity model by modeling the video
information diffusion process driven by various forms of recommendation.
Through fitting the model with real traces collected from a practical system,
we can quantify the strengths of the recommendation forces. Such quantification
can lead to characterizing video popularity patterns, user behaviors and
recommendation strategies, which is illustrated by a case study of TV episodes.

 <dc:description>  We revisit the classic problem of proving safety over parameterised
concurrent systems, i.e., an infinite family of finite-state concurrent systems
that are represented by some finite (symbolic) means. An example of such an
infinite family is a dining philosopher protocol with any number n of processes
(n being the parameter that defines the infinite family). Regular model
checking is a well-known generic framework for modelling parameterised
concurrent systems, where an infinite set of configurations (resp. transitions)
is represented by a regular set (resp. regular transducer). Although verifying
safety properties in the regular model checking framework is undecidable in
general, many sophisticated semi-algorithms have been developed in the past
fifteen years that can successfully prove safety in many practical instances.
In this paper, we propose a simple solution to synthesise regular inductive
invariants that makes use of Angluin's classic L* algorithm (and its variants).
We provide a termination guarantee when the set of configurations reachable
from a given set of initial configurations is regular. We have tested L*
algorithm on standard (as well as new) examples in regular model checking
including the dining philosopher protocol, the dining cryptographer protocol,
and several mutual exclusion protocols (e.g. Bakery, Burns, Szymanski, and
German). Our experiments show that, despite the simplicity of our solution, it
can perform at least as well as existing semi-algorithms.

 <dc:description>  By exploiting the property that the RBM log-likelihood function is the
difference of convex functions, we formulate a stochastic variant of the
difference of convex functions (DC) programming to minimize the negative
log-likelihood. Interestingly, the traditional contrastive divergence algorithm
is a special case of the above formulation and the hyperparameters of the two
algorithms can be chosen such that the amount of computation per mini-batch is
identical. We show that for a given computational budget the proposed algorithm
almost always reaches a higher log-likelihood more rapidly, compared to the
standard contrastive divergence algorithm. Further, we modify this algorithm to
use the centered gradients and show that it is more efficient and effective
compared to the standard centered gradient algorithm on benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  Feature engineering is a crucial step in the process of predictive modeling.
It involves the transformation of given feature space, typically using
mathematical functions, with the objective of reducing the modeling error for a
given target. However, there is no well-defined basis for performing effective
feature engineering. It involves domain knowledge, intuition, and most of all,
a lengthy process of trial and error. The human attention involved in
overseeing this process significantly influences the cost of model generation.
We present a new framework to automate feature engineering. It is based on
performance driven exploration of a transformation graph, which systematically
and compactly enumerates the space of given options. A highly efficient
exploration strategy is derived through reinforcement learning on past
examples.

 <dc:title>Large Vocabulary Automatic Chord Estimation Using Deep Neural Nets:
  Design Framework, System Variations and Limitations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Deng, Junqi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kwok, Yu-Kwong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new system design framework for large vocabulary
automatic chord estimation. Our approach is based on an integration of
traditional sequence segmentation processes and deep learning chord
classification techniques. We systematically explore the design space of the
proposed framework for a range of parameters, namely deep neural nets, network
configurations, input feature representations, segment tiling schemes, and
training data sizes. Experimental results show that among the three proposed
deep neural nets and a baseline model, the recurrent neural network based
system has the best average chord quality accuracy that significantly
outperforms the other considered models. Furthermore, our bias-variance
analysis has identified a glass ceiling as a potential hindrance to future
improvements of large vocabulary automatic chord estimation systems.

 <dc:description>  The local model for differential privacy is emerging as the reference model
for practical applications collecting and sharing sensitive information while
satisfying strong privacy guarantees. In the local model, there is no trusted
entity which is allowed to have each individual's raw data as is assumed in the
traditional curator model for differential privacy. So, individuals' data are
usually perturbed before sharing them.
  We explore the design of private hypothesis tests in the local model, where
each data entry is perturbed to ensure the privacy of each participant.
Specifically, we analyze locally private chi-square tests for goodness of fit
and independence testing, which have been studied in the traditional, curator
model for differential privacy.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents SceneCut, a novel approach to jointly discover previously
unseen objects and non-object surfaces using a single RGB-D image. SceneCut's
joint reasoning over scene semantics and geometry allows a robot to detect and
segment object instances in complex scenes where modern deep learning-based
methods either fail to separate object instances, or fail to detect objects
that were not seen during training. SceneCut automatically decomposes a scene
into meaningful regions which either represent objects or scene surfaces. The
decomposition is qualified by an unified energy function over objectness and
geometric fitting. We show how this energy function can be optimized
efficiently by utilizing hierarchical segmentation trees. Moreover, we leverage
a pre-trained convolutional oriented boundary network to predict accurate
boundaries from images, which are used to construct high-quality region
hierarchies. We evaluate SceneCut on several different indoor environments, and
the results show that SceneCut significantly outperforms all the existing
methods.

 <dc:description>  The paper addresses the problem of computing maximal expected time to
termination of probabilistic timed automata (PTA) models, under the condition
that the system eventually terminates with probability one. The problem may
exhibit high computational complexity, in particular when the automaton under
analysis contains cycles that can be repeated with very high probabilities
(e.g. p =0.999). Such class of cycles can degrade the performance of the model
checking algorithm, as the probability to repeat the cycle converges to zero
arbitrary slow. We propose an acceleration technique which may be applied to
improve the execution of cycles by collapsing their iterations. The
acceleration process of a cyclic PTA consists of several complex formal steps
which are necessary to handle the cumulative timing and probability information
that result from successive executions of a cycle. The advantages of
acceleration are twofold. First, it helps to reduce the computational
complexity of the problem without adversely affecting the outcome of the
analysis. Second, it can bring the worst case execution time problem of PTAs
within the bound of feasibility for model checking. To our knowledge, this work
is the first that addresses the problem of accelerating execution of cycles
that exhibit both timing and probabilistic behavior.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies how to efficiently learn an optimal latent variable model
online from large streaming data. Latent variable models can explain the
observed data in terms of unobserved concepts. They are traditionally studied
in the unsupervised learning setting, and learned by iterative methods such as
the EM. Very few online learning algorithms for latent variable models have
been developed, and the most popular one is online EM. Though online EM is
computationally efficient, it typically converges to a local optimum. In this
work, we motivate and develop SpectralFPL, a novel algorithm to learn latent
variable models online from streaming data. SpectralFPL is computationally
efficient, and we prove that it quickly learns the global optimum under a
bag-of-words model by deriving an $O(\sqrt n)$ regret bound. Experiment results
also demonstrate a consistent performance improvement of SpectralFPL over
online EM: in both synthetic and real-world experiments, SpectralFPL's
performance is similar with or even better than online EM with optimally tuned
parameters.

controller, we train a deep neural network control policy to map raw,
high-dimensional observations to continuous steering and throttle commands, the
latter of which is essential to successfully drive on varied terrain at high
speed. Compared with recent approaches to similar tasks, our method requires
neither state estimation nor online planning to navigate the vehicle.
Real-world experimental results demonstrate successful autonomous off-road
driving, matching the state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  Self-sustainable communications based on advanced energy harvesting
technologies have been under rapid development, which facilitate autonomous
operation and energy-efficient transmission. Recently, ambient backscattering
that leverages existing RF signal resources in the air has been invented to
empower data communication among low-power devices. In this paper, we introduce
hybrid device-to-device (D2D) communications by integrating ambient
backscattering and wireless-powered communications. The hybrid D2D
communications are self-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is
required. However, since the radio signals for energy harvesting and
backscattering come from external RF sources, the performance of the hybrid D2D
communications needs to be optimized efficiently. As such, we design two mode
selection protocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible
adaptation to the environment. We then introduce analytical models to
characterize the impacts of the considered environment factors, e.g.,
distribution, spatial density, and transmission load of the ambient
transmitters, on the hybrid D2D communications performance. Extensive
simulations show that the repulsion factor among the ambient transmitters has a
non-trivial impact on the communication performance. Additionally, we reveal
how different mode selection protocols affect the performance metrics.

 <dc:title>A spatial scientometric analysis of the publication output of cities
  worldwide</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Csomos, Gyorgy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In tandem with the rapid globalisation of science, spatial scientometrics has
become an important research sub-field in scientometric studies. Recently,
numerous spatial scientometric contributions have focused on the examination of
cities' scientific output by using various scientometric indicators. In this
paper, I analyse cities' scientific output worldwide in terms of the number of
journal articles indexed by the Scopus database, in the period from 1986 to
2015. Furthermore, I examine which countries are the most important
collaborators of cities. Finally, I identify the most productive disciplines in
each city. I use GPS Visualizer to illustrate the scientometric data of nearly
2,200 cities on maps. Results show that cities with the highest scientific
output are mostly located in developed countries and China. Between 1986 and
2015, the greatest number of scientific articles were created in Beijing. The
international hegemony of the United States in science has been described by
many studies, and is also reinforced by the fact that the United States is the
most important collaborator to more than 75 percent of all cities. Medicine is
the most productive discipline in two-thirds of cities. Furthermore, cities
having the highest scientific output in specific disciplines show well-defined
geographical patterns.

 <dc:title>Convergence characteristics of the generalized residual cutting method</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The residual cutting (RC) method has been proposed for efficiently solving
linear equations obtained from elliptic partial differential equations. Based
on the RC, we have introduced the generalized residual cutting (GRC) method,
which can be applied to general sparse matrix problems. In this paper, we study
the mathematics of the GRC algorithm and and prove it is a Krylov subspace
method. Moreover, we show that it is deeply related to the conjugate residual
(CR) method and that GRC becomes equivalent to CR for symmetric matrices. Also,
in numerical experiments, GRC shows more robust convergence and needs less
memory compared to GMRES, for significantly larger matrix sizes.

 <dc:description>  Recently visual question answering (VQA) and visual question generation (VQG)
are two trending topics in the computer vision, which have been explored
separately. In this work, we propose an end-to-end unified framework, the
Invertible Question Answering Network (iQAN), to leverage the complementary
relations between questions and answers in images by jointly training the model
on VQA and VQG tasks. Corresponding parameter sharing scheme and regular terms
are proposed as constraints to explicitly leverage Q,A's dependencies to guide
the training process. After training, iQAN can take either question or answer
as input, then output the counterpart. Evaluated on the large-scale visual
question answering datasets CLEVR and VQA2, our iQAN improves the VQA accuracy
over the baselines. We also show the dual learning framework of iQAN can be
generalized to other VQA architectures and consistently improve the results
over both the VQA and VQG tasks.

 <dc:description>  Heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs) composed of densely deployed base
stations of different types with various radio access technologies have become
a prevailing trend to accommodate ever-increasing traffic demand in enormous
volume. Nowadays, users rely heavily on HWNs for ubiquitous network access that
contains valuable and critical information such as financial transactions,
e-health, and public safety. Cyber risks, representing one of the most
significant threats to network security and reliability, are increasing in
severity. To address this problem, this article introduces the concept of cyber
insurance to transfer the cyber risk (i.e., service outage, as a consequence of
cyber risks in HWNs) to a third party insurer. Firstly, a review of the
enabling technologies for HWNs and their vulnerabilities to cyber risks is
presented. Then, the fundamentals of cyber insurance are introduced, and
subsequently, a cyber insurance framework for HWNs is presented. Finally, open
issues are discussed and the challenges are highlighted for integrating cyber
insurance as a service of next generation HWNs.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the question of emotion classification. The task
consists in predicting emotion labels (taken among a set of possible labels)
best describing the emotions contained in short video clips. Building on a
standard framework -- lying in describing videos by audio and visual features
used by a supervised classifier to infer the labels -- this paper investigates
several novel directions. First of all, improved face descriptors based on 2D
and 3D Convo-lutional Neural Networks are proposed. Second, the paper explores
several fusion methods, temporal and multimodal, including a novel hierarchical
method combining features and scores. In addition, we carefully reviewed the
different stages of the pipeline and designed a CNN architecture adapted to the
task; this is important as the size of the training set is small compared to
the difficulty of the problem, making generalization difficult. The so-obtained
model ranked 4th at the 2017 Emotion in the Wild challenge with the accuracy of
58.8 %.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised image segmentation and denoising are two fundamental tasks in
image processing. Usually, graph based models such as multicut are used for
segmentation and variational models are employed for denoising. Our approach
addresses both problems at the same time. We propose a novel ILP formulation of
the first derivative Potts model with the $\ell_1$ data term, where binary
variables are introduced to deal with the $\ell_0$ norm of the regularization
term. The ILP is then solved by a standard off-the-shelf MIP solver. Numerical
experiments are compared with the multicut problem.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a general approach to automatically visual-servo
control the position and shape of a deformable object whose deformation
parameters are unknown. The servo-control is achieved by online learning a
model mapping between the robotic end-effector's movement and the object's
deformation measurement. The model is learned using the Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR) to deal with its highly nonlinear property, and once learned,
the model is used for predicting the required control at each time step. To
overcome GPR's high computational cost while dealing with long manipulation
sequences, we implement a fast online GPR by selectively removing uninformative
observation data from the regression process. We validate the performance of
our controller on a set of deformable object manipulation tasks and demonstrate
that our method can achieve effective and accurate servo-control for general
deformable objects with a wide variety of goal settings. Experiment videos are

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the positions of human
joints, i.e., articulated pose estimation. Recent state-of-the-art solutions
model two key issues, joint detection and spatial configuration refinement,
together using convolutional neural networks. Our work mainly focuses on
spatial configuration refinement by reducing variations of human poses
statistically, which is motivated by the observation that the scattered
distribution of the relative locations of joints e.g., the left wrist is
distributed nearly uniformly in a circular area around the left shoulder) makes
the learning of convolutional spatial models hard. We present a two-stage
normalization scheme, human body normalization and limb normalization, to make
the distribution of the relative joint locations compact, resulting in easier
learning of convolutional spatial models and more accurate pose estimation. In
addition, our empirical results show that incorporating multi-scale supervision
and multi-scale fusion into the joint detection network is beneficial.
Experiment results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning algorithms offer a powerful means to automatically analyze the
content of medical images. However, many biological samples of interest are
primarily transparent to visible light and contain features that are difficult
to resolve with a standard optical microscope. Here, we use a convolutional
neural network (CNN) not only to classify images, but also to optimize the
physical layout of the imaging device itself. We increase the classification
accuracy of a microscope's recorded images by merging an optical model of image
formation into the pipeline of a CNN. The resulting network simultaneously
determines an ideal illumination arrangement to highlight important sample
features during image acquisition, along with a set of convolutional weights to
classify the detected images post-capture. We demonstrate our joint
optimization technique with an experimental microscope configuration that
automatically identifies malaria-infected cells with 5-10% higher accuracy than
standard and alternative microscope lighting designs.

 <dc:description>  Swarm systems constitute a challenging problem for reinforcement learning
(RL) as the algorithm needs to learn decentralized control policies that can
cope with limited local sensing and communication abilities of the agents.
Although there have been recent advances of deep RL algorithms applied to
multi-agent systems, learning communication protocols while simultaneously
learning the behavior of the agents is still beyond the reach of deep RL
algorithms. However, while it is often difficult to directly define the
behavior of the agents, simple communication protocols can be defined more
easily using prior knowledge about the given task. In this paper, we propose a
number of simple communication protocols that can be exploited by deep
reinforcement learning to find decentralized control policies in a multi-robot
swarm environment. The protocols are based on histograms that encode the local
neighborhood relations of the agents and can also transmit task-specific
information, such as the shortest distance and direction to a desired target.
In our framework, we use an adaptation of Trust Region Policy Optimization to
learn complex collaborative tasks, such as formation building, building a
communication link, and pushing an intruder. We evaluate our findings in a
simulated 2D-physics environment, and compare the implications of different
communication protocols.

 <dc:description>  There are several AD tools available, which all implement different
strategies for the reverse mode of AD. The major strategies are primal value
taping (implemented e.g. by ADOL-c) and Jacobi taping (implemented e.g. by
adept and dco/c++). Especially for Jacobi taping, recent advances by using
expression templates make this approach very attractive for large scale
software. The current implementations are either closed source or miss
essential features and flexibility. Therefore, we present the new AD tool
CoDiPack (Code Differentiation Package) in this paper. It is specifically
designed for a minimal memory consumption and optimal runtime, such that it can
be used for the differentiation of large scale software. An essential part of
the design of CoDiPack is the modular layout and the recursive data structures,
which do not only allow the efficient implementation of the Jacobi taping
approach, but will also enable other approaches like the primal value taping or
new research ideas. We will also present the performance value of CoDiPack on a
generic PDE example and on the SU2 code.

 <dc:title>Satisfiability Modulo Theory based Methodology for Floorplanning in VLSI

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a Satisfiability Modulo Theory based formulation for
floorplanning in VLSI circuits. The proposed approach allows a number of fixed
blocks to be placed within a layout region without overlapping and at the same
time minimizing the area of the layout region. The proposed approach is
extended to allow a number of fixed blocks with ability to rotate and flexible
blocks (with variable width and height) to be placed within a layout without
overlap. Our target in all cases is reduction in area occupied on a chip which
is of vital importance in obtaining a good circuit design. Satisfiability
Modulo Theory combines the problem of Boolean satisfiability with domains such
as convex optimization. Satisfiability Modulo Theory provides a richer modeling
language than is possible with pure Boolean SAT formulas. We have conducted our
experiments on MCNC and GSRC benchmark circuits to calculate the total area
occupied, amount of deadspace and the total CPU time consumed while placing the
blocks without overlapping. The results obtained shows clearly that the amount
of dead space or wasted space is reduced if rotation is applied to the blocks.

 <dc:description>  Light scattered from multiple surfaces can be used to retrieve information of
hidden environments. However, full three-dimensional retrieval of an object
hidden from view by a wall has only been achieved with scanning systems and
requires intensive computational processing of the retrieved data. Here we use
a non-scanning, single-photon single-pixel detector in combination with an
artificial neural network: this allows us to locate the position and to also
simultaneously provide the actual identity of a hidden person, chosen from a
database of people (N=3). Artificial neural networks applied to specific
computational imaging problems can therefore enable novel imaging capabilities
with hugely simplified hardware and processing times

 <dc:description>  We present a sorting algorithm for the case of recurrent random comparison
errors. The algorithm essentially achieves simultaneously good properties of
previous algorithms for sorting $n$ distinct elements in this model. In
particular, it runs in $O(n^2)$ time, the maximum dislocation of the elements
in the output is $O(\log n)$, while the total dislocation is $O(n)$. These
guarantees are the best possible since we prove that even randomized algorithms
cannot achieve $o(\log n)$ maximum dislocation with high probability, or $o(n)$
total dislocation in expectation, regardless of their running time.

 <dc:description>  This work presents the evolution of a solution for predictive maintenance to
a Big Data environment. The proposed adaptation aims for predicting failures on
wind turbines using a data-driven solution deployed in the cloud and which is
composed by three main modules. (i) A predictive model generator which
generates predictive models for each monitored wind turbine by means of Random
Forest algorithm. (ii) A monitoring agent that makes predictions every 10
minutes about failures in wind turbines during the next hour. Finally, (iii) a
dashboard where given predictions can be visualized. To implement the solution
Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Mesos and HDFS have been used. Therefore, we
have improved the previous work in terms of data process speed, scalability and
automation. In addition, we have provided fault-tolerant functionality with a
centralized access point from where the status of all the wind turbines of a
company localized all over the world can be monitored, reducing O&amp;M costs.

 <dc:title>Revisiting Resolution and Inter-Layer Coupling Factors in Modularity for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Modularity for multilayer networks, also called multislice modularity, is
parametric to a resolution factor and an inter-layer coupling factor. The
former is useful to express layer-specific relevance and the latter quantifies
the strength of node linkage across the layers of a network. However, such
parameters can be set arbitrarily, thus discarding any structure information at
graph or community level. Other issues are related to the inability of properly
modeling order relations over the layers, which is required for dynamic
networks.
  In this paper we propose a new definition of modularity for multilayer
networks that aims to overcome major issues of existing multislice modularity.
We revise the role and semantics of the layer-specific resolution and
inter-layer coupling terms, and define parameter-free unsupervised approaches
for their computation, by using information from the within-layer and
inter-layer structures of the communities. Moreover, our formulation of
multilayer modularity is general enough to account for an available ordering of
the layers and relating constraints on layer coupling. Experimental evaluation
was conducted using three state-of-the-art methods for multilayer community
detection and nine real-world multilayer networks. Results have shown the
significance of our modularity, disclosing the effects of different
combinations of the resolution and inter-layer coupling functions. This work
can pave the way for the development of new optimization methods for
discovering community structures in multilayer networks.

 <dc:title>A Communication-Efficient Distributed Data Structure for Top-k and

 <dc:description>  We consider the scenario of $n$ sensor nodes observing streams of data. The
nodes are connected to a central server whose task it is to compute some
function over all data items observed by the nodes. In our case, there exists a
total order on the data items observed by the nodes. Our goal is to compute the
$k$ currently lowest observed values or a value with rank in
$[(1-\varepsilon)k,(1+\varepsilon)k]$ with probability $(1-\delta)$. We propose
solutions for these problems in an extension of the distributed monitoring
model where the server can send broadcast messages to all nodes for unit cost.
We want to minimize communication over multiple time steps where there are $m$
updates to a node's value in between queries. The result is composed of two
main parts, which each may be of independent interest: (1) Protocols which
answer Top-k and k-Select queries. These protocols are memoryless in the sense
that they gather all information at the time of the request. (2) A dynamic data
structure which tracks for every $k$ an element close to $k$.
  We describe how to combine the two parts to receive a protocol answering the
stated queries over multiple time steps. Overall, for Top-$k$ queries we use
$O(k + \log m + \log \log n)$ and for $k$-Select queries
$O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} + \log m + \log^2 \log n)$
messages in expectation. These results are shown to be asymptotically tight if
$m$ is not too small.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the number of papers on Alzheimer's disease classification
has increased dramatically, generating interesting methodological ideas on the
use machine learning and feature extraction methods. However, practical impact
is much more limited and, eventually, one could not tell which of these
approaches are the most efficient. While over 90\% of these works make use of
ADNI an objective comparison between approaches is impossible due to variations
in the subjects included, image pre-processing, performance metrics and
cross-validation procedures. In this paper, we propose a framework for
reproducible classification experiments using multimodal MRI and PET data from
ADNI. The core components are: 1) code to automatically convert the full ADNI
database into BIDS format; 2) a modular architecture based on Nipype in order
to easily plug-in different classification and feature extraction tools; 3)
feature extraction pipelines for MRI and PET data; 4) baseline classification
approaches for unimodal and multimodal features. This provides a flexible
framework for benchmarking different feature extraction and classification
tools in a reproducible manner. We demonstrate its use on all (1519) baseline
T1 MR images and all (1102) baseline FDG PET images from ADNI 1, GO and 2 with
SPM-based feature extraction pipelines and three different classification
techniques (linear SVM, anatomically regularized SVM and multiple kernel
learning SVM). The highest accuracies achieved were: 91% for AD vs CN, 83% for
MCIc vs CN, 75% for MCIc vs MCInc, 94% for AD-A$\beta$+ vs CN-A$\beta$- and 72%
for MCIc-A$\beta$+ vs MCInc-A$\beta$+. The code is publicly available at
https://gitlab.icm-institute.org/aramislab/AD-ML (depends on the Clinica
software platform, publicly available at http://www.clinica.run).

 <dc:description>  We extend quantum Stein's lemma in asymmetric quantum hypothesis testing to
composite null and alternative hypotheses. As our main result, we show that the
asymptotic error exponent for testing convex combinations of quantum states
$\rho^{\otimes n}$ against convex combinations of quantum states
$\sigma^{\otimes n}$ is given by a regularized quantum relative entropy
distance formula. We prove that in general such a regularization is needed but
also discuss various settings where our formula as well as extensions thereof
become single-letter. This includes a novel operational interpretation of the
relative entropy of coherence in terms of hypothesis testing. For our proof, we
start from the composite Stein's lemma for classical probability distributions
and lift the result to the non-commutative setting by only using elementary
properties of quantum entropy. Finally, our findings also imply an improved
Markov type lower bound on the quantum conditional mutual information in terms
of the regularized quantum relative entropy - featuring an explicit and
universal recovery map.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a recently proposed approach to multizone sound field
synthesis, referred to as Joint Pressure and Velocity Matching (JPVM), is
investigated analytically using a spherical harmonics representation of the
sound field. The approach is motivated by the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral
equation and aims at controlling the sound field inside the local listening
zones by evoking the sound pressure and particle velocity on surrounding
contours. Based on the findings of the modal analysis, an improved version of
JPVM is proposed which provides both better performance and lower complexity.
In particular, it is shown analytically that the optimization of the tangential
component of the particle velocity vector, as is done in the original JPVM
approach, is very susceptible to errors and thus not pursued anymore. The
analysis furthermore provides fundamental insights as to how the spherical
harmonics used to describe the 3D variant sound field translate into 2D basis
functions as observed on the contours surrounding the zones. By means of
simulations, it is verified that discarding the tangential component of the
particle velocity vector ultimately leads to an improved performance. Finally,
the impact of sensor noise on the reproduction performance is assessed.

interpolation is presented. The framework is motivated by the local nature of
both tangential interpolation and H2-optimal approxi- mations. The main
advantage is given by a decoupling of the cost of optimization from the cost of
reduction, resulting in a significant speedup in H2-optimal reduction. In
addition, a middle-sized surrogate model is produced at no additional cost and
can be used e.g. for error estimation. Numerical examples illustrate the new
framework, showing its effectiveness in producing H2-optimal reduced models at
a far lower cost than conventional algorithms. The paper ends with a brief
discussion on how the idea behind the framework can be extended to approximate
further system classes, thus showing that this truly is a general framework for
interpolatory H2 reduction rather than just an additional reduction algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Hybrid beamforming provides a promising solution to achieve high data rate
transmission at millimeter waves. To implement the hybrid beamforming at the
transceiver, a common solution is to decouple the transmitter and receiver
functions and then optimize them separately based on given channel state
information. However, many references ignore the complexity of the
high-dimensional channel estimation problem or the effort for the subsequent
step of computing the singular value decomposition of a large channel matrix.
To this end, we present a low-complexity scheme that exploits implicit channel
knowledge to facilitate the design of hybrid beamforming for
frequency-selective fading channels. The implicit channel knowledge can be
interpreted as a coupling of the channel and all pairs of possible analog
beamforming vectors at the transmitter and receiver, and it is obtained by
receiving the transmitted pilots. Based on the received pilots, different
effective channel matrices are constructed in the sense that the matrix
elements are essentially the coupling coefficients. Instead of calculating
mutual information, we use the Frobenius norm of the effective channel as a key
parameter of the hybrid beamforming gain. As a result, the complicated hybrid
beamforming problem becomes a much simpler one: it amounts to trying different
sets of the large-power received pilots to construct multiple alternatives for
the effective channel matrix. Then, the set yielding the largest Frobenius norm
provides the solution to the hybrid beamforming problem.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the Arabic MGB-3 Challenge - Arabic Speech Recognition
in the Wild. Unlike last year's Arabic MGB-2 Challenge, for which the
recognition task was based on more than 1,200 hours broadcast TV news
recordings from Aljazeera Arabic TV programs, MGB-3 emphasises dialectal Arabic
using a multi-genre collection of Egyptian YouTube videos. Seven genres were
used for the data collection: comedy, cooking, family/kids, fashion, drama,
sports, and science (TEDx). A total of 16 hours of videos, split evenly across
the different genres, were divided into adaptation, development and evaluation
data sets. The Arabic MGB-Challenge comprised two tasks: A) Speech
transcription, evaluated on the MGB-3 test set, along with the 10 hour MGB-2
test set to report progress on the MGB-2 evaluation; B) Arabic dialect
identification, introduced this year in order to distinguish between four major
Arabic dialects - Egyptian, Levantine, North African, Gulf, as well as Modern
Standard Arabic. Two hours of audio per dialect were released for development
and a further two hours were used for evaluation. For dialect identification,
both lexical features and i-vector bottleneck features were shared with
participants in addition to the raw audio recordings. Overall, thirteen teams
submitted ten systems to the challenge. We outline the approaches adopted in
each system, and summarise the evaluation results.

 <dc:title>Secure Energy Efficiency Optimization for MISO Cognitive Radio Network
  with Energy Harvesting</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a secure energy efficiency (SEE) optimization problem
in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) underlay cognitive radio (CR) network.
In particular, a multi-antenna secondary transmitter (SU-Tx) simultaneously
sends secured information and energy to a secondary receiver (SU-Rx) and an
energy receiver (ER), respectively, in the presence of a primary receiver
(PU-Rx). It is assumed that the SU-Rx, ER and PU-Rx are each equipped with a
single antenna. In addition, the SU-Tx should satisfy constraints on maximum
interference leakage to the PU-Rx and minimum harvested energy at the ER. In
this CR network, we consider the transmit covariance matrix design with the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the SU-Tx. In
addition, it is assumed that the ER is a potential passive eavesdropper due to
broadcast nature of wireless transmission. On the other hand, we consider the
worst-case scenario that ER's energy harvesting requirement is only satisfied
when it performs only energy harvesting without intercepting or eavesdropping
information intended for the SU-Rx. We formulate this transmit covariance
matrix design as a SEE maximization problem which is a non-convex problem due
the non-linear fractional objective function. To realize the solution for this
non-convex problem, we utilize the non-linear fractional programming and
difference of concave (DC) functions approaches to reformulate into a tractable
form. Based on these techniques and the Dinkelbach's method, we propose
iterative algorithms to determine the solution for the original SEE
maximization problem. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed transmit covariance matrix design and
convergence of the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:title>Comparing the Switch and Curveball Markov Chains for Sampling Binary
  Matrices with Fixed Marginals</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Carstens, Corrie Jacobien</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kleer, Pieter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Curveball algorithm is a variation on well-known switch-based Markov
chain approaches for uniformly sampling binary matrices with fixed row and
column sums. Instead of a switch, the Curveball algorithm performs a so-called
binomial trade in every iteration of the algorithm. Intuitively, this could
lead to a better convergence rate for reaching the stationary (uniform)
distribution in certain cases. Some experimental evidence for this has been
given in the literature. In this note we give a spectral gap comparison between
two switch-based chains and the Curveball chain. In particular, this comparison
allows us to conclude that the Curveball Markov chain is rapidly mixing
whenever one of the two switch chains is rapidly mixing. Our analysis directly
extends to the case of sampling binary matrices with forbidden entries (under
the assumption of irreducibility). This in particular captures the case of
sampling simple directed graphs with given degrees. As a by-product of our
analysis, we show that the switch Markov chain of the Kannan-Tetali-Vempala
conjecture only has non-negative eigenvalues if the sampled binary matrices
have at least three columns. This shows that the Markov chain does not have to
be made lazy, which is of independent interest. We also obtain an improved
bound on the smallest eigenvalue for the switch Markov chain studied by
Greenhill for uniformly sampling simple directed regular graphs.

 <dc:description>  Social networks and interactions in social media involve both positive and
negative relationships. Signed graphs capture both types of relationships:
positive edges correspond to pairs of &quot;friends&quot;, and negative edges to pairs of
&quot;foes&quot;. The edge sign prediction problem, that aims to predict whether an
interaction between a pair of nodes will be positive or negative, is an
important graph mining task for which many heuristics have recently been
proposed [Leskovec 2010].
  We model the edge sign prediction problem as follows: we are allowed to query
any pair of nodes whether they belong to the same cluster or not, but the
answer to the query is corrupted with some probability $0&lt;q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. Let
$\delta=1-2q$ be the bias. We provide an algorithm that recovers all signs
correctly with high probability in the presence of noise for any constant gap
$\delta$ with $O(\frac{n\log n}{\delta^4})$ queries. Our algorithm uses breadth
first search as its main algorithmic primitive. A byproduct of our proposed
learning algorithm is the use of $s-t$ paths as an informative feature to
predict the sign of the edge $(s,t)$. As a heuristic, we use edge disjoint
$s-t$ paths of short length as a feature for predicting edge signs in
real-world signed networks. Our findings suggest that the use of paths improves
the classification accuracy, especially for pairs of nodes with no common
neighbors.

 <dc:description>  Cyclic pursuit frameworks provide an efficient way to create useful global
behaviors out of pairwise interactions in a collective of autonomous robots.
Earlier work studied cyclic pursuit with a constant bearing (CB) pursuit law,
and has demonstrated the existence of a variety of interesting behaviors for
the corresponding dynamics. In this work, by attaching multiple branches to a
single cycle, we introduce a modified version of this framework which allows us
to consider any weakly connected pursuit graph where each node has an outdegree
of 1. This provides a further generalization of the cyclic pursuit setting.
Then, after showing existence of relative equilibria (rectilinear or circling
motion), pure shape equilibria (spiraling motion) and periodic orbits, we also
derive necessary conditions for stability of a 3-agent collective. By paving a
way for individual agents to join or leave a collective without perturbing the
motion of others, our approach leads to improved reliability of the overall
system.

(&quot;is a given subsumption entailed by the target ontology?&quot;) and equivalence
queries (&quot;is a given ontology equivalent to the target ontology?&quot;). We present
three main results: (1) ontologies formulated in (two relevant versions of) the
description logic DL-Lite can be learned with polynomially many queries of
polynomial size; (2) this is not the case for ontologies formulated in the
description logic EL, even when only acyclic ontologies are admitted; and (3)
ontologies formulated in a fragment of EL related to the web ontology language
OWL 2 RL can be learned in polynomial time. We also show that neither
membership nor equivalence queries alone are sufficient in cases (1) and (3).

more than 250K high-resolution video frames, all annotated with ground-truth
data for both low-level and high-level vision tasks, including optical flow,
semantic instance segmentation, object detection and tracking, object-level 3D
scene layout, and visual odometry. Ground-truth data for all tasks is available
for every frame. The data was collected while driving, riding, and walking a
total of 184 kilometers in diverse ambient conditions in a realistic virtual
world. To create the benchmark, we have developed a new approach to collecting
ground-truth data from simulated worlds without access to their source code or

 <dc:description>  We propose AffordanceNet, a new deep learning approach to simultaneously
detect multiple objects and their affordances from RGB images. Our
AffordanceNet has two branches: an object detection branch to localize and
classify the object, and an affordance detection branch to assign each pixel in
the object to its most probable affordance label. The proposed framework
employs three key components for effectively handling the multiclass problem in
the affordance mask: a sequence of deconvolutional layers, a robust resizing
strategy, and a multi-task loss function. The experimental results on the
public datasets show that our AffordanceNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art
methods by a fair margin, while its end-to-end architecture allows the
inference at the speed of 150ms per image. This makes our AffordanceNet is well
suitable for real-time robotic applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of AffordanceNet in different testing environments and in real
robotic applications. The source code is available at

 <dc:description>  Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. To assist doctors
in hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment planning, an accurate and
automatic liver and tumor segmentation method is highly demanded in the
clinical practice. Recently, fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs),
including 2D and 3D FCNs, serve as the back-bone in many volumetric image
segmentation. However, 2D convolutions can not fully leverage the spatial
information along the third dimension while 3D convolutions suffer from high
computational cost and GPU memory consumption. To address these issues, we
propose a novel hybrid densely connected UNet (H-DenseUNet), which consists of
a 2D DenseUNet for efficiently extracting intra-slice features and a 3D
counterpart for hierarchically aggregating volumetric contexts under the spirit
of the auto-context algorithm for liver and tumor segmentation. We propose a
new training strategy by formulating the learning process of H-DenseUNet in an
end-to-end manner, where the intra-slice representations and inter-slice
features can be jointly optimized through a hybrid feature fusion (HFF) layer.
We extensively evaluated our method on the dataset of MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor
Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge. Our method outperformed other state-of-the-arts
on the segmentation results of tumors and achieved very competitive performance
for liver segmentation even with a single model.

optimal control problems in the minimax sense for nonlinear, continuous-state,
discrete-time plants. The problem class includes entry-(exit-)time problems as
well as minimum time, pursuit-evasion and reach-avoid games as special cases.
We utilize auxiliary optimal control problems (&quot;abstractions&quot;) to compute both
upper bounds of the value function, i.e., of the achievable closed-loop
performance, and symbolic feedback controllers realizing those bounds. The
abstractions are obtained from discretizing the problem data, and we prove that
the computed bounds and the performance of the symbolic controllers converge to
the value function as the discretization parameters approach zero. In
particular, if the optimal control problem is solvable on some compact subset
of the state space, and if the discretization parameters are sufficiently
small, then we obtain a symbolic feedback controller solving the problem on
that subset. These results do not assume the continuity of the value function
or any problem data, and they fully apply in the presence of hard state and
control constraints.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of instance segmentation in biological images with
crowded and compact cells. We formulate this task as an integer program where
variables correspond to cells and constraints enforce that cells do not
overlap. To solve this integer program, we propose a column generation
formulation where the pricing program is solved via exact optimization of very
small scale integer programs. Column generation is tightened using odd set
inequalities which fit elegantly into pricing problem optimization. Our column
generation approach achieves fast stable anytime inference for our instance
segmentation problems. We demonstrate on three distinct light microscopy
datasets, with several hundred cells each, that our proposed algorithm rapidly
achieves or exceeds state of the art accuracy.

 <dc:description>  The Normalized Relative Compression is a recent dissimilarity metric, related
to the Kolmogorov Complexity. It has been successfully used in different
applications, like DNA sequences, images or even ECG (electrocardiographic)
signal. It uses a reference based compressor to represent a string and
compresses a target string using that reference. One possible approach is to
use finite-context models (\textrm{FCM}s) to represent the strings.
  A finite-context model (\textrm{FCM}) calculates the probability distribution
of the next symbol, given the previous $k$ symbols. In this paper, we introduce
a generalization of the \textrm{FCM}s, called extended finite-context models
(\textrm{xaFCM}), that calculate the probability of occurrence of the next $d$
symbols, given the previous $k$ symbols.
  As a testbed application, we show the results for performing ECG biometric
identification, using an ECG database previously used in other studies for ECG
biometric identification. The results show that often \textrm{xaFCM}s
outperform \textrm{FCM}s in accuracy ratios, using less memory, to represent
the models, and less computational time.

 <dc:description>  Drone base stations (DBSs) can enhance network coverage and area capacity by
moving supply towards demand when required. This degree of freedom could be
especially useful for future applications with extreme demands, such as ultra
reliable and low latency communications (uRLLC). However, deployment of DBSs
can face several challenges. One issue is finding the 3D placement of such BSs
to satisfy dynamic requirements of the system. Second, the availability of
reliable wireless backhaul links and the related resource allocation are
principal issues that should be considered. Finally, association of the users
with BSs becomes an involved problem due to mobility of DBSs. In this paper, we
consider a macro-BS (MBS) and several DBSs that rely on the wireless links to
the MBS for backhauling. Considering regular and uRLLC users, we propose an
algorithm to find efficient 3D locations of DBSs in addition to the user-BS
associations and wireless backhaul bandwidth allocations to maximize the sum
logarithmic rate of the users. To this end, a decomposition method is employed
to first find the user-BS association and bandwidth allocations. Then DBS
locations are updated using a heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm.
Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide
useful insights on the effects of traffic distributions and antenna beamwidth.

 <dc:description>  Estimation of semantic similarity and relatedness between biomedical concepts
has utility for many informatics applications. Automated methods fall into two
categories: methods based on distributional statistics drawn from text corpora,
and methods using the structure of existing knowledge resources. Methods in the
former category disregard taxonomic structure, while those in the latter fail
to consider semantically relevant empirical information. In this paper, we
present a method that retrofits distributional context vector representations
of biomedical concepts using structural information from the UMLS
Metathesaurus, such that the similarity between vector representations of
linked concepts is augmented. We evaluated it on the UMNSRS benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that retrofitting of concept vector representations leads
to better correlation with human raters for both similarity and relatedness,
surpassing the best results reported to date. They also demonstrate a clear
improvement in performance on this reference standard for retrofitted vector
representations, as compared to those without retrofitting.

 <dc:description>  Suzuki and Niida (Ann. Pure. Appl. Logic, 2015) showed the following results
on independent distributions (IDs) on an AND-OR tree, where they took only
depth-first algorithms into consideration. (1) Among IDs such that probability
of the root having value 0 is fixed as a given r such that 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, if d is a
maximizer of cost of the best algorithm then d is an independent and identical
distribution (IID). (2) Among all IDs, if d is a maximizer of cost of the best
algorithm then d is an IID. In the case where non-depth-first algorithms are
taken into consideration, the counter parts of (1) and (2) are left open in the
above work. Peng et al. (Inform. Process. Lett., 2017) extended (1) and (2) to
multi-branching trees, where in (2) they put an additional hypothesis on IDs
that probability of the root having value 0 is neither 0 nor 1. We give
positive answers for the two questions of Suzuki-Niida. A key to the proof is
that if ID d achieves the equilibrium among IDs then we can chose an algorithm
of the best cost against d from depth-first algorithms. In addition, we extend
the result of Peng et al. to the case where non-depth-first algorithms are
taken into consideration.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) produce systematically better quality
samples when class label information is provided., i.e. in the conditional GAN
setup. This is still observed for the recently proposed Wasserstein GAN
formulation which stabilized adversarial training and allows considering high
capacity network architectures such as ResNet. In this work we show how to
boost conditional GAN by augmenting available class labels. The new classes
come from clustering in the representation space learned by the same GAN model.
The proposed strategy is also feasible when no class information is available,
i.e. in the unsupervised setup. Our generated samples reach state-of-the-art
Inception scores for CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets in both supervised and
unsupervised setup.

 <dc:title>Multi-label Pixelwise Classification for Reconstruction of Large-scale
  Urban Areas</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Object classification is one of the many holy grails in computer vision and
as such has resulted in a very large number of algorithms being proposed
already. Specifically in recent years there has been considerable progress in
this area primarily due to the increased efficiency and accessibility of deep
learning techniques. In fact, for single-label object classification [i.e. only
one object present in the image] the state-of-the-art techniques employ deep
neural networks and are reporting very close to human-like performance. There
are specialized applications in which single-label object-level classification
will not suffice; for example in cases where the image contains multiple
intertwined objects of different labels.
  In this paper, we address the complex problem of multi-label pixelwise
classification. We present our distinct solution based on a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for performing multi-label pixelwise classification and
its application to large-scale urban reconstruction. A supervised learning
approach is followed for training a 13-layer CNN using both LiDAR and satellite
images. An empirical study has been conducted to determine the hyperparameters
which result in the optimal performance of the CNN. Scale invariance is
introduced by training the network on five different scales of the input and
labeled data. This results in six pixelwise classifications for each different
scale. An SVM is then trained to map the six pixelwise classifications into a
single-label. Lastly, we refine boundary pixel labels using graph-cuts for
maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation with Markov Random Field (MRF) priors.
The resulting pixelwise classification is then used to accurately extract and
reconstruct the buildings in large-scale urban areas. The proposed approach has
been extensively tested and the results are reported.

 <dc:title>Geometric SMOTE: Effective oversampling for imbalanced learning through

 <dc:creator>Douzas, Georgios</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Classification of imbalanced datasets is a challenging task for standard
algorithms. Although many methods exist to address this problem in different
ways, generating artificial data for the minority class is a more general
approach compared to algorithmic modifications. SMOTE algorithm and its
variations generate synthetic samples along a line segment that joins minority
class instances. In this paper we propose Geometric SMOTE (G-SMOTE) as a
generalization of the SMOTE data generation mechanism. G-SMOTE generates
synthetic samples in a geometric region of the input space, around each
selected minority instance. While in the basic configuration this region is a
hyper-sphere, G-SMOTE allows its deformation to a hyper-spheroid and finally to
a line segment, emulating, in the last case, the SMOTE mechanism. The
performance of G-SMOTE is compared against multiple standard oversampling
algorithms. We present empirical results that show a significant improvement in
the quality of the generated data when G-SMOTE is used as an oversampling
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Automatic urban land cover classification is a classical problem in remote
sensing and good urban land cover maps build the foundation for many tasks,
such as e.g. environmental monitoring. It is a particularly challenging
problem, as classes generally have high inter-class and low intra-class
variance. A common technique to improve urban land cover classification
performance in remote sensing is the fusing of data from different sensors with
different data modalities. However, all modalities are rarely available for all
test data, and this missing data problem poses severe challenges for
multi-modal learning. Inspired by recent successes in deep learning, we propose
as a remedy a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for urban remote
sensing image segmentation trained on data modalities which are not all
available at test time. We train our architecture with a cost function
particularly suited for imbalanced classes, as this is a frequent problem in
remote sensing, especially in urban areas. We demonstrate the method using two
benchmark datasets, both consisting of optical and digital surface model (DSM)
images. We simulate missing data, by assuming that the DSM images are missing
during testing and show that our method outperforms both CNNs trained on
optical images as well as an ensemble of two CNNs trained only on optical
images. We further evaluate the potential of our method to handle situations
where only some DSM images are missing during training and show that we can
clearly exploit training time information of the missing modality during
testing.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work bridges the technical concepts underlying distributed computing and
blockchain technologies with their profound socioeconomic and sociopolitical
implications, particularly on academic research and the healthcare industry.
Several examples from academia, industry, and healthcare are explored
throughout this paper. The limiting factor in contemporary life sciences
research is often funding: for example, to purchase expensive laboratory
equipment and materials, to hire skilled researchers and technicians, and to
acquire and disseminate data through established academic channels. In the case
of the U.S. healthcare system, hospitals generate massive amounts of data, only
a small minority of which is utilized to inform current and future medical
practice. Similarly, corporations too expend large amounts of money to collect,
secure and transmit data from one centralized source to another. In all three
scenarios, data moves under the traditional paradigm of centralization, in
which data is hosted and curated by individuals and organizations and of
benefit to only a small subset of people.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent attacks on power grids demonstrated the vulnerability of the grids to
cyber and physical attacks. To analyze this vulnerability, we study
cyber-physical attacks that affect both the power grid physical infrastructure
and its underlying Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. We
assume that an adversary attacks an area by: (i) disconnecting some lines
within that area, and (ii) obstructing the information (e.g., status of the
lines and voltage measurements) from within the area to reach the control
center. We leverage the algebraic properties of the AC power flows to introduce
the efficient EXPOSE Algorithm for detecting line failures and recovering
voltages inside that attacked area after such an attack. The EXPOSE Algorithm
outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting line failures using
partial information under the AC power flow model in terms of scalability and
accuracy. The main advantages of the EXPOSE Algorithm are that its running time
is independent of the size of the grid and number of line failures, and that it
provides accurate information recovery under some conditions on the attacked
area. Moreover, it approximately recovers the information and provides the
confidence of the solution when these conditions do not hold.

 <dc:description>  We study a unique network dataset including periodic surveys and electronic
logs of dyadic contacts via smartphones. The participants were a sample of
freshmen entering university in the Fall 2011. Their opinions on a variety of
political and social issues and lists of activities on campus were regularly
recorded at the beginning and end of each semester for the first three years of
study. We identify a behavioral network defined by call and text data, and a
cognitive network based on friendship nominations in ego-network surveys. Both
networks are limited to study participants. Since a wide range of attributes on
each node were collected in self-reports, we refer to these networks as
attribute-rich networks. We study whether student preferences for certain
attributes of friends can predict formation and dissolution of edges in both
networks. We introduce a method for computing student preferences for different
attributes which we use to predict link formation and dissolution. We then rank
these attributes according to their importance for making predictions. We find
that personal preferences, in particular political views, and preferences for
common activities help predict link formation and dissolution in both the
behavioral and cognitive networks.

 <dc:title>Inducing Distant Supervision in Suggestion Mining through Part-of-Speech
  Embeddings</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Negi, Sapna</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Buitelaar, Paul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mining suggestion expressing sentences from a given text is a less
investigated sentence classification task, and therefore lacks hand labeled
benchmark datasets. In this work, we propose and evaluate two approaches for
distant supervision in suggestion mining. The distant supervision is obtained
through a large silver standard dataset, constructed using the text from
wikiHow and Wikipedia. Both the approaches use a LSTM based neural network
architecture to learn a classification model for suggestion mining, but vary in
their method to use the silver standard dataset. The first approach directly
trains the classifier using this dataset, while the second approach only learns
word embeddings from this dataset. In the second approach, we also learn POS
embeddings, which interestingly gives the best classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a fully-integrated radar and communication system
-- named ComSens. We utilize two different pilot sequences (one for uplink and
one for downlink) with the condition that they must be uncorrelated to each
other. Within such a framework, the signal received from end-user and the
back-scattered signal from the desired objects have uncorrelated pilots. Thus,
the base-station is able to distinguish data signal from user and
back-scattered signal from object. We assume a time division duplex (TDD)
framework. The pilot sequences are designed for MIMO channels. We evaluate
channel MSE as a figure of merit for communication system. We also show that
the designed pilots are uncorrelated for a range of time lags. Moreover,
designed uplink pilot has negligible autocorrelation for a range of time lags
leading to an impulse-like autocorrelation for radar sensing.

 <dc:description>  The quantum autoencoder is a recent paradigm in the field of quantum machine
learning, which may enable an enhanced use of resources in quantum
technologies. To this end, quantum neural networks with less nodes in the inner
than in the outer layers were considered. Here, we propose a useful connection
between approximate quantum adders and quantum autoencoders. Specifically, this
link allows us to employ optimized approximate quantum adders, obtained with
genetic algorithms, for the implementation of quantum autoencoders for a
variety of initial states. Furthermore, we can also directly optimize the
quantum autoencoders via genetic algorithms. Our approach opens a different
path for the design of quantum autoencoders in controllable quantum platforms.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to automate the process of discovering optimization
methods, with a focus on deep learning architectures. We train a Recurrent
Neural Network controller to generate a string in a domain specific language
that describes a mathematical update equation based on a list of primitive
functions, such as the gradient, running average of the gradient, etc. The
controller is trained with Reinforcement Learning to maximize the performance
of a model after a few epochs. On CIFAR-10, our method discovers several update
rules that are better than many commonly used optimizers, such as Adam,
RMSProp, or SGD with and without Momentum on a ConvNet model. We introduce two
new optimizers, named PowerSign and AddSign, which we show transfer well and
improve training on a variety of different tasks and architectures, including
ImageNet classification and Google's neural machine translation system.

 <dc:title>Learned Features are better for Ethnicity Classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Anwar, Inzamam</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Ethnicity is a key demographic attribute of human beings and it plays a vital
role in automatic facial recognition and have extensive real world applications
such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI); demographic based classification;
biometric based recognition; security and defense to name a few. In this paper
we present a novel approach for extracting ethnicity from the facial images.
The proposed method makes use of a pre trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) to extract the features and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear
kernel is used as a classifier. This technique uses translational invariant
hierarchical features learned by the network, in contrast to previous works,
which use hand crafted features such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP); Gabor etc.
Thorough experiments are presented on ten different facial databases which
strongly suggest that our approach is robust to different expressions and
illuminations conditions. Here we consider ethnicity classification as a three
class problem including Asian, African-American and Caucasian. Average
classification accuracy over all databases is 98.28%, 99.66% and 99.05% for
Asian, African-American and Caucasian respectively.

based mechanism, causing them to assign higher probabilities to re-occurring
sequential patterns. Dynamic evaluation outperforms existing adaptation
approaches in our comparisons. Dynamic evaluation improves the state-of-the-art
word-level perplexities on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets to 51.1
and 44.3 respectively, and the state-of-the-art character-level cross-entropies
on the text8 and Hutter Prize datasets to 1.19 bits/char and 1.08 bits/char
respectively.

 <dc:description>  Black box variational inference (BBVI) with reparameterization gradients
triggered the exploration of divergence measures other than the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, such as alpha divergences. In this paper, we
view BBVI with generalized divergences as a form of estimating the marginal
likelihood via biased importance sampling. The choice of divergence determines
a bias-variance trade-off between the tightness of a bound on the marginal
likelihood (low bias) and the variance of its gradient estimators. Drawing on
variational perturbation theory of statistical physics, we use these insights
to construct a family of new variational bounds. Enumerated by an odd integer
order $K$, this family captures the standard KL bound for $K=1$, and converges
to the exact marginal likelihood as $K\to\infty$. Compared to
alpha-divergences, our reparameterization gradients have a lower variance. We
show in experiments on Gaussian Processes and Variational Autoencoders that the
new bounds are more mass covering, and that the resulting posterior covariances
are closer to the true posterior and lead to higher likelihoods on held-out
data.

 <dc:description>  Social media serves as a unified platform for users to express their thoughts
on subjects ranging from their daily lives to their opinion on consumer brands
and products. These users wield an enormous influence in shaping the opinions
of other consumers and influence brand perception, brand loyalty and brand
advocacy. In this paper, we analyze the opinion of 19M Twitter users towards 62
popular industries, encompassing 12,898 enterprise and consumer brands, as well
as associated subject matter topics, via sentiment analysis of 330M tweets over
a period spanning a month. We find that users tend to be most positive towards
manufacturing and most negative towards service industries. In addition, they
tend to be more positive or negative when interacting with brands than
generally on Twitter. We also find that sentiment towards brands within an
industry varies greatly and we demonstrate this using two industries as use
cases. In addition, we discover that there is no strong correlation between
topic sentiments of different industries, demonstrating that topic sentiments
are highly dependent on the context of the industry that they are mentioned in.
We demonstrate the value of such an analysis in order to assess the impact of
brands on social media. We hope that this initial study will prove valuable for
both researchers and companies in understanding users' perception of
industries, brands and associated topics and encourage more research in this
field.

 <dc:title>Promises and Challenges in Continuous Tracking Utilizing Amino Acids in

 <dc:description>  We consider a new concept of biometric-based cybersecurity systems for active
authentication by continuous tracking, which utilizes biochemical processing of
metabolites present in skin secretions. Skin secretions contain a large number
of metabolites and small molecules that can be targeted for analysis. Here we
argue that amino acids found in sweat can be exploited for the establishment of
an amino acid profile capable of identifying an individual user of a mobile or
wearable device. Individual and combinations of amino acids processed by
biocatalytic cascades yield physical (optical or electronic) signals, providing
a time-series of several outputs that, in their entirety, should suffice to
authenticate a specific user based on standard statistical criteria. Initial
results, motivated by biometrics, indicate that single amino acid levels can
provide analog signals that vary according to the individual donor, albeit with
limited resolution versus noise. However, some such assays offer digital
separation (into well-defined ranges of values) according to groups such as
age, biological sex, race, and physiological state of the individual.
Multi-input biocatalytic cascades that handle several amino acid signals to
yield a single digital-type output, as well as continuous-tracking time-series
data rather than a single-instance sample, should enable active authentication
at the level of an individual.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, numerous vehicular technologies, e.g., cruise control and
steering assistant, have been proposed and deployed to improve the driving
experience, passenger safety, and vehicle performance. Despite the existence of
several novel vehicular applications in the literature, there still exists a
significant gap between resources needed for a variety of vehicular (in
particular, data-dominant, latency-sensitive, and computationally-heavy)
applications and the capabilities of already-in-market vehicles. To address
this gap, different smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches have been proposed that
utilize the external computational/storage resources to enable new
applications. However, their acceptance and application domain are still very
limited due to programability, wireless connectivity, and performance
limitations, along with several security/privacy concerns. In this paper, we
present a novel architecture that can potentially enable rapid development of
various vehicular applications while addressing shortcomings of
smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches. The architecture is formed around a core
component, called SmartCore, a privacy/security-friendly programmable dongle
that brings general-purpose computational and storage resources to the vehicle
and hosts in-vehicle applications. Based on the proposed architecture, we
develop an application development framework for vehicles, that we call
ProCMotive. ProCMotive enables developers to build customized vehicular
applications along the Cloud-to-edge continuum, i.e., different functions of an
application can be distributed across SmartCore, the user's personal devices,
and the Cloud. To highlight potential benefits that the framework provides, we
design and develop two different vehicular applications based on ProCMotive,
namely, Amber Response and Insurance Monitor.

 <dc:title>Learning Domain-Specific Word Embeddings from Sparse Cybersecurity Texts</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Word embedding is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that
automatically maps words from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in an
embedding space. It has been widely used in recent years to boost the
performance of a vari-ety of NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition,
Syntac-tic Parsing and Sentiment Analysis. Classic word embedding methods such
as Word2Vec and GloVe work well when they are given a large text corpus. When
the input texts are sparse as in many specialized domains (e.g.,
cybersecurity), these methods often fail to produce high-quality vectors. In
this pa-per, we describe a novel method to train domain-specificword embeddings
from sparse texts. In addition to domain texts, our method also leverages
diverse types of domain knowledge such as domain vocabulary and semantic
relations. Specifi-cally, we first propose a general framework to encode
diverse types of domain knowledge as text annotations. Then we de-velop a novel
Word Annotation Embedding (WAE) algorithm to incorporate diverse types of text
annotations in word em-bedding. We have evaluated our method on two
cybersecurity text corpora: a malware description corpus and a Common
Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) corpus. Our evaluation re-sults have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in learning domain-specific word
embeddings.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a method for contact state estimation using fuzzy
clustering to learn contact probability for full, six-dimensional humanoid
contacts. The data required for training is solely from proprioceptive sensors
- endeffector contact wrench sensors and inertial measurement units (IMUs) -
and the method is completely unsupervised. The resulting cluster means are used
to efficiently compute the probability of contact in each of the six
endeffector degrees of freedom (DoFs) independently. This clustering-based
contact probability estimator is validated in a kinematics-based base state
estimator in a simulation environment with realistic added sensor noise for
locomotion over rough, low-friction terrain on which the robot is subject to
foot slip and rotation. The proposed base state estimator which utilizes these
six DoF contact probability estimates is shown to perform considerably better
than that which determines kinematic contact constraints purely based on
measured normal force.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Scheduling Charging in the Smart Grid</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the smart grid, the intent is to use flexibility in demand, both to
balance demand and supply as well as to resolve potential congestion. A first
prominent example of such flexible demand is the charging of electric vehicles,
which do not necessarily need to be charged as soon as they are plugged in. The
problem of optimally scheduling the charging demand of electric vehicles within
the constraints of the electricity infrastructure is called the charge
scheduling problem. The models of the charging speed, horizon, and charging
demand determine the computational complexity of the charge scheduling problem.
For about 20 variants, we show, using a dynamic programming approach, that the
problem is either in P or weakly NP-hard. We also show that about 10 variants
of the problem are strongly NP-hard, presenting a potentially significant
obstacle to their use in practical situations of scale.

 <dc:title>WERd: Using Social Text Spelling Variants for Evaluating Dialectal
  Speech Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of evaluating automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems
that target dialectal speech input. A major challenge in this case is that the
orthography of dialects is typically not standardized. From an ASR evaluation
perspective, this means that there is no clear gold standard for the expected
output, and several possible outputs could be considered correct according to
different human annotators, which makes standard word error rate (WER)
inadequate as an evaluation metric. Such a situation is typical for machine
translation (MT), and thus we borrow ideas from an MT evaluation metric, namely
TERp, an extension of translation error rate which is closely-related to WER.
In particular, in the process of comparing a hypothesis to a reference, we make
use of spelling variants for words and phrases, which we mine from Twitter in
an unsupervised fashion. Our experiments with evaluating ASR output for
Egyptian Arabic, and further manual analysis, show that the resulting WERd
(i.e., WER for dialects) metric, a variant of TERp, is more adequate than WER
for evaluating dialectal ASR.

 <dc:description>  Given a pair of predictor variables and a response variable, how much
information do the predictors have about the response, and how is this

Recent work has proposed to quantify the unique component of the decomposition
as the minimum value of the conditional mutual information over a constrained

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of dense depth prediction from a sparse set of depth
measurements and a single RGB image. Since depth estimation from monocular
images alone is inherently ambiguous and unreliable, we introduce additional
sparse depth samples, which are either collected from a low-resolution depth
sensor or computed from SLAM, to attain a higher level of robustness and
accuracy. We propose the use of a single regression network to learn directly
from the RGB-D raw data, and explore the impact of number of depth samples on
prediction accuracy. Our experiments show that, as compared to using only RGB
images, the addition of 100 spatially random depth samples reduces the
prediction root-mean-square error by half in the NYU-Depth-v2 indoor dataset.
It also boosts the percentage of reliable prediction from 59% to 92% on the
more challenging KITTI driving dataset. We demonstrate two applications of the
proposed algorithm: serving as a plug-in module in SLAM to convert sparse maps
to dense maps, and creating much denser point clouds from low-resolution
LiDARs. Codes and video demonstration are publicly available.

routinely generate and collect in pretty much everything we do, as well as our
ability to exploit modern technologies to process, analyze and understand this

supporting Big Data storage, processing and for sophisticated analytics
applications. We analyze in details the building blocks of the software stack
for supporting big data science as a commodity service for data scientists. We
provide various insights about the latest ongoing developments and open

 <dc:description>  Temporal synthesis is the automated design of a system that interacts with an
environment, using the declarative specification of the system's behavior. A
popular language for providing such a specification is Linear Temporal Logic,
or LTL. LTL synthesis in the general case has remained, however, a hard problem
to solve in practice. Because of this, many works have focused on developing
synthesis procedures for specific fragments of LTL, with an easier synthesis
problem. In this work, we focus on Safety LTL, defined here to be the
Until-free fragment of LTL in Negation Normal Form~(NNF), and shown to express
a fragment of safe LTL formulas. The intrinsic motivation for this fragment is
the observation that in many cases it is not enough to say that something
&quot;good&quot; will eventually happen, we need to say by when it will happen. We show
here that Safety LTL synthesis is significantly simpler algorithmically than
LTL synthesis. We exploit this simplicity in two ways, first by describing an
explicit approach based on a reduction to Horn-SAT, which can be solved in
linear time in the size of the game graph, and then through an efficient
symbolic construction, allowing a BDD-based symbolic approach which
significantly outperforms extant LTL-synthesis tools.

 <dc:description>  Recent progress in autonomous and semi-autonomous driving has been made
possible in part through an assortment of sensors that provide the intelligent
agent with an enhanced perception of its surroundings. It has been clear for
quite some while now that for intelligent vehicles to function effectively in
all situations and conditions, a fusion of different sensor technologies is
essential. Consequently, the availability of synchronized multi-sensory data
streams are necessary to promote the development of fusion based algorithms for
low, mid and high level semantic tasks. In this paper, we provide a
comprehensive description of our heavily sensorized, panoramic testbed capable
of providing high quality data from a slew of synchronized and calibrated
sensors such as cameras, LIDARs, radars, and the IMU/GPS. The vehicle has
recorded over 100 hours of real world data for a very diverse set of weather,
traffic and daylight conditions. All captured data is accurately calibrated and
synchronized using timestamps, and stored safely in high performance servers
mounted inside the vehicle itself. Details on the testbed instrumentation,
sensor layout, sensor outputs, calibration and synchronization are described in
this paper.

 <dc:description>  With the rise of attacks using PowerShell in the recent months, there has not
been a comprehensive solution for monitoring or prevention. Microsoft recently
released the AMSI solution for PowerShell v5, however this can also be
bypassed. This paper focuses on repurposing various stealthy runtime .NET
hijacking techniques implemented for PowerShell attacks for defensive
monitoring of PowerShell. It begins with a brief introduction to .NET and
PowerShell, followed by a deeper explanation of various attacker techniques,
which is explained from the perspective of the defender, including assembly
modification, class and method injection, compiler profiling, and C based
function hooking. Of the four attacker techniques that are repurposed for
defensive real-time monitoring of PowerShell execution, intermediate language
binary modification, JIT hooking, and machine code manipulation provide the
best results for stealthy run-time interfaces for PowerShell scripting
analysis.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we focus on the unconstrained binary quadratic optimization
model, maximize x^t Qx, x binary, and consider the problem of identifying
optimal solutions that are robust with respect to perturbations in the Q
matrix.. We are motivated to find robust, or stable, solutions because of the
uncertainty inherent in the big data origins of Q and limitations in computer
numerical precision, particularly in a new class of quantum annealing
computers. Experimental design techniques are used to generate a diverse subset
of possible scenarios, from which robust solutions are identified. An
illustrative example with practical application to business decision making is
examined. The approach presented also generates a surface response equation
which is used to estimate upper bounds in constant time for Q instantiations
within the scenario extremes. In addition, a theoretical framework for the
robustness of individual x_i variables is considered by examining the range of
Q values over which the x_i are predetermined.

 <dc:description>  Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is an important formal
verification method for guaranteeing performance and safety properties of
dynamical systems; it has been applied to many small-scale systems in the past
decade. Its advantages include compatibility with general nonlinear system
dynamics, formal treatment of bounded disturbances, and the availability of
well-developed numerical tools. The main challenge is addressing its
exponential computational complexity with respect to the number of state
variables. In this tutorial, we present an overview of basic HJ reachability
theory and provide instructions for using the most recent numerical tools,
including an efficient GPU-parallelized implementation of a Level Set Toolbox
for computing reachable sets. In addition, we review some of the current work
in high-dimensional HJ reachability to show how the dimensionality challenge
can be alleviated via various general theoretical and application-specific
insights.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a method for the evaluation of a posteriori (historical)
multi-variate multi-stage optimal trading under transaction costs and a
diversification constraint. Starting from a given amount of money in some
currency, we analyze the stage-wise optimal allocation over a time horizon with
potential investments in multiple currencies and various assets, such as, for
example, assets emulating stock indices. Variants are discussed, such as
unconstrained trading frequency, a fixed number of total admissable trades, and
the waiting of a specific time-period after every executed trade until the next
trade. Mathematical aspects are the modeling of transition dynamics as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), efficient graph generation and consequent graph search.
The developed strategies are evaluated on recent real-world data dating back
one year. Special focus is on the evaluation of quantitative results.

 <dc:title>Defining a Lingua Franca to Open the Black Box of a Na\&quot;ive Bayes

 <dc:description>  Many AI systems have a black box nature that makes it difficult to understand
how they make their recommendations. This can be unsettling, as the designer
cannot be certain how the system will respond to novelty. To penetrate our
Na\&quot;ive Bayes recommender's black box, we first asked, what do we want to know
from our system, and how can it be obtained? The answers led us to recursively
define a common lexicon with the AI, a lingua franca, using the very items that
the system ranks to create meta-symbols recognized by the system, and enabling
us to understand the system's knowledge in plain terms and at different levels
of abstraction. As one bonus, using its existing knowledge, the lingua franca
can enable the system to extend recommendations to related, but entirely new
areas, ameliorating the cold start problem. We also supplement the lingua
franca with techniques for visualizing the system's knowledge state, develop
metrics for evaluating the meaningfulness of terms in the lingua franca, and
generalize the requirements for developing a similar lingua franca in other
applications.

 <dc:description>  Multichip systems with memory stacks and various processing chips are at the
heart of platform based designs such as servers and embedded systems. Full
utilization of the benefits of these integrated multichip systems need a
seamless, and scalable in-package interconnection framework. However,
state-of-the-art inter-chip communication requires long wireline channels which
increases energy consumption and latency while decreasing data bandwidth. Here,
we propose the design of an energy-efficient, seamless wireless interconnection
network for multichip systems. We demonstrate with cycle-accurate simulations
that such a design reduces the energy consumption and latency while increasing
the bandwidth in comparison to modern multichip integration systems.

 <dc:description>  E-commerce websites such as Amazon, Alibaba, Flipkart, and Walmart sell
billions of products. Machine learning (ML) algorithms involving products are
often used to improve the customer experience and increase revenue, e.g.,
product similarity, recommendation, and price estimation. The products are
required to be represented as features before training an ML algorithm. In this
paper, we propose an approach called MRNet-Product2Vec for creating generic
embeddings of products within an e-commerce ecosystem. We learn a dense and
low-dimensional embedding where a diverse set of signals related to a product
are explicitly injected into its representation. We train a Discriminative
Multi-task Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the input is a
product title fed through a Bidirectional RNN and at the output, product labels
corresponding to fifteen different tasks are predicted. The task set includes
several intrinsic characteristics about a product such as price, weight, size,
color, popularity, and material. We evaluate the proposed embedding
quantitatively and qualitatively. We demonstrate that they are almost as good
as sparse and extremely high-dimensional TF-IDF representation in spite of
having less than 3% of the TF-IDF dimension. We also use a multimodal
autoencoder for comparing products from different language-regions and show
preliminary yet promising qualitative results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present AutoPerf, a generalized software performance
anomaly detection system. AutoPerf uses autoencoders, an unsupervised learning
technique, and hardware performance counters to learn the performance
signatures of parallel programs. It then uses this knowledge to identify when
newer versions of the program suffer performance penalties, while
simultaneously providing root cause analysis to help programmers debug the
program's performance.
  AutoPerf is the first zero-positive learning performance anomaly detector, a
system that trains entirely in the negative (non-anomalous) space to learn
positive (anomalous) behaviors. We demonstrate AutoPerf's generality against
three different types of performance anomalies: (i) true sharing cache
contention, (ii) false sharing cache contention, and (iii) NUMA latencies
across 15 real world performance anomalies and 7 open source programs. AutoPerf
has only 3.7% profiling overhead (on average) and detects more anomalies than
the prior state-of-the-art approach.

 <dc:description>  Design structure matrices (DSMs) are useful to represent high-level system
structure, modeling interactions between design entities. DSMs are used for
many visualization and abstraction activities. In this work, we propose the use
of an existing DSM clustering algorithm to recover software architecture module
views. To make it suitable to this domain, optimization has proved necessary.
It was achieved through performance analysis and parameter tuning on the
original algorithm. Results show that DSM clustering can be an alternative to
other clustering algorithms.

 <dc:title>Robust Detection of Biasing Attacks on Misappropriated Distributed

 <dc:creator>Ugrinovskii, V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We develop a decentralized $H_\infty$ synthesis approach to detection of
biasing misappropriation attacks on distributed observers. Its starting point
is to equip the observer with an attack model which is then used in the design
of attack detectors. A two-step design procedure is proposed. First, an initial
centralized setup is carried out which enables each node to compute the
parameters of its attack detector online in a decentralized manner, without
interacting with other nodes. Each such detector is designed using the
$H_\infty$ approach. Next, the attack detectors are embedded into the network,
which allows them to detect misappropriated nodes from innovation in the
network interconnections.

 <dc:description>  The goal of personalized history-based recommendation is to automatically
output a distribution over all the items given a sequence of previous purchases
of a user. In this work, we present a novel approach that uses a recurrent
network for summarizing the history of purchases, continuous vectors
representing items for scalability, and a novel attention-based recurrent
mixture density network, which outputs each component in a mixture
sequentially, for modelling a multi-modal conditional distribution. We evaluate
the proposed approach on two publicly available datasets, MovieLens-20M and
RecSys15. The experiments show that the proposed approach, which explicitly
models the multi-modal nature of the predictive distribution, is able to
improve the performance over various baselines in terms of precision, recall
and nDCG.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a special kind of factorization of $x^n+1$ over
$\mathbb{F}_q, $ with $q$ a prime power $\equiv 3~({\rm mod}~4)$ when $n=2p,$
with $p\equiv 3~({\rm mod}~4)$ and $p$ is a prime. Given such a $q$ infinitely
many such $p$'s exist that admit $q$ as a primitive root by the Artin
conjecture in arithmetic progressions. This number theory conjecture is known
to hold under GRH. We study the double (resp. four)-negacirculant codes over
finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q, $ of co-index such $n$'s, including the exact
enumeration of the self-dual subclass, and a modified Varshamov-Gilbert bound
on the relative distance of the codes it contains.

 <dc:description>  We propose a fully automatic system to reconstruct and visualize 3D blood
vessels in Augmented Reality (AR) system from stereo X-ray images with bones
and body fat. Currently, typical 3D imaging technologies are expensive and
carrying the risk of irradiation exposure. To reduce the potential harm, we
only need to take two X-ray images before visualizing the vessels. Our system
can effectively reconstruct and visualize vessels in following steps. We first
conduct initial segmentation using Markov Random Field and then refine
segmentation in an entropy based post-process. We parse the segmented vessels
by extracting their centerlines and generating trees. We propose a
coarse-to-fine scheme for stereo matching, including initial matching using
affine transform and dense matching using Hungarian algorithm guided by
Gaussian regression. Finally, we render and visualize the reconstructed model
in a HoloLens based AR system, which can essentially change the way of
visualizing medical data. We have evaluated its performance by using synthetic
and real stereo X-ray images, and achieved satisfactory quantitative and
qualitative results.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this project was to develop and implement an English language
Text-to-Speech synthesis system. This involved a study of mechanisms of human
speech production, a review of techniques in speech synthesis, and analysis of
tests used to evaluate the effectiveness of synthesized speech. It was
determined that a diphone synthesis system was the most effective choice for
the scope of this project. A method of automatically identifying and extracting
diphones from prompted speech was designed, allowing for the creation of a
diphone database by a speaker in less than 40 minutes. CMUdict was used to
determine the pronunciation of known words. A system for smoothing the
transitions between diphone recordings was designed and implemented. CMUdict
was then used to train a maximum-likelihood prediction system to determine the
correct pronunciation of unknown English language alphabetic words. Then, a
Part Of Speech tagger was designed to find the lexical class of words within a
sentence.
  A method of altering the pitch, duration, and volume of the produced voice
over time was designed, being a combination of the TD-PSOLA algorithm and a
novel approach referred to as Unvoiced Speech Duration Shifting. This minimises
distortion of the voice when shifting the pitch or duration, while maximising
computational efficiency by operating in the time domain. This approach was
used to add correct lexical stress to vowels within words. A text tokenisation
system was developed to handle arbitrary text input, allowing pronunciation of
numerical input tokens and use of appropriate pauses for punctuation. Methods
for further improving sentence level speech naturalness were discussed.
Finally, the system was tested with listeners for its intelligibility and
naturalness.

 <dc:description>  We present the Robotic Overlay coMmunicAtioN prOtocol (ROMANO), a
lightweight, application layer overlay communication protocol for a unified
sensing and control abstraction of a network of heterogeneous robots mainly
consisting of low power, low-compute-capable robots. ROMANO is built to work in
conjunction with the well-known MQ Telemetry Transport for Sensor Nodes
(MQTT-SN) protocol, a lightweight publish-subscribe communication protocol for
the Internet of Things and makes use its concept of &quot;topics&quot; to designate the
addition and deletion of communication endpoints by changing the subscriptions
of topics at each device. We also develop a portable implementation of ROMANO
for low power IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) radios and deployed it on a small testbed
of commercially available, low-power, and low-compute-capable robots called
Pololu 3pi robots. Based on a thorough analysis of the protocol on the real
testbed, as a measure of throughput, we demonstrate that ROMANO can guarantee
more than a $99.5\%$ message delivery ratio for a message generation rate up to
200 messages per second. The single hop delays in ROMANO are as low as 20ms
with linear dependency on the number of robots connected. These delay numbers
concur with typical delays in 802.15.4 networks and suggest that ROMANO does
not introduce additional delays. Lastly, we implement four different
multi-robot applications to demonstrate the scalability, adaptability, ease of
integration, and reliability of ROMANO.

 <dc:description>  Stateful applications and virtualized network functions (VNFs) can benefit
from state externalization to increase their reliability, scalability, and
inter-operability. To keep and share the externalized state, distributed data
stores (DDSs) are a powerful tool allowing for the management of classical
trade-offs in consistency, availability and partitioning tolerance. With the
advent of Fog and Edge Computing, stateful applications and VNFs are pushed
from the data centers toward the network edge. This poses new challenges on
DDSs that are tailored to a deployment in Cloud data centers. In this paper, we
propose two novel design goals for DDSs that are tailored to Fog Computing: (1)
Fog-aware replica placement, and (2) context-sensitive differential
consistency. To realize those design goals on top of existing DDSs, we propose
the FogStore system. FogStore manages the needed adaptations in replica
placement and consistency management transparently, so that existing DDSs can
be plugged into the system. To show the benefits of FogStore, we perform a set
of evaluations using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark.

 <dc:description>  The diversity of Fog Computing deployment models and the lack of publicly
available Fog infrastructure makes the design of an efficient application or
resource management policy a challenging task. Such research often requires a
test framework that facilitates the experimental evaluation of an application
or protocol design in a repeatable and controllable manner. In this paper, we
present EmuFog---an extensible emulation framework tailored for Fog Computing
scenarios---that enables the from-scratch design of Fog Computing
infrastructures and the emulation of real applications and workloads. EmuFog
enables researchers to design the network topology according to the use-case,
embed Fog Computing nodes in the topology and run Docker-based applications on
those nodes connected by an emulated network. Each of the sub-modules of EmuFog
are easily extensible, although EmuFog provides a default implementation for
each of them. The scalability and efficacy of EmuFog are evaluated both on
synthetic and real-world network topologies.

 <dc:title>Novel Evaluation Metrics for Seam Carving based Image Retargeting</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Image retargeting effectively resizes images by preserving the
recognizability of important image regions. Most of retargeting methods rely on
good importance maps as a cue to retain or remove certain regions in the input
image. In addition, the traditional evaluation exhaustively depends on user
ratings. There is a legitimate need for a methodological approach for
evaluating retargeted results. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a study and
analysis on the prominent method in image retargeting, Seam Carving. First, we
introduce two novel evaluation metrics which can be considered as the proxy of
user ratings. Second, we exploit salient object dataset as a benchmark for this
task. We then investigate different types of importance maps for this
particular problem. The experiments show that humans in general agree with the
evaluation metrics on the retargeted results and some importance map methods
are consistently more favorable than others.

 <dc:description>  The female facial image beautification usually requires professional editing
softwares, which are relatively difficult for common users. In this demo, we
introduce a practical system for automatic and personalized facial makeup
recommendation and synthesis. First, a model describing the relations among
facial features, facial attributes and makeup attributes is learned as the
makeup recommendation model for suggesting the most suitable makeup attributes.
Then the recommended makeup attributes are seamlessly synthesized onto the
input facial image.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Tools for Network Intrusion Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the rapid development of Internet and the sharp increase of network
crime, network security has become very important and received a lot of
attention. We model security issues as stochastic systems. This allows us to
find weaknesses in existing security systems and propose new solutions.
Exploring the vulnerabilities of existing security tools can prevent
cyber-attacks from taking advantages of the system weaknesses. We propose a
hybrid network security scheme including intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and
honeypots scattered throughout the network. This combines the advantages of two
security technologies. A honeypot is an activity-based network security system,
which could be the logical supplement of the passive detection policies used by
IDSs. This integration forces us to balance security performance versus cost by
scheduling device activities for the proposed system. By formulating the
scheduling problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision
process (DEC-POMDP), decisions are made in a distributed manner at each device
without requiring centralized control. The partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) is a useful choice for controlling stochastic systems. As a
combination of two Markov models, POMDPs combine the strength of hidden Markov
Model (HMM) (capturing dynamics that depend on unobserved states) and that of
Markov decision process (MDP) (taking the decision aspect into account).
Decision making under uncertainty is used in many parts of business and
science.We use here for security tools.We adopt a high-quality approximation
solution for finite-space POMDPs with the average cost criterion, and their
extension to DEC-POMDPs. We show how this tool could be used to design a
network security framework.

 <dc:title>A Novel Decomposition for Control of DC Circuits and Grid Models with

 <dc:creator>Wang, Shuai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Baillieul, John</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The way in which electric power depends on the topology of circuits with
mixed voltage and current sources is examined. The power flowing in any
steady-state DC circuit is shown to depend on a minimal set of key variables
called fundamental node voltages and fundamental edge currents. Every
steady-state DC circuit can be decomposed into a voltage controlled subcircuit
and a current controlled subcircuit. In terms of such a decomposition, the I^2R
losses of a mixed source circuit are always the sum of losses on the voltage
controlled subcircuit and the current controlled subcircuit. The paper
concludes by showing that the total power flowing in a mixed source circuit can
be found as critical points of the power expressed in terms of the key voltage
and current variables mentioned above. The possible relationship to topology
control of electric grid operations is discussed.

 <dc:description>  Modern urban railways extensively use computerized sensing and control
technologies to achieve safe, reliable, and well-timed operations. However, the
use of these technologies may provide a convenient leverage to cyber-attackers
who have bypassed the air gaps and aim at causing safety incidents and service
disruptions. In this paper, we study false data injection (FDI) attacks against
railways' traction power systems (TPSes). Specifically, we analyze two types of
FDI attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position sensor
measurements - which we call efficiency attack and safety attack -- that (i)
maximize the system's total power consumption and (ii) mislead trains' local
voltages to exceed given safety-critical thresholds, respectively. To
counteract, we develop a global attack detection (GAD) system that serializes a
bad data detector and a novel secondary attack detector designed based on
unique TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our detection
system can effectively detect the FDI attacks on trains' voltage and current
measurements even if the attacker has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS,
attack detection, and real-time system state. In particular, the GAD system
features an adaptive mechanism that ensures low false positive and negative
rates in detecting the attacks under noisy system measurements. Extensive
simulations driven by realistic running profiles of trains verify that a TPS
setup is vulnerable to the FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected
effectively by the proposed GAD while ensuring a low false positive rate.

 <dc:description>  Local search is a basic building block in memetic algorithms. Guided Local
Search (GLS) can improve the efficiency of local search. By changing the guide
function, GLS guides a local search to escape from locally optimal solutions
and find better solutions. The key component of GLS is its penalizing mechanism
which determines which feature is selected to penalize when the search is
trapped in a locally optimal solution. The original GLS penalizing mechanism
only makes use of the cost and the current penalty value of each feature. It is
well known that many combinatorial optimization problems have a big valley
structure, i.e., the better a solution is, the more the chance it is closer to
a globally optimal solution. This paper proposes to use big valley structure
assumption to improve the GLS penalizing mechanism. An improved GLS algorithm
called Elite Biased GLS (EB-GLS) is proposed. EB-GLS records and maintains an
elite solution as an estimate of the globally optimal solutions, and reduces
the chance of penalizing the features in this solution. We have systematically
tested the proposed algorithm on the symmetric traveling salesman problem.
Experimental results show that EB-GLS is significantly better than GLS.

 <dc:title>Service Providers of the Sharing Economy: Who Joins and Who Benefits?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many &quot;sharing economy&quot; platforms, such as Uber and Airbnb, have become
increasingly popular, providing consumers with more choices and suppliers a
chance to make profit. They, however, have also brought about emerging issues
regarding regulation, tax obligation, and impact on urban environment, and have
generated heated debates from various interest groups. Empirical studies
regarding these issues are limited, partly due to the unavailability of
relevant data. Here we aim to understand service providers of the sharing
economy, investigating who joins and who benefits, using the Airbnb market in
the United States as a case study. We link more than 211 thousand Airbnb
listings owned by 188 thousand hosts with demographic, socio-economic status
(SES), housing, and tourism characteristics. We show that income and education
are consistently the two most influential factors that are linked to the
joining of Airbnb, regardless of the form of participation or year. Areas with
lower median household income, or higher fraction of residents who have
Bachelor's and higher degrees, tend to have more hosts. However, when
considering the performance of listings, as measured by number of newly
received reviews, we find that income has a positive effect for entire-home
listings; listings located in areas with higher median household income tend to
have more new reviews. Our findings demonstrate empirically that the
disadvantage of SES-disadvantaged areas and the advantage of SES-advantaged
areas may be present in the sharing economy.

 <dc:description>  Automatic mesh-based shape generation is of great interest across a wide
range of disciplines, from industrial design to gaming, computer graphics and
various other forms of digital art. While most traditional methods focus on
primitive based model generation, advances in deep learning made it possible to
learn 3-dimensional geometric shape representations in an end-to-end manner.
However, most current deep learning based frameworks focus on the
representation and generation of voxel and point-cloud based shapes, making it
not directly applicable to design and graphics communities. This study
addresses the needs for automatic generation of mesh-based geometries, and
propose a novel framework that utilizes signed distance function representation
that generates detail preserving three-dimensional surface mesh by a deep
learning based approach.

 <dc:description>  In psychology, theory-driven researches are usually conducted with extensive
laboratory experiments, yet rarely tested or disproved with big data. In this
paper, we make use of 418K travel photos with traveler ratings to test the
influential &quot;broaden-and-build&quot; theory, that suggests positive emotions broaden
one's visual attention. The core hypothesis examined in this study is that
positive emotion is associated with a wider attention, hence highly-rated sites
would trigger wide-angle photographs. By analyzing travel photos, we find a
strong correlation between a preference for wide-angle photos and the high
rating of tourist sites on TripAdvisor. We are able to carry out this analysis
through the use of deep learning algorithms to classify the photos into wide
and narrow angles, and present this study as an exemplar of how big data and
deep learning can be used to test laboratory findings in the wild.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power
transfer (WPT) system, where a UAV-mounted mobile energy transmitter (ET) is
dispatched to deliver wireless energy to a set of on-ground energy receivers
(ERs). We investigate how the UAV should optimally exploit its mobility via
trajectory design to maximize the energy transferred to all ERs during a finite
period. First, we consider the maximization of the sum energy received by all
ERs by optimizing the UAV's trajectory subject to its maximum speed constraint.
We obtain its optimal solution, which shows that the UAV should hover at one
single fixed location during the whole period. However, the sum-energy
maximization incurs a &quot;near-far&quot; fairness issue. To overcome this issue, we
consider a different problem to maximize the minimum received energy among all
ERs. We first consider an ideal case by ignoring the UAV's maximum speed
constraint, and show that the relaxed problem can be optimally solved via the
Lagrange dual method. Then, for the general case with the UAV's maximum speed
constraint considered, we propose a new successive hover-and-fly trajectory
motivated by the optimal trajectory in the ideal case, and obtain efficient
trajectory designs by applying the successive convex programing (SCP).

 <dc:description>  Taking a photo outside, can we predict the immediate future, \textit{e.g.},
how would the cloud move in the sky? We address this problem by presenting a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based two-stage approach to generating
realistic time-lapse videos of high resolution. Given the first frame, our
model learns to generate long-term future frames. The first stage generates
videos of realistic contents for each frame. The second stage refines the
generated video from the first stage by enforcing it to be closer to real
videos with regard to motion dynamics. To further encourage vivid motion in the
final generated video, Gram matrix is employed to model the motion more
precisely. We build a large scale time-lapse dataset, and test our approach on
this new dataset. Using our model, we are able to generate realistic videos of
up to $128\times 128$ resolution for 32 frames. Quantitative and qualitative
experiment results have demonstrated the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art models.

 <dc:description>  Association rule mining is a time consuming process due to involving both
data intensive and computation intensive nature. In order to mine large volume
of data and to enhance the scalability and performance of existing sequential
association rule mining algorithms, parallel and distributed algorithms are
developed. These traditional parallel and distributed algorithms are based on
homogeneous platform and are not lucrative for heterogeneous platform such as
grid and cloud. This requires design of new algorithms which address the issues
of good data set partition and distribution, load balancing strategy,
optimization of communication and synchronization technique among processors in
such heterogeneous system. Grid and cloud are the emerging platform for
distributed data processing and various association rule mining algorithms have
been proposed on such platforms. This survey article integrates the brief
architectural aspect of distributed system, various recent approaches of grid
based and cloud based association rule mining algorithms with comparative
perception. We differentiate between approaches of association rule mining
algorithms developed on these architectures on the basis of data locality,
programming paradigm, fault tolerance, communication cost, partition and
distribution of data sets. Although it is not complete in order to cover all
algorithms, yet it can be very useful for the new researchers working in the
direction of distributed association rule mining algorithms.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We make an important connection to existing results in econometrics to
describe an alternative formulation of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). In
particular, we describe an algorithm using Conditional Choice Probabilities
(CCP), which are maximum likelihood estimates of the policy estimated from
expert demonstrations, to solve the IRL problem. Using the language of
structural econometrics, we re-frame the optimal decision problem and introduce
an alternative representation of value functions due to (Hotz and Miller 1993).
In addition to presenting the theoretical connections that bridge the IRL
literature between Economics and Robotics, the use of CCPs also has the
practical benefit of reducing the computational cost of solving the IRL
problem. Specifically, under the CCP representation, we show how one can avoid
repeated calls to the dynamic programming subroutine typically used in IRL. We
show via extensive experimentation on standard IRL benchmarks that CCP-IRL is
able to outperform MaxEnt-IRL, with as much as a 5x speedup and without
compromising on the quality of the recovered reward function.

 <dc:description>  Digital retouching of face images is becoming more widespread due to the
introduction of software packages that automate the task. Several researchers
have introduced algorithms to detect whether a face image is original or
retouched. However, previous work on this topic has not considered whether or
how accuracy of retouching detection varies with the demography of face images.
In this paper, we introduce a new Multi-Demographic Retouched Faces (MDRF)
dataset, which contains images belonging to two genders, male and female, and
three ethnicities, Indian, Chinese, and Caucasian. Further, retouched images
are created using two different retouching software packages. The second major
contribution of this research is a novel semi-supervised autoencoder
incorporating &quot;subclass&quot; information to improve classification. The proposed
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art detection algorithms for the
task of generalized retouching detection. Experiments conducted with multiple
combinations of ethnicities show that accuracy of retouching detection can vary
greatly based on the demographics of the training and testing images.

 <dc:description>  We propose a data-driven method for recovering miss-ing parts of 3D shapes.
Our method is based on a new deep learning architecture consisting of two
sub-networks: a global structure inference network and a local geometry
refinement network. The global structure inference network incorporates a long
short-term memorized context fusion module (LSTM-CF) that infers the global
structure of the shape based on multi-view depth information provided as part
of the input. It also includes a 3D fully convolutional (3DFCN) module that
further enriches the global structure representation according to volumetric
information in the input. Under the guidance of the global structure network,
the local geometry refinement network takes as input lo-cal 3D patches around
missing regions, and progressively produces a high-resolution, complete surface
through a volumetric encoder-decoder architecture. Our method jointly trains
the global structure inference and local geometry refinement networks in an
end-to-end manner. We perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations on six
object categories, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art work on shape completion.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study twelve stochastic input models for online problems
and reveal the relationships among the competitive ratios for the models. The
competitive ratio is defined as the worst ratio between the expected optimal
value and the expected profit of the solution obtained by the online algorithm
where the input distribution is restricted according to the model. To handle a
broad class of online problems, we use a framework called request-answer games
that is introduced by Ben-David et al. The stochastic input models consist of
two types: known distribution and unknown distribution. For each type, we
consider six classes of distributions: dependent distributions, deterministic
input, independent distributions, identical independent distribution, random
order of a deterministic input, and random order of independent distributions.
As an application of the models, we consider two basic online problems, which
are variants of the secretary problem and the prophet inequality problem, under
the twelve stochastic input models. We see the difference of the competitive
ratios through these problems.

 <dc:description>  Graph is an important data representation which appears in a wide diversity
of real-world scenarios. Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper
understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful
applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction,
etc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and
space cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the
graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional
space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are
maximally preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the
literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of
graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two
taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in
different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work address
these challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications
that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research
directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques and
application scenarios.

 <dc:title>mts: a light framework for parallelizing tree search codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Avis, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Jordan, Charles</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe version 0.1 of mts, a generic framework for parallelizing certain
types of tree search programs using a single common wrapper. This complements a
previous tutorial that focused on using a preliminary version of mts. mts
supports sharing information between processes which is important for
applications such as satisfiability testing and branch-and-bound. No
parallelization is implemented in the legacy single processor code minimizing
the changes needed and simplying debugging. mts is written in C, uses MPI for
parallelization and can be used on a network of computers. As examples we
parallelize two simple existing reverse search codes, generating topological
sorts and generating spanning trees of a graph, and two codes for
satisfiability testing. We give experimental results comparing the parallel
codes with other codes for the same problems.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This complements the earlier tutorial (arXiv:1610.07735) on how to
  use mts, with which it shares some material. The tutorial should be consulted
  for specific details of the programming changes to legacy code required</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Nearest-neighbor search dominates the asymptotic complexity of sampling-based
motion planning algorithms and is often addressed with k-d tree data
structures. While it is generally believed that the expected complexity of
nearest-neighbor queries is $O(log(N))$ in the size of the tree, this paper
reveals that when a classic k-d tree approach is used with sub-Riemannian
metrics, the expected query complexity is in fact $\Theta(N^p \log(N))$ for a
number $p \in [0, 1)$ determined by the degree of nonholonomy of the system.
These metrics arise naturally in nonholonomic mechanical systems, including
classic wheeled robot models. To address this negative result, we propose novel
k-d tree build and query strategies tailored to sub-Riemannian metrics and
demonstrate significant improvements in the running time of nearest-neighbor
search queries.

 <dc:description>  Many state-of-the-art algorithms for solving hard combinatorial problems
include elements of stochasticity that lead to high variations in runtime, even
for a fixed problem instance, across runs with different pseudo-random number
seeds. Knowledge about the runtime distributions (RTDs) of algorithms on given
problem instances can be exploited in various meta-algorithmic procedures, such
as algorithm selection, portfolios, and randomized restarts. Previous work has
shown that machine learning can be used to individually predict mean, median
and variance of RTDs. To establish a new state-of-the-art in predicting RTDs,
we demonstrate that the parameters of an RTD should be learned jointly and that
neural networks can do this well by directly optimizing the likelihood of an
RTD given runtime observations. In an empirical study involving four algorithms
for SAT solving and AI planning, we show that our neural networks predict the
true RTDs of unseen instances better than previous methods. As an exemplary
application of RTD predictions, we show that our RTD models also yield good
predictions of running these algorithms in parallel.

 <dc:title>Chaotic Dynamic S Boxes Based Substitution Approach for Digital Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ahmad, Musheer</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chopra, Akshay</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an image encryption algorithm based on the chaos,
substitution boxes, nonlinear transformation in Galois field and Latin square.
Initially, the dynamic S boxes are generated using Fisher Yates shuffle method
and piece wise linear chaotic map. The algorithm utilizes advantages of keyed
Latin square and transformation to substitute highly correlated digital images
and yield encrypted image with valued performance. The chaotic behavior is
achieved using Logistic map which is used to select one of thousand S boxes and
also decides the row and column of selected S box. The selected S box value is
transformed using nonlinear transformation. Along with the keyed Latin square
generated using a 256 bit external key, used to substitute secretly plain image
pixels in cipher block chaining mode. To further strengthen the security of
algorithm, round operation are applied to obtain final ciphered image. The
experimental results are performed to evaluate algorithm and the anticipated
algorithm is compared with a recent encryption scheme. The analyses demonstrate
algorithms effectiveness in providing high security to digital media.

 <dc:description>  Selten's game is a kidnapping model where the probability of capturing the
kidnapper is independent of whether the hostage has been released or executed.
Most often, in view of the elevated sensitivities involved, authorities put
greater effort and resources into capturing the kidnapper if the hostage has
been executed, in contrast to the case when a ransom is paid to secure the
hostage's release. In this paper, we study the asymmetric game when the
probability of capturing the kidnapper depends on whether the hostage has been
executed or not and find a new uniquely determined perfect equilibrium point in
Selten's game.

 <dc:description>  Regularized empirical risk minimization using kernels and their corresponding
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) plays an important role in machine
learning. However, the actually used kernel often depends on one or on a few
hyperparameters or the kernel is even data dependent in a much more complicated
manner. Examples are Gaussian RBF kernels, kernel learning, and hierarchical
Gaussian kernels which were recently proposed for deep learning. Therefore, the
actually used kernel is often computed by a grid search or in an iterative
manner and can often only be considered as an approximation to the &quot;ideal&quot; or
&quot;optimal&quot; kernel. The paper gives conditions under which classical kernel based
methods based on a convex Lipschitz loss function and on a bounded and smooth
kernel are stable, if the probability measure $P$, the regularization parameter
$\lambda$, and the kernel $k$ may slightly change in a simultaneous manner.
Similar results are also given for pairwise learning. Therefore, the topic of
this paper is somewhat more general than in classical robust statistics, where
usually only the influence of small perturbations of the probability measure
$P$ on the estimated function is considered.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown promising results in audio and
speech processing applications due to their strong capabilities in modelling
sequential data. In many applications, RNNs tend to outperform conventional
models based on GMM/UBMs and i-vectors. Increasing popularity of IoT devices
makes a strong case for implementing RNN based inferences for applications such
as acoustics based authentication, voice commands, and edge analytics for smart
homes. Nonetheless, the feasibility and performance of RNN based inferences on
resources-constrained IoT devices remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
investigate the feasibility of using RNNs for an end-to-end authentication
system based on breathing acoustics. We evaluate the performance of RNN models
on three types of devices; smartphone, smartwatch, and Raspberry Pi and show
that unlike CNN models, RNN models can be easily ported onto
resource-constrained devices without a significant loss in accuracy.

 <dc:title>EraseReLU: A Simple Way to Ease the Training of Deep Convolution Neural

 <dc:description>  For most state-of-the-art architectures, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) becomes
a standard component accompanied with each layer. Although ReLU can ease the
network training to an extent, the character of blocking negative values may
suppress the propagation of useful information and leads to the difficulty of
optimizing very deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, stacking
layers with nonlinear activations is hard to approximate the intrinsic linear
transformations between feature representations.
  In this paper, we investigate the effect of erasing ReLUs of certain layers
and apply it to various representative architectures following deterministic
rules. It can ease the optimization and improve the generalization performance
for very deep CNN models. We find two key factors being essential to the
performance improvement: 1) the location where ReLU should be erased inside the
basic module; 2) the proportion of basic modules to erase ReLU; We show that
erasing the last ReLU layer of all basic modules in a network usually yields
improved performance. In experiments, our approach successfully improves the
performance of various representative architectures, and we report the improved
results on SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet. Moreover, we achieve competitive
single-model performance on CIFAR-100 with 16.53% error rate compared to
state-of-the-art.

 <dc:title>Quantified Derandomization of Linear Threshold Circuits</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tell, Roei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the prominent current challenges in complexity theory is the attempt
to prove lower bounds for $TC^0$, the class of constant-depth, polynomial-size
circuits with majority gates. Relying on the results of Williams (2013), an
appealing approach to prove such lower bounds is to construct a non-trivial
derandomization algorithm for $TC^0$. In this work we take a first step towards
the latter goal, by proving the first positive results regarding the
derandomization of $TC^0$ circuits of depth $d&gt;2$.
  Our first main result is a quantified derandomization algorithm for $TC^0$
circuits with a super-linear number of wires. Specifically, we construct an
algorithm that gets as input a $TC^0$ circuit $C$ over $n$ input bits with
depth $d$ and $n^{1+\exp(-d)}$ wires, runs in almost-polynomial-time, and
distinguishes between the case that $C$ rejects at most $2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs
and the case that $C$ accepts at most $2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs. In fact, our
algorithm works even when the circuit $C$ is a linear threshold circuit, rather
than just a $TC^0$ circuit (i.e., $C$ is a circuit with linear threshold gates,
which are stronger than majority gates).
  Our second main result is that even a modest improvement of our quantified
derandomization algorithm would yield a non-trivial algorithm for standard
derandomization of all of $TC^0$, and would consequently imply that
$NEXP\not\subseteq TC^0$. Specifically, if there exists a quantified
derandomization algorithm that gets as input a $TC^0$ circuit with depth $d$
and $n^{1+O(1/d)}$ wires (rather than $n^{1+\exp(-d)}$ wires), runs in time at
most $2^{n^{\exp(-d)}}$, and distinguishes between the case that $C$ rejects at
most $2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs and the case that $C$ accepts at most
$2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs, then there exists an algorithm with running time
$2^{n^{1-\Omega(1)}}$ for standard derandomization of $TC^0$.

space models. The method is applied to demand forecasting in the context of a
large e-commerce platform, paying special attention to intermittent and bursty
target statistics. Inference is approximated by the Newton-Raphson algorithm,
reduced to linear-time Kalman smoothing, which allows us to operate on several
orders of magnitude larger problems than previous related work. In a study on
large real-world sales datasets, our method outperforms competing approaches on
fast and medium moving items.

 <dc:description>  Appropriate comments of code snippets provide insight for code functionality,
which are helpful for program comprehension. However, due to the great cost of
authoring with the comments, many code projects do not contain adequate
comments. Automatic comment generation techniques have been proposed to
generate comments from pieces of code in order to alleviate the human efforts
in annotating the code. Most existing approaches attempt to exploit certain
correlations (usually manually given) between code and generated comments,
which could be easily violated if the coding patterns change and hence the
performance of comment generation declines. In this paper, we first build
C2CGit, a large dataset from open projects in GitHub, which is more than
20$\times$ larger than existing datasets. Then we propose a new attention
module called Code Attention to translate code to comments, which is able to
utilize the domain features of code snippets, such as symbols and identifiers.
We make ablation studies to determine effects of different parts in Code
Attention. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed module has better
performance over existing approaches in both BLEU and METEOR.

 <dc:description>  While deep reinforcement learning techniques have recently produced
considerable achievements on many decision-making problems, their use in
robotics has largely been limited to simulated worlds or restricted motions,
since unconstrained trial-and-error interactions in the real world can have
undesirable consequences for the robot or its environment. To overcome such
limitations, we propose a novel reinforcement learning architecture, OptLayer,
that takes as inputs possibly unsafe actions predicted by a neural network and
outputs the closest actions that satisfy chosen constraints. While learning
control policies often requires carefully crafted rewards and penalties while
exploring the range of possible actions, OptLayer ensures that only safe
actions are actually executed and unsafe predictions are penalized during
training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on robot reaching
tasks, both simulated and in the real world.

 <dc:title>SwGridNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on Grid Topology

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve remarkable performance on
image classification tasks. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that
generalization abilities are more important than the depth of neural networks
for improving performance on image classification tasks. Herein, a new neural
network called SwGridNet is proposed. A SwGridNet includes many convolutional
processing units which connect mutually as a grid network where many processing
paths exist between input and output. A SwGridNet has high generalization
capability because the multipath architecture has the same effect of ensemble
learning. As described in this paper, details of the SwGridNet network
architecture are presented. Experimentally obtained results presented in this
paper show that SwGridNets respectively achieve test error rates of 2.95% and
15.67% in a CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks. The results indicate
that the SwGridNet performance approximates that of state-of-the-art deep CNNs.

 <dc:description>  With a strong motivational background in search engine optimization the
amount of structured data on the web is growing rapidly. The main search engine
providers are promising great increase in visibility through annotation of the
web page's content with the vocabulary of schema.org and thus providing it as
structured data. But besides the usage by search engines the data can be used
in various other ways, for example for automatic processing of annotated web
services or actions. In this work we present an approach to consume and process
schema.org annotated data on the web and give an idea how a best practice can
look like.

 <dc:description>  The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will have far-reaching effects
on road traffic in cities and on highways.The implementation of automated
highway system (AHS), possibly with a dedicated lane only for AVs, is believed
to be a requirement to maximise the benefit from the advantages of AVs. We
study the ramifications of an increasing percentage of AVs on the traffic
system with and without the introduction of a dedicated AV lane on highways. We
conduct an analytical evaluation of a simplified scenario and a macroscopic
simulation of the city of Singapore under user equilibrium conditions with a
realistic traffic demand. We present findings regarding average travel time,
fuel consumption, throughput and road usage. Instead of only considering the
highways, we also focus on the effects on the remaining road network. Our
results show a reduction of average travel time and fuel consumption as a
result of increasing the portion of AVs in the system. We show that the
introduction of an AV lane is not beneficial in terms of average commute time.
Examining the effects of the AV population only, however, the AV lane provides
a considerable reduction of travel time (approx. 25%) at the price of delaying
conventional vehicles (approx. 7%). Furthermore a notable shift of travel
demand away from the highways towards major and small roads is noticed in early
stages of AV penetration of the system. Finally, our findings show that after a
certain threshold percentage of AVs the differences between AV and no AV lane
scenarios become negligible.

 <dc:description>  We present our approach for robotic perception in cluttered scenes that led
to winning the recent Amazon Robotics Challenge (ARC) 2017. Next to small
objects with shiny and transparent surfaces, the biggest challenge of the 2017
competition was the introduction of unseen categories. In contrast to
traditional approaches which require large collections of annotated data and
many hours of training, the task here was to obtain a robust perception
pipeline with only few minutes of data acquisition and training time. To that
end, we present two strategies that we explored. One is a deep metric learning
approach that works in three separate steps: semantic-agnostic boundary
detection, patch classification and pixel-wise voting. The other is a
fully-supervised semantic segmentation approach with efficient dataset
collection. We conduct an extensive analysis of the two methods on our ARC 2017
dataset. Interestingly, only few examples of each class are sufficient to
fine-tune even very deep convolutional neural networks for this specific task.

 <dc:description>  Context: While there are many success stories of achieving high reuse and
improved quality using software platforms, there is a need to investigate the
issues and challenges organizations face when transitioning to a software
platform strategy.
  Objective: This case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the
challenges faced when a medium-scale organization decided to adopt software
platforms. The study also reveals how new trends in software engineering (i.e.
agile methods, distributed development and flat management structures)
interplayed with the chosen platform strategy.
  Method: We used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at
a medium-scale company in Scandinavia. We conducted 16 in-depth interviews with
representatives of eight different teams, three of which were working on three
separate platforms. The collected data was analyzed using Grounded Theory.
  Results: The findings identify four classes of challenges, namely: business
challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges, and people
challenges. The article explains how these findings can be used to help
researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions and required tool
support.
  Conclusion: The organization's decision to adopt a software platform strategy
introduced a number of challenges. These challenges need to be understood and
addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse. Researchers need to further
investigate issues such as supportive organizational structures for platform
development, the role of agile methods in software platforms, tool support for
testing and continuous integration in the platform context, and reuse
recommendation systems.

 <dc:description>  Women have been shown to be effective leaders in many team-based situations.
However, it is also well-recognized that women are underrepresented in
engineering and technology areas, which leads to wasted efforts and a lack of
diversity in professional organizations. Although studies about gender and
leadership are rich, research focusing on engineering-specific activities, are
scarce. To react on this gap, we explored the experience of female leaders of
software development projects and possible context factors that influence
leadership effectiveness. The study was conducted as a longitudinal multiple
case study. Data was collected from survey, interviews, observation and project
reports. In this work, we reported some preliminary findings related to
leadership style, team perception on leadership and team-task context factors.
We found a strong correlation between perceived team leadership and task
management. We also observed a potential association between human-oriented
leading approach in low customer involvement scenarios and task-oriented
leading approach in high customer involvement situations.

 <dc:description>  Satellite radar altimetry is one of the most powerful techniques for
measuring sea surface height variations, with applications ranging from
operational oceanography to climate research. Over open oceans, altimeter
return waveforms generally correspond to the Brown model, and by inversion,
estimated shape parameters provide mean surface height and wind speed. However,
in coastal areas or over inland waters, the waveform shape is often distorted
by land influence, resulting in peaks or fast decaying trailing edges. As a
result, derived sea surface heights are then less accurate and waveforms need
to be reprocessed by sophisticated algorithms. To this end, this work suggests
a novel Spatio-Temporal Altimetry Retracking (STAR) technique. We show that
STAR enables the derivation of sea surface heights over the open ocean as well
as over coastal regions of at least the same quality as compared to existing
retracking methods, but for a larger number of cycles and thus retaining more
useful data. Novel elements of our method are (a) integrating information from
spatially and temporally neighboring waveforms through a conditional random
field approach, (b) sub-waveform detection, where relevant sub-waveforms are
separated from corrupted or non-relevant parts through a sparse representation
approach, and (c) identifying the final best set of sea surfaces heights from
multiple likely heights using Dijkstra's algorithm. We apply STAR to data from
the Jason-1, Jason-2 and Envisat missions for study sites in the Gulf of
Trieste, Italy and in the coastal region of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
estuary, Bangladesh. We compare to several established and recent retracking
methods, as well as to tide gauge data. Our experiments suggest that the
obtained sea surface heights are significantly less affected by outliers when
compared to results obtained by other approaches.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have seen a trend towards decentralisation - from initiatives on
decentralized web to decentralized network infrastructures (e.g community
networks). In this position paper, we present an architectural vision for
decentralising cloud service infrastructures. Our vision is on the notion of
community cloud infrastructures on top of decentralised access infrastructures
i.e. community networks, using resources pooled from the community. Our
architectural vision takes into consideration some of the fundamental
challenges of integrating the current state of the art virtualisation
technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) into community
infrastructures which are highly unreliable. Our proposed design goal is to
include lightweight virtualization and fault tolerance mechanisms into the
architecture to ensure sufficient level of reliability to support critical
applications.

 <dc:description>  Robot-assisted deployment of fenestrated stent grafts in Fenestrated
Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR) requires accurate geometrical alignment.
Currently, this process is guided by 2D fluoroscopy, which is uninformative and
error prone. In this paper, a real-time framework is proposed to instantiate
the 3D shape of a fenestrated stent graft based on only a single low-dose 2D
fluoroscopic image. Firstly, the fenestrated stent graft was placed with
markers. Secondly, the 3D pose of each stent segment was instantiated by the
RPnP (Robust Perspective-n-Point) method. Thirdly, the 3D shape of the whole
stent graft was instantiated via graft gap interpolation. Focal-Unet was
proposed to segment the markers from 2D fluoroscopic images to achieve
semi-automatic marker detection. The proposed framework was validated on five
patient-specific 3D printed phantoms of aortic aneurysms and three stent grafts
with new marker placements, showing an average distance error of 1-3mm and an
average angle error of 4 degree.

 <dc:description>  Every language recognized by the Lambek calculus with brackets is
context-free. This is shown by combining an observation by J\&quot;ager with an
entirely straightforward adaptation of the method Pentus used for the original
Lambek calculus. The case of the variant of the calculus allowing sequents with

the multiplicative unit.

 <dc:description>  An analytical model of Human-Robot (H-R) coordination is presented for a
Human-Robot system executing a collaborative task in which a high level of
synchronization among the agents is desired. The influencing parameters and
decision variables that affect the waiting time of the collaborating agents
were analyzed. The performance of the model was evaluated based on the costs of
the waiting times of each of the agents at the pre-defined spatial point of
handover. The model was tested for two cases of dynamic H-R coordination
scenarios. Results indicate that this analytical model can be used as a tool
for designing an H-R system that optimizes the agent waiting time thereby
increasing the joint-efficiency of the system and making coordination fluent
and natural.

 <dc:description>  Many physical problems involve spatial and temporal inhomogeneities that
require a very fine discretization in order to be accurately simulated. Using
an adaptive mesh, a high level of resolution is used in the appropriate areas
while keeping a coarse mesh elsewhere. This idea allows to save time and
computations, but represents a challenge for distributed-memory environments.
The MARS project (for Multiphase Adaptative Refinement Solver) intends to
assess the parallel library p4est for adaptive mesh, in a case of a finite
volume scheme applied to two-phase flows. Besides testing the library's
performances, particularly for load balancing, its user-friendliness in use and
implementation are also exhibited here. First promising 3D simulations are even
presented.

 <dc:description>  The computational complexity of the Vertex Coloring problem is known for all
hereditary classes of graphs defined by forbidding two connected five-vertex
induced subgraphs, except for seven cases. We prove the polynomial-time
solvability of four of these problems: for ($P_5$, dart)-free graphs, ($P_5$,
banner)-free graphs, ($P_5$, bull)-free graphs, and (fork, bull)-free graphs.

 <dc:title>Core-biased random walks in complex networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mondragon, Raul J</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A simple strategy to explore a network is to use a random-walk where the
walker jumps from one node to an adjacent node at random. It is known that
biasing the random jump, the walker can explore every walk of the same length
with equal probability, this is known as a Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW).
To construct a MERW requires the knowledge of the largest eigenvalue and
corresponding eigenvector of the adjacency matrix, this requires global
knowledge of the network. When this global information is not available, it is
possible to construct a biased random walk which approximates the MERW using
only the degree of the nodes, a local property. Here we show that it is also
possible to construct a good approximation to a MERW by biasing the random walk
via the properties of the network's core, which is a mesoscale property of the
network. We present some examples showing that the core-biased random walk
outperforms the degree-biased random walks.

 <dc:description>  We study three notions of directability of fuzzy automata akin to the D1-,
D2- and D3-directability of nondeterministic automata. Thus an input word $w$
of a fuzzy automaton is D1-directing if a fixed single state is reachable by
$w$ from all states, D2-directing if exactly the same states are reachable by
$w$ from every state, and D3-directing if there is a state reachable by $w$
from every state. We study the various sets of directing words of fuzzy
automata, prove that the directability properties are decidable, and show how
such results can be deduced from the theory of directable nondeterministic
automata. Moreover, we establish the closure properties of the different
classes of directable fuzzy automata under the class operations of forming
subautomata, homomorphic images and finite direct products.

 <dc:description>  The Viola-Jones face detection algorithm was (and still is) a quite popular
face detector. In spite of the numerous face detection techniques that have
been recently presented, there are many research works that are still based on
the Viola-Jones algorithm because of its simplicity. In this paper, we study
the influence of a set of blind pre-processing methods on the face detection
rate using the Viola-Jones algorithm. We focus on two aspects of improvement,
specifically badly illuminated faces and blurred faces. Many methods for
lighting invariant and deblurring are used in order to improve the detection
accuracy. We want to avoid using blind pre-processing methods that may obstruct
the face detector. To that end, we perform two sets of experiments. The first
set is performed to avoid any blind pre-processing method that may hurt the
face detector. The second set is performed to study the effect of the selected
pre-processing methods on images that suffer from hard conditions. We present
two manners of applying the pre-processing method to the image prior to being
used by the Viola-Jones face detector. Four different datasets are used to draw
a coherent conclusion about the potential improvement caused by using prior
enhanced images. The results demonstrate that some of the pre-processing
methods may hurt the accuracy of Viola-Jones face detection algorithm. However,
other pre-processing methods have an evident positive impact on the accuracy of
the face detector. Overall, we recommend three simple and fast blind
photometric normalization methods as a pre-processing step in order to improve
the accuracy of the pre-trained Viola-Jones face detector.

 <dc:description>  Optimal physical layer multicasting (PLM) is an NP-hard problem that for
simplicity has been studied under idealistic assumptions, e.g., availability of
perfect channel state information (CSI), both at the base station (BS) and at
the user terminals (UTs). With the advent of massive
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), PLM has become more challenging, as the
computational complexity of the precoder design is proportional to the number
of BS antennas. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing
computationally efficient precoders that account for practical CSI acquisition.
We derive achievable spectral efficiency expressions for the proposed
precoders. Then we introduce a novel problem formulation for the max-min
fairness power control that accounts the CSI acquisition overhead, uplink
training and downlink transmission powers. We solve this problem and find the
optimal uplink and downlink power control policies in closed form. Using
numerical simulations, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed schemes
compared to the-state-of-the-art PLM schemes for massive MIMO systems.

 <dc:description>  Single-pixel imaging is an indirect imaging technique which utilizes
simplified optical hardware and advanced computational methods. It offers novel
solutions for hyper-spectral imaging, polarimetric imaging, three-dimensional
imaging, holographic imaging, optical encryption and imaging through scattering
media. The main limitations for its use come from relatively high measurement
and reconstruction times. In this paper we propose to reduce the required
signal acquisition time by using a novel sampling scheme based on a random
selection of Morlet wavelets convolved with white noise. While such functions
exhibit random properties, they are locally determined by Morlet wavelet
parameters. The proposed method is equivalent to random sampling of the
properly selected part of the feature space, which maps the measured images
accurately both in the spatial and spatial frequency domains. We compare both
numerically and experimentally the image quality obtained with our sampling
protocol against widely-used sampling with Walsh-Hadamard or noiselet
functions. The results show considerable improvement over the former methods,
enabling single-pixel imaging at low compression rates on the order of a few
percent.

 <dc:description>  Recent approaches to verifying programs in separation logics for concurrency
have used state transition systems (STSs) to specify the atomic operations of
programs. A key challenge in the setting has been to compose such STSs into
larger ones, while enabling programs specified under one STS to be linked to a
larger one, without reverification. This paper develops a notion of morphism
between two STSs which permits such lifting. The morphisms are a constructive
form of simulation between the STSs, and lead to a general and concise proof
system. We illustrate the concept and its generality on several disparate
examples, including staged construction of a readers/writers lock and its
proof, and of proofs about quiescence when concurrent programs are executed
without external interference.

 <dc:title>Improving Language Modelling with Noise-contrastive estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural language models do not scale well when the vocabulary is large.
Noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) is a sampling-based method that allows for
fast learning with large vocabularies. Although NCE has shown promising
performance in neural machine translation, it was considered to be an
unsuccessful approach for language modelling. A sufficient investigation of the
hyperparameters in the NCE-based neural language models was also missing. In
this paper, we showed that NCE can be a successful approach in neural language
modelling when the hyperparameters of a neural network are tuned appropriately.
We introduced the 'search-then-converge' learning rate schedule for NCE and
designed a heuristic that specifies how to use this schedule. The impact of the
other important hyperparameters, such as the dropout rate and the weight
initialisation range, was also demonstrated. We showed that appropriate tuning
of NCE-based neural language models outperforms the state-of-the-art
single-model methods on a popular benchmark.

 <dc:description>  This article offers the first characterisation of mixed Nash equilibria (MNE)
for a wireless system with full-duplex capable terminals that share a common
channel via Aloha-based contention. Focussing on a simple grid topology, we
prove that mixed MNE exist only if proportionality, driven by the accuracy of
self-interference cancellation, is granted between the cost undergone for full-
and half-duplex operations. The analysis shows how a proper selection of such
costs allows MNE that are also optimal from a network viewpoint in terms of
aggregate throughput. The sensitivity of system performance to costs is tackled
and discussed considering the price of anarchy.

 <dc:description>  Most machine learning and deep neural network algorithms rely on certain
iterative algorithms to optimise their utility/cost functions, e.g. Stochastic
Gradient Descent. In distributed learning, the networked nodes have to work
collaboratively to update the model parameters, and the way how they proceed is
referred to as synchronous parallel design (or barrier control). Synchronous
parallel protocol is the building block of any distributed learning framework,
and its design has direct impact on the performance and scalability of the
system.
  In this paper, we propose a new barrier control technique - Probabilistic
Synchronous Parallel (PSP). Com- paring to the previous Bulk Synchronous
Parallel (BSP), Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP), and (Asynchronous Parallel)
ASP, the proposed solution e ectively improves both the convergence speed and
the scalability of the SGD algorithm by introducing a sampling primitive into
the system. Moreover, we also show that the sampling primitive can be applied
atop of the existing barrier control mechanisms to derive fully distributed
PSP-based synchronous parallel.
  We not only provide a thorough theoretical analysis1 on the convergence of
PSP-based SGD algorithm, but also implement a full-featured distributed
learning framework called Actor and perform intensive evaluation atop of it.

 <dc:description>  The heavy burdens of computation and off-chip traffic impede deploying the
large scale convolution neural network on embedded platforms. As CNN is
attributed to the strong endurance to computation errors, employing block
floating point (BFP) arithmetics in CNN accelerators could save the hardware
cost and data traffics efficiently, while maintaining the classification
accuracy. In this paper, we verify the effects of word width definitions in BFP
to the CNN performance without retraining. Several typical CNN models,
including VGG16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and GoogLeNet, were tested in this paper.
Experiments revealed that 8-bit mantissa, including sign bit, in BFP
representation merely induced less than 0.3% accuracy loss. In addition, we
investigate the computational errors in theory and develop the noise-to-signal
ratio (NSR) upper bound, which provides the promising guidance for BFP based
CNN engine design.

 <dc:title>Sentence Correction Based on Large-scale Language Modelling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wen, Ji</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the further development of informatization, more and more data is stored
in the form of text. There are some loss of text during their generation and
transmission. The paper aims to establish a language model based on the
large-scale corpus to complete the restoration of missing text. In this paper,
we introduce a novel measurement to find the missing words, and a way of
establishing a comprehensive candidate lexicon to insert the correct choice of
words. The paper also introduces some effective optimization methods, which
largely improve the efficiency of the text restoration and shorten the time of
dealing with 1000 sentences into 3.6 seconds. \keywords{ language model,

 <dc:title>OpenCL Actors - Adding Data Parallelism to Actor-based Programming with
  CAF</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hiesgen, Raphael</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  The actor model of computation has been designed for a seamless support of
concurrency and distribution. However, it remains unspecific about data
parallel program flows, while available processing power of modern many core
hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or coprocessors increases the
relevance of data parallelism for general-purpose computation.
  In this work, we introduce OpenCL-enabled actors to the C++ Actor Framework
(CAF). This offers a high level interface for accessing any OpenCL device
without leaving the actor paradigm. The new type of actor is integrated into
the runtime environment of CAF and gives rise to transparent message passing in
distributed systems on heterogeneous hardware. Following the actor logic in
CAF, OpenCL kernels can be composed while encapsulated in C++ actors, hence
operate in a multi-stage fashion on data resident at the GPU. Developers are
thus enabled to build complex data parallel programs from primitives without
leaving the actor paradigm, nor sacrificing performance. Our evaluations on
commodity GPUs, an Nvidia TESLA, and an Intel PHI reveal the expected linear
scaling behavior when offloading larger workloads. For sub-second duties, the
efficiency of offloading was found to largely differ between devices. Moreover,
our findings indicate a negligible overhead over programming with the native
OpenCL API.

 <dc:description>  Purpose: Advanced usage of Web Analytics tools allows to capture the content
of user queries. Despite their relevant nature, the manual analysis of large
volumes of user queries is problematic. This paper demonstrates the potential
of using information extraction techniques and Linked Data to gather a better
understanding of the nature of user queries in an automated manner.
  Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a large-scale case-study
conducted at the Royal Library of Belgium consisting of a data set of 83 854
queries resulting from 29 812 visits over a 12 month period of the historical
newspapers platform BelgicaPress. By making use of information extraction
methods, knowledge bases and various authority files, this paper presents the
possibilities and limits to identify what percentage of end users are looking
for person and place names.
  Findings: Based on a quantitative assessment, our method can successfully
identify the majority of person and place names from user queries. Due to the
specific character of user queries and the nature of the knowledge bases used,
a limited amount of queries remained too ambiguous to be treated in an
automated manner.
  Originality/value: This paper demonstrates in an empirical manner both the
possibilities and limits of gaining more insights from user queries extracted
from a Web Analytics tool and analysed with the help of information extraction
tools and knowledge bases. Methods and tools used are generalisable and can be
reused by other collection holders.

 <dc:description>  We consider a problem, which we call secure grouping, of dividing a number of
parties into some subsets (groups) in the following manner: Each party has to
know the other members of his/her group, while he/she may not know anything
about how the remaining parties are divided (except for certain public
predetermined constraints, such as the number of parties in each group). In
this paper, we construct an information-theoretically secure protocol using a
deck of physical cards to solve the problem, which is jointly executable by the
parties themselves without a trusted third party. Despite the non-triviality
and the potential usefulness of the secure grouping, our proposed protocol is
fairly simple to describe and execute. Our protocol is based on algebraic
properties of conjugate permutations. A key ingredient of our protocol is our
new techniques to apply multiplication and inverse operations to hidden
permutations (i.e., those encoded by using face-down cards), which would be of
independent interest and would have various potential applications.

 <dc:description>  A Blockchain is a global shared infrastructure where cryptocurrency
transactions among addresses are recorded, validated and made publicly
available in a peer- to-peer network. To date the best known and important
cryptocurrency is the bitcoin. In this paper we focus on this cryptocurrency
and in particular on the modeling of the Bitcoin Blockchain by using the Petri
Nets formalism. The proposed model allows us to quickly collect information
about identities owning Bitcoin addresses and to recover measures and
statistics on the Bitcoin network. By exploiting algebraic formalism, we
reconstructed an Entities network associated to Blockchain transactions
gathering together Bitcoin addresses into the single entity holding permits to
manage Bitcoins held by those addresses. The model allows also to identify a
set of behaviours typical of Bitcoin owners, like that of using an address only
once, and to reconstruct chains for this behaviour together with the rate of
firing. Our model is highly flexible and can easily be adapted to include
different features of the Bitcoin crypto-currency system.

 <dc:description>  The &quot;Loving AI&quot; project involves developing software enabling humanoid robots
to interact with people in loving and compassionate ways, and to promote
people' self-understanding and self-transcendence. Currently the project
centers on the Hanson Robotics robot &quot;Sophia&quot; -- specifically, on supplying
Sophia with personality content and cognitive, linguistic, perceptual and
behavioral content aimed at enabling loving interactions supportive of human
self-transcendence. In September 2017 a small pilot study was conducted,
involving the Sophia robot leading human subjects through dialogues and
exercises focused on meditation, visualization and relaxation. The pilot was an
apparent success, qualitatively demonstrating the viability of the approach and
the ability of appropriate human-robot interaction to increase human well-being
and advance human consciousness.

 <dc:description>  Remote sensing satellite data offer the unique possibility to map land use
land cover transformations by providing spatially explicit information.
However, detection of short-term processes and land use patterns of high
spatial-temporal variability is a challenging task. We present a novel
framework using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data and machine learning techniques,
namely Discriminative Markov Random Fields with spatio-temporal priors, and
Import Vector Machines, in order to advance the mapping of land cover
characterized by short-term changes. Our study region covers a current
deforestation frontier in the Brazilian state Par\'{a} with land cover
dominated by primary forests, different types of pasture land and secondary
vegetation, and land use dominated by short-term processes such as
slash-and-burn activities. The data set comprises multi-temporal TerraSAR-X
imagery acquired over the course of the 2014 dry season, as well as optical
data (RapidEye, Landsat) for reference. Results show that land use land cover
is reliably mapped, resulting in spatially adjusted overall accuracies of up to
$79\%$ in a five class setting, yet limitations for the differentiation of
different pasture types remain. The proposed method is applicable on
multi-temporal data sets, and constitutes a feasible approach to map land use
land cover in regions that are affected by high-frequent temporal changes.

 <dc:description>  This paper stands in the context of reinforcement learning with partial
observability and limited data. In this setting, we focus on the tradeoff
between asymptotic bias (suboptimality with unlimited data) and overfitting
(additional suboptimality due to limited data), and theoretically show that
while potentially increasing the asymptotic bias, a smaller state
representation decreases the risk of overfitting. Our analysis relies on
expressing the quality of a state representation by bounding L1 error terms of
the associated belief states. Theoretical results are empirically illustrated
when the state representation is a truncated history of observations. Finally,
we also discuss and empirically illustrate how using function approximators and
adapting the discount factor may enhance the tradeoff between asymptotic bias
and overfitting.

 <dc:description>  Some researchers have proposed using non-Euclidean metrics for clustering
data points. Generally, the metric should recognize that two points in the same
cluster are close, even if their Euclidean distance is far. Multiple proposals
have been suggested, including the Edge-Squared Metric (a specific example of a
graph geodesic) and the Nearest Neighbor Metric.
  In this paper, we prove that the edge-squared and nearest-neighbor metrics
are in fact equivalent. Previous best work showed that the edge-squared metric
was a 3-approximation of the Nearest Neighbor metric. This paper represents one
of the first proofs of equating a continuous metric with a discrete metric,
using non-trivial discrete methods. Our proof uses the Kirszbraun theorem (also
known as the Lipschitz Extension Theorem and Brehm's Extension Theorem), a
notable theorem in functional analysis and computational geometry.
  The results of our paper, combined with the results of Hwang, Damelin, and
Hero, tell us that the Nearest Neighbor distance on i.i.d samples of a density
is a reasonable constant approximation of a natural density-based distance
function.

 <dc:description>  D. Bennequin and P. Baudot introduced a cohomological construction adapted to
information theory, called &quot;information cohomology&quot; (see &quot;The homological
nature of Entropy&quot;, 2015). Our text serves as a detailed introduction to
information cohomology, containing the necessary background in probability
theory and homological algebra. It makes explicit the link with topos theory,
as introduced by Grothendieck, Verdier and their collaborators in the SGA IV.
It also contains several new constructions and results. (1) We define
generalized information structures, as categories of finite random variables
related by a notion of extension or refinement; probability spaces are models
(or representations) for these general structures. Generalized information
structures form a category with finite products and coproducts. We prove that
information cohomology is invariant under isomorphisms of generalized
structures. (2) We prove that the relatively-free bar construction gives a
projective object for the computation of cohomology. (3) We provide detailed
computations of $H^1$ and describe the &quot;degenerate&quot; cases. (4) We establish the
homological nature of Tsallis entropy. (5) We re-interpret Shannon's axioms for
a 'measure of choice' in the light of this theory and provide a combinatorial
justification for his recurrence formula.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method to build quantum memristors in quantum photonic
platforms. We firstly design an effective beam splitter, which is tunable in
real-time, by means of a Mach-Zehnder-type array with two equal 50:50 beam
splitters and a tunable retarder, which allows us to control its reflectivity.
Then, we show that this tunable beam splitter, when equipped with weak
measurements and classical feedback, behaves as a quantum memristor. Indeed, in
order to prove its quantumness, we show how to codify quantum information in
the coherent beams. Moreover, we estimate the memory capability of the quantum
memristor. Finally, we show the feasibility of the proposed setup in integrated
quantum photonics.

 <dc:description>  The study, based on the Web of Science, analyses 758 articles published from
2000 to 2014. Our analysis includes the publications' output, authorship,
institutional and country patterns of production, citations and collaboration.
A Social Network Analysis was conducted to identify primary groups of
researchers and institutions and the collaboration between countries. The study
reveals that 1097 authors and 453 Institutions have contributed to the journal.
The collaboration index has increased progressively, and the average degree of
collaboration during the study period was 1.98. The majority of the papers were
contributed by professionals affiliated with a university. Highly cited papers
address online and digital environments, e-learning systems, mobile services,
web 2.0 and citation analyses. This work is a bibliometric analysis of a
leading journal in library and information science, Online Information Review.

 <dc:description>  Conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) typically performs
multi-level pattern recognition tasks that map the acoustic speech waveform
into a hierarchy of speech units. But, it is widely known that information loss
in the earlier stage can propagate through the later stages. After the
resurgence of deep learning, interest has emerged in the possibility of
developing a purely end-to-end ASR system from the raw waveform to the
transcription without any predefined alignments and hand-engineered models.
However, the successful attempts in end-to-end architecture still used
spectral-based features, while the successful attempts in using raw waveform
were still based on the hybrid deep neural network - Hidden Markov model
(DNN-HMM) framework. In this paper, we construct the first end-to-end
attention-based encoder-decoder model to process directly from raw speech
waveform to the text transcription. We called the model as &quot;Attention-based
Wav2Text&quot;. To assist the training process of the end-to-end model, we propose
to utilize a feature transfer learning. Experimental results also reveal that
the proposed Attention-based Wav2Text model directly with raw waveform could
achieve a better result in comparison with the attentional encoder-decoder
model trained on standard front-end filterbank features.

 <dc:title>Partition-based Unscented Kalman Filter for Reconfigurable Battery Pack
  State Estimation using an Electrochemical Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Couto, Luis D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kinnaert, Michel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Accurate state estimation of large-scale lithium-ion battery packs is
necessary for the advanced control of batteries, which could potentially
increase their lifetime through e.g. reconfiguration. To tackle this problem,
an enhanced reduced-order electrochemical model is used here. This model allows
considering a wider operating range and thermal coupling between cells, the
latter turning out to be significant. The resulting nonlinear model is
exploited for state estimation through unscented Kalman filters (UKF). A sensor
network composed of one sensor node per battery cell is deployed. Each sensor
node is equipped with a local UKF, which uses available local measurements
together with additional information coming from neighboring sensor nodes. Such
state estimation scheme gives rise to a partition-based unscented Kalman filter
(PUKF). The method is validated on data from a detailed simulator for a battery
pack comprised of six cells, with reconfiguration capabilities. The results
show that the distributed approach outperforms the centralized one in terms of
computation time at the expense of a very low increase of mean-square
estimation error.

 <dc:description>  Objective. The purpose of this work is to analyse the knowledge structure and
trends in scientific research in the Online Information Reviews journal by
bibliometric analysis of key words and social network analysis of co-words.
Methods. Key words included in a set of 758 papers included in the Web of
Science database from 2000 to 2014 were analysed. We conducted a subject
analysis considering the key words assigned to papers. A social network
analysis was also conducted to identify the number of co-occurrences between
key words (co-words). The Pajek software was used to create and graphically
visualize the networks. Results. Internet is the most frequent key word (n=219)
and the most central in the network of co-words, strongly associated with
Information retrieval, search engines, the World Wide Web, libraries and users
Conclusions. Information science, as represented by Online Information Review
in the present study, is an evolving discipline that draws on literature from a
relatively wide range of subjects. Although Online Information Review appears
to have well-defined and established research topics, the journal also changes
rapidly to embrace new lines of research.

 <dc:description>  Compressed bitmap indexes are used in systems such as Git or Oracle to
accelerate queries. They represent sets and often support operations such as
unions, intersections, differences, and symmetric differences. Several
important systems such as Elasticsearch, Apache Spark, Netflix's Atlas,
LinkedIn's Pivot, Metamarkets' Druid, Pilosa, Apache Hive, Apache Tez,
Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services and Apache Kylin rely on a specific type
of compressed bitmap index called Roaring. We present an optimized software
library written in C implementing Roaring bitmaps: CRoaring. It benefits from
several algorithms designed for the single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD)
instructions available on commodity processors. In particular, we present
vectorized algorithms to compute the intersection, union, difference and
symmetric difference between arrays. We benchmark the library against a wide
range of competitive alternatives, identifying weaknesses and strengths in our
software. Our work is available under a liberal open-source license.

 <dc:title>Planar Graph Perfect Matching is in NC</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Is perfect matching in NC? That is, is there a deterministic fast parallel
algorithm for it? This has been an outstanding open question in theoretical
computer science for over three decades, ever since the discovery of RNC
matching algorithms. Within this question, the case of planar graphs has
remained an enigma: On the one hand, counting the number of perfect matchings
is far harder than finding one (the former is #P-complete and the latter is in
P), and on the other, for planar graphs, counting has long been known to be in
NC whereas finding one has resisted a solution.
  In this paper, we give an NC algorithm for finding a perfect matching in a
planar graph. Our algorithm uses the above-stated fact about counting matchings
in a crucial way. Several new ideas are needed, such as finding a point in the
interior of the minimum weight face of the perfect matching polytope and
finding a balanced odd tight set in NC.

 <dc:title>Challenging Neural Dialogue Models with Natural Data: Memory Networks
  Fail on Incremental Phenomena</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Natural, spontaneous dialogue proceeds incrementally on a word-by-word basis;
and it contains many sorts of disfluency such as mid-utterance/sentence
hesitations, interruptions, and self-corrections. But training data for machine
learning approaches to dialogue processing is often either cleaned-up or wholly
synthetic in order to avoid such phenomena. The question then arises of how
well systems trained on such clean data generalise to real spontaneous
dialogue, or indeed whether they are trainable at all on naturally occurring
dialogue data. To answer this question, we created a new corpus called bAbI+ by
systematically adding natural spontaneous incremental dialogue phenomena such
as restarts and self-corrections to the Facebook AI Research's bAbI dialogues
dataset. We then explore the performance of a state-of-the-art retrieval model,
MemN2N, on this more natural dataset. Results show that the semantic accuracy
of the MemN2N model drops drastically; and that although it is in principle
able to learn to process the constructions in bAbI+, it needs an impractical
amount of training data to do so. Finally, we go on to show that an
incremental, semantic parser -- DyLan -- shows 100% semantic accuracy on both
bAbI and bAbI+, highlighting the generalisation properties of linguistically
informed dialogue models.

 <dc:description>  The present study proposes a data-driven framework trained with high-fidelity
simulation results to facilitate decision making for combustor designs. At its
core is a surrogate model employing a machine-learning technique called
kriging, which is combined with data-driven basis functions to extract and
model the underlying coherent structures. This emulation framework encompasses
key design parameter sensitivity analysis, physics-guided classification of
design parameter sets, and flow evolution modeling for efficient design survey.
To better inform the model of quantifiable physical knowledge, a sensitivity
analysis using Sobol' indices and a decision tree are incorporated into the
framework. This information improves the surrogate model training process,
which employs basis functions as regression functions over the design space for
the kriging model. The novelty of the proposed approach is the construction of
the model through Common Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which allows for
data-reduction and extraction of common coherent structures. The accuracy of
prediction of mean flow features for new swirl injector designs is assessed and
the dynamic flowfield is captured in the form of power spectrum densities. This
data-driven framework also demonstrates the uncertainty quantification of
predictions, providing a metric for model fit. The significantly reduced
computation time required for evaluating new design points enables efficient
survey of the design space.

 <dc:description>  When applying Machine Learning techniques to problems, one must select model
parameters to ensure that the system converges but also does not become stuck
at the objective function's local minimum. Tuning these parameters becomes a
non-trivial task for large models and it is not always apparent if the user has
found the optimal parameters. We aim to automate the process of tuning a Neural
Network, (where only a limited number of parameter search attempts are
available) by implementing Bayesian Optimization. In particular, by assigning
Gaussian Process Priors to the parameter space, we utilize Bayesian
Optimization to tune an Artificial Neural Network used to learn the XOR
function, with the result of achieving higher prediction accuracy.

with quantum technologies. At variance with recent results on quantum
reinforcement learning with superconducting circuits [L. Lamata, Sci. Rep. 7,
1609 (2017)], in our current protocol coherent feedback during the learning
process is not required, enabling its implementation in a wide variety of
quantum systems. We consider diverse possible scenarios for an agent, an
environment, and a register that connects them, involving multiqubit and
multilevel systems, as well as open-system dynamics. We finally propose
possible implementations of this protocol in trapped ions and superconducting
circuits. The field of quantum reinforcement learning with quantum technologies
will enable enhanced quantum control, as well as more efficient machine
learning calculations.

 <dc:description>  The asymptotic restriction problem for tensors is to decide, given tensors
$s$ and $t$, whether the nth tensor power of $s$ can be obtained from the
$(n+o(n))$th tensor power of t by applying linear maps to the tensor legs (this
we call restriction), when $n$ goes to infinity. In this context, Volker
Strassen, striving to understand the complexity of matrix multiplication,
introduced in 1986 the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. Essentially, the
asymptotic restriction problem for a family of tensors $X$, closed under direct
sum and tensor product, reduces to finding all maps from $X$ to the reals that
are monotone under restriction, normalised on diagonal tensors, additive under
direct sum and multiplicative under tensor product, which Strassen named
spectral points. Strassen created the support functionals, which are spectral
points for oblique tensors, a strict subfamily of all tensors.
  Universal spectral points are spectral points for the family of all tensors.
The construction of nontrivial universal spectral points has been an open
problem for more than thirty years. We construct for the first time a family of
nontrivial universal spectral points over the complex numbers, using quantum
entropy and covariants: the quantum functionals. In the process we connect the
asymptotic spectrum to the quantum marginal problem and to the entanglement
polytope.
  To demonstrate the asymptotic spectrum, we reprove (in hindsight) recent
results on the cap set problem by reducing this problem to computing asymptotic
spectrum of the reduced polynomial multiplication tensor, a prime example of
Strassen. A better understanding of our universal spectral points construction
may lead to further progress on related questions. We additionally show that
the quantum functionals are an upper bound on the recently introduced
(multi-)slice rank.

 <dc:description>  Instrumenting and collecting annotated visual grasping datasets to train
modern machine learning algorithms can be extremely time-consuming and
expensive. An appealing alternative is to use off-the-shelf simulators to
render synthetic data for which ground-truth annotations are generated
automatically. Unfortunately, models trained purely on simulated data often
fail to generalize to the real world. We study how randomized simulated
environments and domain adaptation methods can be extended to train a grasping
system to grasp novel objects from raw monocular RGB images. We extensively
evaluate our approaches with a total of more than 25,000 physical test grasps,
studying a range of simulation conditions and domain adaptation methods,
including a novel extension of pixel-level domain adaptation that we term the
GraspGAN. We show that, by using synthetic data and domain adaptation, we are
able to reduce the number of real-world samples needed to achieve a given level
of performance by up to 50 times, using only randomly generated simulated
objects. We also show that by using only unlabeled real-world data and our
GraspGAN methodology, we obtain real-world grasping performance without any
real-world labels that is similar to that achieved with 939,777 labeled
real-world samples.

 <dc:description>  We investigate an end-to-end method for automatically inducing task-based
dialogue systems from small amounts of unannotated dialogue data. It combines
an incremental semantic grammar - Dynamic Syntax and Type Theory with Records
(DS-TTR) - with Reinforcement Learning (RL), where language generation and
dialogue management are a joint decision problem. The systems thus produced are
incremental: dialogues are processed word-by-word, shown previously to be
essential in supporting natural, spontaneous dialogue. We hypothesised that the
rich linguistic knowledge within the grammar should enable a combinatorially
large number of dialogue variations to be processed, even when trained on very
few dialogues. Our experiments show that our model can process 74% of the
Facebook AI bAbI dataset even when trained on only 0.13% of the data (5
dialogues). It can in addition process 65% of bAbI+, a corpus we created by
systematically adding incremental dialogue phenomena such as restarts and
self-corrections to bAbI. We compare our model with a state-of-the-art
retrieval model, MemN2N. We find that, in terms of semantic accuracy, MemN2N
shows very poor robustness to the bAbI+ transformations even when trained on
the full bAbI dataset.

 <dc:title>VLSI Designs for Joint Channel Estimation and Data Detection in Large

 <dc:description>  Channel estimation errors have a critical impact on the reliability of
wireless communication systems. While virtually all existing wireless receivers
separate channel estimation from data detection, it is well known that joint
channel estimation and data detection (JED) significantly outperforms
conventional methods at the cost of high computational complexity. In this
paper, we propose a novel JED algorithm and corresponding VLSI designs for
large single-input multiple-output (SIMO) wireless systems that use
constant-modulus constellations. The proposed algorithm is referred to as
PRojection Onto conveX hull (PrOX) and relies on biconvex relaxation (BCR),
which enables us to efficiently compute an approximate solution of the
maximum-likelihood JED problem. Since BCR solves a biconvex problem via
alternating optimization, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for
PrOX. We design a scalable, high-throughput VLSI architecture that uses a
linear array of processing elements to minimize hardware complexity. We develop
corresponding field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) designs, and we demonstrate that PrOX significantly
outperforms the only other existing JED design in terms of throughput,
hardware-efficiency, and energy-efficiency.

 <dc:description>  We apply sequence-to-sequence model to mitigate the impact of speech
recognition errors on open domain end-to-end dialog generation. We cast the
task as a domain adaptation problem where ASR transcriptions and original text
are in two different domains. In this paper, our proposed model includes two
individual encoders for each domain data and make their hidden states similar
to ensure the decoder predict the same dialog text. The method shows that the
sequence-to-sequence model can learn the ASR transcriptions and original text
pair having the same meaning and eliminate the speech recognition errors.
Experimental results on Cornell movie dialog dataset demonstrate that the
domain adaption system help the spoken dialog system generate more similar
responses with the original text answers.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a general-purpose conditioning method for neural networks called
FiLM: Feature-wise Linear Modulation. FiLM layers influence neural network
computation via a simple, feature-wise affine transformation based on
conditioning information. We show that FiLM layers are highly effective for
visual reasoning - answering image-related questions which require a
multi-step, high-level process - a task which has proven difficult for standard
deep learning methods that do not explicitly model reasoning. Specifically, we
show on visual reasoning tasks that FiLM layers 1) halve state-of-the-art error
for the CLEVR benchmark, 2) modulate features in a coherent manner, 3) are
robust to ablations and architectural modifications, and 4) generalize well to
challenging, new data from few examples or even zero-shot.

 <dc:title>Generic Wave Digital Emulation of Memristive Devices</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neuromorphic circuits mimic partial functionalities of brain in a
bio-inspired information processing sense in order to achieve similar
efficiencies as biological systems. While there are common mathematical models
for neurons, which can be realized as nonlinear oscillating circuits, an
electrical representation of the synaptic coupling between those is more
challenging. Since this coupling strength depends on the learning procedure in
the past, it should include a kind of memory. We believe that memristive
devices, which are essentially nonlinear resistors with memory, are potential
candidates for replacing synapses in neuromorphic circuits. Due to a huge
number of synapses in a complex neuromorphic circuit, pre-investigations based
on simulations of such systems can be very inefficient and time-consuming.
Flexible and real-time capable memristive emulators, which can directly be
incorporated into real circuits, can overcome this problem. In our approach, we
introduce a generic memristive emulator based on wave digital principles. The
proposed emulator is flexible, robust, efficient, and it preserves the
passivity of the real device. This, in turn, also makes it reusable independent
of a particular application. In the presented work, the emulation of different
mathematical models as well as of a real device based on physical models are
listed.

 <dc:description>  Event detection is a critical feature across any data-driven system as it
assists with the identification of nominal and anomalous behavior. Event
detection is all the more relevant in robotics as robots are required to
operate with greater autonomy and in increasingly unstructured environments.
Recently supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods along with
probabilistic models have played increasingly important roles in modeling and
predicting events. In this work, we present an accurate, robust, fast, and
versatile measure for skill and anomaly identification. Our work presents a
theoretical proof that establishes the link between the derivative of the HMM
log-likelihood and the latest emission probabilities. The result used a set of
verifiable suppositions and insights aided by the log-sum-exp trick. This link
established that the latest emission probabilities directly affected the
log-likelihood gradient. The key insight was the inverse relationship: that
from these gradients skills and anomalies could be identified. Our results
showed better performance across all metrics than related state-of-the art
results. The result is very significant for event detection problems as the
gradient-based measure can be broadly utilized in any subject area (finance,
bioinformatics, natural language processing, computer vision, etc) that
involves HMM modeling, including its extensions: parametric, nonparametric,
hierarchical, etc).

 <dc:description>  Machine learning (ML) is becoming a commodity. Numerous ML frameworks and
services are available to data holders who are not ML experts but want to train
predictive models on their data. It is important that ML models trained on
sensitive inputs (e.g., personal images or documents) not leak too much
information about the training data.
  We consider a malicious ML provider who supplies model-training code to the
data holder, does not observe the training, but then obtains white- or
black-box access to the resulting model. In this setting, we design and
implement practical algorithms, some of them very similar to standard ML
techniques such as regularization and data augmentation, that &quot;memorize&quot;
information about the training dataset in the model yet the model is as
accurate and predictive as a conventionally trained model. We then explain how
the adversary can extract memorized information from the model.
  We evaluate our techniques on standard ML tasks for image classification
(CIFAR10), face recognition (LFW and FaceScrub), and text analysis (20
Newsgroups and IMDB). In all cases, we show how our algorithms create models
that have high predictive power yet allow accurate extraction of subsets of
their training data.

 <dc:description>  Anticipating future actions is a key component of intelligence, specifically
when it applies to real-time systems, such as robots or autonomous cars. While
recent work has addressed prediction of raw RGB pixel values in future video
frames, we focus on predicting further in future by predicting a summary of
moving pixels through a sequence of frames which we call dynamic images. More
precisely, given a dynamic image, we predict the motion evolution through next
unseen video frames. Since this representation consists of a sequence of
frames, we can go one second further into the future compared to the previous
work in this field. We employed convolutional LSTMs to train our network on the
dynamic images in an unsupervised learning process. Since our final goal is
predicting the next action of a complex task such as an assembly task, we
exploited labelled actions for the recognition process on top of predicted
dynamic images. We show the effectiveness of our method on predicting the next
human action in the above-mentioned task through the two-step process of
predicting the next dynamic image and recognizing the action which it
represents.

 <dc:title>On the Discrimination Power and Effective Utilization of Active Learning
  Measures in Version Space Search</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rodler, Patrick</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Active Learning (AL) methods have proven cost-saving against passive
supervised methods in many application domains. An active learner, aiming to
find some target hypothesis, formulates sequential queries to some oracle. The
set of hypotheses consistent with the already answered queries is called
version space. Several query selection measures (QSMs) for determining the best
query to ask next have been proposed. Assuming binaryoutcome queries, we
analyze various QSMs wrt. to the discrimination power of their selected queries
within the current version space. As a result, we derive superiority and
equivalence relations between these QSMs and introduce improved versions of
existing QSMs to overcome identified issues. The obtained picture gives a hint
about which QSMs should preferably be used in pool-based AL scenarios.
Moreover, we deduce properties optimal queries wrt. QSMs must satisfy. Based on
these, we demonstrate how efficient heuristic search methods for optimal
queries in query synthesis AL scenarios can be devised.

a practical computing primitive equivalent to an electronic Boolean logic, one
should find a nonlinear phenomenon that overcomes weaknesses present in many
optical processing schemes. Ideally, the nonlinearity should provide a
functionally complete set of logic operations, enable ultrafast all-optical
programmability, and allow cascaded operations without a change in the
operating wavelength or in the signal encoding format. Here we demonstrate a
programmable logic gate using an injection-locked Vertical-Cavity
Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL). The gate program is switched between the AND
and the OR operations at the rate of 1 GHz with Bit Error Ratio (BER) of 10e-6
without changes in the wavelength or in the signal encoding format. The scheme
is based on nonlinearity of normalization operations, which can be used to
construct any continuous complex function or operation, Boolean or otherwise.

 <dc:description>  We present a factorized hierarchical variational autoencoder, which learns
disentangled and interpretable representations from sequential data without
supervision. Specifically, we exploit the multi-scale nature of information in
sequential data by formulating it explicitly within a factorized hierarchical
graphical model that imposes sequence-dependent priors and sequence-independent
priors to different sets of latent variables. The model is evaluated on two
speech corpora to demonstrate, qualitatively, its ability to transform speakers
or linguistic content by manipulating different sets of latent variables; and
quantitatively, its ability to outperform an i-vector baseline for speaker
verification and reduce the word error rate by as much as 35% in mismatched
train/test scenarios for automatic speech recognition tasks.

 <dc:description>  Multi-task/Multi-output learning seeks to exploit correlation among tasks to
enhance performance over learning or solving each task independently. In this
paper, we investigate this problem in the context of Gaussian Processes (GPs)
and propose a new model which learns a mixture of latent processes by
decomposing the covariance matrix into a sum of structured hidden components
each of which is controlled by a latent GP over input features and a &quot;weight&quot;
over tasks. From this sum structure, we propose a parallelizable parameter
learning algorithm with a predetermined initialization for the &quot;weights&quot;. We
also notice that an ensemble parameter learning approach using mini-batches of
training data not only reduces the computation complexity of learning but also
improves the regression performance. We evaluate our model on two datasets, the
smaller Swiss Jura dataset and another relatively larger ATMS dataset from
NOAA. Substantial improvements are observed compared with established
alternatives.

 <dc:description>  Imitation learning holds the promise to address challenging robotic tasks
such as autonomous navigation. It however requires a human supervisor to
oversee the training process and send correct control commands to robots
without feedback, which is always prone to error and expensive. To minimize
human involvement and avoid manual labeling of data in the robotic autonomous
navigation with imitation learning, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised
imitation learning solution based on a multi-sensory design. This solution
includes a suboptimal sensor policy based on sensor fusion to automatically
label states encountered by a robot to avoid human supervision during training.
In addition, a recording policy is developed to throttle the adversarial affect
of learning too much from the suboptimal sensor policy. This solution allows
the robot to learn a navigation policy in a self-supervised manner. With
extensive experiments in indoor environments, this solution can achieve near
human performance in most of the tasks and even surpasses human performance in
case of unexpected events such as hardware failures or human operation errors.
To best of our knowledge, this is the first work that synthesizes sensor fusion
and imitation learning to enable robotic autonomous navigation in the real
world without human supervision.

 <dc:description>  The study of virality and information diffusion online is a topic gaining
traction rapidly in the computational social sciences. Computer vision and
social network analysis research have also focused on understanding the impact
of content and information diffusion in making content viral, with prior
approaches not performing significantly well as other traditional
classification tasks. In this paper, we present a novel pairwise reformulation
of the virality prediction problem as an attribute prediction task and develop
a novel algorithm to model image virality on online media using a pairwise
neural network. Our model provides significant insights into the features that
are responsible for promoting virality and surpasses the existing
state-of-the-art by a 12% average improvement in prediction. We also
investigate the effect of external category supervision on relative attribute
prediction and observe an increase in prediction accuracy for the same across
several attribute learning datasets.

 <dc:description>  Social media based digital epidemiology has the potential to support faster
response and deeper understanding of public health related threats. This study
proposes a new framework to analyze unstructured health related textual data
via Twitter users' post (tweets) to characterize the negative health sentiments
and non-health related concerns in relations to the corpus of negative
sentiments, regarding Diet Diabetes Exercise, and Obesity (DDEO). Through the
collection of 6 million Tweets for one month, this study identified the
prominent topics of users as it relates to the negative sentiments. Our
proposed framework uses two text mining methods, sentiment analysis and topic
modeling, to discover negative topics. The negative sentiments of Twitter users
support the literature narratives and the many morbidity issues that are
associated with DDEO and the linkage between obesity and diabetes. The
framework offers a potential method to understand the publics' opinions and
sentiments regarding DDEO. More importantly, this research provides new
opportunities for computational social scientists, medical experts, and public
health professionals to collectively address DDEO-related issues.

 <dc:description>  Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and share
information. Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as
Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such
as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO), however, collecting and
analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging
research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of
the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity
(DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic
framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest
about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8%
of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity.
The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and
obesity. Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity, and diet and
obesity DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO
topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with Diabetes, excluding the
DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer.
The non-DDEO subtopics for Diet included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities,
weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for Exercise
included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for
Obesity included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social
media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be
utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social
scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to
diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.

 <dc:description>  Strand displacement and tile assembly systems are designed to follow
prescribed kinetic rules (i.e., exhibit a specific time-evolution). However,
the expected behavior in the limit of infinite time--known as thermodynamic
equilibrium--is often incompatible with the desired computation. Basic physical
chemistry implicates this inconsistency as a source of unavoidable error. Can
the thermodynamic equilibrium be made consistent with the desired computational
pathway? In order to formally study this question, we introduce a new model of
molecular computing in which computation is driven by the thermodynamic driving
forces of enthalpy and entropy. To ensure greatest generality we do not assume
that there are any constraints imposed by geometry and treat monomers as
unstructured collections of binding sites. In this model we design Boolean
AND/OR formulas, as well as a self-assembling binary counter, where the
thermodynamically favored states are exactly the desired final output
configurations. Though inspired by DNA nanotechnology, the model is
sufficiently general to apply to a wide variety of chemical systems.

 <dc:description>  While the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have achieved
impressive results in learning motor skills, many of the trained policies are
only capable within a limited set of initial states. We propose a technique to
break down a complex robotic task to simpler subtasks and train them
sequentially such that the robot can expand its existing skill set gradually.
Our key idea is to build a tree of local control policies represented by neural
networks, which we refer as Relay Neural Networks. Starting from the root
policy that attempts to achieve the task from a small set of initial states,
each subsequent policy expands the set of successful initial states by driving
the new states to existing &quot;good&quot; states. Our algorithm utilizes the value
function of the policy to determine whether a state is &quot;good&quot; under each
policy. We take advantage of many existing policy search algorithms that learn
the value function simultaneously with the policy, such as those that use
actor-critic representations or those that use the advantage function to reduce
variance. We demonstrate that the relay networks can solve complex continuous
control problems for underactuated dynamic systems.

 <dc:description>  A special type of rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), called
Quadcopter have prevailed to the civilian use for the past decade. They have
gained significant amount of attention within the UAV community for their
redundancy and ease of control, despite the fact that they fall under an
under-actuated system category. They come in a variety of configurations. The
&quot;+&quot; and &quot;x&quot; configurations were introduced first. Literature pertinent to these
two configurations is vast. However, in this paper, we define 6 additional
possible configurations for a Quadcopter that can be built under either &quot;+&quot; or
&quot;x&quot; setup. These configurations can be achieved by changing the angle that the
axis of rotation for rotors make with the main body, i.e., fuselage. This would
also change the location of the COM with respect to the propellers which can
add to the overall stability. A comprehensive dynamic model for all these
configurations is developed for the first time. The overall stability for these
configurations are addressed. In particular, it is shown that one configuration
can lead to the most statically-stable platform by adopting damping motion in
Roll/Pitch/Yaw, which is described for the first time to the best of our
knowledge.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) can be seen as a cooperation of the various
heterogeneous devices with limited performances, that participate in the same
system. By they nature, these devices can be very distributed. The core of
every IoT system is its discovery and control service. The Chord protocol is
one of the first, simplest and most popular distributed protocol and can be use
as a backbone of the discovery and control services of an IoT system. In this
paper we prove the correctness of the Chord protocol using the logic of time
and knowledge. We consider Chord actions that maintain ring topology with the

 <dc:description>  Subgroup discovery is a local pattern mining technique to find interpretable
descriptions of sub-populations that stand out on a given target variable. That
is, these sub-populations are exceptional with regard to the global
distribution. In this paper we argue that in many applications, such as
scientific discovery, subgroups are only useful if they are additionally
representative of the global distribution with regard to a control variable.
That is, when the distribution of this control variable is the same, or almost
the same, as over the whole data.
  We formalise this objective function and give an efficient algorithm to
compute its tight optimistic estimator for the case of a numeric target and a
binary control variable. This enables us to use the branch-and-bound framework
to efficiently discover the top-$k$ subgroups that are both exceptional as well
as representative. Experimental evaluation on a wide range of datasets shows
that with this algorithm we discover meaningful representative patterns and are
up to orders of magnitude faster in terms of node evaluations as well as time.

 <dc:description>  Automatic event detection from time series signals has wide applications,
such as abnormal event detection in video surveillance and event detection in
geophysical data. Traditional detection methods detect events primarily by the
use of similarity and correlation in data. Those methods can be inefficient and
yield low accuracy. In recent years, because of the significantly increased
computational power, machine learning techniques have revolutionized many
science and engineering domains. In this study, we apply a deep-learning-based
method to the detection of events from time series seismic signals. However, a
direct adaptation of the similar ideas from 2D object detection to our problem
faces two challenges. The first challenge is that the duration of earthquake
event varies significantly; The other is that the proposals generated are
temporally correlated. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded
region-based convolutional neural network to capture earthquake events in
different sizes, while incorporating contextual information to enrich features
for each individual proposal. To achieve a better generalization performance,
we use densely connected blocks as the backbone of our network. Because of the
fact that some positive events are not correctly annotated, we further
formulate the detection problem as a learning-from-noise problem. To verify the
performance of our detection methods, we employ our methods to seismic data
generated from a bi-axial &quot;earthquake machine&quot; located at Rock Mechanics
Laboratory, and we acquire labels with the help of experts. Through our
numerical tests, we show that our novel detection techniques yield high
accuracy. Therefore, our novel deep-learning-based detection methods can
potentially be powerful tools for locating events from time series data in
various applications.

 <dc:description>  Voxelwise classification is a popular and effective method for tissue
quantification in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, there
are often large differences over sets of MRI scans due to how they were
acquired (i.e. field strength, vendor, protocol), that lead to variation in,
among others, pixel intensities, tissue contrast, signal-to-noise ratio,
resolution, slice thickness and magnetic field inhomogeneities. Classifiers
trained on data from a specific scanner fail or under-perform when applied to
data that was differently acquired. In order to address this lack of
generalization, we propose a Siamese neural network (MRAI-net) to learn a
representation that minimizes the between-scanner variation, while maintaining
the contrast between brain tissues necessary for brain tissue quantification.
The proposed MRAI-net was evaluated on both simulated and real MRI data. After
learning the MR acquisition invariant representation, any supervised classifier
can be applied. In this paper we showed that applying a linear classifier on
the MRAI representation outperforms supervised convolutional neural network
classifiers for tissue classification when little target training data is
available.

 <dc:title>Asymptotically MDS Array BP-XOR Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Arslan, Suayb S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Belief propagation or message passing on binary erasure channels (BEC) is a
low complexity decoding algorithm that allows the recovery of message symbols
based on bipartite graph prunning process. Recently, array XOR codes have
attracted attention for storage systems due to their burst error recovery
performance and easy arithmetic based on Exclusive OR (XOR)-only logic
operations. Array BP-XOR codes are a subclass of array XOR codes that can be
decoded using BP under BEC. Requiring the capability of BP-decodability in
addition to Maximum Distance Separability (MDS) constraint on the code
construction process is observed to put an upper bound on the maximum
achievable code block length, which leads to the code construction process to
become a harder problem. In this study, we introduce asymptotically MDS array
BP-XOR codes that are alternative to exact MDS array BP-XOR codes to pave the
way for easier code constructions while keeping the decoding complexity low
with an asymptotically vanishing coding overhead. We finally provide and
analyze a simple code construction method that is based on discrete geometry to
fulfill the requirements of the class of asymptotically MDS array BP-XOR codes.

 <dc:title>Private Information Retrieval from Transversal Designs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lavauzelle, Julien</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Private information retrieval (PIR) protocols allow a user to retrieve
entries of a database without revealing the index of the desired item.
Information-theoretical privacy can be achieved by the use of several servers
and specific retrieval algorithms. Most of known PIR protocols focus on
decreasing the number of bits exchanged between the client and the server(s)
during the retrieval process. On another side, Fazeli et. al. introduced
so-called PIR codes in order to reduce the storage overhead on the servers.
However, only a few works address the issue of the computation complexity of
the servers.
  In this paper, we show that a specific encoding of the database provides PIR
protocols with reasonable communication complexity, low storage overhead and
optimal computational complexity for the servers. This encoding is based on
incidence matrices of transversal designs, from which a natural and efficient
recovering algorithm is derived. We also present instances of our construction,
making use of finite geometries and orthogonal arrays, and we finally give a
generalisation of our main construction for resisting collusions of servers.

 <dc:title>On the Competition Complexity of Dynamic Mechanism Design</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Siqi</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Competition Complexity of an auction measures how much competition is
needed for the revenue of a simple auction to surpass the optimal revenue. A
classic result from auction theory by Bulow and Klemperer [9], states that the
Competition Complexity of VCG, in the case of n i.i.d. buyers and a single
item, is 1, i.e., it is better to recruit one extra buyer and run a second
price auction than to learn exactly the buyers' underlying distribution and run
the revenue-maximizing auction tailored to this distribution.
  In this paper we study the Competition Complexity of dynamic auctions.
Consider the following setting: a monopolist is auctioning off m items in m
consecutive stages to n interested buyers. A buyer realizes her value for item
k in the beginning of stage k. We prove that the Competition Complexity of
dynamic auctions is at most 3n, and at least linear in n, even when the buyers'
values are correlated across stages, under a monotone hazard rate assumption on
the stage (marginal) distributions. We also prove results on the number of
additional buyers necessary for VCG at every stage to be an
{\alpha}-approximation of the optimal revenue; we term this number the
{\alpha}-approximate Competition Complexity. As a corollary we provide the
first results on prior-independent dynamic auctions. This is, to the best of
our knowledge, the first non-trivial positive guarantees for simple ex-post IR
dynamic auctions for correlated stages.
  A key step towards proving bounds on the Competition Complexity is getting a
good benchmark/upper bound to the optimal revenue. To this end, we extend the
recent duality framework of Cai et al. [12] to dynamic settings. As an aside to
our approach we obtain a revenue non-monotonicity lemma for dynamic auctions,
which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Dressing is a fundamental task of everyday living and robots offer an
opportunity to assist people with motor impairments. While several robotic
systems have explored robot-assisted dressing, few have considered how a robot
can manage errors in human pose estimation, or adapt to human motion in real
time during dressing assistance. In addition, estimating pose changes due to
human motion can be challenging with vision-based techniques since dressing is
often intended to visually occlude the body with clothing. We present a method
to track a person's pose in real time using capacitive proximity sensing. This
sensing approach gives direct estimates of distance with low latency, has a
high signal-to-noise ratio, and has low computational requirements. Using our
method, a robot can adjust for errors in the estimated pose of a person and
physically follow the contours and movements of the person while providing
dressing assistance. As part of an evaluation of our method, the robot
successfully pulled the sleeve of a hospital gown and a cardigan onto the right
arms of 10 human participants, despite arm motions and large errors in the
initially estimated pose of the person's arm. We also show that a capacitive
sensor is unaffected by visual occlusion of the body and can sense a person's
body through fabric clothing.

 <dc:description>  Cloud RAN (C-RAN) is a promising enabler for distributed massive MIMO
systems, yet is vulnerable to its fronthaul congestion. To cope with the
limited fronthaul capacity, this paper proposes a hybrid analog-digital
precoding design that adaptively adjusts fronthaul compression levels and the
number of active radio-frequency (RF) chains out of the entire RF chains in a
downlink distributed massive MIMO system based on C-RAN architecture. Following
this structure, we propose an analog beamformer design in pursuit of maximizing
multi-user sum average data rate (sum-rate). Each element of the analog
beamformer is constructed based on a weighted sum of spatial channel covariance
matrices, while the size of the analog beamformer, i.e. the number of active RF
chains, is optimized so as to maximize the large-scale approximated sum-rate.
With these analog beamformer and RF chain activation, a regularized zero-
forcing (RZF) digital beamformer is jointly optimized based on the
instantaneous effective channel information observed through the given analog
beamformer. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding algorithm is
validated by simulation, and its design criterion is clarified by analysis.

 <dc:description>  In Photoacoustic imaging (PA), Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamformer is a common
beamforming algorithm having a simple implementation. However, it results in a
poor resolution and high levels of sidelobe. To address these challenges, a new
algorithm namely Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS) was introduced having lower
sidelobes compared to DAS. Improving the resolution of DMAS, a novel beamformer
is introduced using Minimum Variance (MV) adaptive beamforming combined with
DMAS, so-called Minimum Variance-Based DMAS (MVB-DMAS). It is shown that
expanding the DMAS equation results in multiple terms representing a DAS
algebra. It is proposed to use the MV adaptive beamformer instead of the
existing DAS inside the DMAS algebra expansion. MVB-DMAS is evaluated
numerically and experimentally. It is shown that MVB-DMAS outperforms DAS, DMAS
and MV in terms of the resolution and sidelobes. In particular, at the depth of
45 mm MVB-DMAS results in about 31 dB, 18 dB and 8 dB levels of sidelobe
reduction compared to DAS, MV and DMAS, respectively. The quantitative results
show that MVB-DMAS leads to improvement in full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) about
95% compared to DMAS, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast ratio (CR)
enhancement, compared to MV, about 12% and 20%, respectively.

 <dc:title>High Degree Sum of Squares Proofs, Bienstock-Zuckerberg hierarchy and

 <dc:description>  Chvatal-Gomory (CG) cuts and the Bienstock-Zuckerberg hierarchy capture
useful linear programs that the standard bounded degree Lasserre/Sum-of-Squares
SOS hierarchy fails to capture.
  In this paper we present a novel polynomial time SOS hierarchy for 0/1
problems with a custom subspace of high degree polynomials (not the standard
subspace of low-degree polynomials). We show that the new SOS hierarchy
recovers the Bienstock-Zuckerberg hierarchy. Our result implies a linear
program that reproduces the Bienstock-Zuckerberg hierarchy as a polynomial
sized, efficiently constructive extended formulation that satisfies all
constant pitch inequalities. The construction is also very simple, and it is
fully defined by giving the supporting polynomials (one paragraph). Moreover,
for a class of polytopes (e.g. set covering and packing problems) it optimizes,
up to an arbitrarily small error, over the polytope resulting from any constant
rounds of CG cuts.
  Arguably, this is the first example where different basis functions can be
useful in asymmetric situations to obtain a hierarchy of relaxations.

 <dc:description>  Rotary-wing flying machines draw attention within the UAV community for their
in-place hovering capability, and recently, holonomic motion over fixed-wings.
However, they still fall behind in terms of the flight time, power consumption,
and safety for centrally-powered and redundant multi-copters have been
suggested and studied. In this paper, we investigate about the power-optimality
in a mono-spinner, i.e., a class of rotary-wing UAVs with one rotor only, whose
main body has a streamlined shape for producing additional lift when
counter-spinning the rotor. We provide a detailed dynamic model of our
mono-spinner. Two configurations are studied: (1) a symmetric configuration, in
which the rotor is aligned with the fuselage's COM, and (2) an asymmetric
configuration, in which the rotor is located with an offset from the fuselage's
COM. While the former can generate an in-place hovering flight condition, the
latter can achieve trajectory tacking in 3D space by resolving the yaw and
precession rates. Furthermore, it is shown that by introducing a tilting angle
between the rotor and the fuselage, within the asymmetric design, one can
further minimize the power consumption without compromising the overall
stability. It is shown that an energy optimal solution can be achieved through
proper aerodynamic design of the mono-spinner for the first time.

monitoring and diagnostic strategies, this report focuses on the design of a
Recursive Least-Squares (RLS) based estimator for identification over a group
of devices connected to the cloud. The proposed approach, that relies on
Node-to-Cloud-to-Node (N2C2N) transmissions, is designed so that: (i) estimates
of the unknown parameters are computed locally and (ii) the local estimates are
refined on the cloud. The proposed approach requires minimal changes to local
(pre-existing) RLS estimators.

 <dc:description>  Despite impressive advances in simultaneous localization and mapping, dense
robotic mapping remains challenging due to its inherent nature of being a
high-dimensional inference problem. In this paper, we propose a dense semantic
robotic mapping technique that exploits sparse Bayesian models, in particular,
the relevance vector machine, for high-dimensional sequential inference. The
technique is based on the principle of automatic relevance determination and
produces sparse models that use a small subset of the original dense training
set as the dominant basis. The resulting map posterior is continuous, and
queries can be made efficiently at any resolution. Moreover, the technique has
probabilistic outputs per semantic class through Bayesian inference. We
evaluate the proposed relevance vector semantic map using publicly available
benchmark datasets, NYU Depth V2 and KITTI; and the results show promising
improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques.

 <dc:description>  The conflicting problems of growing mobile service demand and
underutilization of dedicated spectrum has given rise to a paradigm where
mobile network operators (MNOs) share their infrastructure among themselves in
order to lower their operational costs, while at the same time increase the
usage of their existing network resources. We model and analyze such an
infrastructure sharing system considering a single buyer MNO and multiple
seller MNOs. Assuming that the locations of the BSs can be modeled as a
homogeneous Poisson point process, we find the downlink
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability for a user
served by the buyer MNO in an infrastructure sharing environment. We analyze
the trade-off between increasing the transmit power of a BS and the intensity
of BSs owned by the buyer MNO required to achieve a given quality-of-service
(QoS) in terms of the SINR coverage probability. Also, for a seller MNO, we
analyze the power consumption of the network per unit area (i.e., areal power
consumption) which is shown to be a piecewise continuous function of BS
intensity, composed of a linear and a convex function. Accordingly, the BS
intensity of the seller MNO can be optimized to minimize the areal power
consumption while achieving a minimum QoS for the buyer MNO. We then use these
results to formulate a single-buyer multiple-seller BS infrastructure market.
The buyer MNO is concerned with finding which seller MNO to purchase from and
what fraction of BSs to purchase. On the sellers' side, the problem of pricing
and determining the fraction of infrastructure to be sold is formulated as a
Cournot oligopoly market. We prove that the iterative update of each seller's
best response always converges to the Nash Equilibrium.

 <dc:description>  We study diversity in one-shot communication over molecular timing channels.
In the considered channel model the transmitter simultaneously releases a large
number of information particles, where the information is encoded in the time
of release. The receiver decodes the information based on the random time of
arrival of the information particles. We characterize the asymptotic
exponential decrease rate of the probability of error as a function of the
number of released particles. We denote this quantity as the system diversity
gain, as it depends both on the number of particles transmitted as well as the
receiver detection method. Three types of detectors are considered: the
maximumlikelihood (ML) detector, a linear detector, and a detector that is
based on the first arrival (FA) among all the transmitted particles. We show
that for random propagation characterized by right-sided unimodal densities
with zero mode, the FA detector is equivalent to the ML detector, and
significantly outperforms the linear detector. Moreover, even for densities
with positive mode, the diversity gain achieved by the FA detector is very
close to that achieved by the ML detector and much higher than the gain
achieved by the linear detector.

 <dc:description>  Companies all over the world started to produce and sell telepresence robots
in the last decade. Users of these robots have to plan their way to avoid
collisions and control the speed of the robot to move it to destination point.
This interface is familiar to many people who play computer games but it causes
difficulties for the older generation and disabled people. We present here a
novel interface to control telepresence robots where the operator only
specifies the destination point on the video frame and the robot moves there
automatically and avoids collisions. Users of the robots learn how to perform
tasks 7-28% faster and make 17-49% fewer mistakes. The approach can be easily
applied for any commercial telepresence robot and for development of
telepresence robots for disabled people.

 <dc:description>  We present a method for efficient learning of control policies for multiple
related robotic motor skills. Our approach consists of two stages, joint
training and specialization training. During the joint training stage, a neural
network policy is trained with minimal information to disambiguate the motor
skills. This forces the policy to learn a common representation of the
different tasks. Then, during the specialization training stage we selectively
split the weights of the policy based on a per-weight metric that measures the
disagreement among the multiple tasks. By splitting part of the control policy,
it can be further trained to specialize to each task. To update the control
policy during learning, we use Trust Region Policy Optimization with
Generalized Advantage Function (TRPOGAE). We propose a modification to the
gradient update stage of TRPO to better accommodate multi-task learning
scenarios. We evaluate our approach on three continuous motor skill learning
problems in simulation: 1) a locomotion task where three single legged robots
with considerable difference in shape and size are trained to hop forward, 2) a
manipulation task where three robot manipulators with different sizes and joint
types are trained to reach different locations in 3D space, and 3) locomotion
of a two-legged robot, whose range of motion of one leg is constrained in
different ways. We compare our training method to three baselines. The first
baseline uses only joint training for the policy, the second trains independent
policies for each task, and the last randomly selects weights to split. We show
that our approach learns more efficiently than each of the baseline methods.

 <dc:description>  To further improve the system capacity for 5G, we explore the integration of
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in mmWave communications (mmWave-NOMA)
for future 5G systems. Compared with the conventional NOMA, the distinguishing
feature of mmWave-NOMA is that, it is usually characterized by transmit/receive
beamforming with large antenna arrays. In this paper, we focus on the design
challenges of mmWave-NOMA due to beamforming. Firstly, we study how beamforming
affects the sum-rate performance of mmWave-NOMA, and find that with
conventional single-beam forming, the performance may be offset by the relative
angle between NOMA users. Then, we consider multi-beam forming for mmWave-NOMA,
which is shown to be able to achieve promising performance enhancement as well
as robustness. We further investigate the challenging joint design of the
intertwined power allocation and user pairing for mmWave-NOMA. We also discuss
the challenges and propose some potential solutions in detail. Finally, we
consider hybrid spatial division multiple access (SDMA) and NOMA in mmWave
communications, where some possible system configurations and the corresponding
solutions are discussed to address the multi-user issues including multi-user
precoding and multi-user interference (MUI) mitigation.

 <dc:description>  The potential of doubling the spectrum efficiency of full-duplex (FD)
transmission motivates us to investigate FD millimeter-wave (FD-mmWave)
communication. To realize FD transmission in the mmWave band, we first
introduce possible antenna configurations for FD-mmWave transmission. It is
shown that, different from the cases in micro-wave band FD communications, the
configuration with separate Tx/Rx antenna arrays appears more flexible in
self-interference (SI) suppression while it may increase some cost and area
versus that with the same array. We then model the mmWave SI channel with
separate Tx/Rx arrays, where a near-field propagation model is adopted for the
line-of-sight (LOS) path, and it is found that the established LOS-SI channel
with separate Tx/Rx arrays also shows spatial sparsity. Based on the SI
channel, we further explore approaches to mitigate SI by signal processing, and
we focus on a new cancellation approach in FD-mmWave communication, i.e.,
beamforming cancellation. Centered on the constant-amplitude (CA) constraint of
the beamforming vectors, we propose several candidate solutions. Lastly, we
consider an FD-mmWave multi-user scenario, and show that even if there are no
FD users in an FD-mmWave cellular system, the FD benefit can still be exploited
in the FD base station. Candidate solutions are also discussed to mitigate both
SI and multi-user interference (MUI) simultaneously.

 <dc:description>  One of the main problems in Network Intrusion Detection comes from constant
rise of new attacks, so that not enough labeled examples are available for the
new classes of attacks. Traditional Machine Learning approaches hardly address
such problem. This can be overcome with Zero-Shot Learning, a new approach in
the field of Computer Vision, which can be described in two stages: the
Attribute Learning and the Inference Stage. The goal of this paper is to
propose a new Inference Stage algorithm for Network Intrusion Detection. In
order to attain this objective, we firstly put forward an experimental setup
for the evaluation of the Zero-Shot Learning in Network Intrusion Detection
related tasks. Secondly, a decision tree based algorithm is applied to extract
rules for generating the attributes in the AL stage. Finally, using a
representation of a Zero-Shot Class as a point in the Grassmann manifold, an
explicit formula for the shortest distance between points in that manifold can
be used to compute the geodesic distance between the Zero-Shot Classes which
represent the new attacks and the Known Classes corresponding to the attack
categories. The experimental results in the datasets KDD Cup 99 and NSL-KDD
show that our approach with Zero-Shot Learning successfully addresses the
Network Intrusion Detection problem.

 <dc:description>  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-satellite communication has drawn dramatic
attention for its potential to build the integrated space-air-ground network
and the seamless wide-area coverage. The key challenge to UAV-satellite
communication is its unstable beam pointing due to the UAV navigation, which is
a typical SatCom on-the-move scenario. In this paper, we propose a blind beam
tracking approach for Ka-band UAVsatellite communication system, where UAV is
equipped with a large-scale antenna array. The effects of UAV navigation are
firstly released through the mechanical adjustment, which could approximately
point the beam towards the target satellite through beam stabilization and
dynamic isolation. Specially, the attitude information can be realtimely
derived from data fusion of lowcost sensors. Then, the precision of the beam
pointing is blindly refined through electrically adjusting the weight of the
massive antennas, where an array structure based simultaneous perturbation
algorithm is designed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the existing ones.

 <dc:description>  Visual dialog is a task of answering a series of inter-dependent questions
given an input image, and often requires to resolve visual references among the
questions. This problem is different from visual question answering (VQA),
which relies on spatial attention (a.k.a. visual grounding) estimated from an
image and question pair. We propose a novel attention mechanism that exploits
visual attentions in the past to resolve the current reference in the visual
dialog scenario. The proposed model is equipped with an associative attention
memory storing a sequence of previous (attention, key) pairs. From this memory,
the model retrieves the previous attention, taking into account recency, which
is most relevant for the current question, in order to resolve potentially
ambiguous references. The model then merges the retrieved attention with a
tentative one to obtain the final attention for the current question;
specifically, we use dynamic parameter prediction to combine the two attentions
conditioned on the question. Through extensive experiments on a new synthetic
visual dialog dataset, we show that our model significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art (by ~16 % points) in situations, where visual reference
resolution plays an important role. Moreover, the proposed model achieves
superior performance (~ 2 % points improvement) in the Visual Dialog dataset,
despite having significantly fewer parameters than the baselines.

 <dc:description>  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a highly mortal disease, currently assessed by
pulmonary CT angiography. True-FISP MRI has emerged as an innocuous alternative
that does not hold many of the limitations of x-ray imaging. However, True-FISP
MRI is very sensitive to turbulent blood flow, generating artifacts that may
resemble fake clots in the pulmonary vasculature. These misinterpretations
reduce its overall diagnostic accuracy to 94%, limiting a wider use in clinical
environments. A new segmentation algorithm is proposed to confirm the presence
of real pulmonary clots in True-FISP MR images by quantitative means, measuring
the shape, intensity, and solidity of the formation. The algorithm was
evaluated in 37 patients. The developed method increased the diagnostic
accuracy of expert observers assessing Pulmonary True-FISP MRI sequences by 6%
without the use of ionizing radiation, achieving a diagnostic accuracy
comparable to standard CT angiography.

 <dc:description>  Log Query Interface is an interactive web application that allows users to
query the very large data logs of MobileInsight easily and efficiently. With
this interface, users no longer need to talk to the database through command
line queries, nor to install the MobileInsight client locally to fetch data.
Users can simply select/type the query message through our web based system
which queries the database very efficiently and responds back to user. While
testing on 6GB of datasets our system takes less than 1 seconds to respond
back, the similar queries on traditional MySql database takes more than 60
seconds. The system gives user the capability to execute all the queries using
sql query language. User can perform complex join operations on very large
tables. The query response time is hugely improved by the server side Spark
clusters, which stores the big datasets in a distributed system and execute the
query in parallel on multiple machines.

 <dc:title>Long Short-Term Memory for Japanese Word Segmentation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kitagawa, Yoshiaki</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Komachi, Mamoru</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This study presents a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network approach
to Japanese word segmentation (JWS). Previous studies on Chinese word
segmentation (CWS) succeeded in using recurrent neural networks such as LSTM
and gated recurrent units (GRU). However, in contrast to Chinese, Japanese
includes several character types, such as hiragana, katakana, and kanji, that
produce orthographic variations and increase the difficulty of word
segmentation. Additionally, it is important for JWS tasks to consider a global
context, and yet traditional JWS approaches rely on local features. In order to
address this problem, this study proposes employing an LSTM-based approach to
JWS. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with respect to various Japanese corpora.

 <dc:title>An Incremental Slicing Method for Functional Programs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Several applications of slicing require a program to be sliced with respect
to more than one slicing criterion. Program specialization, parallelization and
cohesion measurement are examples of such applications. These applications can
benefit from an incremental static slicing method in which a significant extent
of the computations for slicing with respect to one criterion could be reused
for another. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental slicing of
functional programs. We first present a non-incremental version of the slicing
algorithm which does a polyvariant analysis 1 of functions. Since polyvariant
analyses tend to be costly, we compute a compact context-independent summary of
each function and then use this summary at the call sites of the function. The
construction of the function summary is non-trivial and helps in the
development of the incremental version. The incremental method, on the other
hand, consists of a one-time pre-computation step that uses the non-incremental
version to slice the program with respect to a fixed default slicing criterion
and processes the results further to a canonical form. Presented with an actual
slicing criterion, the incremental step involves a low-cost computation that
uses the results of the pre-computation to obtain the slice. We have
implemented a prototype of the slicer for a pure subset of Scheme, with pairs
and lists as the only algebraic data types. Our experiments show that the
incremental step of the slicer runs orders of magnitude faster than the
non-incremental version. We have also proved the correctness of our incremental
algorithm with respect to the non-incremental version.

 <dc:description>  Models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proven very
successful for semantic segmentation and object parsing that yield hierarchies
of features. Our key insight is to build convolutional networks that take input
of arbitrary size and produce object parsing output with efficient inference
and learning. In this work, we focus on the task of instance segmentation and
parsing which recognizes and localizes objects down to a pixel level base on
deep CNN. Therefore, unlike some related work, a pixel cannot belong to
multiple instances and parsing. Our model is based on a deep neural network
trained for object masking that supervised with input image and follow
incorporates a Conditional Random Field (CRF) with end-to-end trainable
piecewise order potentials based on object parsing outputs. In each CRF unit we
designed terms to capture the short range and long range dependencies from
various neighbors. The accurate instance-level segmentation that our network
produce is reflected by the considerable improvements obtained over previous
work at high APr thresholds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with
extensive experiments on challenging dataset subset of PASCAL VOC2012.

 <dc:description>  Traffic flow prediction is an important research issue for solving the
traffic congestion problem in an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).
Traffic congestion is one of the most serious problems in a city, which can be
predicted in advance by analyzing traffic flow patterns. Such prediction is
possible by analyzing the real-time transportation data from correlative roads
and vehicles. This article first gives a brief introduction to the
transportation data, and surveys the state-of-the-art prediction methods. Then,
we verify whether or not the prediction performance is able to be improved by
fitting actual data to optimize the parameters of the prediction model which is
used to predict the traffic flow. Such verification is conducted by comparing
the optimized time series prediction model with the normal time series
prediction model. This means that in the era of big data, accurate use of the
data becomes the focus of studying the traffic flow prediction to solve the
congestion problem. Finally, experimental results of a case study are provided
to verify the existence of such performance improvement, while the research
challenges of this data-analytics-based prediction are presented and discussed.

 <dc:description>  Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising approach for enabling
cloud-computing capabilities at the edge of cellular networks. Nonetheless,
security is becoming an increasingly important issue in MEC-based applications.
In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based model to detect security
threats. The model uses unsupervised learning to automate the detection
process, and uses location information as an important feature to improve the
performance of detection. Our proposed model can be used to detect malicious
applications at the edge of a cellular network, which is a serious security
threat. Extensive experiments are carried out with 10 different datasets, the
results of which illustrate that our deep-learning-based model achieves an
average gain of 6% accuracy compared with state-of-the-art machine learning
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This paper contains analysis of concept of a class within different
object-oriented knowledge representation models. The main attention is paid to
structure of the class and its efficiency in the context of data storage, using
object-relational mapping. The main achievement of the paper is extension of
concept of homogeneous class of objects by introducing concepts of single-core
and multi-core inhomogeneous classes of objects, which allow simultaneous
defining of a few different types within one class of objects, avoiding
duplication of properties and methods in representation of types, decreasing
sizes of program codes and providing more efficient information storage in the
databases. In addition, the paper contains results of experiment, which show
that data storage in relational database, using proposed extensions of the
class, in some cases is more efficient in contrast to usage of homogeneous
classes of objects.

 <dc:description>  The new era of the Web is known as the semantic Web or the Web of data. The
semantic Web depends on ontologies that are seen as one of its pillars. The
bigger these ontologies, the greater their exploitation. However, when these
ontologies become too big other problems may appear, such as the complexity to
charge big files in memory, the time it needs to download such files and
especially the time it needs to make reasoning on them. We discuss in this
paper approaches for segmenting such big Web ontologies as well as its
usefulness. The segmentation method extracts from an existing ontology a
segment that represents a layer or a generation in the existing ontology; i.e.
a horizontally extraction. The extracted segment should be itself an ontology.

 <dc:description>  To resolve conflicts among norms,various nonmonotonic formalisms can be used
to perform prioritized normative reasoning. Meanwhile, formal argumentation
provides a way to represent nonmonotonic logics. In this paper, we propose a
representation of prioritized normative reasoning by argumentation. Using
hierarchical abstract normative systems, we define three kinds of prioritized
normative reasoning approaches, called Greedy, Reduction, and Optimization.
Then, after formulating an argumentation theory for a hierarchical abstract
normative system, we show that for a totally ordered hierarchical abstract
normative system, Greedy and Reduction can be represented in argumentation by
applying the weakest link and the last link principles respectively, and
Optimization can be represented by introducing additional defeats capturing
implicit conflicts between arguments.

 <dc:description>  A method for statistical parametric speech synthesis incorporating generative
adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed. Although powerful deep neural networks
(DNNs) techniques can be applied to artificially synthesize speech waveform,
the synthetic speech quality is low compared with that of natural speech. One
of the issues causing the quality degradation is an over-smoothing effect often
observed in the generated speech parameters. A GAN introduced in this paper
consists of two neural networks: a discriminator to distinguish natural and
generated samples, and a generator to deceive the discriminator. In the
proposed framework incorporating the GANs, the discriminator is trained to
distinguish natural and generated speech parameters, while the acoustic models
are trained to minimize the weighted sum of the conventional minimum generation
loss and an adversarial loss for deceiving the discriminator. Since the
objective of the GANs is to minimize the divergence (i.e., distribution
difference) between the natural and generated speech parameters, the proposed
method effectively alleviates the over-smoothing effect on the generated speech
parameters. We evaluated the effectiveness for text-to-speech and voice
conversion, and found that the proposed method can generate more natural
spectral parameters and $F_0$ than conventional minimum generation error
training algorithm regardless its hyper-parameter settings. Furthermore, we
investigated the effect of the divergence of various GANs, and found that a
Wasserstein GAN minimizing the Earth-Mover's distance works the best in terms
of improving synthetic speech quality.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses design, modeling and dynamic-compensation PID (dc-PID)
control of a novel type of fully-actuated aerial manipulation (AM) system.
Firstly, design of novel mechanical structure of the AM is presented. Secondly,
kinematics and dynamics of AM are modeled using Craig parameters and recursion
Newton-Euler equations respectively, which give rise to a more accurate dynamic
relationship between aerial platform and manipulator. Then, the
dynamic-compensation PID control is proposed to solve the problem of
fully-actuated control of AM. Finally, uniform coupled matrix equations between
driving forces/moments and rotor speeds are derived, which can support design
and analysis of parameters and decoupling theoretically. It is taken into
account practical problems including noise and perturbation, parameter
uncertainty, and power limitation in simulations, and results from simulations
shows that the AM system presented can be fully-actued controlled with advanced
control performances, which can not achieved theoretically in traditional AM.
And with compared to backstepping control dc-PID has better control accuracy
and capability to disturbance rejection in two simulations of aerial operation
tasks with motion of joint. The experiment of dc-pid proves the availability
and effectiveness of the method proposed.

 <dc:description>  This work presents an introduction to feature-based time-series analysis. The
time series as a data type is first described, along with an overview of the
interdisciplinary time-series analysis literature. I then summarize the range
of feature-based representations for time series that have been developed to
aid interpretable insights into time-series structure. Particular emphasis is
given to emerging research that facilitates wide comparison of feature-based
representations that allow us to understand the properties of a time-series
dataset that make it suited to a particular feature-based representation or
analysis algorithm. The future of time-series analysis is likely to embrace
approaches that exploit machine learning methods to partially automate human
learning to aid understanding of the complex dynamical patterns in the time
series we measure from the world.

 <dc:title>Novel Uses of Category Theory in Modeling OOP</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>AbdelGawad, Moez A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Category Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An outline and summary of four new potential applications of category theory
to OOP research are presented. These include (1) the use of operads to model
Java subtyping, (2) the use of Yoneda's lemma and representable functors in the
modeling of generic types in generic nominally-typed OOP, (3) using a
combination of category presentations and cartesian closed categories to model
structurally-typed OOP, and (4) the use of adjoint functors to model Java
erasure.

 <dc:title>A Generic Regression Framework for Pose Recognition on Color and Depth
  Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>He, Wenye</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cascaded regression method is a fast and accurate method on finding 2D pose
of objects in RGB images. It is able to find the accurate pose of objects in an
image by a great number of corrections on the good initial guess of the pose of
objects. This paper explains the algorithm and shows the result of two
experiments carried by the researchers. The presented new method to quickly and
accurately predict 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image, using
no temporal information. We take an object recognition approach, designing an
intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation
problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly
varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant
to pose, body shape, clothing. Finally, we generate confidence-scored 3D
proposals of several body parts by re-projecting the classification result and
finding local modes.

 <dc:description>  Much research in artificial intelligence is concerned with the development of
autonomous agents that can interact effectively with other agents. An important
aspect of such agents is the ability to reason about the behaviours of other
agents, by constructing models which make predictions about various properties
of interest (such as actions, goals, beliefs) of the modelled agents. A variety
of modelling approaches now exist which vary widely in their methodology and
underlying assumptions, catering to the needs of the different sub-communities
within which they were developed and reflecting the different practical uses
for which they are intended. The purpose of the present article is to provide a
comprehensive survey of the salient modelling methods which can be found in the
literature. The article concludes with a discussion of open problems which may
form the basis for fruitful future research.

 <dc:description>  We analyse multimodal time-series data corresponding to weight, sleep and
steps measurements. We focus on predicting whether a user will successfully
achieve his/her weight objective. For this, we design several deep long
short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, including a novel cross-modal LSTM
(X-LSTM), and demonstrate their superiority over baseline approaches. The
X-LSTM improves parameter efficiency by processing each modality separately and
allowing for information flow between them by way of recurrent
cross-connections. We present a general hyperparameter optimisation technique
for X-LSTMs, which allows us to significantly improve on the LSTM and a prior
state-of-the-art cross-modal approach, using a comparable number of parameters.
Finally, we visualise the model's predictions, revealing implications about
latent variables in this task.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses automatic extraction of abbreviations (encompassing
acronyms and initialisms) and corresponding long-form expansions from plain
unstructured text. We create and are going to release a multilingual resource
for abbreviations and their corresponding expansions, built automatically by
exploiting Wikipedia redirect and disambiguation pages, that can be used as a
benchmark for evaluation. We address a shortcoming of previous work where only
the redirect pages were used, and so every abbreviation had only a single
expansion, even though multiple different expansions are possible for many of
the abbreviations. We also develop a principled machine learning based approach
to scoring expansion candidates using different techniques such as indicators
of near synonymy, topical relatedness, and surface similarity. We show improved
performance over seven languages, including two with a non-Latin alphabet,
relative to strong baselines.

 <dc:description>  Given a database network where each vertex is associated with a transaction
database, we are interested in finding theme communities. Here, a theme
community is a cohesive subgraph such that a common pattern is frequent in all
transaction databases associated with the vertices in the subgraph. Finding all
theme communities from a database network enjoys many novel applications.
However, it is challenging since even counting the number of all theme
communities in a database network is #P-hard. Inspired by the observation that
a theme community shrinks when the length of the pattern increases, we
investigate several properties of theme communities and develop TCFI, a
scalable algorithm that uses these properties to effectively prune the patterns
that cannot form any theme community. We also design TC-Tree, a scalable
algorithm that decomposes and indexes theme communities efficiently. Retrieving
1 million theme communities from a TC-Tree takes only 1 second. Extensive
experiments and a case study demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of
TCFI and TC-Tree in discovering and querying meaningful theme communities from
large database networks.

 <dc:title>Calibrated steganalysis of mp3stego in multi-encoder scenario</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghasemzadeh, Hamzeh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Comparing popularity of mp3 and wave with the amount of works published on
each of them shows mp3 steganalysis has not found adequate attention.
Furthermore, investigating existing works on mp3 steganalysis shows that a
major factor has been overlooked. Experimenting with different mp3 encoders
shows there are subtle differences in their outputs. This shows that mp3
standard has been implemented in dissimilar fashions, which in turn could
degrade performance of steganalysis if it is not addressed properly.
Additionally, calibration is a powerful technique which has not found its true
potential for mp3 steganalysis. This paper tries to fill these gaps. First, we
present our analysis on different encoders and show they can be classified
quite accurately with only four features. Then, we propose a new set of
calibrated features based on quantization step. To that end, we show
quantization step is a band limited signal and steganography noise affects its
high frequency components more prominently. By applying a low pass filter on
quantization steps, we arrive at an estimation of quantization step, which in
turn is used for calibrating the features.

 <dc:description>  String diagrams turn algebraic equations into topological moves that have
recurring shapes, involving the sliding of one diagram past another. We
individuate, at the root of this fact, the dual nature of polygraphs as
presentations of higher algebraic theories, and as combinatorial descriptions
of &quot;directed spaces&quot;. Operations of polygraphs modelled on operations of
topological spaces are used as the foundation of a compositional universal
algebra, where sliding moves arise from tensor products of polygraphs. We
reconstruct several higher algebraic theories in this framework.
  In this regard, the standard formalism of polygraphs has some technical
problems. We propose a notion of regular polygraph, barring cell boundaries
that are not homeomorphic to a disk of the appropriate dimension. We define a
category of non-degenerate shapes, and show how to calculate their tensor
products. Then, we introduce a notion of weak unit to recover weakly degenerate
boundaries in low dimensions, and prove that the existence of weak units is
equivalent to a representability property.
  We then turn to applications of diagrammatic algebra to quantum theory. We
re-evaluate the category of Hilbert spaces from the perspective of categorical
universal algebra, which leads to a bicategorical refinement. Then, we focus on
the axiomatics of fragments of quantum theory, and present the ZW calculus, the
first complete diagrammatic axiomatisation of the theory of qubits.
  The ZW calculus has several advantages over ZX calculi, including a
computationally meaningful normal form, and a fragment whose diagrams can be
read as setups of fermionic oscillators. Moreover, its generators reflect an
operational classification of entangled states of 3 qubits. We conclude with
generalisations of the ZW calculus to higher-dimensional systems, including the
definition of a universal set of generators in each dimension.

 <dc:description>  An RNA secondary structure is designable if there is an RNA sequence which
can attain its maximum number of base pairs only by adopting that structure.
The combinatorial RNA design problem, introduced by Hale\v{s} et al. in 2016,
is to determine whether or not a given RNA secondary structure is designable.
Hale\v{s} et al. identified certain classes of designable and non-designable
secondary structures by reference to their corresponding rooted trees. We
introduce an infinite class of rooted trees containing unpaired nucleotides at
the greatest height, and prove constructively that their corresponding
secondary structures are designable. This complements previous results for the
combinatorial RNA design problem.

 <dc:description>  The Internet infrastructure relies entirely on open standards for its routing
protocols. However, the majority of routers on the Internet are closed-source.
Hence, there is no straightforward way to analyze them. Specifically, one
cannot easily identify deviations of a router's routing functionality from the
routing protocol's standard. Such deviations (either deliberate or inadvertent)
are particularly important to identify since they may degrade the security or
resiliency of the network.
  A model-based testing procedure is a technique that allows to systematically
generate tests based on a model of the system to be tested; thereby finding
deviations in the system compared to the model. However, applying such an
approach to a complex multi-party routing protocol requires a prohibitively
high number of tests to cover the desired functionality. We propose efficient
and practical optimizations to the model-based testing procedure that are
tailored to the analysis of routing protocols. These optimizations allow to
devise a formal black-box method to unearth deviations in closed-source routing
protocols' implementations. The method relies only on the ability to test the
targeted protocol implementation and observe its output. Identification of the
deviations is fully automatic.
  We evaluate our method against one of the complex and widely used routing
protocols on the Internet -- OSPF. We search for deviations in the OSPF
implementation of Cisco. Our evaluation identified numerous significant
deviations that can be abused to compromise the security of a network. The
deviations were confirmed by Cisco. We further employed our method to analyze
the OSPF implementation of the Quagga Routing Suite. The analysis revealed one
significant deviation. Subsequent to the disclosure of the deviations some of
them were also identified by IBM, Lenovo and Huawei in their own products.

 <dc:description>  Given a classical channel, a stochastic map from inputs to outputs, can we
replace the input with a simple intermediate variable that still yields the
correct conditional output distribution? We examine two cases: first, when the
intermediate variable is classical; second, when the intermediate variable is
quantum. We show that the quantum variable's size is generically smaller than
the classical, according to two different measures---cardinality and entropy.
We demonstrate optimality conditions for a special case. We end with several
related results: a proposal for extending the special case, a demonstration of
the impact of quantum phases, and a case study concerning pure versus mixed
states.

can be realized using almost any nonlinear self-sustaining oscillators with
logic values encoded in their phases. Many types of such oscillators are
readily available for large-scale integration, with potentials in high-speed
and low-power operation. In this paper, we describe the operation and mechanism
of oscillator-based Ising machines. The feasibility of our scheme is
demonstrated through several examples in simulation and hardware, among which a
simulation study reports average solutions exceeding those from state-of-art
Ising machines on a benchmark combinatorial optimization problem of size 2000.

 <dc:title>Compact Environment-Invariant Codes for Robust Visual Place Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Robust visual place recognition (VPR) requires scene representations that are
invariant to various environmental challenges such as seasonal changes and
variations due to ambient lighting conditions during day and night. Moreover, a
practical VPR system necessitates compact representations of environmental
features. To satisfy these requirements, in this paper we suggest a
modification to the existing pipeline of VPR systems to incorporate supervised
hashing. The modified system learns (in a supervised setting) compact binary
codes from image feature descriptors. These binary codes imbibe robustness to
the visual variations exposed to it during the training phase, thereby, making
the system adaptive to severe environmental changes. Also, incorporating
supervised hashing makes VPR computationally more efficient and easy to
implement on simple hardware. This is because binary embeddings can be learned
over simple-to-compute features and the distance computation is also in the
low-dimensional hamming space of binary codes. We have performed experiments on
several challenging data sets covering seasonal, illumination and viewpoint
variations. We also compare two widely used supervised hashing methods of
CCAITQ and MLH and show that this new pipeline out-performs or closely matches
the state-of-the-art deep learning VPR methods that are based on
high-dimensional features extracted from pre-trained deep convolutional neural
networks.

 <dc:description>  With the recent focus in the accessibility field, researchers from academia
and industry have been very active in developing innovative techniques and
tools for assistive technology. Especially with handheld devices getting ever
powerful and being able to recognize the user's voice, screen magnification for
individuals with low-vision, and eye tracking devices used in studies with
individuals with physical and intellectual disabilities, the science field is
quickly adapting and creating conclusions as well as products to help. In this
paper, we will focus on new technology and tools to help make reading
easier--including reformatting document presentation (for people with physical
vision impairments) and text simplification to make information itself easier
to interpret (for people with intellectual disabilities). A real-world case
study is reported based on our experience to make documents more accessible.

 <dc:description>  Business Process Management (BPM) in the cloud is focused on how to provide
Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) and also implementing the Elastic
Business Process Management (eBPM). These approaches are finding models,
techniques and methodologies to increase the BPM adoption in the cloud. The
objective on this research is to carry out a literature review about the state
of the art of Business Process Management in the cloud, identify categories and
analyze what the approach on eBPM researches and BPaaS researches is. The
method used is the systematic literature review and the researches evolution
over the time will be categorized and analyzed using a timeline and cumulative
charts. The results show that the Business Process enactment is the main
approach focused on eBPM researches, whereas the researches on BPaaS are
focused on a greater number of categories. The conclusion of this research is
that the authors could not identify any systems supporting the eBPM and BPaaS
approaches at the same time and they introduce the definition of a new approach
called Elastic Business Process Management as a Service (eBPMaaS)

 <dc:description>  Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of gradient descent for
directly recovering the factors of low-rank matrices from random linear
measurements in a globally convergent manner when initialized properly.
However, the performance of existing algorithms is highly sensitive in the
presence of outliers that may take arbitrary values. In this paper, we propose
a truncated gradient descent algorithm to improve the robustness against
outliers, where the truncation is performed to rule out the contributions of
samples that deviate significantly from the {\em sample median} of measurement
residuals adaptively in each iteration. We demonstrate that, when initialized
in a basin of attraction close to the ground truth, the proposed algorithm
converges to the ground truth at a linear rate for the Gaussian measurement
model with a near-optimal number of measurements, even when a constant fraction
of the measurements are arbitrarily corrupted. In addition, we propose a new
truncated spectral method that ensures an initialization in the basin of
attraction at slightly higher requirements. We finally provide numerical
experiments to validate the superior performance of the proposed approach.

 <dc:title>GB-PANDAS: Throughput and heavy-traffic optimality analysis for affinity
  scheduling</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dynamic affinity scheduling has been an open problem for nearly three
decades. The problem is to dynamically schedule multi-type tasks to
multi-skilled servers such that the resulting queueing system is both stable in
the capacity region (throughput optimality) and the mean delay of tasks is
minimized at high loads near the boundary of the capacity region (heavy-traffic
optimality). As for applications, data-intensive analytics like MapReduce,
Hadoop, and Dryad fit into this setting, where the set of servers is
heterogeneous for different task types, so the pair of task type and server
determines the processing rate of the task. The load balancing algorithm used
in such frameworks is an example of affinity scheduling which is desired to be
both robust and delay optimal at high loads when hot-spots occur. Fluid model
planning, the MaxWeight algorithm, and the generalized $c\mu$-rule are among
the first algorithms proposed for affinity scheduling that have theoretical
guarantees on being optimal in different senses, which will be discussed in the
related work section. All these algorithms are not practical for use in data
center applications because of their non-realistic assumptions. The
join-the-shortest-queue-MaxWeight (JSQ-MaxWeight), JSQ-Priority, and
weighted-workload algorithms are examples of load balancing policies for
systems with two and three levels of data locality with a rack structure. In
this work, we propose the Generalized-Balanced-Pandas algorithm (GB-PANDAS) for
a system with multiple levels of data locality and prove its throughput
optimality. We prove this result under an arbitrary distribution for service
times, whereas most previous theoretical work assumes geometric distribution
for service times. The extensive simulation results show that the GB-PANDAS
algorithm alleviates the mean delay and has a better performance than the
JSQ-MaxWeight algorithm by twofold

 <dc:description>  Tanglegrams are special graphs that consist of a pair of rooted binary trees
with the same number of leaves, and a perfect matching between the two
leaf-sets. These objects are of use in phylogenetics and are represented with
straightline drawings where the leaves of the two plane binary trees are on two
parallel lines and only the matching edges can cross. The tangle crossing
number of a tanglegram is the minimum crossing number over all such drawings
and is related to biologically relevant quantities, such as the number of times
a parasite switched hosts.
  Our main results for tanglegrams which parallel known theorems for crossing
numbers are as follows. The removal of a single matching edge in a tanglegram
with $n$ leaves decreases the tangle crossing number by at most $n-3$, and this
is sharp. Additionally, if $\gamma(n)$ is the maximum tangle crossing number of
a tanglegram with $n$ leaves, we prove
$\frac{1}{2}\binom{n}{2}(1-o(1))\le\gamma(n)&lt;\frac{1}{2}\binom{n}{2}$. Further,
we provide an algorithm for computing non-trivial lower bounds on the tangle
crossing number in $O(n^4)$ time. This lower bound may be tight, even for
tanglegrams with tangle crossing number $\Theta(n^2)$.

 <dc:description>  This work centers on the problem of stochastic filtering for systems that
yield complex beliefs. The main contribution is GP-SUM, a filtering algorithm
for dynamic systems expressed as Gaussian Processes (GP), that does not rely on
linearizations or Gaussian approximations of the belief. The algorithm can be
seen as a combination of a sampling-based filter and a probabilistic Bayes
filter. GP-SUM operates by sampling the state distribution and propagating each
sample through the dynamic system and observation models. Both, the sampling of
the state and its propagation, are made possible by relying on the GP form of
the system. In practice, the belief has the form of a weighted sum of
Gaussians. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm with favorable
comparisons against multiple versions of GP-Bayes filters on a standard
synthetic problem. We also illustrate its practical use in a pushing task, and
demonstrate that GP-SUM can predict heteroscedasticity, i.e., different amounts
of uncertainty, and multi-modality when naturally occurring in pushing.

 <dc:description>  Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a reliable learning mechanism in which a
robot enhances its perceptual capabilities. Typically, in SSL a trusted,
primary sensor cue provides supervised training data to a secondary sensor cue.
In this article, a theoretical analysis is performed on the fusion of the
primary and secondary cue in a minimal model of SSL. A proof is provided that
determines the specific conditions under which it is favorable to perform
fusion. In short, it is favorable when (i) the prior on the target value is
strong or (ii) the secondary cue is sufficiently accurate. The theoretical
findings are validated with computational experiments. Subsequently, a
real-world case study is performed to investigate if fusion in SSL is also
beneficial when assumptions of the minimal model are not met. In particular, a
flying robot learns to map pressure measurements to sonar height measurements
and then fuses the two, resulting in better height estimation. Fusion is also
beneficial in the opposite case, when pressure is the primary cue. The analysis
and results are encouraging to study SSL fusion also for other robots and
sensors.

 <dc:title>Robust Facial Landmark Detection under Significant Head Poses and
  Occlusion</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Yue</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ji, Qiang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There have been tremendous improvements for facial landmark detection on
general &quot;in-the-wild&quot; images. However, it is still challenging to detect the
facial landmarks on images with severe occlusion and images with large head
poses (e.g. profile face). In fact, the existing algorithms usually can only
handle one of them. In this work, we propose a unified robust cascade
regression framework that can handle both images with severe occlusion and
images with large head poses. Specifically, the method iteratively predicts the
landmark occlusions and the landmark locations. For occlusion estimation,
instead of directly predicting the binary occlusion vectors, we introduce a
supervised regression method that gradually updates the landmark visibility
probabilities in each iteration to achieve robustness. In addition, we
explicitly add occlusion pattern as a constraint to improve the performance of
occlusion prediction. For landmark detection, we combine the landmark
visibility probabilities, the local appearances, and the local shapes to
iteratively update their positions. The experimental results show that the
proposed method is significantly better than state-of-the-art works on images
with severe occlusion and images with large head poses. It is also comparable
to other methods on general &quot;in-the-wild&quot; images.

 <dc:title>Constrained Deep Transfer Feature Learning and its Applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Yue</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ji, Qiang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Feature learning with deep models has achieved impressive results for both
data representation and classification for various vision tasks. Deep feature
learning, however, typically requires a large amount of training data, which
may not be feasible for some application domains. Transfer learning can be one
of the approaches to alleviate this problem by transferring data from data-rich
source domain to data-scarce target domain. Existing transfer learning methods
typically perform one-shot transfer learning and often ignore the specific
properties that the transferred data must satisfy. To address these issues, we
introduce a constrained deep transfer feature learning method to perform
simultaneous transfer learning and feature learning by performing transfer
learning in a progressively improving feature space iteratively in order to
better narrow the gap between the target domain and the source domain for
effective transfer of the data from the source domain to target domain.
Furthermore, we propose to exploit the target domain knowledge and incorporate
such prior knowledge as a constraint during transfer learning to ensure that
the transferred data satisfies certain properties of the target domain. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed constrained deep transfer feature
learning method, we apply it to thermal feature learning for eye detection by
transferring from the visible domain. We also applied the proposed method for
cross-view facial expression recognition as a second application. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for
both applications.

 <dc:description>  Cascade regression framework has been shown to be effective for facial
landmark detection. It starts from an initial face shape and gradually predicts
the face shape update from the local appearance features to generate the facial
landmark locations in the next iteration until convergence. In this paper, we
improve upon the cascade regression framework and propose the Constrained Joint
Cascade Regression Framework (CJCRF) for simultaneous facial action unit
recognition and facial landmark detection, which are two related face analysis
tasks, but are seldomly exploited together. In particular, we first learn the
relationships among facial action units and face shapes as a constraint. Then,
in the proposed constrained joint cascade regression framework, with the help
from the constraint, we iteratively update the facial landmark locations and
the action unit activation probabilities until convergence. Experimental
results demonstrate that the intertwined relationships of facial action units
and face shapes boost the performances of both facial action unit recognition
and facial landmark detection. The experimental results also demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to the state-of-the-art works.

 <dc:description>  Facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, and facial deformation
analysis are typical facial behavior analysis tasks in computer vision. The
existing methods usually perform each task independently and sequentially,
ignoring their interactions. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified
framework for simultaneous facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, and
facial deformation analysis, and the proposed model is robust to facial
occlusion. Following a cascade procedure augmented with model-based head pose
estimation, we iteratively update the facial landmark locations, facial
occlusion, head pose and facial de- formation until convergence. The
experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method for simultaneous facial landmark detection, head pose and
facial deformation estimation, even if the images are under facial occlusion.

 <dc:title>Coverage-Rate Tradeoff in mmWave Heterogeneous Networks with Generalized
  User Association</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Chun-Hung</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we first introduce a generalized modeling and analysis
framework to explore the fundamental interactions between user association,
coverage probability and link rate in a millimeter wave (mmWave) heterogeneous
network (HetNet) in which there are multiple tiers of the ultra-high-frequency
(UHF) macrocell and small cell base stations (BSs) and a single tier of mmWave
small cell BSs. A generalized user association scheme that can cover many
pathloss-based user association schemes is proposed and its related
probabilistic properties that facilitate the derivations of the coverage
probability and link rate are derived. The derived general expressions of the
coverage and link rate not only shed light on how to design user association
functions in order to maximizes the coverage and rate but also show that it is
impossible to devise a user association scheme that maximizes the coverage and
link rate at the same time. Namely, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between
coverage and link rate in an mmWave HetNet with distinct bandwidths in the UHF
and mmWave bands. We characterize the coverage-optimal and rate-optimal user
association schemes and numerically validate their performances and show the
tradeoff problem.

 <dc:description>  Existing socio-psychological studies suggest that users of a social network
form their opinions relying on the opinions of their neighbors. According to
DeGroot opinion formation model, one value of particular importance is the
asymptotic consensus value---the sum of user opinions weighted by the users'
eigenvector centralities. This value plays the role of an attractor for the
opinions in the network and is a lucrative target for external influence.
However, since any potentially malicious control of the opinion distribution in
a social network is clearly undesirable, it is important to design methods to
prevent the external attempts to strategically change the asymptotic consensus
value.
  In this work, we assume that the adversary wants to maximize the asymptotic
consensus value by altering the opinions of some users in a network; we, then,
state DIVER---an NP-hard problem of disabling such external influence attempts
by strategically adding a limited number of edges to the network. Relying on
the theory of Markov chains, we provide perturbation analysis that shows how
eigenvector centrality and, hence, DIVER's objective function change in
response to an edge's addition to the network. The latter leads to the design
of a pseudo-linear-time heuristic for DIVER, whose computation relies on
efficient estimation of mean first passage times in a Markov chain. We confirm
our theoretical findings in experiments.

 <dc:title>The Value of Distributed Energy Resources for Heterogeneous Residential

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The presence of behind-the-meter rooftop PV and storage in the residential
sector is poised to increase significantly. Here we quantify in detail the
value of these technologies to consumers and service providers. We characterize
the heterogeneity in household electricity cost savings under time-varying
prices due to consumption behavior differences. The top 15% of consumers
benefit two to three times as much as the remaining 85%. Different pricing
policies do not significantly alter how households fare with respect to one
another. We define the value of information as the financial value of improved
forecasting capabilities for a household. The typical value of information is
3.5 cents per hour per kWh reduction of standard deviation of forecast error.
Coordination services that combine the resources available at all households
can reduce costs by an additional 15% to 30% of the original total cost.
Surprisingly, on the basis of coordinated action alone, service providers will
not encourage adoption beyond 50% within a group. Coordinated information,
however, enables the providers to generate additional value with increasing
adoption.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a method for video smoke detection using synthetic smoke
samples. The virtual data can automatically offer precise and rich annotated
samples. However, the learning of smoke representations will be hurt by the
appearance gap between real and synthetic smoke samples. The existed researches
mainly work on the adaptation to samples extracted from original annotated
samples. These methods take the object detection and domain adaptation as two
independent parts. To train a strong detector with rich synthetic samples, we
construct the adaptation to the detection layer of state-of-the-art
single-model detectors (SSD and MS-CNN). The training procedure is an
end-to-end stage. The classification, location and adaptation are combined in
the learning. The performance of the proposed model surpasses the original
baseline in our experiments. Meanwhile, our results show that the detectors
based on the adversarial adaptation are superior to the detectors based on the
discrepancy adaptation. Code will be made publicly available on
http://smoke.ustc.edu.cn.

 <dc:title>Comparison of Batch Normalization and Weight Normalization Algorithms
  for the Large-scale Image Classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gitman, Igor</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Batch normalization (BN) has become a de facto standard for training deep
convolutional networks. However, BN accounts for a significant fraction of
training run-time and is difficult to accelerate, since it is a
memory-bandwidth bounded operation. Such a drawback of BN motivates us to
explore recently proposed weight normalization algorithms (WN algorithms), i.e.
weight normalization, normalization propagation and weight normalization with
translated ReLU. These algorithms don't slow-down training iterations and were
experimentally shown to outperform BN on relatively small networks and
datasets. However, it is not clear if these algorithms could replace BN in
practical, large-scale applications. We answer this question by providing a
detailed comparison of BN and WN algorithms using ResNet-50 network trained on
ImageNet. We found that although WN achieves better training accuracy, the
final test accuracy is significantly lower ($\approx 6\%$) than that of BN.
This result demonstrates the surprising strength of the BN regularization
effect which we were unable to compensate for using standard regularization
techniques like dropout and weight decay. We also found that training of deep
networks with WN algorithms is significantly less stable compared to BN,
limiting their practical applications.

certain norm condition, we first propose an output encoding method that
achieves the stabilization of systems with finite-data rates only under an
assumption on the duration of DoS attacks. Next we add a condition on the
frequency of DoS attacks and develop an output encoding method with an
arbitrary state transformation. Finally we illustrate the obtained results with
numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  Wood Identification has never been more important to serve the purpose of
global forest species protection and timber regulation. Macroscopic level wood
identification practiced by wood anatomists can identify wood up to genus
level. This is sufficient to serve as a frontline identification to fight
against illegal wood logging and timber trade for law enforcement authority.
However, frontline enforcement official may lack of the accuracy and confidence
of a well trained wood anatomist. Hence, computer assisted method such as
machine vision methods are developed to do rapid field identification for law
enforcement official. In this paper, we proposed a rapid and robust macroscopic
wood identification system using machine vision method with off-the-shelf
smartphone and retrofitted macro-lens. Our system is cost effective, easily
accessible, fast and scalable at the same time provides human-level accuracy on
identification. Camera-enabled smartphone with Internet connectivity coupled
with a macro-lens provides a simple and effective digital acquisition of
macroscopic wood images which are essential for macroscopic wood
identification. The images are immediately streamed to a cloud server via
Internet connection for identification which are done within seconds.

 <dc:description>  We present a probabilistic model of an intrusion in a marked renewal process.
Given a process and a sequence of events, an intrusion is a subsequence of
events that is not produced by the process. Applications of the model are, for
example, online payment fraud with the fraudster taking over a user's account
and performing payments on the user's behalf, or unexpected equipment failures
due to unintended use.
  We adopt Bayesian approach to infer the probability of an intrusion in a
sequence of events, a MAP subsequence of events constituting the intrusion, and
the marginal probability of each event in a sequence to belong to the
intrusion. We evaluate the model for intrusion detection on synthetic data, as
well as on anonymized data from an online payment system.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present tensor-based linear and nonlinear models for
hyperspectral data classification and analysis. By exploiting principles of
tensor algebra, we introduce new classification architectures, the weight
parameters of which satisfies the {\it rank}-1 canonical decomposition
property. Then, we introduce learning algorithms to train both the linear and
the non-linear classifier in a way to i) to minimize the error over the
training samples and ii) the weight coefficients satisfies the {\it rank}-1
canonical decomposition property. The advantages of the proposed classification
model is that i) it reduces the number of parameters required and thus reduces
the respective number of training samples required to properly train the model,
ii) it provides a physical interpretation regarding the model coefficients on
the classification output and iii) it retains the spatial and spectral
coherency of the input samples. To address issues related with linear
classification, characterizing by low capacity, since it can produce rules that
are linear in the input space, we introduce non-linear classification models
based on a modification of a feedforward neural network. We call the proposed
architecture {\it rank}-1 Feedfoward Neural Network (FNN), since their weights
satisfy the {\it rank}-1 caconical decomposition property. Appropriate learning
algorithms are also proposed to train the network. Experimental results and
comparisons with state of the art classification methods, either linear (e.g.,
SVM) and non-linear (e.g., deep learning) indicates the outperformance of the
proposed scheme, especially in cases where a small number of training samples
are available. Furthermore, the proposed tensor-based classfiers are evaluated
against their capabilities in dimensionality reduction.

 <dc:description>  Security questions are one of the mechanisms used to recover passwords.
Strong answers to security questions (i.e. high entropy) are hard for attackers
to guess or obtain using social engineering techniques (e.g. monitoring of
social networking profiles), but at the same time are difficult to remember.
Instead, weak answers to security questions (i.e. low entropy) are easy to
remember, which makes them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Convenience leads
users to use the same answers to security questions on multiple accounts, which
exposes these accounts to numerous cyber-threats. Hence, current security
questions implementations rarely achieve the required security and memorability
requirements. This research study is the first step in the development of a
model which investigates the determinants that influence users' behavioural
intentions through motivation to select strong and memorable answers to
security questions. This research also provides design recommendations for
novel security questions mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  Spiking networks that perform probabilistic inference have been proposed both
as models of cortical computation and as candidates for solving problems in
machine learning. However, the evidence for spike-based computation being in
any way superior to non-spiking alternatives remains scarce. We propose that
short-term plasticity can provide spiking networks with distinct computational
advantages compared to their classical counterparts. In this work, we use
networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that are trained to perform both
discriminative and generative tasks in their forward and backward information
processing paths, respectively. During training, the energy landscape
associated with their dynamics becomes highly diverse, with deep attractor
basins separated by high barriers. Classical algorithms solve this problem by
employing various tempering techniques, which are both computationally
demanding and require global state updates. We demonstrate how similar results
can be achieved in spiking networks endowed with local short-term synaptic
plasticity. Additionally, we discuss how these networks can even outperform
tempering-based approaches when the training data is imbalanced. We thereby
show how biologically inspired, local, spike-triggered synaptic dynamics based
simply on a limited pool of synaptic resources can allow spiking networks to
outperform their non-spiking relatives.

 <dc:title>A Serious Game Design: Nudging Users' Memorability of Security Questions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Security questions are one of the techniques used to recover passwords. The
main limitation of security questions is that users find strong answers
difficult to remember. This leads users to trade-off security for the
convenience of an improved memorability. Previous research found that increased
fun and enjoyment can lead to an enhanced memorability, which provides a better
learning experience. Hence, we empirically investigate whether a serious game
has the potential of improving the memorability of strong answers to security
questions. For our serious game, we adapted the popular &quot;4 Pics 1 word&quot; mobile
game because of its use of pictures and cues, which psychology research found
to be important to help with memorability. Our findings indicate that the
proposed serious game could potentially improve the memorability of answers to
security questions. This potential improvement in memorability, could
eventually help reduce the trade-off between usability and security in
fall-back authentication.

 <dc:title>Can Image Retrieval help Visual Saliency Detection?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Shuang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mathews, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel image retrieval framework for visual saliency detection
using information about salient objects contained within bounding box
annotations for similar images. For each test image, we train a customized SVM
from similar example images to predict the saliency values of its object
proposals and generate an external saliency map (ES) by aggregating the
regional scores. To overcome limitations caused by the size of the training
dataset, we also propose an internal optimization module which computes an
internal saliency map (IS) by measuring the low-level contrast information of
the test image. The two maps, ES and IS, have complementary properties so we
take a weighted combination to further improve the detection performance.
Experimental results on several challenging datasets demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>Function approximation with ReLU-like zonal function networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mhaskar, Hrushikesh N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A zonal function (ZF) network on the $q$ dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^q$ is
a network of the form $\mathbf{x}\mapsto \sum_{k=1}^n
a_k\phi(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{x}_k)$ where $\phi :[-1,1]\to\mathbf{R}$ is the
activation function, $\mathbf{x}_k\in\mathbb{S}^q$ are the centers, and
$a_k\in\mathbb{R}$. While the approximation properties of such networks are
well studied in the context of positive definite activation functions, recent
interest in deep and shallow networks motivate the study of activation
functions of the form $\phi(t)=|t|$, which are not positive definite. In this
paper, we define an appropriate smoothess class and establish approximation
properties of such networks for functions in this class. The centers can be
chosen independently of the target function, and the coefficients are linear
combinations of the training data. The constructions preserve rotational
symmetries.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchical Temporal Memory is a new machine learning algorithm intended to
mimic the working principle of neocortex, part of the human brain, which is
responsible for learning, classification, and making predictions. Although many
works illustrate its effectiveness as a software algorithm, hardware design for
HTM remains an open research problem. Hence, this work proposes an architecture
for HTM Spatial Pooler and Temporal Memory with learning mechanism, which
creates a single image for each class based on important and unimportant
features of all images in the training set. In turn, the reduction in the
number of templates within database reduces the memory requirements and
increases the processing speed. Moreover, face recognition analysis indicates
that for a large number of training images, the proposed design provides higher
accuracy results (83.5\%) compared to only Spatial Pooler design presented in
the previous works.

 <dc:description>  Image blurring artifact is the main challenge to any spatial, denoising
filters. This artifact is contributed by the heterogeneous intensities within
the given neighborhood or window of fixed size. Selection of most similar
intensities (G-Neighbors) helps to adapt the window shape which is of
edge-aware nature and subsequently reduce this blurring artifact. The paper
presents a memristive circuit design to implement this variable pixel
G-Neighbor filter. The memristive circuits exhibits parallel processing
capabilities (near real-time) and neuromorphic architectures. The proposed
design is demonstrated as simulations of both algorithm (MATLAB) and circuit
(SPICE). Circuit design is evaluated for various parameters such as processing
time, fabrication area used, and power consumption. Denoising performance is
demonstrated using image quality metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio
(PSNR), mean square error (MSE), and structural similarity index measure
(SSIM). Combining adaptive filtering method with mean filter resulted in
average improvement of MSE to about 65\% reduction, increase of PSNR and SSIM
to nearly 18\% and 12\% correspondingly.

 <dc:description>  In the Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), due to the high mobility of
vehicles, the network parameters change frequently and the information which
the sender maintains may outdate when it wants to transmit data packet to the
receiver, so for improving the routing effective, we propose the probability
prediction based reliable (PRO) opportunistic routing for VANETs. The PRO
routing algorithm can predict the variation of Signal to Interference plus
Noise Ratio (SINR) and packet queue length (PQL) in the receiver. The
prediction results are used to determine the utility of each relaying vehicle
in the candidate set. The calculation of the vehicle utility is weight based
algorithm and the weights are the variances of SINR and PQL of the candidate
relaying vehicles. The relaying priority of each relaying vehicle is determined
by the value of the utility. By these innovations, the PRO can achieve better
routing performance (such as the packet delivery ratio, the end-to-end delay,
and the network throughput) than the SRPE, ExOR (street-centric), and GPSR
routing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Transfer learning significantly accelerates the reinforcement learning
process by exploiting relevant knowledge from previous experiences. The problem
of optimally selecting source policies during the learning process is of great
importance yet challenging. There has been little theoretical analysis of this
problem. In this paper, we develop an optimal online method to select source
policies for reinforcement learning. This method formulates online source
policy selection as a multi-armed bandit problem and augments Q-learning with
policy reuse. We provide theoretical guarantees of the optimal selection
process and convergence to the optimal policy. In addition, we conduct
experiments on a grid-based robot navigation domain to demonstrate its
efficiency and robustness by comparing to the state-of-the-art transfer
learning method.

 <dc:description>  Selecting the most suitable local invariant feature detector for a particular
application has rendered the task of evaluating feature detectors a critical
issue in vision research. Although the literature offers a variety of
comparison works focusing on performance evaluation of image feature detectors
under several types of image transformations, the influence of the scene
content on the performance of local feature detectors has received little
attention so far. This paper aims to bridge this gap with a new framework for
determining the type of scenes which maximize and minimize the performance of
detectors in terms of repeatability rate. The results are presented for several
state-of-the-art feature detectors that have been obtained using a large image
database of 20482 images under JPEG compression, uniform light and blur changes
with 539 different scenes captured from real-world scenarios. These results
provide new insights into the behavior of feature detectors.

 <dc:description>  Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge as it requires
the ability to understand and encode the multi-modal inputs - in terms of image
processing and natural language processing. The algorithm further needs to
learn how to perform reasoning over this multi-modal representation so it can
answer the questions correctly. This paper presents a survey of different
approaches proposed to solve the problem of Visual Question Answering. We also
describe the current state of the art model in later part of paper. In
particular, the paper describes the approaches taken by various algorithms to
extract image features, text features and the way these are employed to predict
answers. We also briefly discuss the experiments performed to evaluate the VQA
models and report their performances on diverse datasets including newly
released VQA2.0[8].

 <dc:description>  This work studies the labeled multi-robot path and motion planning problem in
continuous domains, in the absence of static obstacles. Given $n$ robots which
may be arbitrarily close to each other and assuming random start and goal
configurations for the robots, we derived an $O(n^3)$, complete algorithm that
produces solutions with constant-factor optimality guarantees on both makespan
and distance optimality, in expectation. Furthermore, our algorithm only
requires a small constant factor expansion of the initial and goal
configuration footprints for solving the problem. In addition to strong
theoretical guarantees, we present a thorough computational evaluation of the
proposed solution. Beyond the baseline solution, adapting an effective (but
non-polynomial time) robot routing subroutine, we also provide a highly
efficient implementation that quickly computes near-optimal solutions. Hardware
experiments on microMVP platform composed of non-holonomic robots confirms the
practical applicability of our algorithmic pipeline.

total amount of information flow from the remaining code blocks during the
repair process. This problem naturally arises in the context of distributed
storage systems as the node repair problem [7]. The constructions of
exact-repairable MDS codes with optimal repair-bandwidth require working with
large sub-packetization levels, which restricts their employment in practice.
  This paper presents constructions for MDS codes that simultaneously provide
both small repair bandwidth and small sub-packetization level. In particular,
this paper presents two general approaches to construct exact-repairable MDS
codes that aim at significantly reducing the required sub-packetization level
at the cost of slightly sub-optimal repair bandwidth. The first approach gives
MDS codes that have repair bandwidth at most twice the optimal
repair-bandwidth. Additionally, these codes also have the smallest possible
sub-packetization level $\ell = O(r)$, where $r$ denotes the number of parity
blocks. This approach is then generalized to design codes that have their
repair bandwidth approaching the optimal repair-bandwidth at the cost of
graceful increment in the required sub-packetization level. The second approach
transforms an MDS code with optimal repair-bandwidth and large
sub-packetization level into a longer MDS code with small sub-packetization
level and near-optimal repair bandwidth. For a given $r$, the obtained codes
have their sub-packetization level scaling logarithmically with the code
length. In addition, the obtained codes require field size only linear in the
code length and ensure load balancing among the intact code blocks in terms of
the information downloaded from these blocks during the exact reconstruction of
a code block.

 <dc:description>  The average achievable rate of an Opportunistic Non-Orthogonal Multiple
Access (O-NOMA) based Cooperative Relaying System (CRS) with Channel State
Information (CSI) known at the transmitter end is analyzed under Rician fading
channels. For opportunistic transmission of data signals, CSI is used for the
source-to-relay and source-to-destination links, which helps the transmitter to
select the best out of the cooperative NOMA transmission and the direct
transmission of signals, instantaneously. The average achievable rate of the
O-NOMA and conventional NOMA (C-NOMA) based CRSs is considered for the
performance comparison and the exact and asymptotic analytical expressions of
the achievable rates has been provided. Asymptotic results are verified through
Monte Carlo simulations for various channel powers and power allocation
coefficients. Numerical results verify that the derived analytical results are
matched well with the Monte Carlo simulations and shows that O-NOMA-based CRS
achieves better rate performance than C-NOMA-based CRS with the increasing
power allocation coefficients, transmit Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and
channel powers.

 <dc:description>  Digital image correlation (DIC) is a well-established, non-invasive technique
for tracking and quantifying the deformation of mechanical samples under
strain. While it provides an obvious way to observe incremental and aggregate
displacement information, it seems likely that DIC data sets, which after all
reflect the spatially-resolved response of a microstructure to loads, contain
much richer information than has generally been extracted from them. In this
paper, we demonstrate a machine-learning approach to quantifying the prior
deformation history of a crystalline sample based on its response to a
subsequent DIC test. This prior deformation history is encoded in the
microstructure through the inhomogeneity of the dislocation microstructure, and
in the spatial correlations of the dislocation patterns, which mediate the
system's response to the DIC test load. Our domain consists of deformed
crystalline thin films generated by a discrete dislocation plasticity
simulation. We explore the range of applicability of machine learning (ML) for
typical experimental protocols, and as a function of possible size effects and
stochasticity. Plasticity size effects may directly influence the data,
rendering unsupervised techniques unable to distinguish different plasticity
regimes.

 <dc:description>  With the recent increase in data online, discovering meaningful opportunities
can be time-consuming and complicated for many individuals. To overcome this
data overload challenge, we present a novel text-content-based recommender
system as a valuable tool to predict user interests. To that end, we develop a
specific procedure to create user models and item feature-vectors, where items
are described in free text. The user model is generated by soliciting from a
user a few keywords and expanding those keywords into a list of weighted
near-synonyms. The item feature-vectors are generated from the textual
descriptions of the items, using modified tf-idf values of the users' keywords
and their near-synonyms. Once the users are modeled and the items are
abstracted into feature vectors, the system returns the maximum-similarity
items as recommendations to that user. Our experimental evaluation shows that
our method of creating the user models and item feature-vectors resulted in
higher precision and accuracy in comparison to well-known
feature-vector-generating methods like Glove and Word2Vec. It also shows that
stemming and the use of a modified version of tf-idf increase the accuracy and
precision by 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to non-stemming and the standard
tf-idf definition. Moreover, the evaluation results show that updating the user
model from usage histories improves the precision and accuracy of the system.
This recommender system has been developed as part of the Agnes application,
which runs on iOS and Android platforms and is accessible through the Agnes
website.

 <dc:description>  While deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have achieved unprecedented
successes in a range of challenging problems, their applicability has been
mainly limited to simulation or game domains due to the high sample complexity
of the trial-and-error learning process. However, real-world robotic
applications often need a data-efficient learning process with safety-critical
constraints. In this paper, we consider the challenging problem of learning
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control for tracking a moving target. To acquire
a strategy that combines perception and control, we represent the policy by a
convolutional neural network. We develop a hierarchical approach that combines
a model-free policy gradient method with a conventional feedback
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to enable stable learning
without catastrophic failure. The neural network is trained by a combination of
supervised learning from raw images and reinforcement learning from games of
self-play. We show that the proposed approach can learn a target following
policy in a simulator efficiently and the learned behavior can be successfully
transferred to the DJI quadrotor platform for real-world UAV control.

 <dc:description>  Modeling and simulation of pedestrian behavior is used in applications such
as planning large buildings, disaster management, or urban planning.
Realistically simulating pedestrian behavior is challenging, due to the
complexity of individual behavior as well as the complexity of interactions of
pedestrians with each other and with the environment. This work-in-progress
paper addresses the tactical (path planning) and the operational level
(movement control) of pedestrian simulation from the perspective of
multiagent-based modeling. We propose (1) an novel extension of the JPS routing
algorithm for tactical planning, and (2) an architecture how path planning can
be integrated with a social-force based movement control. The architecture is
inspired by layered architectures for robot planning and control. We validate
correctness and efficiency of our approach through simulation runs.

 <dc:description>  This letter studies bi-directional secure information exchange in a
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system enabled by
a full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward
(AF) relay. The AF relay injects artificial noise (AN) in order to confuse the
eavesdropper. Specifically, we assume a zeroforcing (ZF) solution constraint to
eliminate the residual self-interference (RSI). As a consequence, we address
the optimal joint design of the ZF matrix and the AN covariance matrix at the
relay node as well as the transmit power at the sources. We propose an
alternating algorithm utilizing semi-definite programming (SDP) technique and
one-dimensional searching to achieve the optimal solution. Simulation results
are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Despite noise suppression being a mature area in signal processing, it
remains highly dependent on fine tuning of estimator algorithms and parameters.
In this paper, we demonstrate a hybrid DSP/deep learning approach to noise
suppression. A deep neural network with four hidden layers is used to estimate
ideal critical band gains, while a more traditional pitch filter attenuates
noise between pitch harmonics. The approach achieves significantly higher
quality than a traditional minimum mean squared error spectral estimator, while
keeping the complexity low enough for real-time operation at 48 kHz on a
low-power processor.

 <dc:description>  While skin cancer is the most diagnosed form of cancer in men and women, with
more cases diagnosed each year than all other cancers combined, sufficiently
early diagnosis results in very good prognosis and as such makes early
detection crucial. While radiomics have shown considerable promise as a
powerful diagnostic tool for significantly improving oncological diagnostic
accuracy and efficiency, current radiomics-driven methods have largely rely on
pre-defined, hand-crafted quantitative features, which can greatly limit the
ability to fully characterize unique cancer phenotype that distinguish it from
healthy tissue. Recently, the notion of discovery radiomics was introduced,
where a large amount of custom, quantitative radiomic features are directly
discovered from the wealth of readily available medical imaging data. In this
study, we present a novel discovery radiomics framework for skin cancer
detection, where we leverage novel deep multi-column radiomic sequencers for
high-throughput discovery and extraction of a large amount of custom radiomic
features tailored for characterizing unique skin cancer tissue phenotype. The
discovered radiomic sequencer was tested against 9,152 biopsy-proven clinical
images comprising of different skin cancers such as melanoma and basal cell
carcinoma, and demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 75%,
respectively, thus achieving dermatologist-level performance and \break hence
can be a powerful tool for assisting general practitioners and dermatologists
alike in improving the efficiency, consistency, and accuracy of skin cancer
diagnosis.

 <dc:title>A fundamental structure of a strongly controllable group system or group

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>H.1.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A finite group G defines a signature group if and only if there is a normal
chain of G and a complete set of coset representatives of the normal chain that
can be arranged in a triangular form, where representatives in the same row can
be put in 1-1 correspondence so that certain sets of subtriangles of
representatives form isomorphic groups, when subtriangle multiplication is
induced by multiplication in G. We show that any strongly controllable time
invariant group system (or group shift or group code) can be associated with a
signature group. Conversely given a signature group, we can construct a
strongly controllable time invariant group system. These results show that to
some extent the study of strongly controllable time invariant group systems can
be reduced to the study of signature groups. For a general strongly
controllable group system which may vary in time, we show there is a signature
sequence of groups with similar properties as a signature group. The general
strongly controllable group system can be restricted to a finite interval, in
which case it becomes a block group system. We describe the additive structure
of the generator vectors which comprise the block group system. This new result
applies to any mathematical structure defined on a finite number of coordinates
which is closed under group addition in each coordinate, such as any linear
block code over a group, field, vector space, ring, or module. Finally we give
algorithms to construct any strongly controllable group system or its time
invariant version or block version.

 <dc:description>  The continually increasing number of documents produced each year
necessitates ever improving information processing methods for searching,
retrieving, and organizing text. Central to these information processing
methods is document classification, which has become an important application
for supervised learning. Recently the performance of these traditional
classifiers has degraded as the number of documents has increased. This is
because along with this growth in the number of documents has come an increase
in the number of categories. This paper approaches this problem differently
from current document classification methods that view the problem as
multi-class classification. Instead we perform hierarchical classification
using an approach we call Hierarchical Deep Learning for Text classification
(HDLTex). HDLTex employs stacks of deep learning architectures to provide
specialized understanding at each level of the document hierarchy.

This system enables a user to conceal an object located behind a display that
surrounded by 3D objects. If we considered here the tracked point of observer s
eyes is a light source, the system will work on estimating shadow shape of the
display device that falls on the objects in background. The system uses the 3d

 <dc:description>  We introduce Graph-Structured Sum-Product Networks (GraphSPNs), a
probabilistic approach to structured prediction for problems where dependencies
between latent variables are expressed in terms of arbitrary, dynamic graphs.
While many approaches to structured prediction place strict constraints on the
interactions between inferred variables, many real-world problems can be only
characterized using complex graph structures of varying size, often
contaminated with noise when obtained from real data. Here, we focus on one
such problem in the domain of robotics. We demonstrate how GraphSPNs can be
used to bolster inference about semantic, conceptual place descriptions using
noisy topological relations discovered by a robot exploring large-scale office
spaces. Through experiments, we show that GraphSPNs consistently outperform the
traditional approach based on undirected graphical models, successfully
disambiguating information in global semantic maps built from uncertain, noisy
local evidence. We further exploit the probabilistic nature of the model to
infer marginal distributions over semantic descriptions of as yet unexplored
places and detect spatial environment configurations that are novel and
incongruent with the known evidence.

 <dc:description>  We study multi-user massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems and
focus on downlink transmission, where the base station (BS) employs a large
antenna array with low-cost 1-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The
direct combination of existing beamforming schemes with 1-bit DACs is shown to
lead to an error floor at medium-to-high SNR regime, due to the coarse
quantization of the DACs with limited precision. In this paper, based on the
constructive interference we consider both a quantized linear beamforming
scheme where we analytically obtain the optimal beamforming matrix, and a
non-linear mapping scheme where we directly design the transmit signal vector.
Due to the 1-bit quantization, the formulated optimization for the non-linear
mapping scheme is shown to be non-convex. To solve this problem, the non-convex
constraints of the 1-bit DACs are firstly relaxed, followed by an element-wise
normalization to satisfy the 1-bit DAC transmission. We further propose a
low-complexity symbol scaling scheme that consists of three stages, in which
the quantized transmit signal on each antenna element is selected sequentially.
Numerical results show that the proposed symbol scaling scheme achieves a
comparable performance to the optimization-based non-linear mapping approach,
while its corresponding complexity is negligible compared to that of the
non-linear scheme.

 <dc:title>Interdependence of clusters measures and distance distribution in
  compact metric spaces</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pushnyakov, Alexey</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A compact metric space $(X, \rho)$ is given. Let $\mu$ be a Borel measure on
$X$. By $r$-cluster we mean a measurable subset of $X$ with diameter at most
$r$. A family of $k$ $2r$-clusters is called a $r$-cluster structure of order
$k$ if any two clusters from the family are separated by a distance at least
$r$. By measure of a cluster structure we mean a sum of clusters measures from
the cluster structure. Using the Blaschke selection theorem one can prove that
there exists a cluster structure $\mathcal{X}^*$ of maximum measure. We study
dependence $\mu(\mathcal{X}^*)$ on distance distribution. The main issue is to
find restrictions for distance distribution which guarantee that
$\mu(\mathcal{X}^*)$ is close to $\mu(X)$. We propose a discretization of
distance distribution and in terms of this discretization obtain a lower bound
for $\mu(\mathcal{X}^*)$.

parametric restrictions for distance distribution measure of maximal cluster
structure $\mu(\mathcal{X})^*$ is close $\mu(X)$ and lower bound for
$\mu(\mathcal{X})^*$ converges to $\mu(X)$ when corresponding parameters tend
to 0. However, this bound asymptotically unimprovable. We propose an additional
restriction for distance distribution that is responsible for balance of
cluster's measure in cluster structure. This restriction allows to
significantly improve previous bound in asymptotic sense.

 <dc:description>  We present a robust multi-robot convoying approach that relies on visual
detection of the leading agent, thus enabling target following in unstructured
3-D environments. Our method is based on the idea of tracking-by-detection,
which interleaves efficient model-based object detection with temporal
filtering of image-based bounding box estimation. This approach has the
important advantage of mitigating tracking drift (i.e. drifting away from the
target object), which is a common symptom of model-free trackers and is
detrimental to sustained convoying in practice. To illustrate our solution, we
collected extensive footage of an underwater robot in ocean settings, and
hand-annotated its location in each frame. Based on this dataset, we present an
empirical comparison of multiple tracker variants, including the use of several
convolutional neural networks, both with and without recurrent connections, as
well as frequency-based model-free trackers. We also demonstrate the
practicality of this tracking-by-detection strategy in real-world scenarios by
successfully controlling a legged underwater robot in five degrees of freedom
to follow another robot's independent motion.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as a popular
building block for natural language processing (NLP). Despite their success,
most existing CNN models employed in NLP are not expressive enough, in the
sense that all input sentences share the same learned (and static) set of
filters. Motivated by this problem, we propose an adaptive convolutional filter
generation framework for natural language understanding, by leveraging a meta
network to generate input-aware filters. We further generalize our framework to
model question-answer sentence pairs and propose an adaptive question answering
(AdaQA) model; a novel two-way feature abstraction mechanism is introduced to
encapsulate co-dependent sentence representations. We investigate the
effectiveness of our framework on document categorization and answer
sentence-selection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  Discriminative localization is essential for fine-grained image
classification task, which devotes to recognizing hundreds of subcategories in
the same basic-level category. Reflecting on discriminative regions of objects,
key differences among different subcategories are subtle and local. Existing
methods generally adopt a two-stage learning framework: The first stage is to
localize the discriminative regions of objects, and the second is to encode the
discriminative features for training classifiers. However, these methods
generally have two limitations: (1) Separation of the two-stage learning is
time-consuming. (2) Dependence on object and parts annotations for
discriminative localization learning leads to heavily labor-consuming labeling.
It is highly challenging to address these two important limitations
simultaneously. Existing methods only focus on one of them. Therefore, this
paper proposes the discriminative localization approach via saliency-guided
Faster R-CNN to address the above two limitations at the same time, and our
main novelties and advantages are: (1) End-to-end network based on Faster R-CNN
is designed to simultaneously localize discriminative regions and encode
discriminative features, which accelerates classification speed. (2)
Saliency-guided localization learning is proposed to localize the
discriminative region automatically, avoiding labor-consuming labeling. Both
are jointly employed to simultaneously accelerate classification speed and
eliminate dependence on object and parts annotations. Comparing with the
state-of-the-art methods on the widely-used CUB-200-2011 dataset, our approach
achieves both the best classification accuracy and efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Design of clock synchronization for networked nodes faces a fundamental
trade-off between synchronization accuracy and universality for heterogeneous
platforms, because a high synchronization accuracy generally requires
platform-dependent hardware-level network packet timestamping. This paper
presents TouchSync, a new indoor clock synchronization approach for wearables
that achieves millisecond accuracy while preserving universality in that it
uses standard system calls only, such as reading system clock, sampling
sensors, and sending/receiving network messages. The design of TouchSync is
driven by a key finding from our extensive measurements that the skin electric
potentials (SEPs) induced by powerline radiation are salient, periodic, and
synchronous on a same wearer and even across different wearers. TouchSync
integrates the SEP signal into the universal principle of Network Time Protocol
and solves an integer ambiguity problem by fusing the ambiguous results in
multiple synchronization rounds to conclude an accurate clock offset between
two synchronizing wearables. With our shared code, TouchSync can be readily
integrated into any wearable applications. Extensive evaluation based on our
Arduino and TinyOS implementations shows that TouchSync's synchronization
errors are below 3 and 7 milliseconds on the same wearer and between two
wearers 10 kilometers apart, respectively.

and has attracted a lot of attentions. However, existing reading comprehension
datasets are mostly in English. To add diversity in reading comprehension
datasets, in this paper we propose a new Chinese reading comprehension dataset
for accelerating related research in the community. The proposed dataset
contains two different types: cloze-style reading comprehension and user query
reading comprehension, associated with large-scale training data as well as
human-annotated validation and hidden test set. Along with this dataset, we
also hosted the first Evaluation on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension
(CMRC-2017) and successfully attracted tens of participants, which suggest the
potential impact of this dataset.

 <dc:title>Continuous Monitoring of Pareto Frontiers on Partially Ordered
  Attributes for Many Users</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sultana, Afroza</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Li, Chengkai</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of continuous object dissemination---given a large
number of users and continuously arriving new objects, deliver an object to all
users who prefer the object. Many real world applications analyze users'
preferences for effective object dissemination. For continuously arriving
objects, timely finding users who prefer a new object is challenging. In this
paper, we consider an append-only table of objects with multiple attributes and
users' preferences on individual attributes are modeled as strict partial
orders. An object is preferred by a user if it belongs to the Pareto frontier
with respect to the user's partial orders. Users' preferences can be similar.
Exploiting shared computation across similar preferences of different users, we
design algorithms to find target users of a new object. In order to find users
of similar preferences, we study the novel problem of clustering users'
preferences that are represented as partial orders. We also present an
approximate solution of the problem of finding target users which is more
efficient than the exact one while ensuring sufficient accuracy. Furthermore,
we extend the algorithms to operate under the semantics of sliding window. We
present the results from comprehensive experiments for evaluating the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

 <dc:description>  Sometimes, we do not use a maximum likelihood estimator of a probability but
it's a smoothed estimator in order to cope with the zero frequency problem.
This is often the case when we use the Naive Bayes classifier. Laplace
smoothing is a popular choice with the value of Laplace smoothing estimator
being the expected value of posterior distribution of the probability where we
assume that the prior is uniform distribution. In this paper, we investigate
the confidence intervals of the estimator of Laplace smoothing. We show that
the likelihood function for this confidence interval is the same as the
likelihood of a maximum likelihood estimated value of a probability of
Bernoulli trials. Although the confidence interval of the maximum likelihood
estimator of the Bernoulli trial probability has been studied well, and
although the approximate formulas for the confidence interval are well known,
we cannot use the interval of maximum likelihood estimator since the interval
contains the value 0, which is not suitable for the Naive Bayes classifier. We
are also interested in the accuracy of existing approximation methods since
these approximation methods are frequently used but their accuracy is not well
discussed. Thus, we obtain the confidence interval by numerically integrating
the likelihood function. In this paper, we report the difference between the
confidence interval that we computed and the confidence interval by approximate
formulas. Finally, we include a URL, where all of the intervals that we
computed are available.

 <dc:title>Non-Cash Auction for Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: A
  Contract Theoretical Model with Joint Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), spectrum trading is an efficient way for
secondary users (SUs) to achieve dynamic spectrum access and to bring economic
benefits for the primary users (PUs). Existing methods requires full payment
from SU, which blocked many potential &quot;buyers&quot;, and thus limited the PU's
expected income. To better improve PUs' revenue from spectrum trading in a CRN,
we introduce a financing contract, which is similar to a sealed non-cash
auction that allows SU to do a financing. Unlike previous mechanism designs in
CRN, the financing contract allows the SU to only pay part of the total amount
when the contract is signed, known as the down payment. Then, after the
spectrum is released and utilized, the SU pays the rest of payment, known as
the installment payment, from the revenue generated by utilizing the spectrum.
The way the financing contract carries out and the sealed non-cash auction
works similarly. Thus, contract theory is employed here as the mathematical
framework to solve the non-cash auction problem and form mutually beneficial
relationships between PUs and SUs. As the PU may not have the full
acknowledgement of the SU's financial status, nor the SU's capability in making
revenue, the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard arise in the two
scenarios, respectively. Therefore, a joint adverse selection and moral hazard
model is considered here. In particular, we present three situations when
either or both adverse selection and moral hazard are present during the
trading. Furthermore, both discrete and continuous models are provided in this
paper. Through extensive simulations, we show that the adverse selection and
moral hazard cases serve as the upper and lower bounds of the general case
where both problems are present.

 <dc:description>  We show that a cooperative game may be decomposed into a sum of component
games, one for each player, using the combinatorial Hodge decomposition on a
graph. This decomposition is shown to satisfy certain efficiency, null-player,
symmetry, and linearity properties. Consequently, we obtain a new
characterization of the classical Shapley value as the value of the grand
coalition in each player's component game. We also relate this decomposition to
a least-squares problem involving inessential games (in a similar spirit to
previous work on least-squares and minimum-norm solution concepts) and to the
graph Laplacian. Finally, we generalize this approach to games with weights
and/or constraints on coalition formation.

 <dc:description>  Feature extraction and matching are two crucial components in person
Re-Identification (ReID). The large pose deformations and the complex view
variations exhibited by the captured person images significantly increase the
difficulty of learning and matching of the features from person images. To
overcome these difficulties, in this work we propose a Pose-driven Deep
Convolutional (PDC) model to learn improved feature extraction and matching
models from end to end. Our deep architecture explicitly leverages the human
part cues to alleviate the pose variations and learn robust feature
representations from both the global image and different local parts. To match
the features from global human body and local body parts, a pose driven feature
weighting sub-network is further designed to learn adaptive feature fusions.
Extensive experimental analyses and results on three popular datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements of our model over all
published state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Technical Support Scams (TSS), which combine online abuse with social
engineering over the phone channel, have persisted despite several law
enforcement actions. The tactics used by these scammers have evolved over time
and they have targeted an ever increasing number of technology brands. Although
recent research has provided insights into TSS, these scams have now evolved to
exploit ubiquitously used online services such as search and sponsored
advertisements served in response to search queries. We use a data-driven
approach to understand search-and-ad abuse by TSS to gain visibility into the
online infrastructure that facilitates it. By carefully formulating tech
support queries with multiple search engines, we collect data about both the
support infrastructure and the websites to which TSS victims are directed when
they search online for tech support resources. We augment this with a DNS-based
amplification technique to further enhance visibility into this abuse
infrastructure. By analyzing the collected data, we demonstrate that tech
support scammers are (1) successful in getting major as well as custom search
engines to return links to websites controlled by them, and (2) they are able
to get ad networks to serve malicious advertisements that lead to scam pages.
Our study period of 8 months uncovered over 9,000 TSS domains, of both passive
and aggressive types, with minimal overlap between sets that are reached via
organic search results and sponsored ads. Also, we found over 2,400 support
domains which aid the TSS domains in manipulating organic search results.
Moreover, we found little overlap with domains that are reached via abuse of
domain parking and URL-shortening services which was investigated previously.
Thus, investigation of search-and-ad abuse provides new insights into TSS
tactics and helps detect previously unknown abuse infrastructure that
facilitates these scams.

 <dc:description>  A novel algorithm is proposed for CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition to
exploit best rank-1 tensor approximation. Different from the existing
algorithms, our algorithm updates rank-1 tensors simultaneously in parallel. In
order to achieve this, we develop new all-at-once algorithms for best rank-1
tensor approximation based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method and the rotational
update. We show that the LM algorithm has the same complexity of first-order
optimisation algorithms, while the rotational method leads to solving the best
rank-1 approximation of tensors of size $2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2$. We
derive a closed-form expression of the best rank-1 tensor of $2\times 2 \times
2$ tensors and present an ALS algorithm which updates 3 component at a time for
higher order tensors. The proposed algorithm is illustrated in decomposition of
difficult tensors which are associated with multiplication of two matrices.

 <dc:description>  Recently, machine learning has been used in every possible field to leverage
its amazing power. For a long time, the net-working and distributed computing
system is the key infrastructure to provide efficient computational resource
for machine learning. Networking itself can also benefit from this promising
technology. This article focuses on the application of Machine Learning
techniques for Networking (MLN), which can not only help solve the intractable
old network questions but also stimulate new network applications. In this
article, we summarize the basic workflow to explain how to apply the machine
learning technology in the networking domain. Then we provide a selective
survey of the latest representative advances with explanations on their design
principles and benefits. These advances are divided into several network design
objectives and the detailed information of how they perform in each step of MLN
workflow is presented. Finally, we shed light on the new opportunities on
networking design and community building of this new inter-discipline. Our goal
is to provide a broad research guideline on networking with machine learning to
help and motivate researchers to develop innovative algorithms, standards and
frameworks.

 <dc:description>  This present research investigated the relationship between personal
impressions and the acoustic nonverbal communication conveyed by employees
being interviewed. First, we investigated the extent to which different
conversation topics addressed during the interview induced changes in the
interviewees' acoustic parameters. Next, we attempted to predict the observed
and self-assessed attitudes and body language of the interviewees based on the
acoustic data. The results showed that topicality caused significant deviations
in the acoustic parameters statistics, but the ability to predict the personal
perceptions of the interviewees based on their acoustic non-verbal
communication was relatively independent of topicality, due to the natural
redundancy inherent in acoustic attributes. Our findings suggest that joint
modeling of speech and visual cues may improve the assessment of interviewee
profiles.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition, degeneracy often occurs in some
difficult scenarios, e.g., when the rank exceeds the tensor dimension, or when
the loading components are highly collinear in several or all modes, or when
CPD does not have an optimal solution. In such the cases, norms of some rank-1
terms become significantly large and cancel each other. This makes algorithms
getting stuck in local minima while running a huge number of iterations does
not improve the decomposition. In this paper, we propose an error preservation
correction method to deal with such problem. Our aim is to seek a new tensor
whose norms of rank-1 tensor components are minimised in an optimization
problem, while it preserves the approximation error. An alternating correction
algorithm and an all-atone algorithm have been developed for the problem. In
addition, we propose a novel CPD with a bound constraint on a norm of the
rank-one tensors. The method can be useful for decomposing tensors that cannot
be analyzed by traditional algorithms, such as tensors corresponding to the
matrix multiplication.

 <dc:description>  In this project, we designed a modularity-based dynamic community detection
method, which keeps tracking the community structure of a dynamic network with
very low computing complexity in updating the community structure while the
network changing dynamically, and we implemented our algorithm using Java.
Furthermore, we generated random dynamic networks that have the community
structures with different parameters as our experiment dataset. Extensive
experiments have been taken to evaluate our method in terms of accuracy and
efficiency. The experiment result shows that, comparing with Louvain algorithm,
our method could greatly enhance the efficiency without jeopardizing much of
the accuracy. Although we got a pretty good results from our experiments, we
only implemented our method on our own generated dataset. For future work, we
might want to test our method on real public dataset. In the real public
dynamic networks, there might be more specific dynamic change cases other than
the cases covered by our method, so that we might need to dig into more
specific other dynamic cases and find out the solutions.

 <dc:description>  One of the big challenges in program obfuscation consists in modifying not
only the program's straight-line code (SLC) but also the program's control flow
graph (CFG). Indeed, if only SLC is modified, the program's CFG can be
extracted and analyzed. Usually, the CFG leaks a considerable amount of
information on the program's structure.
  In this work we propose a method allowing to re-write a code P into a
functionally equivalent code P' such that CFG{P} and CFG{P'} are radically
different.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the expressive power of $\mathsf{MATLANG}$, a formal language
for matrix manipulation based on common matrix operations and linear algebra.
The language can be extended with the operation $\mathsf{inv}$ of inverting a
matrix. In $\mathsf{MATLANG}+\mathsf{inv}$ we can compute the transitive
closure of directed graphs, whereas we show that this is not possible without
inversion. Indeed we show that the basic language can be simulated in the
relational algebra with arithmetic operations, grouping, and summation. We also
consider an operation $\mathsf{eigen}$ for diagonalizing a matrix, which is
defined so that different eigenvectors returned for a same eigenvalue are
orthogonal. We show that $\mathsf{inv}$ can be expressed in
$\mathsf{MATLANG}+\mathsf{eigen}$. We put forward the open question whether
there are boolean queries about matrices, or generic queries about graphs,
expressible in $\mathsf{MATLANG} + \mathsf{eigen}$ but not in
$\mathsf{MATLANG}+\mathsf{inv}$. The evaluation problem for $\mathsf{MATLANG} +
\mathsf{eigen}$ is shown to be complete for the complexity class $\exists
\mathbf{R}$.

 <dc:title>Distributed Discrete-time Optimization in Multi-agent Networks Using

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes distributed discrete-time algorithms to cooperatively
solve an additive cost optimization problem in multi-agent networks. The
striking feature lies in the use of only the sign of relative state information
between neighbors, which substantially differentiates our algorithms from
others in the existing literature. We first interpret the proposed algorithms
in terms of the penalty method in optimization theory and then perform
non-asymptotic analysis to study convergence for static network graphs.
Compared with the celebrated distributed subgradient algorithms, which however
use the exact relative state information, the convergence speed is essentially
not affected by the loss of information. We also study how introducing noise
into the relative state information and randomly activated graphs affect the
performance of our algorithms. Finally, we validate the theoretical results on
a class of distributed quantile regression problems.

 <dc:title>An Evolutionary Computing Enriched RS Attack Resilient Medical Image
  Steganography Model for Telemedicine Applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mansour, Romany F.</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  The recent advancement in computing technologies and resulting vision based
applications have gives rise to a novel practice called telemedicine that
requires patient diagnosis images or allied information to recommend or even
perform diagnosis practices being located remotely. However, to ensure accurate
and optimal telemedicine there is the requirement of seamless or flawless
biomedical information about patient. On the contrary, medical data transmitted
over insecure channel often remains prone to get manipulated or corrupted by
attackers. The existing cryptosystems alone are not sufficient to deal with
these issues and hence in this paper a highly robust reversible image
steganography model has been developed for secret information hiding. Unlike
traditional wavelet transform techniques, we incorporated Discrete Ripplet
Transformation (DRT) technique for message embedding in the medical cover
images. In addition, to assure seamless communication over insecure channel, a
dual cryptosystem model containing proposed steganography scheme and RSA
cryptosystem has been developed. One of the key novelties of the proposed
research work is the use of adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) for optimal pixel
adjustment process (OPAP) that enriches data hiding capacity as well as
imperceptibility features. The performance assessment reveals that the proposed
steganography model outperforms other wavelet transformation based approaches
in terms of high PSNR, embedding capacity, imperceptibility etc.

 <dc:description>  With the expected adoption of robots able to seamlessly and intuitively
interact with people in real-world scenarios, the need arises to provide
non-technically-skilled users with easy-to-understand paradigms for customising
robot behaviors. In this paper, we present an interaction design robot
programming platform for enabling multidisciplinary social robot research and
applications. This platform is referred to Node Primitives (NEP) and consists
of two main parts. On the one hand, a ZeroMQ and Python-based distributed
software framework has been developed to provide inter-process communication
and robot behavior specification mechanisms. On the other hand, a web-based
end-user programming (EUP) interface has been developed to allow for an easy
and intuitive way of programming and executing robot behaviors. In order to
evaluate NEP, we discuss the development of a human-robot interaction
application using arm gestures to control robot behaviors. A usability test for
the proposed EUP interface is also presented.

 <dc:description>  In the coming Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) era, 3D contents will be
popularized just as images and videos today. The security and privacy of these
3D contents should be taken into consideration. 3D contents contain surface
models and solid models. The surface models include point clouds, meshes and
textured models. Previous work mainly focus on encryption of solid models,
point clouds and meshes. This work focuses on the most complicated 3D textured
model. We propose a 3D Lu chaotic mapping based encryption method of 3D
textured model. We encrypt the vertexes, the polygons and the textures of 3D
models separately using the 3D Lu chaotic mapping. Then the encrypted vertices,
edges and texture maps are composited together to form the final encrypted 3D
textured model. The experimental results reveal that our method can encrypt and
decrypt 3D textured models correctly. In addition, our method can resistant
several attacks such as brute-force attack and statistic attack.

domain into another to strike a chord with the target audience. In this
research, we present PersuAIDE! - A persuasive system based on linguistic
creativity to transform given sentence to generate various forms of persuading
sentences. These various forms cover multiple focus of persuasion such as
memorability and sentiment. For a given simple product line, the algorithm is
composed of several steps including: (i) select an appropriate well-known
expression for the target domain to add memorability, (ii) identify keywords
and entities in the given sentence and expression and transform it to produce
creative persuading sentence, and (iii) adding positive or negative sentiment
for further persuasion. The persuasive conversion were manually verified using
qualitative results and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is
empirically discussed.

 <dc:description>  The brain is a noisy system subject to energy constraints. These facts are
rarely taken into account when modelling artificial neural networks. In this
paper, we are interested in demonstrating that those factors can actually lead
to the appearance of robust associative memories. We first propose a simplified
model of noise in the brain, taking into account synaptic noise and
interference from neurons external to the network. When coarsely quantized, we
show that this noise can be reduced to insertions and erasures. We take a
neural network with recurrent modifiable connections, and subject it to noisy
external inputs. We introduce an energy usage limitation principle in the
network as well as consolidated Hebbian learning, resulting in an incremental
processing of inputs. We show that the connections naturally formed correspond
to state-of-the-art binary sparse associative memories.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a deep extension of Sparse Subspace Clustering,
termed Deep Sparse Subspace Clustering (DSSC). Regularized by the unit sphere
distribution assumption for the learned deep features, DSSC can infer a new
data affinity matrix by simultaneously satisfying the sparsity principle of SSC
and the nonlinearity given by neural networks. One of the appealing advantages
brought by DSSC is: when original real-world data do not meet the
class-specific linear subspace distribution assumption, DSSC can employ neural
networks to make the assumption valid with its hierarchical nonlinear
transformations. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first deep
learning based subspace clustering methods. Extensive experiments are conducted
on four real-world datasets to show the proposed DSSC is significantly superior
to 12 existing methods for subspace clustering.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Exploring the significance of geo-tagged information of a satellite image and
associated shadow information in the image to enable man-made infrastructure
dimensional characterization, in this paper a novel approach has been developed
to estimate the height of a man-made structure accurately. Our proposed method
applies shadow detection and shadow feature along with geo-tagged information
retrieved through Google Earth tools, to estimate the structural dimension of
the man-made infrastructure. To characterize the dimensional features of the
man-made structure, we have considered Google Earth satellite images with
precise and crisp edge as well as shadow length information, which have been
obtained using freely available Google Earth information retrieval tool.
Applying our proposed mathematical formulation, the height of man-made
structures as well as neighbouring structures have been estimated which can be
used for certain strategic decision purposes. The proposed method can be
applicable for professionals exploring dimensional characterization of
relatively low height constructions as well as defence purposes. Our proposed
model has outperformed majority of existing approaches, particularly in terms
of accuracy of height estimation of man-made structures.

 <dc:description>  Channel matrix sparsification is considered as a promising approach to reduce
the progressing complexity in large-scale cloud-radio access networks (C-RANs)
based on ideal channel condition assumption. In this paper, the research of
channel sparsification is extend to practical scenarios, in which the perfect
channel state information (CSI) is not available. First, a tractable lower
bound of signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR) fidelity, which is
defined as a ratio of SINRs with and without channel sparsification, is derived
to evaluate the impact of channel estimation error. Based on the theoretical
results, a Dinkelbach-based algorithm is proposed to achieve the global optimal
performance of channel matrix sparsification based on the criterion of
distance. Finally, all these results are extended to a more challenging
scenario with pilot contamination. Finally, simulation results are shown to
evaluate the performance of channel matrix sparsification with imperfect CSIs
and verify our analytical results.

 <dc:description>  We tackle the problem of reflectance estimation from a set of multi-view
images, assuming known geometry. The approach we put forward turns the input
images into reflectance maps, through a robust variational method. The
variational model comprises an image-driven fidelity term and a term which
enforces consistency of the reflectance estimates with respect to each view. If
illumination is fixed across the views, then reflectance estimation remains
under-constrained: a regularization term, which ensures piecewise-smoothness of
the reflectance, is thus used. Reflectance is parameterized in the image
domain, rather than on the surface, which makes the numerical solution much
easier, by resorting to an alternating majorization-minimization approach.
Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are carried out to validate the
proposed strategy.

 <dc:description>  Cryptovirological augmentations present an immediate, incomparable threat.
Over the last decade, the substantial proliferation of crypto-ransomware has
had widespread consequences for consumers and organisations alike. Established
preventive measures perform well, however, the problem has not ceased. Reverse
engineering potentially malicious software is a cumbersome task due to platform
eccentricities and obfuscated transmutation mechanisms, hence requiring
smarter, more efficient detection strategies. The following manuscript presents
a novel approach for the classification of cryptographic primitives in compiled
binary executables using deep learning. The model blueprint, a DCNN, is
fittingly configured to learn from variable-length control flow diagnostics
output from a dynamic trace. To rival the size and variability of contemporary
data compendiums, hence feeding the model cognition, a methodology for the
procedural generation of synthetic cryptographic binaries is defined, utilising
core primitives from OpenSSL with multivariate obfuscation, to draw a vastly
scalable distribution. The library, CryptoKnight, rendered an algorithmic pool
of AES, RC4, Blowfish, MD5 and RSA to synthesis combinable variants which are
automatically fed in its core model. Converging at 91% accuracy, CryptoKnight
is successfully able to classify the sample algorithms with minimal loss.

 <dc:description>  Compressed sensing is an important problem in many fields of science and
engineering. It reconstructs signals by finding sparse solutions to
underdetermined linear equations. In this work we propose a deterministic and
non-parametric algorithm SSD (Shortest-Solution guided Decimation) to construct
support of the sparse solution under the guidance of the dense least-squares
solution of the recursively decimated linear equation. The most significant
feature of SSD is its insensitivity to correlations in the sampling matrix.
Using extensive numerical experiments we show that SSD greatly outperforms
L1-norm based methods, Orthogonal Least Squares, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit,
and Approximate Message Passing when the sampling matrix contains strong
correlations. This nice property of correlation tolerance makes SSD a versatile
and robust tool for different types of real-world signal acquisition tasks.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the low rank and sparse (LRS) matrix decomposition has been
introduced as an effective mean to solve the multi-view registration. However,
this method presents two notable disadvantages: the registration result is
quite sensitive to the sparsity of the LRS matrix; besides, the decomposition
process treats each block element equally in spite of their reliability.
Therefore, this paper firstly proposes a matrix completion method based on the
overlap percentage of scan pairs. By completing the LRS matrix with reliable
block elements as much as possible, more synchronization constraints of
relative motions can be utilized for registration. Furthermore, it is observed
that the reliability of each element in the LRS matrix can be weighed by the
relationship between its corresponding model and data shapes. Therefore, a
weight matrix is designed to measure the contribution of each element to
decomposition and accordingly, the decomposition result is closer to the ground
truth than before. Benefited from the more informative LRS matrix as well as
the weight matrix, experimental results conducted on several public datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over other methods on both
accuracy and robustness.

 <dc:title>Detection of Malicious and Low Throughput Data Exfiltration Over the DNS
  Protocol</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the presence of security countermeasures, a malware designed for data
exfiltration must do so using a covert channel to achieve its goal. Among
existing covert channels stands the domain name system (DNS) protocol. Although
the detection of covert channels over the DNS has been thoroughly studied in
the last decade, previous research dealt with a specific subclass of covert
channels, namely DNS tunneling. While the importance of tunneling detection is
not undermined, an entire class of low throughput DNS exfiltration malware
remained overlooked. The goal of this study is to propose a method for
detecting both tunneling and low-throughput data exfiltration over the DNS.
Towards this end, we propose a solution composed of a supervised feature
selection method, and an interchangeable, and adjustable anomaly detection
model trained on legitimate traffic. In the first step, a one-class classifier
is applied for detecting domain-specific traffic that does not conform with the
normal behavior. Then, in the second step, in order to reduce the false
positive rate resulting from the attempt to detect the low-throughput data
exfiltration we apply a rule-based filter that filters data exchange over DNS
used by legitimate services. Our solution was evaluated on a medium-scale
recursive DNS server logs, and involved more than 75,000 legitimate uses and
almost 2,000 attacks. Evaluation results shows that while DNS tunneling is
covered with at least 99% recall rate and less than 0.01% false positive rate,
the detection of low throughput exfiltration is more difficult. While not
preventing it completely, our solution limits a malware attempting to avoid
detection with at most a 1kb/h of payload under the limitations of the DNS
syntax (equivalent to five credit cards details, or ten user credentials per
hour) which reduces the effectiveness of the attack.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel open-source pipeline for face registration
based on Gaussian processes as well as an application to face image analysis.
Non-rigid registration of faces is significant for many applications in
computer vision, such as the construction of 3D Morphable face models (3DMMs).
Gaussian Process Morphable Models (GPMMs) unify a variety of non-rigid
deformation models with B-splines and PCA models as examples. GPMM separate
problem specific requirements from the registration algorithm by incorporating
domain-specific adaptions as a prior model. The novelties of this paper are the
following: (i) We present a strategy and modeling technique for face
registration that considers symmetry, multi-scale and spatially-varying
details. The registration is applied to neutral faces and facial expressions.
(ii) We release an open-source software framework for registration and
model-building, demonstrated on the publicly available BU3D-FE database. The
released pipeline also contains an implementation of an Analysis-by-Synthesis
model adaption of 2D face images, tested on the Multi-PIE and LFW database.
This enables the community to reproduce, evaluate and compare the individual
steps of registration to model-building and 3D/2D model fitting. (iii) Along
with the framework release, we publish a new version of the Basel Face Model
(BFM-2017) with an improved age distribution and an additional facial
expression model.

online algorithms and investigate them with respect to a competitive ratio in
two points of view: space complexity and advice complexity. We start with
exploring a model with restricted memory and show that quantum online
algorithms can be better than classical ones (deterministic or randomized) for
sublogarithmic space (memory), and they can be better than deterministic online
algorithms without restriction for memory. Additionally, we consider
polylogarithmic space case and show that in this case, quantum online
algorithms can be better than deterministic ones as well.

 <dc:title>Low-Latency Millimeter-Wave Communications: Traffic Dispersion or

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates two strategies to reduce the communication delay in
future wireless networks: traffic dispersion and network densification. A
hybrid scheme that combines these two strategies is also considered. The
probabilistic delay and effective capacity are used to evaluate performance.
For probabilistic delay, the violation probability of delay, i.e., the
probability that the delay exceeds a given tolerance level, is characterized in
terms of upper bounds, which are derived by applying stochastic network
calculus theory. In addition, to characterize the maximum affordable arrival
traffic for mmWave systems, the effective capacity, i.e., the service
capability with a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, is studied. The
derived bounds on the probabilistic delay and effective capacity are validated
through simulations. These numerical results show that, for a given average
system gain, traffic dispersion, network densification, and the hybrid scheme
exhibit different potentials to reduce the end-to-end communication delay. For
instance, traffic dispersion outperforms network densification, given high
average system gain and arrival rate, while it could be the worst option,
otherwise. Furthermore, it is revealed that, increasing the number of
independent paths and/or relay density is always beneficial, while the
performance gain is related to the arrival rate and average system gain,
jointly. Therefore, a proper transmission scheme should be selected to optimize
the delay performance, according to the given conditions on arrival traffic and
system service capability.

 <dc:description>  Automatically generating a summary of sports video poses the challenge of
detecting interesting moments, or highlights, of a game. Traditional sports
video summarization methods leverage editing conventions of broadcast sports
video that facilitate the extraction of high-level semantics. However,
user-generated videos are not edited, and thus traditional methods are not
suitable to generate a summary. In order to solve this problem, this work
proposes a novel video summarization method that uses players' actions as a cue
to determine the highlights of the original video. A deep neural network-based
approach is used to extract two types of action-related features and to
classify video segments into interesting or uninteresting parts. The proposed
method can be applied to any sports in which games consist of a succession of
actions. Especially, this work considers the case of Kendo (Japanese fencing)
as an example of a sport to evaluate the proposed method. The method is trained
using Kendo videos with ground truth labels that indicate the video highlights.
The labels are provided by annotators possessing different experience with
respect to Kendo to demonstrate how the proposed method adapts to different
needs. The performance of the proposed method is compared with several
combinations of different features, and the results show that it outperforms
previous summarization methods.

 <dc:description>  Graph based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has intuitive representation and
can be improved by exploiting the matrix calculation. However, it has to
perform iterative optimization to achieve a preset objective, which usually
leads to low efficiency. Another inconvenience lying in GSSL is that when new
data come, the graph construction and the optimization have to be conducted all
over again. We propose a sound assumption, arguing that: the neighboring data
points are not in peer-to-peer relation, but in a partial-ordered relation
induced by the local density and distance between the data; and the label of a
center can be regarded as the contribution of its followers. Starting from the
assumption, we develop a highly efficient non-iterative label propagation
algorithm based on a novel data structure named as optimal leading forest
(LaPOLeaF). The major weaknesses of the traditional GSSL are addressed by this
study. We further scale LaPOLeaF to accommodate big data by utilizing block
distance matrix technique, parallel computing, and Locality-Sensitive Hashing
(LSH). Experiments on large datasets have shown the promising results of the
proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies monocular visual odometry (VO) problem. Most of existing
VO algorithms are developed under a standard pipeline including feature
extraction, feature matching, motion estimation, local optimisation, etc.
Although some of them have demonstrated superior performance, they usually need
to be carefully designed and specifically fine-tuned to work well in different
environments. Some prior knowledge is also required to recover an absolute
scale for monocular VO. This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for
monocular VO by using deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs).
Since it is trained and deployed in an end-to-end manner, it infers poses
directly from a sequence of raw RGB images (videos) without adopting any module
in the conventional VO pipeline. Based on the RCNNs, it not only automatically
learns effective feature representation for the VO problem through
Convolutional Neural Networks, but also implicitly models sequential dynamics
and relations using deep Recurrent Neural Networks. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI VO dataset show competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods,
verifying that the end-to-end Deep Learning technique can be a viable
complement to the traditional VO systems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we focus on developing a control algorithm for multi-terrain
tracked robots with flippers using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The
work is based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm,
proven to be very successful in simple simulation environments. The algorithm
works in an end-to-end fashion in order to control the continuous position of
the flippers. This end-to-end approach makes it easy to apply the controller to
a wide array of circumstances, but the huge flexibility comes to the cost of an
increased difficulty of solution. The complexity of the task is enlarged even
more by the fact that real multi-terrain robots move in partially observable
environments. Notwithstanding these complications, being able to smoothly
control a multi-terrain robot can produce huge benefits in impaired people
daily lives or in search and rescue situations.

 <dc:description>  The AC Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is one of the most fundamental
problems in power systems engineering. For the past decades, researchers have
been relying on unproven heuristics to tackle OPF. The hardness of OPF stems
from two issues: (1) non-convexity and (2) combinatoric constraints (e.g.,
discrete power ejection constraints). The recent advances in providing
sufficient conditions on the exactness of convex relaxation of OPF can address
the issue of non-convexity. To complete the understanding of OPF, this paper
presents a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve the convex-relaxed
OPF with discrete demands as combinatoric constraints, which has a provably
small parameterized approximation ratio (also known as PTAS algorithm).
Together with the sufficient conditions on the exactness of convex relaxation,
we provide an efficient approximation algorithm to solve OPF with discrete
demands. This paper also discusses fundamental hardness results of OPF to show
that our PTAS is among the best achievable in theory. Simulations show our
algorithm can produce close-to-optimal solutions in practice.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we use the house price data ranging from January 2004 to
October 2016 to predict the average house price of November and December in
2016 for each district in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. We apply
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model to generate the baseline while
LSTM networks to build prediction model. These algorithms are compared in terms
of Mean Squared Error. The result shows that the LSTM model has excellent
properties with respect to predict time series. Also, stateful LSTM networks
and stack LSTM networks are employed to further study the improvement of
accuracy of the house prediction model.

 <dc:description>  Cloud storage services have become accessible and used by everyone.
Nevertheless, stored data are dependable on the behavior of the cloud servers,
and losses and damages often occur. One solution is to regularly audit the
cloud servers in order to check the integrity of the stored data. The Dynamic
Provable Data Possession scheme with Public Verifiability and Data Privacy
presented in ACISP'15 is a straightforward design of such solution. However,
this scheme is threatened by several attacks. In this paper, we carefully
recall the definition of this scheme as well as explain how its security is
dramatically menaced. Moreover, we proposed two new constructions for Dynamic
Provable Data Possession scheme with Public Verifiability and Data Privacy
based on the scheme presented in ACISP'15, one using Index Hash Tables and one
based on Merkle Hash Trees. We show that the two schemes are secure and
privacy-preserving in the random oracle model.

 <dc:description>  An orientation of a grid is called unique sink orientation (USO) if each of
its nonempty subgrids has a unique sink. Particularly, the original grid itself
has a unique global sink. In this work we investigate the problem of how to
find the global sink using minimum number of queries to an oracle. There are
two different oracle models: the vertex query model where the orientation of
all edges incident to the queried vertex are provided, and the edge query model
where the orientation of the queried edge is provided. In the 2-dimensional
case, we design an optimal linear deterministic algorithm for the vertex query
model and an almost linear deterministic algorithm for the edge query model,
previously the best known algorithms run in O(N logN) time for the vertex query
model and O(N^1.404) time for the edge query model.

 <dc:description>  Agile - denoting &quot;the quality of being agile, readiness for motion,
nimbleness, activity, dexterity in motion&quot; - software development methods are
attempting to offer an answer to the eager business community asking for
lighter weight along with faster and nimbler software development processes.
This is especially the case with the rapidly growing and volatile Internet
software industry as well as for the emerging mobile application environment.
The new agile methods have evoked substantial amount of literature and debates.
However, academic research on the subject is still scarce, as most of existing
publications are written by practitioners or consultants. The aim of this
publication is to begin filling this gap by systematically reviewing the
existing literature on agile software development methodologies. This
publication has three purposes. First, it proposes a definition and a
classification of agile software development approaches. Second, it analyses
ten software development methods that can be characterized as being &quot;agile&quot;
against the defined criterion. Third, it compares these methods and highlights
their similarities and differences. Based on this analysis, future research
needs are identified and discussed.

 <dc:description>  We study the equilibrium behavior in a multi-commodity selfish routing game
with many types of uncertain users where each user over- or under-estimates
their congestion costs by a multiplicative factor. Surprisingly, we find that
uncertainties in different directions have qualitatively distinct impacts on
equilibria. Namely, contrary to the usual notion that uncertainty increases
inefficiencies, network congestion actually decreases when users over-estimate
their costs. On the other hand, under-estimation of costs leads to increased
congestion. We apply these results to urban transportation networks, where
drivers have different estimates about the cost of congestion. In light of the
dynamic pricing policies aimed at tackling congestion, our results indicate
that users' perception of these prices can significantly impact the policy's
efficacy, and &quot;caution in the face of uncertainty&quot; leads to favorable network
conditions.

 <dc:description>  Authoring of OWL-DL ontologies is intellectually challenging and to make this
process simpler, many systems accept natural language text as input. A
text-based ontology authoring approach can be successful only when it is
combined with an effective method for extracting ontological axioms from text.
Extracting axioms from unrestricted English input is a substantially
challenging task due to the richness of the language. Controlled natural
languages (CNLs) have been proposed in this context and these tend to be highly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a new CNL called TEDEI (TExtual
DEscription Identifier) whose grammar is inspired by the different ways OWL-DL
constructs are expressed in English. We built a system that transforms TEDEI
sentences into corresponding OWL-DL axioms. Now, ambiguity due to different
possible lexicalizations of sentences and semantic ambiguity present in
sentences are challenges in this context. We find that the best way to handle
these challenges is to construct axioms corresponding to alternative
formalizations of the sentence so that the end-user can make an appropriate
choice. The output is compared against human-authored axioms and in substantial
number of cases, human-authored axiom is indeed one of the alternatives given
by the system. The proposed system substantially enhances the types of sentence
structures that can be used for ontology authoring.

 <dc:title>Crowdsourced correlation clustering with relative distance comparisons</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ukkonen, Antti</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Crowdsourced, or human computation based clustering algorithms usually rely
on relative distance comparisons, as these are easier to elicit from human
workers than absolute distance information. A relative distance comparison is a
statement of the form &quot;item A is closer to item B than to item C&quot;. However,
many existing clustering algorithms that use relative distances are rather
complex. They are often based on a two-step approach, where the relative
distances are first used to learn either a distance matrix, or an embedding of
the items, and then some standard clustering method is applied in a second
step. In this paper we argue that it should be possible to compute a clustering
directly from relative distance comparisons. Our ideas are built upon existing
work on correlation clustering, a well-known non-parametric approach to
clustering. The technical contribution of this work is twofold. We first define
a novel variant of correlation clustering that is based on relative distance
comparisons, and hence suitable for human computation. We go on to show that
our new problem is closely related to basic correlation clustering, and use
this property to design an approximation algorithm for our problem. As a second
contribution, we propose a more practical algorithm, which we empirically
compare against existing methods from literature. Experiments with synthetic
data suggest that our approach can outperform more complex methods. Also, our
method efficiently finds good and intuitive clusterings from real relative
distance comparison data.

 <dc:description>  Discrete wavelet transform of finite-length signals must necessarily handle
the signal boundaries. The state-of-the-art approaches treat such boundaries in
a complicated and inflexible way, using special prolog or epilog phases. This
holds true in particular for images decomposed into a number of scales,
exemplary in JPEG 2000 coding system. In this paper, the state-of-the-art
approaches are extended to perform the treatment using a compact streaming
core, possibly in multi-scale fashion. We present the core focused on CDF 5/3
wavelet and the symmetric border extension method, both employed in the JPEG
2000. As a result of our work, every input sample is visited only once, while
the results are produced immediately, i.e. without buffering.

 <dc:description>  Biclustering techniques have been widely used to identify homogeneous
subgroups within large data matrices, such as subsets of genes similarly
expressed across subsets of patients. Mining a max-sum sub-matrix is a related
but distinct problem for which one looks for a (non-necessarily contiguous)
rectangular sub-matrix with a maximal sum of its entries. Le Van et al. (Ranked
Tiling, 2014) already illustrated its applicability to gene expression analysis
and addressed it with a constraint programming (CP) approach combined with
large neighborhood search (CP-LNS). In this work, we exhibit some key
properties of this NP-hard problem and define a bounding function such that
larger problems can be solved in reasonable time. Two different algorithms are
proposed in order to exploit the highlighted characteristics of the problem: a
CP approach with a global constraint (CPGC) and mixed integer linear
programming (MILP). Practical experiments conducted both on synthetic and real
gene expression data exhibit the characteristics of these approaches and their
relative benefits over the original CP-LNS method. Overall, the CPGC approach
tends to be the fastest to produce a good solution. Yet, the MILP formulation
is arguably the easiest to formulate and can also be competitive.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous break through in the area of
image/video processing. In this paper, a spatial-temporal residue network
(STResNet) based in-loop filter is proposed to suppress visual artifacts such
as blocking, ringing in video coding. Specifically, the spatial and temporal
information is jointly exploited by taking both current block and co-located
block in reference frame into consideration during the processing of in-loop
filter. The architecture of STResNet only consists of four convolution layers
which shows hospitality to memory and coding complexity. Moreover, to fully
adapt the input content and improve the performance of the proposed in-loop
filter, coding tree unit (CTU) level control flag is applied in the sense of
rate-distortion optimization. Extensive experimental results show that our
scheme provides up to 5.1% bit-rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-art
video coding standard.

 <dc:title>Improving Viability of Electric Taxis by Taxi Service Strategy
  Optimization: A Big Data Analysis of New York City</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Electrification of transportation is critical for a low-carbon society. In
particular, public vehicles (e.g., taxis) provide a crucial opportunity for
electrification. Despite the benefits of eco-friendliness and energy
efficiency, adoption of electric taxis faces several obstacles, including
constrained driving range, long recharging duration, limited charging stations
and low gas price, all of which impede taxi drivers' decisions to switch to
electric taxis. On the other hand, the popularity of ride-hailing mobile apps
facilitates the computerization and optimization of taxi service strategies,
which provide computer-assisted decisions of navigation and roaming for taxi
drivers to locate potential customers. This paper examines the viability of
electric taxis with the assistance of taxi service strategy optimization, in
comparison with conventional taxis with internal combustion engines. A big data
analysis is provided using a large dataset of real-world taxi trips in New York
City. Our methodology is to first model the computerized taxi service strategy
by Markov Decision Process (MDP), and then devise the optimized taxi service
strategy based on NYC taxi trip dataset. The profitability of electric taxi
drivers is studied empirically under various battery capacity and charging
conditions. Consequently, we shed light on the solutions that can improve
viability of electric taxis.

 <dc:description>  Recently there has been increasing interest in probabilistic solvers for
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that return full probability measures,
instead of point estimates, over the solution and can incorporate uncertainty
over the ODE at hand, e.g. if the vector field or the initial value is only
approximately known or evaluable. The ODE filter proposed in recent work models
the solution of the ODE by a Gauss-Markov process which serves as a prior in
the sense of Bayesian statistics. While previous work employed a Wiener process
prior on the (possibly multiple times) differentiated solution of the ODE and
established equivalence of the corresponding solver with classical numerical
methods, this paper raises the question whether other priors also yield
practically useful solvers. To this end, we discuss a range of possible priors
which enable fast filtering and propose a new prior--the Integrated Ornstein
Uhlenbeck Process (IOUP)--that complements the existing Integrated Wiener
process (IWP) filter by encoding the property that a derivative in time of the
solution is bounded in the sense that it tends to drift back to zero. We
provide experiments comparing IWP and IOUP filters which support the belief
that IWP approximates better divergent ODE's solutions whereas IOUP is a better
prior for trajectories with bounded derivatives.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep architecture that jointly learns
to detect obstacles and estimate their depth for MAV flight applications. Most
of the existing approaches either rely on Visual SLAM systems or on depth
estimation models to build 3D maps and detect obstacles. However, for the task
of avoiding obstacles this level of complexity is not required. Recent works
have proposed multi task architectures to both perform scene understanding and
depth estimation. We follow their track and propose a specific architecture to
jointly estimate depth and obstacles, without the need to compute a global map,
but maintaining compatibility with a global SLAM system if needed. The network
architecture is devised to exploit the joint information of the obstacle
detection task, that produces more reliable bounding boxes, with the depth
estimation one, increasing the robustness of both to scenario changes. We call
this architecture J-MOD$^{2}$. We test the effectiveness of our approach with
experiments on sequences with different appearance and focal lengths and
compare it to SotA multi task methods that jointly perform semantic
segmentation and depth estimation. In addition, we show the integration in a
full system using a set of simulated navigation experiments where a MAV
explores an unknown scenario and plans safe trajectories by using our detection
model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an approach to select a subset of requirement
elicitation technique for an optimum result in the requirement elicitation
process. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we identify various
attribute in three important dimensions namely project, people and the process
of software development that can influence the outcome of an elicitation
process. Second, we construct three p matrix (3PM) separately for each
dimension, that shows a relation between the elicitation techniques and three
dimensions of a software. Third, we provide a mapping criteria and use them in
the selection of a subset of elicitation techniques. We demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed approach using case studies to evaluate and
provide the contextual knowledge of selecting requirement elicitation
technique.

 <dc:description>  Availability of abundant spectrum has enabled millimeter wave (mm-wave) as a
prominent candidate solution for the next generation cellular networks. Highly
directional transmissions are essential for exploitation of mm-wave bands to
compensate high propagation loss and attenuation. The directional transmission,
nevertheless, necessitates a specific design for mm-wave initial cell
discovery, as conventional omni-directional broadcast signaling may fail in
delivering the cell discovery information. To address this issue, this paper
provides an analytical framework for mm-wave beamformed cell discovery based on
an information theoretical approach. Design options are compared considering
four fundamental and representative broadcast signaling schemes to evaluate
discovery latency and signaling overhead. The schemes are then simulated under
realistic system parameters. Analytical and simulation results reveals four key
findings: (i) For cell discovery without knowledge of beacon timing,
analog/hybrid beamforming performs as well as digital beamforming in terms of
cell discovery latency; (ii) Single beam exhaustive scan optimize the latency,
however leads to overhead penalty; (iii) Multi-beam simultaneous scan can
significantly reduce the overhead, and provide the flexibility to achieve
trade-off between the latency and the overhead; (iv) The latency and the
overhead are relatively insensitive to extreme low block error rates.

 <dc:description>  Understanding human mobility is critical for decision support in areas from
urban planning to infectious diseases control. Prior work has focused on
tracking daily logs of outdoor mobility without considering relevant context,
which contain a mixture of regular and irregular human movement for a range of
purposes, and thus diverse effects on the dynamics have been ignored. This
study aims to focus on irregular human movement of different meta-populations
with various purposes. We propose approaches to estimate the predictability of
mobility in different contexts. With our survey data from international and
domestic visitors to Australia, we found that the travel patterns of Europeans
visiting for holidays are less predictable than those visiting for education,
while East Asian visitors show the opposite patterns, ie, more predictable for
holidays than for education. Domestic residents from the most populous
Australian states exhibit the most unpredictable patterns, while visitors from
less populated states show the highest predictable movement.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a mixed-effects model to learn spatiotempo-ral patterns on a
network by considering longitudinal measures distributed on a fixed graph. The
data come from repeated observations of subjects at different time points which
take the form of measurement maps distributed on a graph such as an image or a
mesh. The model learns a typical group-average trajectory characterizing the
propagation of measurement changes across the graph nodes. The subject-specific
trajectories are defined via spatial and temporal transformations of the
group-average scenario, thus estimating the variability of spatiotemporal
patterns within the group. To estimate population and individual model
parameters, we adapted a stochastic version of the Expectation-Maximization
algorithm, the MCMC-SAEM. The model is used to describe the propagation of
cortical atrophy during the course of Alzheimer's Disease. Model parameters
show the variability of this average pattern of atrophy in terms of
trajectories across brain regions, age at disease onset and pace of
propagation. We show that the personalization of this model yields accurate
prediction of maps of cortical thickness in patients.

 <dc:description>  You put a program on a concurrent server, but you don't trust the server,
later, you get a trace of the actual requests that the server received from its
clients and the responses that it delivered. You separately get logs from the
server, these are untrusted. How can you use the logs to efficiently verify
that the responses were derived from running the program on the requests? This
is the Efficient Server Audit Problem, and it abstracts real-world scenarios,
including running a web application on an untrusted provider. We present a
solution based on several new techniques, including SIMD-on-demand replay of
requests that share the same control flow, and simulate-and-check, in which the
verifier re-executes read operations from logs, and validates the logs
opportunistically. We build a system that implements the solution for PHP-based
web applications. For several applications, our implemented verifier achieves
5.6--10.9x speedup versus simply re-executing, at the cost of less than 10
percent overhead on the server's execution.

 <dc:description>  In the smart grid, smart meters, and numerous control and monitoring
applications employ bidirectional wireless communication, where security is a
critical issue. In key management based encryption method for the smart grid,
the Trusted Third Party (TTP), and links between the smart meter and the third
party are assumed to be fully trusted and reliable. However, in wired/wireless
medium, a man-in-middle may want to interfere, monitor and control the network,
thus exposing its vulnerability. Acknowledging this, in this paper, we propose
a novel two level encryption method based on two partially trusted simple
servers (constitutes the TTP) which implement this method without increasing
packet overhead. One server is responsible for data encryption between the
meter and control center/central database, and the other server manages the
random sequence of data transmission. Numerical calculation shows that the
number of iterations required to decode a message is large which is quite
impractical. Furthermore, we introduce One-class support vector machine
(machine learning) algorithm for node-to-node authentication utilizing the
location information and the data transmission history (node identity, packet
size and frequency of transmission). This secures data communication privacy
without increasing the complexity of the conventional key management scheme.

hyperproperties, which have recently been identified as a key concept in the
verification of information flow properties. Conceptually, we consider an
asynchronous and a synchronous variant of team semantics. We study basic
properties of this new logic and classify the computational complexity of its
satisfiability, path, and model checking problem. Eventually, we compare its
expressivity to the one of HyperLTL, another recently introduced logic for
hyperproperties. Our results show that LTL under team semantics is a viable
alternative to HyperLTL, which complements the expressivity of HyperLTL and has
better algorithmic properties.

 <dc:description>  Detecting moving vehicles and people is crucial for safe operation of UGVs
but is challenging in cluttered, real world environments. We propose a
registration technique that enables objects to be robustly matched and tracked,
and hence movers to be detected even in high clutter. Range data are acquired
using a 2D scanning Ladar from a moving platform. These are automatically
clustered into objects and modeled using a surface density function. A
Bhattacharya similarity is optimized to register subsequent views of each
object enabling good discrimination and tracking, and hence mover detection.

 <dc:description>  Safe mobility for unmanned ground vehicles requires reliable detection of
other vehicles, along with precise estimates of their locations and
trajectories. Here we describe the algorithms and system we have developed for
accurate trajectory estimation of nearby vehicles using an onboard scanning
LADAR. We introduce a variable-axis Ackerman steering model and compare this to
an independent steering model. Then for robust tracking we propose a
multi-hypothesis tracker that combines these kinematic models to leverage the
strengths of each. When trajectories estimated with our techniques are input
into a planner, they enable an unmanned vehicle to negotiate traffic in urban
environments. Results have been evaluated running in real time on a moving
vehicle with a scanning LADAR.

 <dc:description>  LADARs mounted on mobile platforms produce a wealth of precise range data on
the surrounding objects and vehicles. The challenge we address is to infer from
these raw LADAR data the location and orientation of nearby vehicles. We
propose a novel view-dependent adaptive matched filter for obtaining fast and
precise measurements of target vehicle pose. We derive an analytic expression
for the matching function which we optimize to obtain target pose and size. Our
algorithm is fast, robust and simple to implement compared to other methods.
When used as the measurement component of a tracker on an autonomous ground
vehicle, we are able to track in excess of 50 targets at 10 Hz. Once targets
are aligned using our matched filter, we use a support vector-based
discriminator to distinguish vehicles from other objects. This tracker provides
a key sensing component for our autonomous ground vehicles which have
accumulated hundreds of miles of on-road and off-road autonomous driving.

 <dc:description>  We study the quantum synchronization between a pair of two-level systems
inside two coupledcavities. Using a digital-analog decomposition of the master
equation that rules the system dynamics, we show that this approach leads to
quantum synchronization between both two-level systems. Moreover, we can
identify in this digital-analog block decomposition the fundamental elements of
a quantum machine learning protocol, in which the agent and the environment
(learning units) interact through a mediating system, namely, the register. If
we can additionally equip this algorithm with a classical feedback mechanism,
which consists of projective measurements in the register, reinitialization of
the register state and local conditional operations on the agent and register
subspace, a powerful and flexible quantum machine learning protocol emerges.
Indeed, numerical simulations show that this protocol enhances the
synchronization process, even when every subsystem experience different
loss/decoherence mechanisms, and give us flexibility to choose the
synchronization state. Finally, we propose an implementation based on current
technologies in superconducting circuits.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a vital modeling technique that rely on
internal states learned indirectly by optimization of a supervised,
unsupervised, or reinforcement training loss. RNNs are used to model dynamic
processes that are characterized by underlying latent states whose form is
often unknown, precluding its analytic representation inside an RNN. In the
Predictive-State Representation (PSR) literature, latent state processes are
modeled by an internal state representation that directly models the
distribution of future observations, and most recent work in this area has
relied on explicitly representing and targeting sufficient statistics of this
probability distribution. We seek to combine the advantages of RNNs and PSRs by
augmenting existing state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks with
Predictive-State Decoders (PSDs), which add supervision to the network's
internal state representation to target predicting future observations.
Predictive-State Decoders are simple to implement and easily incorporated into
existing training pipelines via additional loss regularization. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of PSDs with experimental results in three different domains:
probabilistic filtering, Imitation Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. In
each, our method improves statistical performance of state-of-the-art recurrent
baselines and does so with fewer iterations and less data.

 <dc:title>Using objective words in the reviews to improve the colloquial arabic
  sentiment analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Al-Harbi, Omar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the main difficulties in sentiment analysis of the Arabic language is
the presence of the colloquialism. In this paper, we examine the effect of
using objective words in conjunction with sentimental words on sentiment
classification for the colloquial Arabic reviews, specifically Jordanian
colloquial reviews. The reviews often include both sentimental and objective
words, however, the most existing sentiment analysis models ignore the
objective words as they are considered useless. In this work, we created two
lexicons: the first includes the colloquial sentimental words and compound
phrases, while the other contains the objective words associated with values of
sentiment tendency based on a particular estimation method. We used these
lexicons to extract sentiment features that would be training input to the
Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the sentiment polarity of the
reviews. The reviews dataset have been collected manually from JEERAN website.
The results of the experiments show that the proposed approach improves the
polarity classification in comparison to two baseline models, with accuracy
95.6%.

 <dc:description>  Learning, taking into account full distribution of the data, referred to as
generative, is not feasible with deep neural networks (DNNs) because they model
only the conditional distribution of the outputs given the inputs. Current
solutions are either based on joint probability models facing difficult
estimation problems or learn two separate networks, mapping inputs to outputs
(recognition) and vice-versa (generation). We propose an intermediate approach.
First, we show that forward computation in DNNs with logistic sigmoid
activations corresponds to a simplified approximate Bayesian inference in a
directed probabilistic multi-layer model. This connection allows to interpret
DNN as a probabilistic model of the output and all hidden units given the
input. Second, we propose that in order for the recognition and generation
networks to be more consistent with the joint model of the data, weights of the
recognition and generator network should be related by transposition. We
demonstrate in a tentative experiment that such a coupled pair can be learned
generatively, modelling the full distribution of the data, and has enough
capacity to perform well in both recognition and generation.

 <dc:title>Comments on Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: Relative Gain
  Subject to Near Sum-Rate Optimality</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Erez, Uri</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Non-orthogonal access techniques have recently gained renewed interest in the
context of next generation wireless networks. As the relative gain, with
respect to traditionally employed orthogonal-access techniques depends on many
factors, it is of interest to obtain insights by considering the simplest
scenario, the two-user downlink (broadcast) channel where all nodes are
equipped with a single antenna. Further, we focus on rate pairs that are in the
vicinity of sum-rate optimalilty with respect to the capacity region of the
broadcast channel. A simple and explicit characterization of the relative gain
of non-orthogonal transmission with respect to orthogonal transmission is
obtained under these conditions as an immediate consequence of the capacity
regions of the two.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing has permeated into the information technology industry in the
last few years, and it is emerging nowadays in scientific environments. Science
user communities are demanding a broad range of computing power to satisfy the
needs of high-performance applications, such as local clusters,
high-performance computing systems, and computing grids. Different workloads
are needed from different computational models, and the cloud is already
considered as a promising paradigm. The scheduling and allocation of resources
is always a challenging matter in any form of computation and clouds are not an
exception. Science applications have unique features that differentiate their
workloads, hence, their requirements have to be taken into consideration to be
fulfilled when building a Science Cloud. This paper will discuss what are the
main scheduling and resource allocation challenges for any Infrastructure as a
Service provider supporting scientific applications.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new method for human pose estimation which leverages information
from multiple views to impose a strong prior on articulated pose. The novelty
of the method concerns the types of coherence modelled. Consistency is
maximised over the different views through different terms modelling classical
geometric information (coherence of the resulting poses) as well as appearance
information which is modelled as latent variables in the global energy
function. Moreover, adequacy of each view is assessed and their contributions
are adjusted accordingly. Experiments on the HumanEva and UMPM datasets show
that the proposed method significantly decreases the estimation error compared
to single-view results.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports on a data-driven, interaction-aware motion prediction
approach for pedestrians in environments cluttered with static obstacles. When
navigating in such workspaces shared with humans, robots need accurate motion
predictions of the surrounding pedestrians. Human navigation behavior is mostly
influenced by their surrounding pedestrians and by the static obstacles in
their vicinity. In this paper we introduce a new model based on Long-Short Term
Memory (LSTM) neural networks, which is able to learn human motion behavior
from demonstrated data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
approach using LSTMs, that incorporates both static obstacles and surrounding
pedestrians for trajectory forecasting. As part of the model, we introduce a
new way of encoding surrounding pedestrians based on a 1d-grid in polar angle
space. We evaluate the benefit of interaction-aware motion prediction and the
added value of incorporating static obstacles on both simulation and real-world
datasets by comparing with state-of-the-art approaches. The results show, that
our new approach outperforms the other approaches while being very
computationally efficient and that taking into account static obstacles for
motion predictions significantly improves the prediction accuracy, especially
in cluttered environments.

 <dc:description>  This work is meant to be a step towards the formal definition of the notion
of algorithm, in the sense of an equivalence class of programs working &quot;in a
similar way&quot;. But instead of defining equivalence transformations directly on
programs, we look at the computation for each particular argument and give it a
structure. This leads to the notion of constructed number: the result of the
computation is a constructed number whose constructors (0, successor) carry a
history condition (or trace) of their computation. There are equivalence
relations on these conditions and on constructed numbers. Two programs are
equivalent if they produce equivalent constructed numbers for each argument.

 <dc:description>  Regression shrinkage and variable selection are important concepts in
high-dimensional statistics that allow the inference of robust models from
large data sets. Bayesian methods achieve this by subjecting the model
parameters to a prior distribution whose mass is centred around zero. In
particular, the lasso and elastic net linear regression models employ a
double-exponential distribution in their prior, which results in some
maximum-likelihood regression coefficients being identically zero. Because of
their ability to simultaneously perform parameter estimation and variable
selection, these models have become enormously popular. However, there has been
limited success in moving beyond maximum-likelihood estimation and deriving
estimates for the posterior distribution of regression coefficients, due to a
need for computationally expensive Gibbs sampling approaches to evaluate
analytically intractable partition function integrals. Here, through the use of
the Fourier transform, these integrals are expressed as complex-valued
oscillatory integrals over &quot;regression frequencies&quot;. This results in an
analytic expansion and stationary phase approximation for the partition
functions of the Bayesian lasso and elastic net, where the
non-differentiability of the double-exponential prior distribution has so far
eluded such an approach. Use of this approximation leads to highly accurate
numerical estimates for the expectation values and marginal posterior
distributions of the regression coefficients, thus allowing for Bayesian
inference of much higher dimensional models than previously possible.

 <dc:description>  As roles for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) continue to diversify, the
ability to sense and interact closely with the environment becomes increasingly
important. Within this paper we report on the initial flight tests of a novel
adaptive compliant actuator which will allow a UAV to carry out such tasks as
the &quot;pick and placement&quot; of remote sensors, structural testing and
contact-based inspection. Three key results are discussed and presented; the
ability to physically compensate impact forces or apply interaction forces by
the UAV through the use of the active compliant manipulator; to be able to
tailor these forces through tuning of the manipulator controller gains; and the
ability to apply a rapid series of physical pulses in order to excite remotely
placed sensors, e.g. vibration sensors. The paper describes the overall system
requirements and system modelling considerations which have driven the concept
through to flight testing. A series of over sixty flight tests have been used
to generate initial results which clearly demonstrate the potential of this new
type of compliant aerial actuator. Results are discussed in line with potential
applications; and a series of future flight tests are described which will
enable us to refine and characterise the overall system.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) is the science of connecting multiple devices
that coordinate to provide the service in question. IoT environments are
complex, dynamic, rapidly changing and resource constrained. Therefore,
proactively adapting devices to align with context fluctuations becomes a
concern. To propose suitable configurations, it should be possible to sense
information from devices, analyze the data and reconfigure them accordingly.
Applied in the service of the environment, a fleet of devices can monitor
environment indicators and control it in order to propose best fit solutions or
prevent risks like over consumption of resources (e.g., water and energy). This
paper describes our methodology in designing a framework for the monitoring and
multi-instantiation of fleets of connected objects. First by identifying the
particularities of the fleet, then by specifying connected object as a Dynamic
Software Product Line (DSPL), capable of readjusting while running.

 <dc:description>  Since the packet is transmitted to a set of relaying nodes in opportunistic
routing strategy, so the transmission delay and the duplication transmission
are serious. For reducing the transmission delay and the duplicate
transmission, in this paper, we propose the delay based duplication
transmission avoid (DDA) coordination scheme for opportunistic routing. In this
coordination scheme, the candidate relaying nodes are divided into different
fully connected relaying networks, so the duplicate transmission is avoided.
Moreover, we propose the relaying network recognition algorithm which can be
used to judge whether the sub-network is fully connected or not. The properties
of the relaying networks are investigated in detail in this paper. When the
fully connected relaying networks are got, they will be the basic units in the
next hop relaying network selection. In this paper, we prove that the packet
delivery ratio of the high priority relaying nodes in the relaying network has
greater effection on the relaying delay than that of the low priority relaying
nodes. According to this conclusion, in DDA, the relaying networks which the
packet delivery ratios of the high priority relaying nodes are high have higher
priority than that of the low one. During the next hop relaying network
selection, the transmission delay, the network utility, and the packet delivery
ratio are taken into account. By these innovations, the DDA can improve the
network performance greatly than that of ExOR and SOAR.

 <dc:description>  Visualizations of tabular data are widely used; understanding their
effectiveness in different task and data contexts is fundamental to scaling
their impact. However, little is known about how basic tabular data
visualizations perform across varying data analysis tasks and data attribute
types. In this paper, we report results from a crowdsourced experiment to
evaluate the effectiveness of five visualization types --- Table, Line Chart,
Bar Chart, Scatterplot, and Pie Chart --- across ten common data analysis tasks
and three data attribute types using two real world datasets. We found the
effectiveness of these visualization types significantly varies across task and
data attribute types, suggesting that visualization design would benefit from
considering context dependent effectiveness. Based on our findings, we derive
recommendations on which visualizations to choose based on different task and
data contexts.

 <dc:description>  Recognising semantic pedestrian attributes in surveillance images is a
challenging task for computer vision, particularly when the imaging quality is
poor with complex background clutter and uncontrolled viewing conditions, and
the number of labelled training data is small. In this work, we formulate a
Joint Recurrent Learning (JRL) model for exploring attribute context and
correlation in order to improve attribute recognition given small sized
training data with poor quality images. The JRL model learns jointly pedestrian
attribute correlations in a pedestrian image and in particular their sequential
ordering dependencies (latent high-order correlation) in an end-to-end
encoder/decoder recurrent network. We demonstrate the performance advantage and
robustness of the JRL model over a wide range of state-of-the-art deep models
for pedestrian attribute recognition, multi-label image classification, and
multi-person image annotation on two largest pedestrian attribute benchmarks
PETA and RAP.

 <dc:title>A simple FPRAS for bi-directed reachability</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Gorodezky and Pak (Random Struct. Algorithms, 2014) introduced a
&quot;cluster-popping&quot; algorithm for sampling root-connected subgraphs in a directed
graph, and conjectured that it runs in expected polynomial time on bi-directed
graphs. We confirm their conjecture. It follows that there is a fully
polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for reachability in
bi-directed graphs. Reachability is the probability that, assuming each arc
fails independently, all vertices can reach a special root vertex in the
remaining graph. A bi-directed graph is one in which each directed arc has a
parallel twin oriented in the opposite sense.

 <dc:description>  Directed graphs are widely used to model data flow and execution dependencies
in streaming applications. This enables the utilization of graph partitioning
algorithms for the problem of parallelizing computation for multiprocessor
architectures. However due to resource restrictions, an acyclicity constraint
on the partition is necessary when mapping streaming applications to an
embedded multiprocessor. Here, we contribute a multi-level algorithm for the
acyclic graph partitioning problem. Based on this, we engineer an evolutionary
algorithm to further reduce communication cost, as well as to improve load
balancing and the scheduling makespan on embedded multiprocessor architectures.

 <dc:title>The Consciousness Prior</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A new prior is proposed for representation learning, which can be combined
with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factors from each
other. It is inspired by the phenomenon of consciousness seen as the formation
of a low-dimensional combination of a few concepts constituting a conscious
thought, i.e., consciousness as awareness at a particular time instant. This
provides a powerful constraint on the representation in that such
low-dimensional thought vectors can correspond to statements about reality
which are true, highly probable, or very useful for taking decisions. The fact
that a few elements of the current state can be combined into such a predictive
or useful statement is a strong constraint and deviates considerably from the
maximum likelihood approaches to modelling data and how states unfold in the
future based on an agent's actions. Instead of making predictions in the
sensory (e.g. pixel) space, the consciousness prior allows the agent to make
predictions in the abstract space, with only a few dimensions of that space
being involved in each of these predictions. The consciousness prior also makes
it natural to map conscious states to natural language utterances or to express
classical AI knowledge in the form of facts and rules, although the conscious
states may be richer than what can be expressed easily in the form of a
sentence, a fact or a rule.

 <dc:title>Coverage Analysis of a Vehicular Network Modeled as Cox Process Driven

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a vehicular network in which the wireless nodes
are located on a system of roads. We model the roadways, which are
predominantly straight and randomly oriented, by a Poisson line process (PLP)
and the locations of nodes on each road as a homogeneous 1D Poisson point
process (PPP). Assuming that each node transmits independently, the locations
of transmitting and receiving nodes are given by two Cox processes driven by
the same PLP. For this setup, we derive the coverage probability of a typical
receiver, which is an arbitrarily chosen receiving node, assuming independent
Nakagami-$m$ fading over all wireless channels. Assuming that the typical
receiver connects to its closest transmitting node in the network, we first
derive the distribution of the distance between the typical receiver and the
serving node to characterize the desired signal power. We then characterize
coverage probability for this setup, which involves two key technical
challenges. First, we need to handle several cases as the serving node can
possibly be located on any line in the network and the corresponding
interference experienced at the typical receiver is different in each case.
Second, conditioning on the serving node imposes constraints on the spatial
configuration of lines, which require careful analysis of the conditional
distribution of the lines. We address these challenges in order to accurately
characterize the interference experienced at the typical receiver. We then
derive an exact expression for coverage probability in terms of the derivative
of Laplace transform of interference power distribution. We analyze the trends
in coverage probability as a function of the network parameters: line density
and node density. We also study the asymptotic behavior of this model and
compare the coverage performance with that of a homogeneous 2D PPP model with
the same node density.

highlighted the need for suitable classification methods. In this paper, a
comparison between three of well-known classification methods (i.e. support
vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov map (HMM), and radial basis function (RBF))
for EEG based eye state classification was achieved. Furthermore, a suggested
method that is based on ensemble model was tested. The suggested (ensemble
system) method based on a voting algorithm with two kernels: random forest (RF)
and Kstar classification methods. The performance was tested using three
measurement parameters: accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and confusion
matrix. Results showed that the proposed method outperforms the other tested
methods. For instance, the suggested method's performance was 97.27% accuracy
and 0.13 MAE.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world applications require large-scale data annotation, such as
identifying tissue origins based on gene expressions and classifying images
into semantic categories. Annotation classes are often numerous and subject to
changes over time, and annotating examples has become the major bottleneck for
supervised learning methods. In science and other high-value domains, large
repositories of data samples are often available, together with two sources of
organic supervision: a lexicon for the annotation classes, and text
descriptions that accompany some data samples. Distant supervision has emerged
as a promising paradigm for exploiting such indirect supervision by
automatically annotating examples where the text description contains a class
mention in the lexicon. However, due to linguistic variations and ambiguities,
such training data is inherently noisy, which limits the accuracy in this
approach. In this paper, we introduce an auxiliary natural language processing
system for the text modality, and incorporate co-training to reduce noise and
augment signal in distant supervision. Without using any manually labeled data,
our EZLearn system learned to accurately annotate data samples in functional
genomics and scientific figure comprehension, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art supervised methods trained on tens of thousands of annotated
examples.

 <dc:title>Dense scale selection over space, time and space-time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lindeberg, Tony</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Scale selection methods based on local extrema over scale of scale-normalized
derivatives have been primarily developed to be applied sparsely --- at image
points where the magnitude of a scale-normalized differential expression
additionally assumes local extrema over the domain where the data are defined.
This paper presents a methodology for performing dense scale selection, so that
hypotheses about local characteristic scales in images, temporal signals and
video can be computed at every image point and every time moment.
  A critical problem when designing mechanisms for dense scale selection is
that the scale at which scale-normalized differential entities assume local
extrema over scale can be strongly dependent on the local order of the locally
dominant differential structure. To address this problem, we propose a
methodology where local extrema over scale are detected of a quasi quadrature
measure involving scale-space derivatives up to order two and propose two
independent mechanisms to reduce the phase dependency of the local scale
estimates by: (i) introducing a second layer of post-smoothing prior to the
detection of local extrema over scale and (ii) performing local phase
compensation based on a model of the phase dependency of the local scale
estimates depending on the relative strengths between first- vs. second-order
differential structure.
  This general methodology is applied over three types of domains: (i) spatial
images, (ii) temporal signals and (iii) spatio-temporal video. Experiments show
that the proposed methodology leads to intuitively reasonable results with
local scale estimates that reflect variations in the characteristic scales of
locally dominant structures over space and time.

 <dc:description>  The CRAYFIS experiment proposes to use privately owned mobile phones as a
ground detector array for Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays. Upon interacting with
Earth's atmosphere, these events produce extensive particle showers which can
be detected by cameras on mobile phones. A typical shower contains
minimally-ionizing particles such as muons. As these particles interact with
CMOS image sensors, they may leave tracks of faintly-activated pixels that are
sometimes hard to distinguish from random detector noise. Triggers that rely on
the presence of very bright pixels within an image frame are not efficient in
this case.
  We present a trigger algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Networks which
selects images containing such tracks and are evaluated in a lazy manner: the
response of each successive layer is computed only if activation of the current
layer satisfies a continuation criterion. Usage of neural networks increases
the sensitivity considerably comparable with image thresholding, while the lazy
evaluation allows for execution of the trigger under the limited computational
power of mobile phones.

particularly from perspectives of routine monitoring of quality for data being
taken. We describe an approach that uses Machine Learning for the automated
system to monitor data quality, which is based on partial use of data qualified
manually by detector experts. The system automatically classifies marginal
cases: both of good an bad data, and use human expert decision to classify
remaining &quot;grey area&quot; cases.
  This study uses collision data collected by the CMS experiment at LHC in
2010. We demonstrate that proposed workflow is able to automatically process at
least 20\% of samples without noticeable degradation of the result.

 <dc:description>  High-energy physics experiments rely on reconstruction of the trajectories of
particles produced at the interaction point. This is a challenging task,
especially in the high track multiplicity environment generated by p-p
collisions at the LHC energies. A typical event includes hundreds of signal
examples (interesting decays) and a significant amount of noise (uninteresting
examples).
  This work describes a modification of the Artificial Retina algorithm for
fast track finding: numerical optimization methods were adopted for fast local
track search. This approach allows for considerable reduction of the total
computational time per event. Test results on simplified simulated model of
LHCb VELO (VErtex LOcator) detector are presented. Also this approach is
well-suited for implementation of paralleled computations as GPGPU which look
very attractive in the context of upcoming detector upgrades.

 <dc:description>  We follow two main objectives in this article. On the one hand, we introduce
a security model called LORBACPA$^+$ for self-synchronized stream ciphers which
is stronger than the blockwise LOR-IND-CPA, where we show that standard
constructions as delayed CBC or similar existing self-synchronized modes of
operation are not secure in this stronger model. Then, on the other hand,
following contributions of G.~Mill\'{e}rioux et.al., we introduce a new
self-synchronized stream cipher and prove its security in LORBACPA$^+$ model.

 <dc:description>  Watermarking can detect sensor attacks in control systems by injecting a
private signal into the control, whereby attacks are identified by checking the
statistics of the sensor measurements and private signal. However, past
approaches assume full state measurements or a centralized controller, which is
not found in networked LTI systems with subcontrollers. Since generally the
entire system is neither controllable nor observable by a single subcontroller,
communication of sensor measurements is required to ensure closed-loop
stability. The possibility of attacking the communication channel has not been
explicitly considered by previous watermarking schemes, and requires a new
design. In this paper, we derive a statistical watermarking test that can
detect both sensor and communication attacks. A unique (compared to the
non-networked case) aspect of the implementing this test is the state-feedback
controller must be designed so that the closed-loop system is controllable by
each sub-controller, and we provide two approaches to design such a controller
using Heymann's lemma and a multi-input generalization of Heymann's lemma. The
usefulness of our approach is demonstrated with a simulation of detecting
attacks in a platoon of autonomous vehicles. Our test allows each vehicle to
independently detect attacks on both the communication channel between vehicles
and on the sensor measurements.

 <dc:description>  Fallback authentication is used to retrieve forgotten passwords. Security
questions are one of the main techniques used to conduct fallback
authentication. In this paper, we propose a serious game design that uses
system-generated security questions with the aim of improving the usability of
fallback authentication. For this purpose, we adopted the popular picture-based
&quot;4 Pics 1 word&quot; mobile game. This game was selected because of its use of
pictures and cues, which previous psychology research found to be crucial to
aid memorability. This game asks users to pick the word that relates to the
given pictures. We then customized this game by adding features which help
maximize the following memory retrieval skills: (a) verbal cues - by providing
hints with verbal descriptions, (b) spatial cues - by maintaining the same
order of pictures, (c) graphical cues - by showing 4 images for each challenge,
(d) interactivity/engaging nature of the game.

 <dc:description>  Automatically generating coherent and semantically meaningful text has many
applications in machine translation, dialogue systems, image captioning, etc.
Recently, by combining with policy gradient, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN)
that use a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model
as a reinforcement learning policy has shown promising results in text
generation. However, the scalar guiding signal is only available after the
entire text has been generated and lacks intermediate information about text
structure during the generative process. As such, it limits its success when
the length of the generated text samples is long (more than 20 words). In this
paper, we propose a new framework, called LeakGAN, to address the problem for
long text generation. We allow the discriminative net to leak its own
high-level extracted features to the generative net to further help the
guidance. The generator incorporates such informative signals into all
generation steps through an additional Manager module, which takes the
extracted features of current generated words and outputs a latent vector to
guide the Worker module for next-word generation. Our extensive experiments on
synthetic data and various real-world tasks with Turing test demonstrate that
LeakGAN is highly effective in long text generation and also improves the
performance in short text generation scenarios. More importantly, without any
supervision, LeakGAN would be able to implicitly learn sentence structures only
through the interaction between Manager and Worker.

 <dc:title>Collaborative Service Caching for Edge Computing in Dense Small Cell

 <dc:description>  Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) pushes computing functionalities away from the
centralized cloud to the proximity of data sources, thereby reducing service
provision latency and saving backhaul network bandwidth. Although computation
offloading has been extensively studied in the literature, service caching is
an equally, if not more, important design topic of MEC, yet receives much less
attention. Service caching refers to caching application services and their
related data (libraries/databases) in the edge server, e.g. MEC-enabled Base
Station (BS), enabling corresponding computation tasks to be executed. Since
only a small number of services can be cached in resource-limited edge server
at the same time, which services to cache has to be judiciously decided to
maximize the system performance. In this paper, we investigate collaborative
service caching in MEC-enabled dense small cell (SC) networks. We propose an
efficient decentralized algorithm, called CSC (Collaborative Service Caching),
where a network of small cell BSs optimize service caching collaboratively to
address a number of key challenges in MEC systems, including service
heterogeneity, spatial demand coupling, and decentralized coordination. Our
algorithm is developed based on parallel Gibbs sampling by exploiting the
special structure of the considered problem using graphing coloring. The
algorithm significantly improves the time efficiency compared to conventional
Gibbs sampling, yet guarantees provable convergence and optimality. CSC is
further extended to the SC network with selfish BSs, where a coalitional game
is formulated to incentivize collaboration. A coalition formation algorithm is
developed by employing the merge-and-split rules and ensures the stability of
the SC coalitions.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, several real-time or near real-time object detectors have
been developed. However these object detectors are typically designed for
first-person view images where the subject is large in the image and do not
directly apply well to detecting vehicles in aerial imagery. Though some
detectors have been developed for aerial imagery, these are either slow or do
not handle multi-scale imagery very well. Here the popular YOLOv2 detector is
modified to vastly improve it's performance on aerial data. The modified
detector is compared to Faster RCNN on several aerial imagery datasets. The
proposed detector gives near state of the art performance at more than 4x the
speed.

 <dc:description>  Recently proposed models which learn to write computer programs from data use
either input/output examples or rich execution traces. Instead, we argue that a
novel alternative is to use a glass-box loss function, given as a program
itself that can be directly inspected. Glass-box optimization covers a wide
range of problems, from computing the greatest common divisor of two integers,
to learning-to-learn problems.
  In this paper, we present an intelligent search system which learns, given
the partial program and the glass-box problem, the probabilities over the space
of programs. We empirically demonstrate that our informed search procedure
leads to significant improvements compared to brute-force program search, both
in terms of accuracy and time. For our experiments we use rich context free
grammars inspired by number theory, text processing, and algebra. Our results
show that (i) performing 4 rounds of our framework typically solves about 70%
of the target problems, (ii) our framework can improve itself even in domain
agnostic scenarios, and (iii) it can solve problems that would be otherwise too
slow to solve with brute-force search.

 <dc:description>  Real-world data processing problems often involve various image modalities
associated with a certain scene, including RGB images, infrared images or
multispectral images. The fact that different image modalities often share
diverse attributes, such as certain edges, textures and other structure
primitives, represents an opportunity to enhance various image processing
tasks. This paper proposes a new approach to construct a high-resolution (HR)
version of a low-resolution (LR) image given another HR image modality as
reference, based on joint sparse representations induced by coupled
dictionaries. Our approach, which captures the similarities and disparities
between different image modalities in a learned sparse feature domain in lieu
of the original image domain, consists of two phases. The coupled dictionary
learning phase is used to learn a set of dictionaries that couple different
image modalities in the sparse feature domain given a set of training data. In
turn, the coupled super-resolution phase leverages such coupled dictionaries to
construct a HR version of the LR target image given another related image
modality. One of the merits of our sparsity-driven approach relates to the fact
that it overcomes drawbacks such as the texture copying artifacts commonly
resulting from inconsistency between the guidance and target images.
Experiments on both synthetic data and real multimodal images demonstrate that
incorporating appropriate guidance information via joint sparse representation
induced by coupled dictionary learning brings notable benefits in the
super-resolution task with respect to the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:title>Data-Driven Approach to Simulating Realistic Human Joint Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modeling realistic human joint limits is important for applications involving
physical human-robot interaction. However, setting appropriate human joint
limits is challenging because it is pose-dependent: the range of joint motion
varies depending on the positions of other bones. The paper introduces a new
technique to accurately simulate human joint limits in physics simulation. We
propose to learn an implicit equation to represent the boundary of valid human
joint configurations from real human data. The function in the implicit
equation is represented by a fully connected neural network whose gradients can
be efficiently computed via back-propagation. Using gradients, we can
efficiently enforce realistic human joint limits through constraint forces in a
physics engine or as constraints in an optimization problem.

 <dc:description>  Programmable circuits such as general-purpose processors or FPGAs have their
end-user energy efficiency strongly dependent on the program that they execute.
Ultimately, it is the programmer's ability to code and, in the case of general
purpose processors, the compiler's ability to translate source code into a
sequence of native instructions that make the circuit deliver the expected
performance to the end user. This way, the benefits of energy-efficient
circuits build upon energy-efficient devices could be obfuscated by poorly
written software. Clearly, having well-written software running on conventional
circuits is no better in terms of energy efficiency than having poorly written
software running on energy-efficient circuits. Therefore, to get the most out
of the energy-saving capabilities of programmable circuits that support low
voltage operating modes, it is necessary to address software issues that might
work against the benefits of operating in such modes.

Vision and Natural Language Pro- cessing. Among others, Visual Question
Answering (VQA), also referred to a visual Turing test, is considered one of
the most compelling problems, and recent deep learning models have reported
significant progress in vision and language modeling. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is getting closer to passing the visual Turing test, at the
same time the existence of adversarial examples to deep learning systems may
hinder the practical application of such systems. In this work, we conduct the
first extensive study on adversarial examples for VQA systems. In particular,
we focus on generating targeted adversarial examples for a VQA system while the
target is considered to be a question-answer pair. Our evaluation shows that
the success rate of whether a targeted adversarial example can be generated is
mostly dependent on the choice of the target question-answer pair, and less on
the choice of images to which the question refers. We also report the language
prior phenomenon of a VQA model, which can explain why targeted adversarial
examples are hard to generate for some question-answer targets. We also
demonstrate that a compositional VQA architecture is slightly more resilient to
adversarial attacks than a non-compositional one. Our study sheds new light on
how to build deep vision and language resilient models robust against
adversarial examples.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the methodology and the results obtained by our
teams, dubbed Blue Man Group, in the ASSIN (from the Portuguese {\it
Avalia\c{c}\~ao de Similaridade Sem\^antica e Infer\^encia Textual})
competition, held at PROPOR 2016\footnote{International Conference on the
Computational Processing of the Portuguese Language -
http://propor2016.di.fc.ul.pt/}. Our team's strategy consisted of evaluating
methods based on semantic word vectors, following two distinct directions: 1)
to make use of low-dimensional, compact, feature sets, and 2) deep
learning-based strategies dealing with high-dimensional feature vectors.
Evaluation results demonstrated that the first strategy was more promising, so
that the results from the second strategy have been discarded. As a result, by
considering the best run of each of the six teams, we have been able to achieve
the best accuracy and F1 values in entailment recognition, in the Brazilian
Portuguese set, and the best F1 score overall. In the semantic similarity task,
our team was ranked second in the Brazilian Portuguese set, and third
considering both sets.

 <dc:title>On the widths of regular and context free languages, with an application

 <dc:description>  Given a partially-ordered finite alphabet $\Sigma$ and a language $L
\subseteq \Sigma^*$, how large can an antichain in $L$ be (where $L$ is ordered
by the lexicographic ordering)? This fundamental property of partial orders is
known as the width and its computation is the central extremal problem for
partially ordered sets. More precisely, since $L$ will in general be infinite,
we should ask about the rate of growth of maximum antichains consisting of
words of length $n$.
  In this work, we show that if L is regular or context free then there is a
dichotomy between polynomial and exponential antichain growth. For regular
languages we give a polynomial time algorithm to distinguish the two cases,
even if $L$ is specified as an NFA. On the other hand for context free
languages we show that the problem of distinguishing the two cases is
undecidable. We generalise the lexicographic order to tree languages, and show
that for regular tree languages there is a trichotomy between polynomial,
exponential and doubly exponential antichain growth. Finally we discuss the
motivating problem for this work, which is related to information flow in the
context of computer security.

 <dc:title>Identifying Restaurant Features via Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many people use Yelp to find a good restaurant. Nonetheless, with only an
overall rating for each restaurant, Yelp offers not enough information for
independently judging its various aspects such as environment, service or
flavor. In this paper, we introduced a machine learning based method to
characterize such aspects for particular types of restaurants. The main
approach used in this paper is to use a support vector machine (SVM) model to
decipher the sentiment tendency of each review from word frequency. Word scores
generated from the SVM models are further processed into a polarity index
indicating the significance of each word for special types of restaurant.
Customers overall tend to express more sentiment regarding service. As for the
distinction between different cuisines, results that match the common sense are
obtained: Japanese cuisines are usually fresh, some French cuisines are
overpriced while Italian Restaurants are often famous for their pizzas.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of quantifying controllability and
observability of a nonlinear discrete time dynamical system. We introduce the
Koopman operator as a canonical representation of the system and apply a
lifting technique to compute gramians in the space of full-state observables.
We illustrate the properties of these gramians and identify several
relationships with canonical results on local controllability and
observability. Once defined, we show that these gramians can be balanced
through a change of coordinates on the observables space, which in turn allows
for direct application of balanced truncation. Throughout the paper, we
highlight the aspects of our approach with an example nonlinear system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditional supervised learning makes the closed-world assumption that the
classes appeared in the test data must have appeared in training. This also
applies to text learning or text classification. As learning is used
increasingly in dynamic open environments where some new/test documents may not
belong to any of the training classes, identifying these novel documents during
classification presents an important problem. This problem is called open-world
classification or open classification. This paper proposes a novel deep
learning based approach. It outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques
dramatically.

 <dc:description>  Our goal is to empirically discover how censors react to the introduction of
new proxy servers that can be used to circumvent their information controls. We
examine a specific case, that of obfuscated Tor bridges, and conduct
experiments designed to discover how long it takes censors to block them (if
they do block at all). Through a year's worth of active measurements from
China, Iran, Kazakhstan, and other countries, we learn when bridges become
blocked. In China we found the most interesting behavior, including long and
varying delays before blocking, frequent failures during which blocked bridges
became reachable, and an advancement in blocking technique midway through the
experiment. Throughout, we observed surprising behavior by censors, not in
accordance with what we would have predicted, calling into question our
assumptions and suggesting potential untapped avenues for circumvention.

 <dc:description>  We study stochastic optimization of nonconvex loss functions, which are

approximation algorithms which optimize a series of regularized, nonlinearized
losses on large minibatches of samples, using only first-order gradient

uncertainty (MSU) measure through the use of statistical simulation techniques
under various mixes of informative and non-informative randomly generated
features. Experiments show how the number of attributes, their cardinalities,
and the sample size affect the MSU. We discovered a condition that preserves
good quality in the MSU under different combinations of these three factors,
providing a new useful criterion to help drive the process of dimension

 <dc:description>  Models of molecular computing generally embed computation in kinetics--the
specific time evolution of a chemical system. However, if the desired output is
not thermodynamically stable, basic physical chemistry dictates that
thermodynamic forces will drive the system toward error throughout the
computation. The Thermodynamic Binding Network (TBN) model was introduced to
formally study how the thermodynamic equilibrium can be made consistent with
the desired computation, and it idealizes binding interactions subject to
enthalpy and entropy tradeoffs. Here we consider the computational complexity
of natural questions about TBNs, and develop a practical algorithm for
verifying the correctness of constructions based on a SAT solver. The TBN model
together with automated verification tools will help inform strategies for leak
and error reduction in strand displacement cascades and algorithmic tile
assembly.

 <dc:description>  Zero forcing is an iterative process on a graph used to bound the maximum
nullity. The process begins with select vertices as colored, and the remaining
vertices can become colored under a specific color change rule. The goal is to
find a minimum set of vertices such that after iteratively applying the rule,
all of the vertices become colored (i.e., a minimum zero forcing set). Of
particular interest is the propagation time of a chosen set which is the number
of steps the rule must be applied in order to color all the vertices of a
graph.
  We give a purely linear algebraic interpretation of zero forcing: Find a set
of vertices $S$ such that for any weighted adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$,
whenever $\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{0}$, the entirety of of $\mathbf{x}$ can be
recovered using only $\mathbf{x}_S$, the entries corresponding to $S$. The key
here is that $S$ must be chosen before $\mathbf{A}$. In this light, we are able
to give a linear algebraic interpretation of the propagation time: Any error in
$\mathbf{x}_S$ effects the error of $\mathbf{x}$ exponentially in the
propagation time. This error can be quantitatively measured using newly defined
zero forcing-related parameters, the error polynomial vector and the variance
polynomial vector. In this sense, the quality of two zero forcing sets can
objectively be compared even if the sets are the same size and their
propagation time is the same. Examples and constructions are given.

 <dc:description>  Growing uncertainty in design parameters (and therefore, in design
functionality) renders stochastic computing particularly promising, which
represents and processes data as quantized probabilities. However, due to the
difference in data representation, integrating conventional memory (designed
and optimized for non-stochastic computing) in stochastic computing systems
inevitably incurs a significant data conversion overhead. Barely any stochastic
computing proposal to-date covers the memory impact. In this paper, as the
first study of its kind to the best of our knowledge, we rethink the memory
system design for stochastic computing. The result is a seamless stochastic
system, StochMem, which features analog memory to trade the energy and area
overhead of data conversion for computation accuracy. In this manner StochMem
can reduce the energy (area) overhead by up-to 52.8% (93.7%) at the cost of at
most 0.7% loss in computation accuracy.

 <dc:title>Bobtail: A Proof-of-Work Target that Minimizes Blockchain Mining
  Variance (Draft)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bissias, George</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Levine, Brian Neil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Blockchain systems are designed to produce blocks at a constant average rate.
The most popular systems currently employ a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm as a
means of creating these blocks. Bitcoin produces, on average, one block every
10 minutes. An unfortunate limitation of all deployed PoW blockchain systems is
that the time between blocks has high variance. For example, 5% of the time,
Bitcoin's inter-block time is at least 40 minutes. This variance impedes the
consistent flow of validated transactions through the system. We propose an
alternative process for PoW-based block discovery that results in an
inter-block time with significantly lower variance. Our algorithm, called
Bobtail, generalizes the current algorithm by comparing the mean of the k
lowest order statistics to a target. We show that the variance of inter-block
times decreases as k increases. If our approach were applied to Bitcoin, about
80% of blocks would be found within 7 to 12 minutes, and nearly every block
would be found within 5 to 18 minutes; the average inter-block time would
remain at 10 minutes. Further, we show that low-variance mining significantly
thwarts doublespend and selfish mining attacks. For Bitcoin and Ethereum
currently (k=1), an attacker with 40% of the mining power will succeed with 30%
probability when the merchant sets up an embargo of 8 blocks; however, when
k&gt;=20, the probability of success falls to less than 1%. Similarly, for Bitcoin
and Ethereum currently, a selfish miner with 40% of the mining power will claim
about 66% of blocks; however, when k&gt;=5, the same miner will find that selfish
mining is less successful than honest mining. The cost of our approach is a
larger block header.

 <dc:title>Automated Behavioral Analysis of Malware A Case Study of WannaCry
  Ransomware</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Qian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bridges, Robert A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Ransomware, a class of self-propagating malware that uses encryption to hold
the victims' data ransom, has emerged in recent years as one of the most
dangerous cyber threats, with widespread damage; e.g., zero-day ransomware
WannaCry has caused world-wide catastrophe, from knocking U.K. National Health
Service hospitals offline to shutting down a Honda Motor Company in Japan[1].
Our close collaboration with security operations of large enterprises reveals
that defense against ransomware relies on tedious analysis from high-volume
systems logs of the first few infections. Sandbox analysis of freshly captured
malware is also commonplace in operation.
  We introduce a method to identify and rank the most discriminating ransomware
features from a set of ambient (non-attack) system logs and at least one log
stream containing both ambient and ransomware behavior. These ranked features
reveal a set of malware actions that are produced automatically from system
logs, and can help automate tedious manual analysis. We test our approach using
WannaCry and two polymorphic samples by producing logs with Cuckoo Sandbox
during both ambient, and ambient plus ransomware executions. Our goal is to
extract the features of the malware from the logs with only knowledge that
malware was present. We compare outputs with a detailed analysis of WannaCry
allowing validation of the algorithm's feature extraction and provide analysis
of the method's robustness to variations of input data\textemdash changing
quality/quantity of ambient data and testing polymorphic ransomware. Most
notably, our patterns are accurate and unwavering when generated from
polymorphic WannaCry copies, on which 63 (of 63 tested) anti-virus (AV)
products fail.

 <dc:description>  Image similarity involves fetching similar looking images given a reference
image. Our solution called SimNet, is a deep siamese network which is trained
on pairs of positive and negative images using a novel online pair mining
strategy inspired by Curriculum learning. We also created a multi-scale CNN,
where the final image embedding is a joint representation of top as well as
lower layer embedding's. We go on to show that this multi-scale siamese network
is better at capturing fine grained image similarities than traditional CNN's.

 <dc:description>  HTTP video streaming is in wide use to deliver video over the Internet. With
HTTP adaptive steaming, a video playback dynamically selects a video stream
from a pre-encoded representation based on available bandwidth and viewport
(screen) size. The viewer's video quality is therefore influenced by the
encoded bitrates. We minimize the average delivered bitrate subject to a
quality lower bound on a per-chunk basis by modeling the probability that a
player selects a particular encoding. Through simulation and real-world
experiments, the proposed method saves 9.6% of bandwidth while average
delivered video quality comparing with state of the art while keeping average
delivered video quality.

 <dc:description>  In decentralized optimization, nodes cooperate to minimize an overall
objective function that is the sum (or average) of per-node private objective
functions. Algorithms interleave local computations with communication among
all or a subset of the nodes. Motivated by a variety of
applications---distributed estimation in sensor networks, fitting models to
massive data sets, and distributed control of multi-robot systems, to name a
few---significant advances have been made towards the development of robust,
practical algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. This paper
presents an overview of recent work in this area. In general, rates of
convergence depend not only on the number of nodes involved and the desired
level of accuracy, but also on the structure and nature of the network over
which nodes communicate (e.g., whether links are directed or undirected, static
or time-varying). We survey the state-of-the-art algorithms and their analyses
tailored to these different scenarios, highlighting the role of the network
topology.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel computational framework that connects Blue Waters, the
NSF-supported, leadership-class supercomputer operated by NCSA, to the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Data Grid via Open Science
Grid technology. To enable this computational infrastructure, we configured,
for the first time, a LIGO Data Grid Tier-1 Center that can submit
heterogeneous LIGO workflows using Open Science Grid facilities. In order to
enable a seamless connection between the LIGO Data Grid and Blue Waters via
Open Science Grid, we utilize Shifter to containerize LIGO's workflow software.
This work represents the first time Open Science Grid, Shifter, and Blue Waters
are unified to tackle a scientific problem and, in particular, it is the first
time a framework of this nature is used in the context of large scale
gravitational wave data analysis. This new framework has been used in the last
several weeks of LIGO's second discovery campaign to run the most
computationally demanding gravitational wave search workflows on Blue Waters,
and accelerate discovery in the emergent field of gravitational wave
astrophysics. We discuss the implications of this novel framework for a wider
ecosystem of Higher Performance Computing users.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a real-time programming and parameter reconfiguration
method for autonomous underwater robots in human-robot collaborative tasks.
Using a set of intuitive and meaningful hand gestures, we develop a
syntactically simple framework that is computationally more efficient than a
complex, grammar-based approach. In the proposed framework, a convolutional
neural network is trained to provide accurate hand gesture recognition;
subsequently, a finite-state machine-based deterministic model performs
efficient gesture-to-instruction mapping, and further improves robustness of
the interaction scheme. The key aspect of this framework is that it can be
easily adopted by divers for communicating simple instructions to underwater
robots without using artificial tags such as fiducial markers, or requiring
them to memorize a potentially complex set of language rules. Extensive
experiments are performed both on field-trial data and through simulation,
which demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and portability of this framework
in a number of different scenarios. Finally, a user interaction study is
presented that illustrates the gain in usability of our proposed interaction
framework compared to the existing methods for underwater domains.

 <dc:description>  This article introduces a tensor network subspace algorithm for the
identification of specific polynomial state space models. The polynomial
nonlinearity in the state space model is completely written in terms of a
tensor network, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We also prove how
the block Hankel data matrices in the subspace method can be exactly
represented by low rank tensor networks, reducing the computational and storage
complexity significantly. The performance and accuracy of our subspace
identification algorithm are illustrated by numerical experiments, showing that
our tensor network implementation is around 20 times faster than the standard
matrix implementation before the latter fails due to insufficient memory, is
robust with respect to noise and can model real-world systems.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed the rapid development and wide adoption of
immersive head-mounted devices, such as HTC VIVE, Oculus Rift, and Microsoft
HoloLens. These immersive devices have the potential to significantly extend
the methodology of urban visual analytics by providing critical 3D context
information and creating a sense of presence. In this paper, we propose an
theoretical model to characterize the visualizations in immersive urban
analytics. Further more, based on our comprehensive and concise model, we
contribute a typology of combination methods of 2D and 3D visualizations that
distinguish between linked views, embedded views, and mixed views. We also
propose a supporting guideline to assist users in selecting a proper view under
certain circumstances by considering visual geometry and spatial distribution
of the 2D and 3D visualizations. Finally, based on existing works, possible
future research opportunities are explored and discussed.

 <dc:description>  As a flexible and scalable architecture, heterogeneous cloud radio access
networks (H-CRANs) inject strong vigor into the green evolution of current
wireless networks. But the brutal truth is that energy efficiency (EE) improves
at the cost of other indexes such as spectral efficiency (SE), fairness, and
delay. It is thus important to investigate performance tradeoffs for striking
flexible balances between energy-efficient transmission and excellent
quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees under this new architecture. In this
article, we first propose some potential techniques to energy-efficiently
operate H-CRANs by exploiting their features. We then elaborate the initial
ideas of modeling three fundamental tradeoffs, namely EE-SE, EE-fairness, and
EE-delay tradeoffs, when applying these green techniques, and present open
issues and challenges for future investigations. These related results are
expected to shed light on green operation of H-CRANs from adaptive resource
allocation, intelligent network control, and scalable network planning.

 <dc:description>  We consider network utility maximization problems over heterogeneous cellular
networks (HetNets) that permit dual connectivity. Dual connectivity (DC) is a
feature that targets emerging practical HetNet deployments that will comprise
of non-ideal (higher latency) connections between transmission nodes, and has
been recently introduced to the LTE-Advanced standard. DC allows for a user to
be simultaneously served by a macro node as well as one other (typically micro
or pico) node and requires relatively coarser level coordination among serving
nodes. For such a DC enabled HetNet we comprehensively analyze the problem of
determining an optimal user association, where in any feasible association each
user can be associated with (i.e., configured to receive data from) any one
macro node (in a given set of macro nodes) and any one pico node that lies in
the chosen macro node's coverage area. We consider the weighted sum rate system
utility subject to per-user maximum and minimum rate constraints, as well as
the proportional fairness (PF) system utility. For both utility choices we
construct approximation algorithms and establish their respective approximation
guarantees. We then validate the performance of our algorithms via numerical
results.

that the property of recursive randomness is closed under computable
permutations. We investigate analogous statements for randomness notions
defined by betting strategies that are computable within resource bounds.
Suppose that S is a polynomial time computable permutation of the set of
strings over the unary alphabet (identified with N). If the inverse of S is not
polynomially bounded, it is easy to build a polynomial time random bit sequence
Z such that Z o S is not polynomial time random. So one should only consider
permutations S satisfying the extra condition that the inverse is polynomially
bounded. Now the closure depends on additional assumptions in complexity
theory.
  Our first result shows that if BPP contains a superpolynomial deterministic
time class then polynomial time randomness is not preserved by some permutation
S such that in fact both S and its inverse are in P. Our second result shows
that polynomial space randomness is preserved by polynomial time permutations
with polynomially boun\-ded inverse, so if P=PSPACE then polynomial time
randomness is preserved.

 <dc:description>  Ultra-dense heterogeneous networks (Ud-HetNets) have been put forward to
improve the network capacity for next-generation wireless networks. However,
counter to the 5G vision, ultra-dense deployment of networks would
significantly increase energy consumption and thus decrease network energy
efficiency suffering from the conventional worst-case network design
philosophy. This problem becomes particularly severe when Ud-HetNets meet big
data because of the traditional reactive request-transmit service mode. In view
of these, this article first develops a big-data-aware artificial intelligent
based framework for energy-efficient operations of Ud-HetNets. Based on the
framework, we then identify four promising techniques, namely big data
analysis, adaptive base station operation, proactive caching, and
interference-aware resource allocation, to reduce energy cost on both large and
small scales. We further develop a load-aware stochastic optimization approach
to show the potential of our proposed framework and techniques in energy
conservation. In a nutshell, we devote to constructing green Ud-HetNets of big
data with the abilities of learning and inferring by improving the flexibility
of control from worst-case to adaptive design and shifting the manner of
services from reactive to proactive modes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the computational power of a set of mobile
robots with limited visibility. At each iteration, a robot takes a snapshot of
its surroundings, uses the snapshot to compute a destination point, and it
moves toward its destination. Each robot is punctiform and memoryless, it
operates in $\mathbb{R}^m$, it has a local reference system independent of the
other robots' ones, and is activated asynchronously by an adversarial
scheduler. Moreover, robots are non-rigid, in that they may be stopped by the
scheduler at each move before reaching their destination (but are guaranteed to
travel at least a fixed unknown distance before being stopped).
  We show that despite these strong limitations, it is possible to arrange
$3m+3k$ of these weak entities in $\mathbb{R}^m$ to simulate the behavior of a
stronger robot that is rigid (i.e., it always reaches its destination) and is
endowed with $k$ registers of persistent memory, each of which can store a real
number. We call this arrangement a TuringMobile. In its simplest form, a
TuringMobile consisting of only three robots can travel in the plane and store
and update a single real number. We also prove that this task is impossible
with fewer than three robots.
  Among the applications of the TuringMobile, we focused on Near-Gathering (all
robots have to gather in a small-enough disk) and Pattern Formation (of which
Gathering is a special case) with limited visibility. Interestingly, our
investigation implies that both problems are solvable in Euclidean spaces of
any dimension, even if the visibility graph of the robots is initially
disconnected, provided that a small amount of these robots are arranged to form
a TuringMobile. In the special case of the plane, a basic TuringMobile of only
three robots is sufficient.

 <dc:description>  This study proposes a Deep Belief Network model to classify traffic flow
states. The model is capable of processing massive, high-density, and
noise-contaminated data sets generated from smartphone sensors. The statistical
features of Vehicle acceleration, angular acceleration, and GPS speed data,
recorded by smartphone software, are analyzed, and then used as input for
traffic flow state classification. Data from a five-day experiment is used to
train and test the proposed model. A total of 747,856 sets of data are
generated and used for both traffic flow states classification and sensitivity
analysis of input variables. The result shows that the proposed Deep Belief
Network model is superior to traditional machine learning methods in both
classification performance and computational efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Static detection technologies based on signature-based approaches that are
widely used in Android platform to detect malicious applications. It can
accurately detect malware by extracting signatures from test data and then
comparing the test data with the signature samples of virus and benign samples.
However, this method is generally unable to detect unknown malware
applications. This is because, sometimes, the machine code can be converted
into assembly code, which can be easily read and understood by humans.
Furthuremore, the attacker can then make sense of the assembly instructions and
understand the functioning of the program from the same. Therefore we focus on
observing the behaviour of the malicious software while it is actually running
on a host system. The dynamic behaviours of an application are conducted by the
system call sequences at the end. Hence, we observe the system call log of each
application, use the same for the construction of our dataset, and finally use
this dataset to classify an unknown application as malicious or benign.

 <dc:description>  Place recognition is an essential component of any Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM) system. Correct place recognition is a difficult perception
task in cases where there is significant appearance change as the same place
might look very different in the morning and at night or over different
seasons. This work addresses place recognition using a two-step (generative and
discriminative) approach. Using a pair of coupled Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), we show that it is possible to generate the appearance of one
domain (such as summer) from another (such as winter) without needing image to
image correspondences. We identify these relationships considering sets of
images in the two domains without knowing the instance-to-instance
correspondence. In the process, we learn meaningful feature spaces, the
distances in which can be used for the task of place recognition. Experiments
show that learned feature correspond to visual space and can be effectively
used for place recognition across seasons.

 <dc:description>  An electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) enables
people to communicate with the outside world by interpreting the EEG signals of
their brains to interact with devices such as wheelchairs and intelligent
robots. More specifically, motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG), which reflects a
subjects active intent, is attracting increasing attention for a variety of BCI
applications. Accurate classification of MI-EEG signals while essential for
effective operation of BCI systems, is challenging due to the significant noise
inherent in the signals and the lack of informative correlation between the
signals and brain activities. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural
network based learning framework that affords perceptive insights into the
relationship between the MI-EEG data and brain activities. We design a joint
convolutional recurrent neural network that simultaneously learns robust
high-level feature presentations through low-dimensional dense embeddings from
raw MI-EEG signals. We also employ an Autoencoder layer to eliminate various
artifacts such as background activities. The proposed approach has been
evaluated extensively on a large- scale public MI-EEG dataset and a limited but
easy-to-deploy dataset collected in our lab. The results show that our approach
outperforms a series of baselines and the competitive state-of-the- art
methods, yielding a classification accuracy of 95.53%. The applicability of our
proposed approach is further demonstrated with a practical BCI system for
typing.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of scheduling sensors in a resource-constrained linear
dynamical system, where the objective is to select a small subset of sensors
from a large network to perform the state estimation task. We formulate this
problem as the maximization of a monotone set function under a matroid
constraint. We propose a randomized greedy algorithm that is significantly
faster than state-of-the-art methods. By introducing the notion of curvature
which quantifies how close a function is to being submodular, we analyze the
performance of the proposed algorithm and find a bound on the expected mean
square error (MSE) of the estimator that uses the selected sensors in terms of
the optimal MSE. Moreover, we derive a probabilistic bound on the curvature for
the scenario where{\color{black}{ the measurements are i.i.d. random vectors
with bounded $\ell_2$ norm.}} Simulation results demonstrate efficacy of the
randomized greedy algorithm in a comparison with greedy and semidefinite
programming relaxation methods.

 <dc:description>  Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control is concerned with the design of an
optimal controller and estimator for linear Gaussian systems with imperfect
state information. Standard LQG assumes the set of sensor measurements, to be
fed to the estimator, to be given. However, in many problems, arising in
networked systems and robotics, one may not be able to use all the available
sensors, due to power or payload constraints, or may be interested in using the
smallest subset of sensors that guarantees the attainment of a desired control
goal. In this paper, we introduce the sensing-constrained LQG control problem,
in which one has to jointly design sensing, estimation, and control, under
given constraints on the resources spent for sensing. We focus on the realistic
case in which the sensing strategy has to be selected among a finite set of
possible sensing modalities. While the computation of the optimal sensing
strategy is intractable, we present the first scalable algorithm that computes
a near-optimal sensing strategy with provable sub-optimality guarantees. To
this end, we show that a separation principle holds, which allows the design of
sensing, estimation, and control policies in isolation. We conclude the paper
by discussing two applications of sensing-constrained LQG control, namely,
sensing-constrained formation control and resource-constrained robot
navigation.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we tackle the problem of car license plate detection and
recognition in natural scene images. We propose a unified deep neural network
which can localize license plates and recognize the letters simultaneously in a
single forward pass. The whole network can be trained end-to-end. In contrast
to existing approaches which take license plate detection and recognition as
two separate tasks and settle them step by step, our method jointly solves
these two tasks by a single network. It not only avoids intermediate error
accumulation, but also accelerates the processing speed. For performance
evaluation, three datasets including images captured from various scenes under
different conditions are tested. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness
and efficiency of our proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  A significant challenge in energy system cyber security is the current
inability to detect cyber-physical attacks targeting and originating from
distributed grid-edge devices such as photovoltaics (PV) panels, smart flexible
loads, and electric vehicles. We address this concern by designing and
developing a distributed, multi-modal anomaly detection approach that can sense
the health of the device and the electric power grid from the edge. This is
realized by exploiting unsupervised machine learning algorithms on multiple
sources of time-series data, fusing these multiple local observations and
flagging anomalies when a deviation from the normal behavior is observed.
  We particularly focus on the cyber-physical threats to the distributed PVs
that has the potential to cause local disturbances or grid instabilities by
creating supply-demand mismatch, reverse power flow conditions etc. We use an
open source power system simulation tool called GridLAB-D, loaded with real
smart home and solar datasets to simulate the smart grid scenarios and to
illustrate the impact of PV attacks on the power system. Various attacks
targeting PV panels that create voltage fluctuations, reverse power flow etc
were designed and performed. We observe that while individual unsupervised
learning algorithms such as OCSVMs, Corrupt RF and PCA surpasses in identifying
particular attack type, PCA with Convex Hull outperforms all algorithms in
identifying all designed attacks with a true positive rate of 83.64% and an
accuracy of 95.78%. Our key insight is that due to the heterogeneous nature of
the distribution grid and the uncertainty in the type of the attack being
launched, relying on single mode of information for defense can lead to
increased false alarms and missed detection rates as one can design attacks to
hide within those uncertainties and remain stealthy.

 <dc:description>  Our CoBot robots have successfully performed a variety of service tasks in
our multi-building environment including accompanying people to meetings and
delivering objects to offices due to its navigation and localization
capabilities. However, they lack the capability to visually search over desks
and other confined locations for an object of interest. Conversely, an
inexpensive GPS-denied quadcopter platform such as the Parrot ARDrone 2.0 could
perform this object search task if it had access to reasonable localization. In
this paper, we propose the concept of coordination between CoBot and the Parrot
ARDrone 2.0 to perform service-based object search tasks, in which CoBot
localizes and navigates to the general search areas carrying the ARDrone and
the ARDrone searches locally for objects. We propose a vision-based moving
target navigation algorithm that enables the ARDrone to localize with respect
to CoBot, search for objects, and return to the CoBot for future searches. We
demonstrate our algorithm in indoor environments on several search
trajectories.

 <dc:title>Conjugate Phase Retrieval on ${\mathbb C}^M$ by real vectors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we will introduce the notion of {\it conjugate phase
retrieval}, which is a relaxed definition of phase retrieval allowing recovery
of signals up to conjugacy as well as a global phase factor. It is known that
frames of real vectors are never phase retrievable on ${\mathbb C}^M$ in the
ordinary sense, but we show that they can be conjugate phase retrievable in
complex vector spaces. We continue to develop the theory on conjugate phase
retrievable real frames. In particular, a complete characterization of
conjugate phase retrievable real frames on ${\mathbb C}^2$ and ${\mathbb C}^3$
is given. Furthermore, we show that a generic real frame with at least $4M - 6$
measurements is conjugate phase retrievable in ${\mathbb C}^M$ for $ M \ge 4.$

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses discrete-time maps of the form $x(k + 1) = F(x(k))$,
focussing on equilibrium points of such maps. Under some circumstances,
Lefschetz fixed-point theory can be used to establish the existence of a single
locally attractive equilibrium (which is sometimes globally attractive) when a
general property of local attractivity is known for any equilibrium. Problems
in social networks often involve such discrete-time systems, and we make an
application to one such problem.

 <dc:title>Learning a Predictive Model for Music Using PULSE</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Predictive models for music are studied by researchers of algorithmic
composition, the cognitive sciences and machine learning. They serve as base
models for composition, can simulate human prediction and provide a
multidisciplinary application domain for learning algorithms. A particularly
well established and constantly advanced subtask is the prediction of
monophonic melodies. As melodies typically involve non-Markovian dependencies
their prediction requires a capable learning algorithm. In this thesis, I apply
the recent feature discovery and learning method PULSE to the realm of symbolic
music modeling. PULSE is comprised of a feature generating operation and
L1-regularized optimization. These are used to iteratively expand and cull the
feature set, effectively exploring feature spaces that are too large for common
feature selection approaches. I design a general Python framework for PULSE,
propose task-optimized feature generating operations and various
music-theoretically motivated features that are evaluated on a standard corpus
of monophonic folk and chorale melodies. The proposed method significantly
outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models. I further discuss the free
parameters of the learning algorithm and analyze the feature composition of the
learned models. The models learned by PULSE afford an easy inspection and are
musicologically interpreted for the first time.

 <dc:description>  Structured prediction is ubiquitous in applications of machine learning such
as knowledge extraction and natural language processing. Structure often can be
formulated in terms of logical constraints. We consider the question of how to
perform efficient active learning in the presence of logical constraints among
variables inferred by different classifiers. We propose several methods and
provide theoretical results that demonstrate the inappropriateness of employing
uncertainty guided sampling, a commonly used active learning method.
Furthermore, experiments on ten different datasets demonstrate that the methods
significantly outperform alternatives in practice. The results are of practical
significance in situations where labeled data is scarce.

 <dc:title>Is It Safe to Uplift This Patch? An Empirical Study on Mozilla Firefox</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or
implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development
channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more
stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is
risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end
up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift
operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted
patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we
quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift
decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced
regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to
understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and
outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong
functionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have
larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors
in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift
requests that concern certain specific components, and-or that are submitted by
certain specific developers.

 <dc:description>  We propose Object-oriented Neural Programming (OONP), a framework for
semantically parsing documents in specific domains. Basically, OONP reads a
document and parses it into a predesigned object-oriented data structure
(referred to as ontology in this paper) that reflects the domain-specific
semantics of the document. An OONP parser models semantic parsing as a decision
process: a neural net-based Reader sequentially goes through the document, and
during the process it builds and updates an intermediate ontology to summarize
its partial understanding of the text it covers. OONP supports a rich family of
operations (both symbolic and differentiable) for composing the ontology, and a
big variety of forms (both symbolic and differentiable) for representing the
state and the document. An OONP parser can be trained with supervision of
different forms and strength, including supervised learning (SL) ,
reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid of the two. Our experiments on both
synthetic and real-world document parsing tasks have shown that OONP can learn
to handle fairly complicated ontology with training data of modest sizes.

 <dc:description>  We study the design of deep architectures for lossy image compression. We
present two architectural recipes in the context of multi-stage progressive
encoders and empirically demonstrate their importance on compression
performance. Specifically, we show that: (a) predicting the original image data
from residuals in a multi-stage progressive architecture facilitates learning
and leads to improved performance at approximating the original content and (b)
learning to inpaint (from neighboring image pixels) before performing
compression reduces the amount of information that must be stored to achieve a
high-quality approximation. Incorporating these design choices in a baseline
progressive encoder yields an average reduction of over $60\%$ in file size
with similar quality compared to the original residual encoder.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a statistical test to determine whether a given
word is used as a polysemic word or not. The statistic of the word in this test
roughly corresponds to the fluctuation in the senses of the neighboring words a
nd the word itself. Even though the sense of a word corresponds to a single
vector, we discuss how polysemy of the words affects the position of vectors.
Finally, we also explain the method to detect this effect.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a minimal contrastive divergence method for learning
energy-based generative ConvNet models of images at multiple grids (or scales)
simultaneously. For each grid, we learn an energy-based probabilistic model
where the energy function is defined by a bottom-up convolutional neural
network (ConvNet or CNN). Learning such a model requires generating synthesized
examples from the model. Within each iteration of our learning algorithm, for
each observed training image, we generate synthesized images at multiple grids
by initializing the finite-step MCMC sampling from a minimal 1 x 1 version of
the training image. The synthesized image at each subsequent grid is obtained
by a finite-step MCMC initialized from the synthesized image generated at the
previous coarser grid. After obtaining the synthesized examples, the parameters
of the models at multiple grids are updated separately and simultaneously based
on the differences between synthesized and observed examples. We call this
learning method the multi-grid minimal contrastive divergence. We show that
this method can learn realistic energy-based generative ConvNet models, and it
outperforms the original contrastive divergence (CD) and persistent CD.

 <dc:description>  An autonomous robot should be able to evaluate the affordances that are
offered by a given situation. Here we address this problem by designing a
system that can densely predict affordances given only a single 2D RGB image.
This is achieved with a convolutional neural network (ResNet), which we combine
with refinement modules recently proposed for addressing semantic image
segmentation. We define a novel cost function, which is able to handle
(potentially multiple) affordances of objects and their parts in a pixel-wise
manner even in the case of incomplete data. We perform qualitative as well as
quantitative evaluations with simulated and real data assessing 15 different
affordances. In general, we find that affordances, which are well-enough
represented in the training data, are correctly recognized with a substantial
fraction of correctly assigned pixels. Furthermore, we show that our model
outperforms several baselines. Hence, this method can give clear action
guidelines for a robot.

Compared to traditional models that generate from scratch either left-to-right
or by first sampling a latent sentence vector, our prototype-then-edit model
improves perplexity on language modeling and generates higher quality outputs
according to human evaluation. Furthermore, the model gives rise to a latent
edit vector that captures interpretable semantics such as sentence similarity
and sentence-level analogies.

information retrieval, artificial intelligence, the concept of similarity
measuring has become a very important domain of research. Therefore, in the
current paper, we propose our method of similarity measuring which uses the
Dijkstra algorithm to define and compute the shortest path. Then, we use this
one to compute the semantic distance between two concepts defined in the same
hierarchy of ontology. Afterward, we base on this result to compute the
semantic similarity. Finally, we present an experimental comparison between our
method and other methods of similarity measuring.

 <dc:description>  The security of the Bitcoin system is based on having a large amount of
computational power in the hands of honest miners. Such miners are incentivized
to join the system and validate transactions by the payments issued by the
protocol to anyone who creates blocks. As new bitcoins creation rate decreases
(halving every 4 years), the revenue derived from transaction fees start to
have an increasingly important role. We argue that Bitcoin's current fee market
does not extract revenue well when blocks are not congested. This effect has
implications for the scalability debate: revenue from transaction fees may
decrease if block size is increased.
  The current mechanism is a &quot;pay your bid&quot; auction in which included
transactions pay the amount they suggested. We propose two alternative auction
mechanisms: The Monopolistic Price Mechanism, and the Random Sampling Optimal
Price Mechanism (due to Goldberg et al.). In the monopolistic price mechanism,
the miner chooses the number of accepted transactions in the block, and all
transactions pay exactly the smallest bid included in the block. The mechanism
thus sets the block size dynamically (up to a bound required for fast block
propagation and other security concerns). We show, using analysis and
simulations, that this mechanism extracts revenue better from users, and that
it is nearly incentive compatible: the profit due to strategic bidding relative
to honest biding decreases as the number of bidders grows. Users can then
simply set their bids truthfully to exactly the amount they are willing to pay
to transact, and do not need to utilize fee estimate mechanisms, do not resort
to bid shading and do not need to adjust transaction fees (via replace-by-fee
mechanisms) if the mempool grows.
  We discuss these and other properties of our mechanisms, and explore various
desired properties of fee market mechanisms for crypto-currencies.

 <dc:title>Partial matching width and its application to lower bounds for branching
  programs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Razgon, Igor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new structural graph parameter called \emph{partial matching
width}. For each (sufficiently large) integer $k \geq 1$, we introduce a class
$\mathcal{G}_k$ of graphs of treewidth at most $k$ and max-degree $7$ such that
for each $G \in \mathcal{G}_k$ and each (sufficiently large) $V \subseteq
V(G)$, the partial matching width of $V$ is $\Omega(k \log |V|)$.
  We use the above lower bound to establish a lower bound on the size of
non-deterministic read-once branching programs (NROBPs). In particular, for
each sufficiently large ineteger $k$, we introduce a class ${\bf \Phi}_k$ of
CNFs of (primal graph) treewidth at most $k$ such that for any $\varphi \in
{\bf \Phi}_k$ and any Boolean function $F \subseteq \varphi$ and such that
$|\varphi|/|F| \leq 2^{\sqrt{n}}$ (here the functions are regarded as sets of
assignments on which they are true), a NROBP implementing $F$ is of size
$n^{\Omega(k)}$. This result significantly generalises an earlier result of the
author showing a non-FPT lower bound for NROBPs representing CNFs of bounded
treewidth. Intuitively, we show that not only those CNFs but also their
arbitrary one side approximations with an exponential ratio still attain that
lower bound.
  The non-trivial aspect of this approximation is that due to a small number of
satisfying assignments for $F$, it seems difficult to establish a large
bottleneck: the whole function can `sneak' through a single rectangle
corresponding to just \emph{one} vertex of the purported bottleneck. We
overcome this problem by simultaneously exploring $\sqrt{n}$ bottlenecks and
showing that at least one of them must be large. This approach might be useful
for establishing other lower bounds for branching programs.

 <dc:description>  Since their invention, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a
popular approach for learning to model a distribution of real (unlabeled) data.
Convergence problems during training are overcome by Wasserstein GANs which
minimize the distance between the model and the empirical distribution in terms
of a different metric, but thereby introduce a Lipschitz constraint into the
optimization problem. A simple way to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the
class of functions, which can be modeled by the neural network, is weight
clipping. It was proposed that training can be improved by instead augmenting
the loss by a regularization term that penalizes the deviation of the gradient
of the critic (as a function of the network's input) from one. We present
theoretical arguments why using a weaker regularization term enforcing the
Lipschitz constraint is preferable. These arguments are supported by
experimental results on toy data sets.

 <dc:description>  In machine translation, we often try to collect resources to improve its
performance. However, most of the language pairs don't have enough resources to
train machine translation systems. In this paper, we propose to use synthetic
methods for extending a low resource corpus and apply it to a multi source
neural machine translation model. We showed the improvement of machine
translation performance through the corpus extension using the synthetic
method. Especially, we focused on how to create source sentences that can make
better target sentences, even using synthetic methods. And we found that the
corpus extension could also improve the performance of a multi source neural
machine translation. We showed the corpus extension and multi source model to
be an efficient method for a low-resource language pair. Furthermore, when both
methods were used together, we found better machine translation performance.

 <dc:description>  Initializing all elements of a given array to a specified value is basic
operation that frequently appears in numerous algorithms and programs.
Initializable arrays are abstract arrays that support initialization as well as
reading and writing of any element of the array in constant worst case time. On
the word RAM model, we propose an in-place algorithm which implements an
initializable array of length $N$ with only 1 extra bit, where $w$ is the word
size, and each element of the array can store an individual value of $\ell \in
O(w)$ bits. We also show that the space complexity of our implementation is
optimal. Our algorithm significantly improves upon the previous best algorithm
[Navarro, CSUR 2014] using $N + \ell + o(N)$ extra bits, and removes the
constraint $\ell \ge w$ which is implicitly assumed in [Navarro, CSUR 2014].

 <dc:title>A New Cooperative Framework for Parallel Trajectory-Based Metaheuristics</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose the Parallel Elite Biased framework (PEB framework)
for parallel trajectory-based metaheuristics. In the PEB framework, multiple
search processes are executed concurrently. During the search, each process
sends its best found solutions to its neighboring processes and uses the
received solutions to guide its search. Using the PEB framework, we design a
parallel variant of Guided Local Search (GLS) called PEBGLS. Extensive
experiments have been conducted on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer to study the
performance of PEBGLS on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The experimental
results show that PEBGLS is a competitive parallel metaheuristic for the TSP,
which confirms that the PEB framework is useful for designing parallel
trajectory-based metaheuristics.

 <dc:description>  The stabilizer ZX-calculus is a rigorous graphical language for reasoning
about quantum mechanics. The language is sound and complete: one can transform
a stabilizer ZX-diagram into another one if and only if these two diagrams
represent the same quantum evolution or quantum state. We show that the
stabilizer ZX-calculus can be simplified, removing unnecessary equations while
keeping only the essential axioms which potentially capture fundamental
structures of quantum mechanics. We thus give a significantly smaller set of
axioms and prove that meta-rules like `only the topology matters', `colour
symmetry' and `upside-down symmetry', which were considered as axioms in
previous versions of the language, can in fact be derived. In particular, we
show that most of the remaining rules of the language are necessary, however
leaving as an open question the necessity of two rules. These include,
surprisingly, the bialgebra rule, which is an axiomatisation of
complementarity, the cornerstone of the ZX-calculus. Furthermore, we show that
a weaker ambient category -- a braided autonomous category instead of the usual
compact closed category -- is sufficient to recover the topology meta rule.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a reinforcing method that refines the output layers of
existing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language models. We refer to our
proposed method as Input-to-Output Gate (IOG). IOG has an extremely simple
structure, and thus, can be easily combined with any RNN language models. Our
experiments on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets demonstrate that IOG
consistently boosts the performance of several different types of current

 <dc:title>On the Benefits of QoS-Differentiated Posted Pricing in Cloud Computing:
  An Analytical Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Xiaohu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>De Pellegrini, Francesco</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When designing service and pricing models, an important goal is to both
enable user-friendly and cost-effective access to services and achieve a high
system's utilization. Such design could attract more users and improve the
revenue. QoS-differentiated pricing represents an important direction to
address the above design goal as illustrated by numerous studies in other
fields such as Internet. In this paper, we propose the first analytical model
of QoS-differentiated posted pricing in the context of cloud computing. In this
model, a cloud provider offers a stable set of SLAs and their prices are also
posted to users in advance, where higher QoSs are charged higher prices. As a
result, users can directly choose their preferred SLA with a certain price, in
contrast to many existing dynamic pricing mechanisms with the uncertain prices
and availability of cloud resource.
  In order to maximizing the revenue of a cloud provider, the questions that
arise here include: (1) setting the prices properly to direct users to the
right SLAs best fitting their need, and, (2) given a fixed cloud capacity,
determining how many servers should be assigned to each SLA and which users and
how many of their jobs are admitted to be served. To this respect, we propose
optimal schemes to jointly determine SLA-based prices and perform capacity
planning. In spite of the usability of such a pricing model, simulations also
show that it could improve the utilization of computing resource by up to
eleven-fold increase, compared with the standard pay-as-you-go pricing model;
furthermore, the revenue of a cloud provider could be improved by up to a
five-fold increase.

 <dc:description>  The expansion of the electronic commerce, together with an increasing
confidence of customers in electronic payments, makes of fraud detection a
critical factor. Detecting frauds in (nearly) real time setting demands the
design and the implementation of scalable learning techniques able to ingest
and analyse massive amounts of streaming data. Recent advances in analytics and
the availability of open source solutions for Big Data storage and processing
open new perspectives to the fraud detection field. In this paper we present a
SCAlable Real-time Fraud Finder (SCARFF) which integrates Big Data tools
(Kafka, Spark and Cassandra) with a machine learning approach which deals with
imbalance, nonstationarity and feedback latency. Experimental results on a
massive dataset of real credit card transactions show that this framework is
scalable, efficient and accurate over a big stream of transactions.

 <dc:description>  Digital human identity management, can now be seen as a social necessity, as
it is essentially required in almost every public sector such as, financial
inclusions, security, banking, social networking e.t.c. Hence, in today's
rampantly emerging world with so many adversarial entities, relying on a single
biometric trait is being too optimistic. In this paper, we have proposed a
novel end-to-end, Unified Biometric ROI Segmentation Network (UBSegNet), for
extracting region of interest from five different biometric traits viz. face,
iris, palm, knuckle and 4-slap fingerprint. The architecture of the proposed
UBSegNet consists of two stages: (i) Trait classification and (ii) Trait
localization. For these stages, we have used a state of the art region based
convolutional neural network (RCNN), comprising of three major parts namely
convolutional layers, region proposal network (RPN) along with classification
and regression heads. The model has been evaluated over various huge publicly
available biometric databases. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
unified architecture proposed, segmenting multiple biometric traits. It has
been tested over around 5000 * 5 = 25,000 images (5000 images per trait) and
produces very good results. Our work on unified biometric segmentation, opens
up the vast opportunities in the field of multiple biometric traits based
authentication systems.

 <dc:description>  The majority of works in distributed storage networks assume a simple network
model with a collection of identical storage nodes with the same communication
cost between the nodes. In this paper, we consider a realistic multi-rack
distributed data storage network and present a code design framework for this
model. Considering the cheaper data transmission within the racks, our code
construction method is able to locally repair the nodes failure within the same
rack by using only the survived nodes in the same rack. However, in the case of
severe failure patterns when the information content of the survived nodes is
not sufficient to repair the failures, other racks will participate in the
repair process. By employing the criteria of our multi-rack storage code, we
establish a linear programming bound on the size of the code in order to
maximize the code rate.

 <dc:description>  The uncertainty and variability of underwater environment propose the request
to control underwater robots in real time and dynamically, especially in the
scenarios where human and robots need to work collaboratively in the field.
However, the underwater environment imposes harsh restrictions on the
application of typical control and communication methods. Considering that
gestures are a natural and efficient interactive way for human, we, utilizing
convolution neural network, implement a real-time gesture-based recognition
system, who can recognize 50 kinds of gestures from images captured by one
normal monocular camera, and apply this recognition system in human and
underwater robot interaction. We design A Flexible and Extendable Interaction
Scheme (AFEIS) through which underwater robots can be programmed in situ
underwater by human operators using customized gesture-based sign language.
This paper elaborates the design of gesture recognition system and AFEIS, and
presents our field trial results when applying this system and scheme on

 <dc:title>Computing Tree Decompositions with FlowCutter: PACE 2017 Submission</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Strasser, Ben</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe the algorithm behind our PACE 2017 submission to the heuristic
tree decomposition computation track. It was the only competitor to solve all
instances and won a tight second place. The algorithm was originally developed
in the context of accelerating shortest path computation on road graphs using
multilevel partitions. We illustrate how this seemingly unrelated field fits
into tree decomposition and parameterized complexity theory.

 <dc:description>  Cross Technology Interference (CTI) is a prevalent phenomenon in the 2.4 GHz
unlicensed spectrum causing packet losses and increased channel contention. In
particular, WiFi interference is a severe problem for low-power wireless
networks as its presence causes a significant degradation of the overall
performance. In this paper, we propose a proactive approach based on WiFi
interference modeling for accurately predicting transmission opportunities for
low-power wireless networks. We leverage statistical analysis of real-world
WiFi traces to learn aggregated traffic characteristics in terms of
Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) that, once captured into a specific 2nd order Markov
Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP(2)) model, enable accurate estimation of
interference. We further use a hidden Markov model (HMM) for channel occupancy
prediction. We evaluated the performance of i) the MMPP(2) traffic model w.r.t.
real-world traces and an existing Pareto model for accurately characterizing
the WiFi traffic and, ii) compared the HMM based white space prediction to
random channel access. We report encouraging results for using interference
modeling for white space prediction.

 <dc:description>  This report documents the program and the outcomes of GI-Dagstuhl Seminar
16394 &quot;Software Performance Engineering in the DevOps World&quot;.
  The seminar addressed the problem of performance-aware DevOps. Both, DevOps
and performance engineering have been growing trends over the past one to two
years, in no small part due to the rise in importance of identifying
performance anomalies in the operations (Ops) of cloud and big data systems and
feeding these back to the development (Dev). However, so far, the research
community has treated software engineering, performance engineering, and cloud
computing mostly as individual research areas. We aimed to identify
cross-community collaboration, and to set the path for long-lasting
collaborations towards performance-aware DevOps.
  The main goal of the seminar was to bring together young researchers (PhD
students in a later stage of their PhD, as well as PostDocs or Junior
Professors) in the areas of (i) software engineering, (ii) performance
engineering, and (iii) cloud computing and big data to present their current
research projects, to exchange experience and expertise, to discuss research
challenges, and to develop ideas for future collaborations.

 <dc:description>  Medical Mixed Reality helps surgeons to contextualize intraoperative data
with video of the surgical scene. Nonetheless, the surgical scene and
anatomical target are often occluded by surgical instruments and surgeon hands.
In this paper and to our knowledge, we propose a multi-layer visualization in
Medical Mixed Reality solution which subtly improves a surgeon's visualization
by making transparent the occluding objects. As an example scenario, we use an
augmented reality C-arm fluoroscope device. A video image is created using a
volumetric-based image synthesization technique and stereo-RGBD cameras mounted
on the C-arm. From this synthesized view, the background which is occluded by
the surgical instruments and surgeon hands is recovered by modifying the
volumetric-based image synthesization technique. The occluding objects can,
therefore, become transparent over the surgical scene. Experimentation with
different augmented reality scenarios yield results demonstrating that the
background of the surgical scenes can be recovered with accuracy between
45%-99%. In conclusion, we presented a solution that a Mixed Reality solution
for medicine, providing transparency to objects occluding the surgical scene.
This work is also the first application of volumetric field for Diminished
Reality/ Mixed Reality.

 <dc:title>Asymptotically Optimal Monte Carlo Sparse Multivariate Polynomial
  Interpolation Algorithms of Straight-Line Program</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Qiao-Long</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gao, Xiao-Shan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose new deterministic interpolation algorithms and
Monte Carlo interpolation algorithms for sparse multivariate polynomials
represented by straight-line programs. Let f be an n-variate polynomial with a
degree bound D and and term bound T. Our deterministic algorithms have better
complexities than existing deterministic interpolation algorithms in most
cases. Our Monte Carlo interpolation algorithms are asymptotically optimal in
the sense that their bit complexities are linear in nT and cubic in log D, when
the coefficients of the polynomials are from a finite field. Since f has size
nT, our algorithm implies that interpolating a straight-line program polynomial
f is as easy as reading f, if the log D factor in the complexities is not
considered. Based on the Monte Carlo interpolation algorithm, we give an
asymptotically optimal algorithm for the multiplication of several multivariate
polynomials, whose complexity is softly linear in the input size plus the
output size, if the logarithm factors are ignored.

 <dc:title>User and Developer Interaction with Editable and Readable Ontologies</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blfgeh, Aisha</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The process of building ontologies is a difficult task that involves
collaboration between ontology developers and domain experts and requires an
ongoing interaction between them. This collaboration is made more difficult,
because they tend to use different tool sets, which can hamper this
interaction. In this paper, we propose to decrease this distance between domain
experts and ontology developers by creating more readable forms of ontologies,
and further to enable editing in normal office environments. Building on a
programmatic ontology development environment, such as Tawny-OWL, we are now
able to generate these readable/editable from the raw ontological source and
its embedded comments. We have this translation to HTML for reading; this
environment provides rich hyperlinking as well as active features such as
hiding the source code in favour of comments. We are now working on translation
to a Word document that also enables editing. Taken together this should
provide a significant new route for collaboration between the ontologist and
domain specialist.

 <dc:description>  We show that all known classical adversary lower bounds on randomized query
complexity are equivalent for total functions, and are equal to the fractional
block sensitivity $\text{fbs}(f)$. That includes the Kolmogorov complexity
bound of Laplante and Magniez and the earlier relational adversary bound of
Aaronson. For partial functions, we show unbounded separations between
$\text{fbs}(f)$ and other adversary bounds, as well as between the relational
and Kolmogorov complexity bounds.
  We also show that, for partial functions, fractional block sensitivity cannot
give lower bounds larger than $\sqrt{n \cdot \text{bs}(f)}$, where $n$ is the
number of variables and $\text{bs}(f)$ is the block sensitivity. Then we
exhibit a partial function $f$ that matches this upper bound, $\text{fbs}(f) =
\Omega(\sqrt{n \cdot \text{bs}(f)})$.

 <dc:description>  Arrays of integers are often compressed in search engines. Though there are
many ways to compress integers, we are interested in the popular byte-oriented
integer compression techniques (e.g., VByte or Google's Varint-GB). They are
appealing due to their simplicity and engineering convenience. Amazon's
varint-G8IU is one of the fastest byte-oriented compression technique published
so far. It makes judicious use of the powerful single-instruction-multiple-data
(SIMD) instructions available in commodity processors. To surpass varint-G8IU,
we present Stream VByte, a novel byte-oriented compression technique that
separates the control stream from the encoded data. Like varint-G8IU, Stream
VByte is well suited for SIMD instructions. We show that Stream VByte decoding
can be up to twice as fast as varint-G8IU decoding over real data sets. In this
sense, Stream VByte establishes new speed records for byte-oriented integer
compression, at times exceeding the speed of the memcpy function. On a 3.4GHz
Haswell processor, it decodes more than 4 billion differentially-coded integers
per second from RAM to L1 cache.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of deciding the winner of reachability
switching games. These games provide deterministic analogues of Markovian
systems. We study zero-, one-, and two-player variants of these games. We show
that the zero-player case is NL-hard, the one-player case is NP-complete, and
that the two-player case is PSPACE-hard and in EXPTIME. In the one- and
two-player cases, the problem of determining the winner of a switching game
turns out to be much harder than the problem of determining the winner of a
Markovian game. We also study the structure of winning strategies in these
games, and in particular we show that both players in a two-player reachability
switching game require exponential memory.

 <dc:description>  This paper provides an overview of evolutionary robotics techniques applied
to on-line distributed evolution for robot collectives -- namely, embodied
evolution. It provides a definition of embodied evolution as well as a thorough
description of the underlying concepts and mechanisms. The paper also presents
a comprehensive summary of research published in the field since its inception
(1999-2017), providing various perspectives to identify the major trends. In
particular, we identify a shift from considering embodied evolution as a
parallel search method within small robot collectives (fewer than 10 robots) to
embodied evolution as an on-line distributed learning method for designing
collective behaviours in swarm-like collectives. The paper concludes with a
discussion of applications and open questions, providing a milestone for past
and an inspiration for future research.

 <dc:title>Networks of Music Groups as Success Predictors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  More than 4,600 non-academic music groups emerged in the USSR and post-Soviet
independent nations in 1960--2015, performing in 275 genres. Some of the groups
became legends and survived for decades, while others vanished and are known
now only to select music history scholars. We built a network of the groups
based on sharing at least one performer. We discovered that major network
measures serve as reasonably accurate predictors of the groups' success. The
proposed network-based success exploration and prediction methods are
transferable to other areas of arts and humanities that have medium- or
long-term team-based collaborations.

synchronization. Then, each agent is able to balance its synchronization error
versus its consumed input-energy. In this regard, a local, time-invariant
optimal control is obtained by means of recently developed methods for
infinite-time linear quadratic tracking. Extending these methods, we present a
parametric optimization problem to obtain an optimal control that guarantees
given error-bounds on the synchronization error. In addition, we are able to
relax standard assumptions and our approach applies even for agents which
usually cannot synchronize exactly, e.g. agents with less inputs than outputs.
All these aspects are demonstrated by an illustrative simulation example for
which a detailed analysis is provided.

 <dc:description>  We present a physically-inspired model and efficient algorithm to infer
hierarchical rankings of nodes in directed networks. Unlike other methods such
as minimum violation ranking, it assigns real-valued ranks to nodes rather than
simply ordinal ranks, and it formalizes the assumption that interactions are
more likely to occur between individuals with similar ranks. It provides a
natural framework for a statistical significance test for distinguishing when
the inferred hierarchy is due to the network topology or is instead due to
random chance, and it can be used to perform inference tasks such as predicting
the existence or direction of edges. The ranking is inferred by solving a
linear system of equations, which is sparse if the network is; thus the
resulting algorithm is extremely efficient and scalable. We illustrate these
findings by analyzing real and synthetic data, including datasets from animal
behavior, faculty hiring, and social support networks, and show that our method
outperforms others, in both speed and accuracy, in recovering the underlying
ranks and predicting edge directions.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic Pushdown Networks (DPNs) are a natural model for multithreaded
programs with (recursive) procedure calls and thread creation. On the other
hand, CARET is a temporal logic that allows to write linear temporal formulas
while taking into account the matching between calls and returns. We consider
in this paper the model-checking problem of DPNs against CARET formulas. We
show that this problem can be effectively solved by a reduction to the
emptiness problem of B\&quot;uchi Dynamic Pushdown Systems. We then show that CARET
model checking is also decidable for DPNs communicating with locks. Our results
can, in particular, be used for the detection of concurrent malware.

 <dc:title>Programming from Metaphorisms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Oliveira, J. N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a study of the metaphorism pattern of relational
specification, showing how it can be refined into recursive programs.
Metaphorisms express input-output relationships which preserve relevant
information while at the same time some intended optimization takes place. Text
processing, sorting, representation changers, etc., are examples of
metaphorisms. The kind of metaphorism refinement studied in this paper is a
strategy known as change of virtual data structure. By framing metaphorisms in
the class of (inductive) regular relations, sufficient conditions are given for
such implementations to be calculated using relation algebra. The strategy is
illustrated with examples including the derivation of the quicksort and
mergesort algorithms, showing what they have in common and what makes them
different from the very start of development.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is fabricated on a riderless
bicycle. The Fuzzy Inference System is based on a rule base inherited from
human experience of bicycle riding. The steady turning motion and roll-angle
tracking controls for the riderless bicycle were achieved by using fuzzy

circuits were employed to introduce new prototype autonomous bicycle.
Effectiveness of the control scheme was proved by experimental tests and
stabilization and roll-angle tracking of the real bicycle was illustrated by

 <dc:description>  Auto-encoding is an important task which is typically realized by deep neural
networks (DNNs) such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this paper, we
propose EncoderForest (abbrv. eForest), the first tree ensemble based
auto-encoder. We present a procedure for enabling forests to do backward
reconstruction by utilizing the equivalent classes defined by decision paths of
the trees, and demonstrate its usage in both supervised and unsupervised
setting. Experiments show that, compared with DNN autoencoders, eForest is able
to obtain lower reconstruction error with fast training speed, while the model
itself is reusable and damage-tolerable.

 <dc:description>  Delay is omnipresent in modern control systems, which can prompt oscillations
and may cause deterioration of control performance, invalidate both stability
and safety properties. This implies that safety or stability certificates
obtained on idealized, delay-free models of systems prone to delayed coupling
may be erratic, and further the incorrectness of the executable code generated
from these models. However, automated methods for system verification and code
generation that ought to address models of system dynamics reflecting delays
have not been paid enough attention yet in the computer science community. In
our previous work, on one hand, we investigated the verification of delay
dynamical and hybrid systems; on the other hand, we also addressed how to
synthesize SystemC code from a verified hybrid system modelled by Hybrid CSP
(HCSP) without delay. In this paper, we give a first attempt to synthesize
SystemC code from a verified delay hybrid system modelled by Delay HCSP
(dHCSP), which is an extension of HCSP by replacing ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) with delay differential equations (DDEs). We implement a tool
to support the automatic translation from dHCSP to SystemC.

 <dc:description>  It is often recommended that identifiers for ontology terms should be
semantics-free or meaningless. In practice, ontology developers tend to use
numeric identifiers, starting at 1 and working upwards. In this paper we
present a critique of current ontology semantics-free identifiers;
monotonically increasing numbers have a number of significant usability flaws
which make them unsuitable as a default option, and we present a series of
alternatives. We have provide an implementation of these alternatives which can
be freely combined.

 <dc:description>  Automatic testing is a widely adopted technique for improving software
quality. Software developers add, remove and update test methods and test
classes as part of the software development process as well as during the
evolution phase, following the initial release. In this work we conduct a large
scale study of 61 popular open source projects and report the relationships we
have established between test maintenance, production code maintenance, and
semantic changes (e.g, statement added, method removed, etc.). performed in
developers' commits.
  We build predictive models, and show that the number of tests in a software
project can be well predicted by employing code maintenance profiles (i.e., how
many commits were performed in each of the maintenance activities: corrective,
perfective, adaptive). Our findings also reveal that more often than not,
developers perform code fixes without performing complementary test maintenance
in the same commit (e.g., update an existing test or add a new one). When
developers do perform test maintenance, it is likely to be affected by the
semantic changes they perform as part of their commit.
  Our work is based on studying 61 popular open source projects, comprised of
over 240,000 commits consisting of over 16,000,000 semantic change type
instances, performed by over 4,000 software engineers.

 <dc:title>Switching and Information Exchange in Compressed Estimation of Coupled

 <dc:description>  Compressed Estimation approaches, such as the Generalised Compressed Kalman
Filter (GCKF), reduce the computational cost and complexity of high dimensional
and high frequency data assimilation problems; usually without sacrificing
optimality. Configured using adequate cores, such as the Unscented Kalman
Filter (UKF), the GCKF could also treat certain non-linear cases. However, the
application of a compressed estimation process is limited to a class of
problems which inherently allow the estimation process to be divided, at
certain intervals of time, in a subset of lower dimensional problems. This
limitation prohibits applying the compressing techniques for estimating densely
coupled high dimensional processes. However, those limitations can be overcome
by applying proper techniques. In this paper, the concept of subsystem
switching, and information exchange architecture, namely Exploiting Local
Statistical Dependency (ELSD), has been derived and explored, for allowing
compressed estimators to mimic optimal full Gaussian estimators. The
performances of the methods have been verified through its application in
solving usual types of linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equations
(SPDEs). The computational advantages of using the proposed techniques have
also been highlighted with recommendation of its usage over the full filter
when dealing with high dimensional and high frequency data assimilation.

 <dc:description>  For 5G it will be important to leverage the available millimeter wave
spectrum. To achieve an approximately omni- directional coverage with a similar
effective antenna aperture compared to state of the art cellular systems, an
antenna array is required at both the mobile and basestation. Due to the large
bandwidth and inefficient amplifiers available in CMOS for mmWave, the analog
front-end of the receiver with a large number of antennas becomes especially
power hungry. Two main solutions exist to reduce the power consumption: hybrid
beam forming and digital beam forming with low resolution Analog to Digital
Converters (ADCs). In this work we compare the spectral and energy efficiency
of both systems under practical system constraints. We consider the effects of
channel estimation, transmitter impairments and multiple simultaneous users.
Our power consumption model considers components reported in literature at 60
GHz. In contrast to many other works we also consider the correlation of the
quantization error, and generalize the modeling of it to non-uniform quantizers
and different quantizers at each antenna. The result shows that as the SNR gets
larger the ADC resolution achieving the optimal energy efficiency gets also
larger. The energy efficiency peaks for 5 bit resolution at high SNR, since due
to other limiting factors the achievable rate almost saturates at this
resolution. We also show that in the multi-user scenario digital beamforming is
in any case more energy efficient than hybrid beamforming. In addition we show
that if different ADC resolutions are used we can achieve any desired
trade-offs between power consumption and rate close to those achieved with only
one ADC resolution.

higher genus. In 2001, Schroeder conjectured that if a graph has genus $g,$
then its cop number is at most $g + 3.$ While Schroeder's bound is known to
hold for planar and toroidal graphs, the case for graphs with higher genus
remains open. We consider the capture time of graphs on surfaces and examine
results for embeddings of graphs on non-orientable surfaces. We present a
conjecture by the second author, and in addition, we survey results for the
lazy cop number, directed graphs, and Zombies and Survivors.

 <dc:title>Exact MAP inference in general higher-order graphical models using
  linear programming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the problem of exact MAP inference in general
higher-order graphical models by means of a traditional linear programming
relaxation approach. In fact, the proof that we have developed in this paper is
a rather simple algebraic proof being made straightforward, above all, by the
introduction of two novel algebraic tools. Indeed, on the one hand, we
introduce the notion of delta-distribution which merely stands for the
difference of two arbitrary probability distributions, and which mainly serves
to alleviate the sign constraint inherent to a traditional probability
distribution. On the other hand, we develop an approximation framework of
general discrete functions by means of an orthogonal projection expressing in
terms of linear combinations of function margins with respect to a given
collection of point subsets, though, we rather exploit the latter approach for
the purpose of modeling locally consistent sets of discrete functions from a
global perspective. After that, as a first step, we develop from scratch the
expectation optimization framework which is nothing else than a reformulation,
on stochastic grounds, of the convex-hull approach, as a second step, we
develop the traditional LP relaxation of such an expectation optimization
approach, and we show that it enables to solve the MAP inference problem in
graphical models under rather general assumptions. Last but not least, we
describe an algorithm which allows to compute an exact MAP solution from a
perhaps fractional optimal (probability) solution of the proposed LP
relaxation.

 <dc:description>  The OpenAI Gym provides researchers and enthusiasts with simple to use
environments for reinforcement learning. Even the simplest environment have a
level of complexity that can obfuscate the inner workings of RL approaches and
make debugging difficult. This whitepaper describes a Python framework that
makes it very easy to create simple Markov-Decision-Process environments
programmatically by specifying state transitions and rewards of deterministic
and non-deterministic MDPs in a domain-specific language in Python. It then
presents results and visualizations created with this MDP framework.

 <dc:description>  Sub-cortical brain structure segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI)
has attracted the interest of the research community for a long time because
morphological changes in these structures are related to different
neurodegenerative disorders. However, manual segmentation of these structures
can be tedious and prone to variability, highlighting the need for robust
automated segmentation methods. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional
neural network based approach for accurate segmentation of the sub-cortical
brain structures that combines both convolutional and prior spatial features
for improving the segmentation accuracy. In order to increase the accuracy of
the automated segmentation, we propose to train the network using a restricted
sample selection to force the network to learn the most difficult parts of the
structures. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method on the public
MICCAI 2012 challenge and IBSR 18 datasets, comparing it with different
available state-of-the-art methods and other recently proposed deep learning
approaches. On the MICCAI 2012 dataset, our method shows an excellent
performance comparable to the best challenge participant strategy, while
performing significantly better than state-of-the-art techniques such as
FreeSurfer and FIRST. On the IBSR 18 dataset, our method also exhibits a
significant increase in the performance with respect to not only FreeSurfer and
FIRST, but also comparable or better results than other recent deep learning
approaches. Moreover, our experiments show that both the addition of the
spatial priors and the restricted sampling strategy have a significant effect
on the accuracy of the proposed method. In order to encourage the
reproducibility and the use of the proposed method, a public version of our
approach is available to download for the neuroimaging community.

 <dc:description>  An electroencephalography (EEG) based brain activity recognition is a
fundamental field of study for a number of significant applications such as
intention prediction, appliance control, and neurological disease diagnosis in
smart home and smart healthcare domains. Existing techniques mostly focus on
binary brain activity recognition for a single person, which limits their
deployment in wider and complex practical scenarios. Therefore, multi-person
and multi-class brain activity recognition has obtained popularity recently.
Another challenge faced by brain activity recognition is the low recognition
accuracy due to the massive noises and the low signal-to-noise ratio in EEG
signals. Moreover, the feature engineering in EEG processing is time-consuming
and highly re- lies on the expert experience. In this paper, we attempt to
solve the above challenges by proposing an approach which has better EEG
interpretation ability via raw Electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis for
multi-person and multi-class brain activity recognition. Specifically, we
analyze inter-class and inter-person EEG signal characteristics, based on which
to capture the discrepancy of inter-class EEG data. Then, we adopt an
Autoencoder layer to automatically refine the raw EEG signals by eliminating
various artifacts. We evaluate our approach on both a public and a local EEG
datasets and conduct extensive experiments to explore the effect of several
factors (such as normalization methods, training data size, and Autoencoder
hidden neuron size) on the recognition results. The experimental results show
that our approach achieves a high accuracy comparing to competitive
state-of-the-art methods, indicating its potential in promoting future research
on multi-person EEG recognition.

 <dc:description>  We describe some bulk statistics of historical initial line outages and the
implications for forming contingency lists and understanding which initial
outages are likely to lead to further cascading. We use historical outage data
to estimate the effect of weather on cascading via cause codes and via NOAA
storm data. Bad weather significantly increases outage rates and interacts with
cascading effects, and should be accounted for in cascading models and
simulations. We suggest how weather effects can be incorporated into the OPA
cascading simulation and validated. There are very good prospects for improving
data processing and models for the bulk statistics of historical outage data so
that cascading can be better understood and quantified.

 <dc:description>  Future practical implementation of secure quantum communication technology in
a multiuser network environment would require automatic monitoring of the
optical link condition and quantum system parameters, along with adjusting them
in real time according to protocol restrictions. We demonstrate how
software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm can be used for addressing this
problem on the example of a subcarrier wave quantum communication system, which
is promising for network applications. We propose a novel approach to dynamic
quantum network routing and communication security based on SDN OpenFlow
protocol. SDN-operated dynamic switching between different data encryption
methods, quantum or classic, will enable to organize virtual encoding channels
with an ability to set the required Quality of Service level for
security/bandwidth. These developments will further increase the feasibility of
quantum technologies from the network perspective and contribute to bringing
them to industrial scale.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of distributed information bottleneck, in which multiple
encoders separately compress their observations in a manner such that,
collectively, the compressed signals preserve as much information as possible
about another signal. The model generalizes Tishby's centralized information
bottleneck method to the setting of multiple distributed encoders. We establish
single-letter characterizations of the information-rate region of this problem
for both i) a class of discrete memoryless sources and ii) memoryless vector
Gaussian sources. Furthermore, assuming a sum constraint on rate or complexity,
for both models we develop Blahut-Arimoto type iterative algorithms that allow
to compute optimal information-rate trade-offs, by iterating over a set of
self-consistent equations.

 <dc:title>Beyond opening up the black box: Investigating the role of algorithmic

 <dc:description>  Scholars and practitioners across domains are increasingly concerned with
algorithmic transparency and opacity, interrogating the values and assumptions
embedded in automated, black-boxed systems, particularly in user-generated
content platforms. I report from an ethnography of infrastructure in Wikipedia
to discuss an often understudied aspect of this topic: the local, contextual,
learned expertise involved in participating in a highly automated
social-technical environment. Today, the organizational culture of Wikipedia is
deeply intertwined with various data-driven algorithmic systems, which
Wikipedians rely on to help manage and govern the &quot;anyone can edit&quot;
encyclopedia at a massive scale. These bots, scripts, tools, plugins, and
dashboards make Wikipedia more efficient for those who know how to work with
them, but like all organizational culture, newcomers must learn them if they
want to fully participate. I illustrate how cultural and organizational
expertise is enacted around algorithmic agents by discussing two
autoethnographic vignettes, which relate my personal experience as a veteran in
Wikipedia. I present thick descriptions of how governance and gatekeeping
practices are articulated through and in alignment with these automated
infrastructures. Over the past 15 years, Wikipedian veterans and administrators
have made specific decisions to support administrative and editorial workflows
with automation in particular ways and not others. I use these cases of
Wikipedia's bot-supported bureaucracy to discuss several issues in the fields
of critical algorithms studies, critical data studies, and fairness,
accountability, and transparency in machine learning -- most principally
arguing that scholarship and practice must go beyond trying to &quot;open up the
black box&quot; of such systems and also examine sociocultural processes like
newcomer socialization.

 <dc:description>  How can we analyze enormous networks including the Web and social networks
which have hundreds of billions of nodes and edges? Network analyses have been
conducted by various graph mining methods including shortest path computation,
PageRank, connected component computation, random walk with restart, etc. These
graph mining methods can be expressed as generalized matrix-vector
multiplication which consists of few operations inspired by typical
matrix-vector multiplication. Recently, several graph processing systems based
on matrix-vector multiplication or their own primitives have been proposed to
deal with large graphs; however, they all have failed on Web-scale graphs due
to insufficient memory space or the lack of consideration for I/O costs. In
this paper, we propose PMV (Pre-partitioned generalized Matrix-Vector
multiplication), a scalable distributed graph mining method based on
generalized matrix-vector multiplication on distributed systems. PMV
significantly decreases the communication cost, which is the main bottleneck of
distributed systems, by partitioning the input graph in advance and judiciously
applying execution strategies based on the density of the pre-partitioned
sub-matrices. Experiments show that PMV succeeds in processing up to 16x larger
graphs than existing distributed memory-based graph mining methods, and
requires 9x less time than previous disk-based graph mining methods by reducing
I/O costs significantly.

 <dc:description>  In classical Cluster Editing we seek to transform a given graph into a
disjoint union of cliques, called a cluster graph, using the fewest number of
edge modifications (deletions or additions). Motivated by recent applications,
we propose and study Cluster Editing in multi-layer graphs. A multi-layer graph
consists of a set of simple graphs, called layers, that all have the same
vertex set. In Multi-Layer Cluster Editing we aim to transform all layers into
cluster graphs that differ only slightly. More specifically, we allow to mark
at most d vertices and to transform each layer of the multi-layer graph into a
cluster graph with at most k edge modifications per layer such that, if we
remove the marked vertices, we obtain the same cluster graph in all layers.
Multi-Layer Cluster Editing is NP-hard and we analyze its parameterized
complexity. We focus on the natural parameters &quot;max. number d of marked
vertices&quot;, &quot;max. number k of edge modifications per layer&quot;, &quot;number n of
vertices&quot;, and &quot;number l of layers&quot;. We fully explore the parameterized
computational complexity landscape for those parameters and their combinations.
Our main results are that Multi-Layer Cluster Editing is FPT with respect to
the parameter combination (d, k) and that it is para-NP-hard for all smaller or
incomparable parameter combinations. Furthermore, we give a polynomial kernel
with respect to the parameter combination (d, k, l) and show that for all
smaller or incomparable parameter combinations, the problem does not admit a
polynomial kernel unless NP is in coNP/poly.

 <dc:description>  Ultra-dense network (UDN) is a promising technology to further evolve
wireless networks and meet the diverse performance requirements of 5G networks.
With abundant access points, each with communication, computation and storage
resources, UDN brings unprecedented benefits, including significant improvement
in network spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, greatly reduced latency
to enable novel mobile applications, and the capability of providing massive
access for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, such great promises come
with formidable research challenges. To design and operate such complex
networks with various types of resources, efficient and innovative
methodologies will be needed. This motivates the recent introduction of highly
structured and generalizable models for network optimization. In this article,
we present some recently proposed large-scale sparse and low-rank frameworks
for optimizing UDNs, supported by various motivating applications. A special
attention is paid on algorithmic approaches to deal with nonconvex objective
functions and constraints, as well as computational scalability.

 <dc:description>  Region-based image retrieval (RBIR) technique is revisited. In early attempts
at RBIR in the late 90s, researchers found many ways to specify region-based
queries and spatial relationships; however, the way to characterize the
regions, such as by using color histograms, were very poor at that time. Here,
we revisit RBIR by incorporating semantic specification of objects and
intuitive specification of spatial relationships. Our contributions are the
following. First, to support multiple aspects of semantic object specification
(category, instance, and attribute), we propose a multitask CNN feature that
allows us to use deep learning technique and to jointly handle multi-aspect
object specification. Second, to help users specify spatial relationships among
objects in an intuitive way, we propose recommendation techniques of spatial
relationships. In particular, by mining the search results, a system can
recommend feasible spatial relationships among the objects. The system also can
recommend likely spatial relationships by assigned object category names based
on language prior. Moreover, object-level inverted indexing supports very fast
shortlist generation, and re-ranking based on spatial constraints provides
users with instant RBIR experiences.

 <dc:description>  This paper establishes a general equivalence between discrete choice and
rational inattention models. Matejka and McKay (2015, AER) showed that when
information costs are modelled using the Shannon entropy function, the
resulting choice probabilities in the rational inattention model take the
multinomial logit form. By exploiting convex-analytic properties of the
discrete choice model, we show that when information costs are modelled using a
class of generalized entropy functions, the choice probabilities in any
rational inattention model are observationally equivalent to some additive
random utility discrete choice model and vice versa. Thus any additive random
utility model can be given an interpretation in terms of boundedly rational
behavior. This includes empirically relevant specifications such as the probit
and nested logit models.

 <dc:description>  We present a new approach to the design of deep networks for natural language
processing (NLP), based on the general technique of Tensor Product
Representations (TPRs) for encoding and processing symbol structures in
distributed neural networks. A network architecture --- the Tensor Product
Generation Network (TPGN) --- is proposed which is capable in principle of
carrying out TPR computation, but which uses unconstrained deep learning to
design its internal representations. Instantiated in a model for image-caption
generation, TPGN outperforms LSTM baselines when evaluated on the COCO dataset.
The TPR-capable structure enables interpretation of internal representations
and operations, which prove to contain considerable grammatical content. Our
caption-generation model can be interpreted as generating sequences of
grammatical categories and retrieving words by their categories from a plan
encoded as a distributed representation.

 <dc:description>  If someone is looking for a certain publication in the field of computer
science, the searching person is likely to use the DBLP to find the desired
publication. The DBLP data set is continuously extended with new publications,
or rather their metadata, for example the names of involved authors, the title
and the publication date. While the size of the data set is already remarkable,
specific areas can still be improved. The DBLP offers a huge collection of
English papers because most papers concerning computer science are published in
English. Nevertheless, there are official publications in other languages which
are supposed to be added to the data set. One kind of these are Japanese
papers. This diploma thesis will show a way to automatically process
publication lists of Japanese papers and to make them ready for an import into
the DBLP data set. Especially important are the problems along the way of
processing, such as transcription handling and Personal Name Matching with
Japanese names.

 <dc:title>Joint Detection and Recounting of Abnormal Events by Learning Deep
  Generic Knowledge</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of joint detection and recounting of
abnormal events in videos. Recounting of abnormal events, i.e., explaining why
they are judged to be abnormal, is an unexplored but critical task in video
surveillance, because it helps human observers quickly judge if they are false
alarms or not. To describe the events in the human-understandable form for
event recounting, learning generic knowledge about visual concepts (e.g.,
object and action) is crucial. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have achieved promising results in learning such concepts, it remains an open
question as to how to effectively use CNNs for abnormal event detection, mainly
due to the environment-dependent nature of the anomaly detection. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by integrating a generic CNN model and
environment-dependent anomaly detectors. Our approach first learns CNN with
multiple visual tasks to exploit semantic information that is useful for
detecting and recounting abnormal events. By appropriately plugging the model
into anomaly detectors, we can detect and recount abnormal events while taking
advantage of the discriminative power of CNNs. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art on Avenue and UCSD Ped2 benchmarks for abnormal event
detection and also produces promising results of abnormal event recounting.

 <dc:title>The aggregated unfitted finite element method for elliptic problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Unfitted finite element techniques are valuable tools in different
applications where the generation of body-fitted meshes is difficult. However,
these techniques are prone to severe ill conditioning problems that obstruct
the efficient use of iterative Krylov methods and, in consequence, hinders the
practical usage of unfitted methods for realistic large scale applications. In
this work, we present a technique that addresses such conditioning problems by
constructing enhanced finite element spaces based on a cell aggregation
technique. The presented method, called aggregated unfitted finite element
method, is easy to implement, and can be used, in contrast to previous works,
in Galerkin approximations of coercive problems with conforming Lagrangian
finite element spaces. The mathematical analysis of the new method states that
the condition number of the resulting linear system matrix scales as in
standard finite elements for body-fitted meshes, without being affected by
small cut cells, and that the method leads to the optimal finite element
convergence order. These theoretical results are confirmed with 2D and 3D
numerical experiments.

 <dc:title>Interactive Coding for Markovian Protocols</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of simulating an arbitrary Markovian interactive
protocol over binary symmetric channels with crossover probability
$\varepsilon$. We are interested in the achievable rates of reliable
simulation, i.e., in characterizing the smallest possible blowup in
communications such that a vanishing error probability (in the protocol length)
can be attained. Whereas for general interactive protocols the output of each
party may depend on all previous outputs of its counterpart, in a (first order)
Markovian protocol this dependence is limited to the last observed output only.
In the special case where there is no dependence on previous outputs (no
interaction), the maximal achievable rate is given by the (one-way) Shannon
capacity $1-h(\varepsilon)$. For Markovian protocols, we first show that a rate
of $\frac{2}{3}(1-h(\varepsilon))$ can be trivially achieved. We then describe
a more involved coding scheme and provide a closed-form lower bound for its
rate at any noise level $\varepsilon$. Specifically, we show that this scheme
outperforms the trivial one for any $\varepsilon&lt;0.044$, and achieves a rate
higher than
$\frac{1-h(\varepsilon)}{1+h(\varepsilon)+h\left(&lt;\varepsilon(2-\varepsilon)&gt;\right)}=1-\Theta(h(\varepsilon))$
as $\varepsilon\to 0$, which is order-wise the best possible. This should be
juxtaposed with a result of Kol and Raz that shows the capacity for interactive
protocols with alternating rounds is lower bounded by
$1-O(\sqrt{h(\varepsilon)})$.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks (NN) are extensively used for machine learning tasks
such as image classification, perception and control of autonomous systems.
Increasingly, these deep NNs are also been deployed in high-assurance
applications. Thus, there is a pressing need for developing techniques to
verify neural networks to check whether certain user-expected properties are
satisfied. In this paper, we study a specific verification problem of computing
a guaranteed range for the output of a deep neural network given a set of
inputs represented as a convex polyhedron. Range estimation is a key primitive
for verifying deep NNs. We present an efficient range estimation algorithm that
uses a combination of local search and linear programming problems to
efficiently find the maximum and minimum values taken by the outputs of the NN
over the given input set. In contrast to recently proposed &quot;monolithic&quot;
optimization approaches, we use local gradient descent to repeatedly find and
eliminate local minima of the function. The final global optimum is certified
using a mixed integer programming instance. We implement our approach and
compare it with Reluplex, a recently proposed solver for deep neural networks.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for verification of
NNs used in automated control as well as those used in classification.

 <dc:description>  In the context of fitness coaching or for rehabilitation purposes, the motor
actions of a human participant must be observed and analyzed for errors in
order to provide effective feedback. This task is normally carried out by human
coaches, and it needs to be solved automatically in technical applications that
are to provide automatic coaching (e.g. training environments in VR). However,
most coaching systems only provide coarse information on movement quality, such
as a scalar value per body part that describes the overall deviation from the
correct movement. Further, they are often limited to static body postures or
rather simple movements of single body parts. While there are many approaches
to distinguish between different types of movements (e.g., between walking and
jumping), the detection of more subtle errors in a motor performance is less
investigated. We propose a novel approach to classify errors in sports or
rehabilitation exercises such that feedback can be delivered in a rapid and
detailed manner: Homogeneous sub-sequences of exercises are first temporally
aligned via Dynamic Time Warping. Next, we extract a feature vector from the
aligned sequences, which serves as a basis for feature selection using Random
Forests. The selected features are used as input for Support Vector Machines,
which finally classify the movement errors. We compare our algorithm to a well
established state-of-the-art approach in time series classification, 1-Nearest
Neighbor combined with Dynamic Time Warping, and show our algorithm's
superiority regarding classification quality as well as computational cost.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we analyse the convergence properties of V-cycle multigrid
algorithms for the numerical solution of the linear system of equations arising
from discontinuous Galerkin discretization of second-order elliptic partial
differential equations on polytopal meshes. Here, the sequence of spaces that
stands at the basis of the multigrid scheme is possibly non nested and is
obtained based on employing agglomeration with possible edge/face coarsening.
We prove that the method converges uniformly with respect to the granularity of
the grid and the polynomial approximation degree p, provided that the number of
smoothing steps, which depends on p, is chosen sufficiently large.

 <dc:description>  This study investigates the use of accelerometer data from a smart watch to
infer an individual's emotional state. We present our preliminary findings on a
user study with 50 participants. Participants were primed either with
audio-visual (movie clips) or audio (classical music) to elicit emotional
responses. Participants then walked while wearing a smart watch on one wrist
and a heart rate strap on their chest. Our hypothesis is that the accelerometer
signal will exhibit different patterns for participants in response to
different emotion priming. We divided the accelerometer data using sliding
windows, extracted features from each window, and used the features to train
supervised machine learning algorithms to infer an individual's emotion from
their walking pattern. Our discussion includes a description of the
methodology, data collected, and early results.

 <dc:description>  We analyze some local properties of sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs, where $d(n)/n$
is the edge probability. In particular we study the behavior of very short
paths. For $d(n)=n^{o(1)}$ we show that $G(n,d(n)/n)$ has asymptotically almost
surely (a.a.s.~) bounded local treewidth and therefore is a.a.s.~nowhere dense.
We also discover a new and simpler proof that $G(n,d/n)$ has a.a.s.~bounded
expansion for constant~$d$. The local structure of sparse Erdos-Renyi Gaphs is
very special: The $r$-neighborhood of a vertex is a tree with some additional
edges, where the probability that there are $m$ additional edges decreases
with~$m$. This implies efficient algorithms for subgraph isomorphism, in
particular for finding subgraphs with small diameter. Finally we note that
experiments suggest that preferential attachment graphs might have similar
properties after deleting a small number of vertices.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks continue to show improved performance with increasing
depth, an encouraging trend that implies an explosion in the possible
permutations of network architectures and hyperparameters for which there is
little intuitive guidance. To address this increasing complexity, we propose
Evolutionary DEep Networks (EDEN), a computationally efficient
neuro-evolutionary algorithm which interfaces to any deep neural network
platform, such as TensorFlow. We show that EDEN evolves simple yet successful
architectures built from embedding, 1D and 2D convolutional, max pooling and
fully connected layers along with their hyperparameters. Evaluation of EDEN
across seven image and sentiment classification datasets shows that it reliably
finds good networks -- and in three cases achieves state-of-the-art results --
even on a single GPU, in just 6-24 hours. Our study provides a first attempt at
applying neuro-evolution to the creation of 1D convolutional networks for
sentiment analysis including the optimisation of the embedding layer.

 <dc:title>A Longitudinal Assessment of the Persistence of Twitter Datasets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zubiaga, Arkaitz</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sharing of social media datasets presents the caveat that they are not always
completely replicable. Having to adhere to requirements of platforms like
Twitter, researchers cannot release the raw data and instead have to release a
list of unique identifiers, which others can then use to recollect the data
from the platform themselves. This leads to the problem that subsets of the
data may no longer be available, as content can be deleted or user accounts
deactivated. To quantify the impact of content deletion in the validity of
datasets in a long term, we perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence
of 30 Twitter datasets, which include over 147 million tweets. Having the
original datasets collected between 2012 and 2016, and recollecting them later
by using the tweet IDs, we look at four different factors that quantify the
extent to which recollected datasets resemble original ones: completeness,
representativity, similarity and changingness. Even though the ratio of
available tweets keeps decreasing as the dataset gets older, we find that the
textual content of the recollected subset is still largely representative of
the whole dataset that was originally collected. The representativity of the
metadata, however, keeps decreasing over time, both because the dataset shrinks
and because certain metadata, such as the users' number of followers, keeps
changing. Our study has important implications for researchers sharing and
using publicly shared Twitter datasets in their research.

 <dc:title>Recognizing Weak Embeddings of Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an efficient algorithm for a problem in the interface between
clustering and graph embeddings. An embedding $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$ of a
graph $G$ into a 2-manifold $M$ maps the vertices in $V(G)$ to distinct points
and the edges in $E(G)$ to interior-disjoint Jordan arcs between the
corresponding vertices. In applications in clustering, cartography, and
visualization, nearby vertices and edges are often bundled to a common node or
arc, due to data compression or low resolution. This raises the computational
problem of deciding whether a given map $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$ comes from an
embedding. A map $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$ is a weak embedding if it can be
perturbed into an embedding $\psi_\varepsilon : G\rightarrow M$ with
$\|\varphi-\psi_\varepsilon\|&lt;\varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$.
  A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing weak embeddings was recently
found by [Fulek and Kyn\v{c}l, 2017], which reduces to solving a system of
linear equations over $\mathbb{Z}_2$. It runs in $O(n^{2\omega})\leq
O(n^{4.75})$ time, where $\omega\approx 2.373$ is the matrix multiplication
exponent and $n$ is the number of vertices and edges of $G$. We improve the
running time to $O(n\log n)$. Our algorithm is also conceptually simpler than
[Fulek and Kyn\v{c}l, 2017]: We perform a sequence of \emph{local operations}
that gradually &quot;untangles&quot; the image $\varphi(G)$ into an embedding $\psi(G)$,
or reports that $\varphi$ is not a weak embedding. It generalizes a recent
technique developed for the case that $G$ is a cycle and the embedding is a
simple polygon [Akitaya et al., 2016], and combines local constraints on the
orientation of subgraphs directly, thereby eliminating the need for solving
large systems of linear equations.

 <dc:description>  One of the challenges in information retrieval is providing accurate answers
to a user's question often expressed as uncertainty words. Most answers are
based on a Syntactic approach rather than a Semantic analysis of the query. In
this paper, our objective is to present a hybrid approach for a Semantic
question answering retrieval system using Ontology Similarity and Fuzzy logic.
We use a Fuzzy Co-clustering algorithm to retrieve the collection of documents
based on Ontology Similarity. The Fuzzy Scale uses Fuzzy type-1 for documents
and Fuzzy type-2 for words to prioritize answers. The objective of this work is
to provide retrieval system with more accurate answers than non-fuzzy Semantic
Ontology approach.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the problem of visual hashtag discovery for infographics:
extracting visual elements from an infographic that are diagnostic of its
topic. Given an infographic as input, our computational approach automatically
outputs textual and visual elements predicted to be representative of the
infographic content. Concretely, from a curated dataset of 29K large
infographic images sampled across 26 categories and 391 tags, we present an
automated two step approach. First, we extract the text from an infographic and
use it to predict text tags indicative of the infographic content. And second,
we use these predicted text tags as a supervisory signal to localize the most
diagnostic visual elements from within the infographic i.e. visual hashtags. We
report performances on a categorization and multi-label tag prediction problem
and compare our proposed visual hashtags to human annotations.

 <dc:description>  Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) detects opinionated aspect terms in sentences or
text spans, with the end goal of performing aspect-based sentiment analysis.
The small amount of available datasets for supervised ATE and the fact that
they cover only a few domains raise the need for exploiting other data sources
in new and creative ways. Publicly available review corpora contain a plethora
of opinionated aspect terms and cover a larger domain spectrum. In this paper,
we first propose a method for using such review corpora for creating a new
dataset for ATE. Our method relies on an attention mechanism to select
sentences that have a high likelihood of containing actual opinionated aspects.
We thus improve the quality of the extracted aspects. We then use the
constructed dataset to train a model and perform ATE with distant supervision.
By evaluating on human annotated datasets, we prove that our method achieves a
significantly improved performance over various unsupervised and supervised
baselines. Finally, we prove that sentence selection matters when it comes to
creating new datasets for ATE. Specifically, we show that, using a set of
selected sentences leads to higher ATE performance compared to using the whole
sentence set.

 <dc:title>Optimizing PID parameters with machine learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nyberg, Adam</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper examines the Evolutionary programming (EP) method for optimizing
PID parameters. PID is the most common type of regulator within control theory,
partly because it's relatively simple and yields stable results for most
applications. The p, i and d parameters vary for each application; therefore,
choosing the right parameters is crucial for obtaining good results but also
somewhat difficult. EP is a derivative-free optimization algorithm which makes
it suitable for PID optimization. The experiments in this paper demonstrate the
power of EP to solve the problem of optimizing PID parameters without getting
stuck in local minimums.

 <dc:description>  Supported by the emerging technologies of Network Function Virtualization
(NFV) and network slicing, 5G networks allow tenants to rent resources from
mobile network operators (MNOs) in order to provide services without possessing
an own network infrastructure. The MNOs are therefore facing the problem of
deciding if to accept or decline the resource renting requests they receive.
This paper builds a stochastic model that describes the MNO's revenue and
opportunity cost of accepting a contract, and therewith proposes a strategy
that is analytically derived to maximize the expected profit at every decision.

haves greatly improved, but at the cost of increased treatment plan complexity
and planning time. The accurate prediction of dose distributions would
alleviate this issue by guiding clinical plan optimization to save time and
maintain high quality plans. We have developed a novel application of the fully
convolutional deep network model, U-net, for predicting dose from patient
contours. We show that with this model, we are able to accurately predict the
dose of prostate cancer patients, where the average dice similarity coefficient
is well over 0.9 when comparing the predicted vs. true isodose volumes between
0% and 100% of the prescription dose. The average differences in mean and max
dose for all structures were within 2.3% of the prescription dose.

 <dc:description>  Molecular fingerprints, i.e. feature vectors describing atomistic
neighborhood configurations, is an important abstraction and a key ingredient
for data-driven modeling of potential energy surface and interatomic force. In
this paper, we present the Density-Encoded Canonically Aligned Fingerprint
(DECAF) fingerprint algorithm, which is robust and efficient, for fitting
per-atom scalar and vector quantities. The fingerprint is essentially a
continuous density field formed through the superimposition of smoothing
kernels centered on the atoms. Rotational invariance of the fingerprint is
achieved by aligning, for each fingerprint instance, the neighboring atoms onto
a local canonical coordinate frame computed from a kernel minisum optimization
procedure. We show that this approach is superior over PCA-based methods
especially when the atomistic neighborhood is sparse and/or contains symmetry.
We propose that the `distance' between the density fields be measured using a
volume integral of their pointwise difference. This can be efficiently computed
using optimal quadrature rules, which only require discrete sampling at a small
number of grid points. We also experiment on the choice of weight functions for
constructing the density fields, and characterize their performance for fitting
interatomic potentials. The applicability of the fingerprint is demonstrated
through a set of benchmark problems.

 <dc:description>  In the context of personalized medicine, text mining methods pose an
interesting option for identifying disease-gene associations, as they can be
used to generate novel links between diseases and genes which may complement
knowledge from structured databases. The most straightforward approach to
extract such links from text is to rely on a simple assumption postulating an
association between all genes and diseases that co-occur within the same
document. However, this approach (i) tends to yield a number of spurious
associations, (ii) does not capture different relevant types of associations,
and (iii) is incapable of aggregating knowledge that is spread across
documents. Thus, we propose an approach in which disease-gene co-occurrences
and gene-gene interactions are represented in an RDF graph. A machine
learning-based classifier is trained that incorporates features extracted from
the graph to separate disease-gene pairs into valid disease-gene associations
and spurious ones. On the manually curated Genetic Testing Registry, our
approach yields a 30 points increase in F1 score over a plain co-occurrence
baseline.

 <dc:description>  Microservice Architectures (MA) have the potential to increase the agility of
software development. In an era where businesses require software applications
to evolve to support software emerging requirements, particularly for Internet
of Things (IoT) applications, we examine the issue of microservice granularity
and explore its effect upon application latency. Two approaches to microservice
deployment are simulated; the first with microservices in a single container,
and the second with microservices partitioned across separate containers. We
observed a neglibible increase in service latency for the multiple container
deployment over a single container.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic spiking neural networks based on nanoelectronic spin devices can
be a possible pathway to achieving &quot;brainlike&quot; compact and energy-effcient
cognitive intelligence. The computational model attempt to exploit the
intrinsic device stochasticity of nanoelectronic synaptic or neural components
to perform learning or inference. However, there has been limited analysis on
the scaling effect of stochastic spin devices and its impact on the operation
of such stochastic networks at the system level. This work attempts to explore
the design space and analyze the performance of nanomagnet-based stochastic
neuromorphic computing architectures for magnets with different barrier
heights. We illustrate how the underlying network architecture must be modified
to account for the random telegraphic switching behavior displayed by magnets
with low barrier heights as they are scaled into the superparamagnetic regime.
We perform a device-to-system-level analysis on a deep neural-network
architecture for a digit-recognition problem on the MNIST data set.

 <dc:description>  With more and more cultural heritage data being published online, their
usefulness in this open context depends on the quality and diversity of
descriptive metadata for collection objects. In many cases, existing metadata
is not adequate for a variety of retrieval and research tasks and more specific
annotations are necessary. However, eliciting such annotations is a challenge
since it often requires domain-specific knowledge. Where crowdsourcing can be
successfully used for eliciting simple annotations, identifying people with the
required expertise might prove troublesome for tasks requiring more complex or
domain-specific knowledge. Nichesourcing addresses this problem, by tapping
into the expert knowledge available in niche communities. This paper presents
Accurator, a methodology for conducting nichesourcing campaigns for cultural
heritage institutions, by addressing communities, organizing events and
tailoring a web-based annotation tool to a domain of choice. The contribution
of this paper is threefold: 1) a nichesourcing methodology, 2) an annotation
tool for experts and 3) validation of the methodology and tool in three case
studies. The three domains of the case studies are birds on art, bible prints
and fashion images. We compare the quality and quantity of obtained annotations
in the three case studies, showing that the nichesourcing methodology in
combination with the image annotation tool can be used to collect high quality
annotations in a variety of domains and annotation tasks. A user evaluation
indicates the tool is suited and usable for domain specific annotation tasks.

 <dc:description>  Question processing is a fundamental step in a question answering (QA)
application, and its quality impacts the performance of QA application. The
major challenging issue in processing question is how to extract semantic of
natural language questions (NLQs). A human language is ambiguous. Ambiguity may
occur at two levels; lexical and syntactic. In this paper, we propose a new
approach for resolving lexical ambiguity problem by integrating context
knowledge and concepts knowledge of a domain, into shallow natural language
processing (SNLP) techniques. Concepts knowledge is modeled using ontology,
while context knowledge is obtained from WordNet, and it is determined based on
neighborhood words in a question. The approach will be applied to a university
QA system.

 <dc:description>  We describe a data-driven approach for automatically explaining new,
non-standard English expressions in a given sentence, building on a large
dataset that includes 15 years of crowdsourced examples from
UrbanDictionary.com. Unlike prior studies that focus on matching keywords from
a slang dictionary, we investigate the possibility of learning a neural
sequence-to-sequence model that generates explanations of unseen non-standard
English expressions given context. We propose a dual encoder approach---a
word-level encoder learns the representation of context, and a second
character-level encoder to learn the hidden representation of the target
non-standard expression. Our model can produce reasonable definitions of new
non-standard English expressions given their context with certain confidence.

under the attacks there is no disturbance in the message mode and that the
mutual information between the sender and the receiver is always constant and
equal to one. It follows that recent proofs of security for two-way protocols
cannot be considered complete since they do not cover the considered attacks.

 <dc:title>On Time Optimisation of Centroidal Momentum Dynamics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently, the centroidal momentum dynamics has received substantial attention
to plan dynamically consistent motions for robots with arms and legs in
multi-contact scenarios. However, it is also non convex which renders any
optimization approach difficult and timing is usually kept fixed in most
trajectory optimization techniques to not introduce additional non convexities
to the problem. But this can limit the versatility of the algorithms. In our
previous work, we proposed a convex relaxation of the problem that allowed to
efficiently compute momentum trajectories and contact forces. However, our
approach could not minimize a desired angular momentum objective which
seriously limited its applicability. Noticing that the non-convexity introduced
by the time variables is of similar nature as the centroidal dynamics one, we
propose two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft
constraints. The resulting approaches can compute time-optimized dynamically
consistent trajectories sufficiently fast to make the approach realtime
capable. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in several
multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot. In particular, we show that the
proposed convex relaxation of the original problem finds solutions that are
consistent with the original non-convex problem and illustrate how timing
optimization allows to find motion plans that would be difficult to plan with
fixed timing. Source code is available at
https://git-amd.tuebingen.mpg.de/bponton/timeoptimization.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel real-time Fuzzy Supervised Learning with Binary
Meta-Feature (FSL-BM) for big data classification task. The study of real-time
algorithms addresses several major concerns, which are namely: accuracy, memory
consumption, and ability to stretch assumptions and time complexity. Attaining
a fast computational model providing fuzzy logic and supervised learning is one
of the main challenges in the machine learning. In this research paper, we
present FSL-BM algorithm as an efficient solution of supervised learning with
fuzzy logic processing using binary meta-feature representation using Hamming
Distance and Hash function to relax assumptions. While many studies focused on
reducing time complexity and increasing accuracy during the last decade, the
novel contribution of this proposed solution comes through integration of
Hamming Distance, Hash function, binary meta-features, binary classification to
provide real time supervised method. Hash Tables (HT) component gives a fast
access to existing indices; and therefore, the generation of new indices in a
constant time complexity, which supersedes existing fuzzy supervised algorithms
with better or comparable results. To summarize, the main contribution of this
technique for real-time Fuzzy Supervised Learning is to represent hypothesis
through binary input as meta-feature space and creating the Fuzzy Supervised
Hash table to train and validate model.

 <dc:title>Early Prediction for Physical Human Robot Collaboration in the Operating

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To enable a natural and fluent human robot collaboration flow, it is critical
for a robot to comprehend their human peers' on-going actions, predict their
behaviors in the near future, and plan its actions correspondingly.
Specifically, the capability of making early predictions is important, so that
the robot can foresee the precise timing of a turn-taking event and start
motion planning and execution early enough to smooth the turn-taking
transition. Such proactive behavior would reduce human's waiting time, increase
efficiency and enhance naturalness in collaborative task. To that end, this
paper presents the design and implementation of an early turn-taking prediction
algorithm, catered for physical human robot collaboration scenarios.
Specifically, a Robotic Scrub Nurse (RSN) system which can comprehend surgeon's
multimodal communication cues and perform turn-taking prediction is presented.
The developed algorithm was tested on a collected data set of simulated
surgical procedures in a surgeon-nurse tandem. The proposed turn-taking
prediction algorithm is found to be significantly superior to its algorithmic
counterparts, and is more accurate than human baseline when little partial
input is given (less than 30% of full action). After observing more
information, the algorithm can achieve comparable performances as humans with a
F1 score of 0.90.

 <dc:description>  Robotic manipulation involves actions where contacts occur between the robot
and the objects. In this scope, the availability of physics-based engines
allows motion planners to comprise dynamics between rigid bodies, which is
necessary for planning this type of actions. However, physics-based motion
planning is computationally intensive due to the high dimensionality of the
state space and the need to work with a low integration step to find accurate
solutions. On the other hand, manipulation actions change the environment and
conditions further actions and motions. To cope with this issue, the
representation of manipulation actions using ontologies enables a
semantic-based inference process that alleviates the computational cost of
motion planning. This paper proposes a manipulation planning framework where
physics-based motion planning is enhanced with ontological knowledge
representation and reasoning. The proposal has been implemented and is
illustrated and validated with a simple example. Its use in grasping tasks in
cluttered environments is currently under development.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Turn-taking is essential to the structure of human teamwork. Humans are
typically aware of team members' intention to keep or relinquish their turn
before a turn switch, where the responsibility of working on a shared task is
shifted. Future co-robots are also expected to provide such competence. To that
end, this paper proposes the Cognitive Turn-taking Model (CTTM), which
leverages cognitive models (i.e., Spiking Neural Network) to achieve early
turn-taking prediction. The CTTM framework can process multimodal human
communication cues (both implicit and explicit) and predict human turn-taking
intentions in an early stage. The proposed framework is tested on a simulated
surgical procedure, where a robotic scrub nurse predicts the surgeon's
turn-taking intention. It was found that the proposed CTTM framework
outperforms the state-of-the-art turn-taking prediction algorithms by a large
margin. It also outperforms humans when presented with partial observations of
communication cues (i.e., less than 40% of full actions). This early prediction
capability enables robots to initiate turn-taking actions at an early stage,
which facilitates collaboration and increases overall efficiency.

 <dc:title>From Blind deconvolution to Blind Super-Resolution through convex
  programming</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cosse, Augustin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the recovery of an unknown signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^L$
through the result of its convolution with an unknown filter $h \in
\mathbb{R}^L$. This problem, also known as blind deconvolution, has been
studied extensively by the signal processing and applied mathematics
communities, leading to a diversity of proofs and algorithms based on various
assumptions on the filter and its input. Sparsity of this filter, or in
contrast, non vanishing of its Fourier transform are instances of such
assumptions. The main result of this paper shows that blind deconvolution can
be solved through nuclear norm relaxation in the case of a fully unknown
channel, as soon as this channel is probed through a few $N \gtrsim \mu^2_m
K^{1/2}$ input signals $x_n = C_n m_n$, $n=1,\ldots,N,$ that are living in
known $K$-dimensional subspaces $C_n$ of $\mathbb{R}^L$. This result holds with
high probability on the genericity of the subspaces $C_n$ as soon as $L\gtrsim
K^{3/2}$ and $N\gtrsim K^{1/2}$ up to log factors. Our proof system relies on
the construction of a certificate of optimality for the underlying convex
program. This certificate expands as a Neumann series and is shown to satisfy
the conditions for the recovery of the matrix encoding the unknowns by
controlling the terms in this series. An incidental consequence of the result
of this paper, following from the lack of assumptions on the filter, is that
nuclear norm relaxation can be extended from blind deconvolution to blind
super-resolution, as soon as the unknown ideal low pass filter has a
sufficiently large support compared to the ambient dimension $L$. Numerical
experiments supporting the theory as well as its application to blind
super-resolution are provided.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, various shadow detection methods from a single image have
been proposed and used in vision systems; however, most of them are not
appropriate for the robotic applications due to the expensive time complexity.
This paper introduces a fast shadow detection method using a deep learning
framework, with a time cost that is appropriate for robotic applications. In
our solution, we first obtain a shadow prior map with the help of multi-class
support vector machine using statistical features. Then, we use a semantic-
aware patch level Convolutional Neural Network architecture that efficiently
trains on patch level shadow examples by combining the original image and the
shadow prior map. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed
method significantly decreases the time complexity of shadow detection without
losing accuracy.

 <dc:description>  With the proliferation of mobile devices and location-based services,
continuous generation of massive volume of streaming spatial objects (i.e.,
geo-tagged data) opens up new opportunities to address real-world problems by
analyzing them. In this paper, we present a novel continuous bursty region
detection problem that aims to continuously detect a bursty region of a given
size in a specified geographical area from a stream of spatial objects.
Specifically, a bursty region shows maximum spike in the number of spatial
objects in a given time window. The problem is useful in addressing several
real-world challenges such as surge pricing problem in online transportation
and disease outbreak detection. To solve the problem, we propose an exact
solution and two approximate solutions, and the approximation ratio is
$\frac{1-\alpha}{4}$ in terms of the burst score, where $\alpha$ is a parameter
to control the burst score. We further extend these solutions to support
detection of top-$k$ bursty regions. Extensive experiments with real-world data
are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions.

 <dc:description>  Label estimation is an important component in an unsupervised person
re-identification (re-ID) system. This paper focuses on cross-camera label
estimation, which can be subsequently used in feature learning to learn robust
re-ID models. Specifically, we propose to construct a graph for samples in each
camera, and then graph matching scheme is introduced for cross-camera labeling
association. While labels directly output from existing graph matching methods
may be noisy and inaccurate due to significant cross-camera variations, this
paper proposes a dynamic graph matching (DGM) method. DGM iteratively updates
the image graph and the label estimation process by learning a better feature
space with intermediate estimated labels. DGM is advantageous in two aspects:
1) the accuracy of estimated labels is improved significantly with the
iterations; 2) DGM is robust to noisy initial training data. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmarks including the large-scale MARS
dataset show that DGM yields competitive performance to fully supervised
baselines, and outperforms competing unsupervised learning methods.

 <dc:title>A Structural Characterization of Market Power in Power Markets</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider a market in which capacity-constrained generators compete in
scalar-parameterized supply functions to serve an inelastic demand spread
throughout a transmission constrained power network. The market clears
according to a locational marginal pricing mechanism, in which the independent
system operator (ISO) determines the generators' production quantities to
minimize the revealed cost of meeting demand, while ensuring that network
transmission and generator capacity constraints are met. Under the stylizing
assumption that both the ISO and generators choose their strategies
simultaneously, we establish the existence of Nash equilibria for the
underlying market, and derive an upper bound on the allocative efficiency loss
at Nash equilibrium relative to the socially optimal level. We also
characterize an upper bound on the markup of locational marginal prices at Nash
equilibrium above their perfectly competitive levels. Of particular relevance
to ex ante market power monitoring, these bounds reveal the role of certain
market structures---specifically, the market share and residual supply index of
a producer---in predicting the degree to which that producer is able to
exercise market power to influence the market outcome to its advantage.
Finally, restricting our attention to the simpler setting of a two-node power
network, we provide a characterization of market structures under which a
Braess-like paradox occurs due to the exercise of market power---that is to
say, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition on market structure under
which the strengthening of the network's transmission line capacity results in
the (counterintuitive) increase in the total cost of generation at Nash
equilibrium.

 <dc:title>Effective Image Retrieval via Multilinear Multi-index Fusion</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Multi-index fusion has demonstrated impressive performances in retrieval task
by integrating different visual representations in a unified framework.
However, previous works mainly consider propagating similarities via neighbor
structure, ignoring the high order information among different visual
representations. In this paper, we propose a new multi-index fusion scheme for
image retrieval. By formulating this procedure as a multilinear based
optimization problem, the complementary information hidden in different indexes
can be explored more thoroughly. Specially, we first build our multiple indexes
from various visual representations. Then a so-called index-specific functional
matrix, which aims to propagate similarities, is introduced for updating the
original index. The functional matrices are then optimized in a unified tensor
space to achieve a refinement, such that the relevant images can be pushed more
closer. The optimization problem can be efficiently solved by the augmented
Lagrangian method with theoretical convergence guarantee. Unlike the
traditional multi-index fusion scheme, our approach embeds the multi-index
subspace structure into the new indexes with sparse constraint, thus it has
little additional memory consumption in online query stage. Experimental
evaluation on three benchmark datasets reveals that the proposed approach
achieves the state-of-the-art performance, i.e., N-score 3.94 on UKBench, mAP
94.1\% on Holiday and 62.39\% on Market-1501.

 <dc:title>On the construction of converging hierarchies for polynomial

 <dc:description>  In recent years, techniques based on convex optimization and real algebra
that produce converging hierarchies of lower bounds for polynomial optimization
problems (POPs) have gained much popularity. At their heart, these hierarchies
rely crucially on Positivstellens\&quot;atze from the late 20th century (e.g., due
to Stengle, Putinar, or Schm\&quot;udgen) that certify positivity of a polynomial on
an arbitrary basic semialgebraic set. In this paper, we show that such
hierarchies could in fact be designed from much more limited
Positivstellens\&quot;atze dating back to the early 20th century that only certify
positivity of a polynomial globally. More precisely, we show that any inner
approximation to the cone of positive homogeneous polynomials that is
arbitrarily tight can be turned into a converging hierarchy for general
polynomial optimization problems with compact feasible sets. This in particular
leads to a semidefinite programming-based hierarchy that relies solely on
Artin's solution to Hilbert's 17th problem. We also use a classical result of
Poly\'a on global positivity of even forms to construct an &quot;optimization-free&quot;
converging hierarchy for general POPs with compact feasible sets. This
hierarchy only requires polynomial multiplication and checking nonnegativity of
coefficients of certain fixed polynomials. As a corollary, we obtain new linear
programming and second-order cone programming-based hierarchies for POPs that
rely on the recently introduced concepts of dsos (diagonally dominant sum of
squares) and sdsos (scaled diagonally dominant sum of squares) polynomials.

 <dc:title>A Simple Reinforcement Learning Mechanism for Resource Allocation in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Resource allocation is still a difficult issue to deal with in wireless
networks. The unstable channel condition and traffic demand for Quality of
Service (QoS) raise some barriers that interfere with the process. It is
significant that an optimal policy takes into account some resources available
to each traffic class while considering the spectral efficiency and other
related channel issues. Reinforcement learning is a dynamic and effective
method to support the accomplishment of resource allocation properly
maintaining QoS levels for applications. The technique can track the system
state as feedback to enhance the performance of a given task. Herein, it is
proposed a simple reinforcement learning mechanism introduced in LTE-A networks
and aimed to choose and limit the number of resources allocated for each
traffic class, regarding the QoS Class Identifier (QCI), at each Transmission
Time Interval (TTI) along the scheduling procedure. The proposed mechanism
implements a Markov Decision Process (MDP) solved by the Q-Learning algorithm
to find an optimal action-state decision policy. The results obtained from
simulation exhibit good performance, especially for the real-time Video
application.

 <dc:description>  At CCS 2015 Naveed et al. presented first attacks on efficiently searchable
encryption, such as deterministic and order-preserving encryption. These
plaintext guessing attacks have been further improved in subsequent work, e.g.
by Grubbs et al. in 2016. Such cryptanalysis is crucially important to sharpen
our understanding of the implications of security models. In this paper we
present an efficiently searchable, encrypted data structure that is provably
secure against these and even more powerful chosen plaintext attacks. Our data
structure supports logarithmic-time search with linear space complexity. The
indices of our data structure can be used to search by standard comparisons and
hence allow easy retrofitting to existing database management systems. We
implemented our scheme and show that its search time overhead is only 10
milliseconds compared to non-secure search.

 <dc:title>Touch-based object localization in cluttered environments</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Touch-based object localization is an important component of autonomous
robotic systems that are to perform dexterous tasks in real-world environments.
When the objects to locate are placed within clutters, this touch-based
procedure tends to generate outlier measurements which, in turn, can lead to a
significant loss in localization precision. Our first contribution is to
address this problem by applying the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) method to
a Bayesian estimation framework. As RANSAC requires repeatedly applying the
(computationally intensive) Bayesian updating step, it is crucial to improve
that step in order to achieve practical running times. Our second contribution
is therefore a fast method to find the most probable object face that
corresponds to a given touch measurement, which yields a significant
acceleration of the Bayesian updating step. Experiments show that our overall
algorithm provides accurate localization in practical times, even when the
measurements are corrupted by outliers.

 <dc:description>  We discuss an incentivizing market and model-based approach to design the
energy management and control systems which realize high-quality ancillary
services in dynamic power grids. Under the electricity liberalization, such
incentivizing market should secure a high speed market-clearing by using the
market players' private information well. Inspired by contract theory in
microeconomics field, we propose a novel design method of such incentivizing
market based on the integration of the economics models and the dynamic grid
model. The conventional contract problems are analyzed for static systems or
dynamical systems with control inputs directly operated by the principal. The
analysis is, however, in discord with the incentivizing market. The main
challenge of our approach is to reformulate the contract problems adapted to
the market from the system and control perspective. We first establish the
fundamental formulae for optimal incentive and control design, and clarify the
basic properties of the designed market. We also discuss possibilities and
limitation in the direction of our approach.

 <dc:title>Pseudo-labels for Supervised Learning on Dynamic Vision Sensor Data,
  Applied to Object Detection under Ego-motion</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Nicholas F. Y.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, dynamic vision sensors (DVS), also known as event-based
cameras or neuromorphic sensors, have seen increased use due to various
advantages over traditional frame-based cameras. Its high temporal resolution
overcomes motion blurring, its high dynamic range overcomes extreme
illumination conditions and its low power consumption makes it suitable for
platforms such as drones and self-driving cars. While frame-based computer
vision is mature due to the large amounts of data and ground truth available,
event-based computer vision is still a work in progress as data sets are not as
aplenty and ground truth is scarce for tasks such as object detection. In this
paper, we suggest a way to overcome the lack of labeled ground truth by
introducing a simple method to generate pseudo-labels for dynamic vision sensor
data, assuming that the corresponding frame-based data is also available. These
pseudo-labels can be treated as ground truth when training on supervised
learning algorithms, and we show, for the first time, event-based car detection
under ego-motion in a realistic environment at 100 frames per second with an
average precision of 41.7% relative to pseudo-ground truth.

corrupted) frames of a video and then jointly processes the registered frames
to produce a decomposition of the scene into a low-rank background component
that captures the static components of the scene, a smooth foreground component
that captures the dynamic components of the scene, and a sparse component that
can isolate corruptions and other non-idealities. Unlike existing methods, our
proposed algorithm produces a panoramic low-rank component that spans the
entire field of view, automatically stitching together corrupted data from
partially overlapping scenes. The low-rank portion of our robust PCA model is
based on a recently discovered optimal low-rank matrix estimator (OptShrink)
that requires no parameter tuning. We demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm on both static and moving camera videos corrupted by noise and
outliers.

 <dc:title>RoboTSP - A Fast Solution to the Robotic Task Sequencing Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many industrial robotics applications, such as spot-welding,
spray-painting or drilling, the robot is required to visit successively
multiple targets. The robot travel time among the targets is a significant
component of the overall execution time. This travel time is in turn greatly
affected by the order of visit of the targets, and by the robot configurations
used to reach each target. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize these two
elements, a problem known in the literature as the Robotic Task Sequencing
Problem (RTSP). Our contribution in this paper is two-fold. First, we propose a
fast, near-optimal, algorithm to solve RTSP. The key to our approach is to
exploit the classical distinction between task space and configuration space,
which, surprisingly, has been so far overlooked in the RTSP literature. Second,
we provide an open-source implementation of the above algorithm, which has been
carefully benchmarked to yield an efficient, ready-to-use, software solution.
We discuss the relationship between RTSP and other Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) variants, such as the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP), and
show experimentally that our method finds motion sequences of the same quality
but using several orders of magnitude less computation time than existing
approaches.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel memory network model named Read-Write Memory Network
(RWMN) to perform question and answering tasks for large-scale, multimodal
movie story understanding. The key focus of our RWMN model is to design the
read network and the write network that consist of multiple convolutional
layers, which enable memory read and write operations to have high capacity and
flexibility. While existing memory-augmented network models treat each memory
slot as an independent block, our use of multi-layered CNNs allows the model to
read and write sequential memory cells as chunks, which is more reasonable to
represent a sequential story because adjacent memory blocks often have strong
correlations. For evaluation, we apply our model to all the six tasks of the
MovieQA benchmark, and achieve the best accuracies on several tasks, especially
on the visual QA task. Our model shows a potential to better understand not
only the content in the story, but also more abstract information, such as
relationships between characters and the reasons for their actions.

 <dc:description>  Policy-gradient approaches to reinforcement learning have two common and
undesirable overhead procedures, namely warm-start training and sample variance
reduction. In this paper, we describe a reinforcement learning method based on
a softmax value function that requires neither of these procedures. Our method
combines the advantages of policy-gradient methods with the efficiency and
simplicity of maximum-likelihood approaches. We apply this new cold-start
reinforcement learning method in training sequence generation models for
structured output prediction problems. Empirical evidence validates this method
on automatic summarization and image captioning tasks.

 <dc:title>Signature Verification Approach using Fusion of Hybrid Texture Features</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Roy, Partha Pratim</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a writer-dependent signature verification method is proposed.
Two different types of texture features, namely Wavelet and Local Quantized
Patterns (LQP) features, are employed to extract two kinds of transform and
statistical based information from signature images. For each writer two
separate one-class support vector machines (SVMs) corresponding to each set of
LQP and Wavelet features are trained to obtain two different authenticity
scores for a given signature. Finally, a score level classifier fusion method
is used to integrate the scores obtained from the two one-class SVMs to achieve
the verification score. In the proposed method only genuine signatures are used
to train the one-class SVMs. The proposed signature verification method has
been tested using four different publicly available datasets and the results
demonstrate the generality of the proposed method. The proposed system
outperforms other existing systems in the literature.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a new structure to Generative Adversarial Networks
by adding an inverse transformation unit behind the generator. We present two
theorems to claim the convergence of the model, and two conjectures to nonideal
situations when the transformation is not bijection. A general survey on models
with different transformations was done on the MNIST dataset and the
Fashion-MNIST dataset, which shows the transformation does not necessarily need
to be bijection. Also, with certain transformations that blurs an image, our
model successfully learned to sharpen the images and recover blurred images,
which was additionally verified by our measurement of sharpness.

 <dc:description>  To overcome the travelling difficulty for the visually impaired group, this
paper presents a novel ETA (Electronic Travel Aids)-smart guiding device in the
shape of a pair of eyeglasses for giving these people guidance efficiently and
safely. Different from existing works, a novel multi sensor fusion based
obstacle avoiding algorithm is proposed, which utilizes both the depth sensor
and ultrasonic sensor to solve the problems of detecting small obstacles, and
transparent obstacles, e.g. the French door. For totally blind people, three
kinds of auditory cues were developed to inform the direction where they can go
ahead. Whereas for weak sighted people, visual enhancement which leverages the
AR (Augment Reality) technique and integrates the traversable direction is
adopted. The prototype consisting of a pair of display glasses and several low
cost sensors is developed, and its efficiency and accuracy were tested by a
number of users. The experimental results show that the smart guiding glasses
can effectively improve the user's travelling experience in complicated indoor
environment. Thus it serves as a consumer device for helping the visually
impaired people to travel safely.

 <dc:description>  When a speaker says the name of a color, the color they picture is not
necessarily the same as the listener imagines. Color is a grounded semantic
task, but that grounding is not a single value as the most recent works on
color-generation do. Rather proper understanding of color language requires the
capacity to map a sequence of words is to a distribution in color space. To
achieve this, we propose a novel GRU based model which when given a color
description such as &quot;light greenish blue&quot; produces an estimated probability
distribution across HSV color space. This model learns the compositional
functioning of each term: &quot;light&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;ish&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; in the color name,
and show together they determine the shape of the distribution. This allows the
prediction of distributions for color description phrases never seen in
training. Such capacity is crucial in allowing human computer interaction
systems to interpret vague color statements, with particular use in recognising
objects described by color.

 <dc:description>  In this dissertation the practical speech emotion recognition technology is
studied, including several cognitive related emotion types, namely fidgetiness,
confidence and tiredness. The high quality of naturalistic emotional speech
data is the basis of this research. The following techniques are used for
inducing practical emotional speech: cognitive task, computer game, noise
stimulation, sleep deprivation and movie clips.
  A practical speech emotion recognition system is studied based on Gaussian
mixture model. A two-class classifier set is adopted for performance
improvement under the small sample case. Considering the context information in
continuous emotional speech, a Gaussian mixture model embedded with Markov
networks is proposed.
  A further study is carried out for system robustness analysis. First, noise
reduction algorithm based on auditory masking properties is fist introduced to
the practical speech emotion recognition. Second, to deal with the complicated
unknown emotion types under real situation, an emotion recognition method with
rejection ability is proposed, which enhanced the system compatibility against
unknown emotion samples. Third, coping with the difficulties brought by a large
number of unknown speakers, an emotional feature normalization method based on
speaker-sensitive feature clustering is proposed. Fourth, by adding the
electrocardiogram channel, a bi-modal emotion recognition system based on
speech signals and electrocardiogram signals is first introduced.
  The speech emotion recognition methods studied in this dissertation may be
extended into the cross-language speech emotion recognition and the whispered
speech emotion recognition.

 <dc:description>  Parametric Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis of a sequential program
produces a formula that represents the worst-case execution time of the
program, where parameters of the formula are user-defined parameters of the
program (as loop bounds, values of inputs or internal variables, etc).
  In this paper we propose a novel methodology to compute the parametric WCET
of a program. Unlike other algorithms in the literature, our method is not
based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Instead, we follow an approach based
on the notion of symbolic computation of WCET formulae. After explaining our
methodology and proving its correctness, we present a set of experiments to
compare our method against the state of the art. We show that our approach
dominates other parametric analyses, and produces results that are very close
to those produced by non-parametric ILP-based approaches, while keeping very
good computing time.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an intertemporal bimodal network to analyze the evolution
of the semantic content of a scientific field within the framework of topic
modeling, namely using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The main
contribution is the conceptualization of the topic dynamics and its
formalization and codification into an algorithm. To benchmark the
effectiveness of this approach, we propose three indexes which track the
transformation of topics over time, their rate of birth and death, and the
novelty of their content. Applying the LDA, we test the algorithm both on a
controlled experiment and on a corpus of several thousands of scientific papers
over a period of more than 100 years which account for the history of the
economic thought.

 <dc:title>Masked Toeplitz covariance estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The problem of estimating the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of a $p$-variate
distribution based on its $n$ observations arises in many data analysis
contexts. While for $n&gt;p$, the classical sample covariance matrix
$\hat{\Sigma}_n$ is a good estimator for $\Sigma$, it fails in the
high-dimensional setting when $n\ll p$. In this scenario one requires prior
knowledge about the structure of the covariance matrix in order to construct
reasonable estimators. Under the common assumption that $\Sigma$ is sparse, a
refined estimator is given by $M\cdot\hat{\Sigma}_n$, where $M$ is a suitable
symmetric mask matrix indicating the nonzero entries of $\Sigma$ and $\cdot$
denotes the entrywise product of matrices. In the present work we assume that
$\Sigma$ has Toeplitz structure corresponding to stationary signals. This
suggests to average the sample covariance $\hat{\Sigma}_n$ over the diagonals
in order to obtain an estimator $\tilde{\Sigma}_n$ of Toeplitz structure.
Assuming in addition that $\Sigma$ is sparse suggests to study estimators of
the form $M\cdot\tilde{\Sigma}_n$. For Gaussian random vectors and, more
generally, random vectors satisfying the convex concentration property, our
main result bounds the estimation error in terms of $n$ and $p$ and shows that
accurate estimation is indeed possible when $n \ll p$. The new bound
significantly generalizes previous results by Cai, Ren and Zhou and provides an
alternative proof. Our analysis exploits the connection between the spectral
norm of a Toeplitz matrix and the supremum norm of the corresponding spectral
density function.

 <dc:description>  Estimating the 6-DoF pose of a camera from a single image relative to a
pre-computed 3D point-set is an important task for many computer vision
applications. Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers are routinely used for camera
pose estimation, provided that a good quality set of 2D-3D feature
correspondences are known beforehand. However, finding optimal correspondences
between 2D key-points and a 3D point-set is non-trivial, especially when only
geometric (position) information is known. Existing approaches to the
simultaneous pose and correspondence problem use local optimisation, and are
therefore unlikely to find the optimal solution without a good pose
initialisation, or introduce restrictive assumptions. Since a large proportion
of outliers are common for this problem, we instead propose a globally-optimal
inlier set cardinality maximisation approach which jointly estimates optimal
camera pose and optimal correspondences. Our approach employs branch-and-bound
to search the 6D space of camera poses, guaranteeing global optimality without
requiring a pose prior. The geometry of SE(3) is used to find novel upper and
lower bounds for the number of inliers and local optimisation is integrated to
accelerate convergence. The evaluation empirically supports the optimality
proof and shows that the method performs much more robustly than existing
approaches, including on a large-scale outdoor data-set.

 <dc:title>Human Detection for Night Surveillance using Adaptive Background

 <dc:description>  Surveillance based on Computer Vision has become a major necessity in current
era. Most of the surveillance systems operate on visible light imaging, but
performance based on visible light imaging is limited due to some factors like
variation in light intensity during the daytime. The matter of concern lies in
the need for processing images in low light, such as in the need of nighttime
surveillance. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for human
detection using FLIR(Forward Looking Infrared) camera. As the principle
involves sensing based on thermal radiation in the Near IR Region, it is
possible to detect Humans from an image captured using a FLIR camera even in
low light. The proposed method for human detection involves processing of
Thermal images by using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature
extraction technique along with some enhancements. The principle of the
proposed technique lies in an adaptive background subtraction algorithm, which
works in association with the HOG technique. By means of this method, we are
able to reduce execution time, precision and some other parameters, which
result in improvement of overall accuracy of the human detection system.

 <dc:description>  Data parallelism has emerged as a necessary technique to accelerate the
training of deep neural networks (DNN). In a typical data parallelism approach,
the local workers push the latest updates of all the parameters to the
parameter server and pull all merged parameters back periodically. However,
with the increasing size of DNN models and the large number of workers in
practice, this typical data parallelism cannot achieve satisfactory training
acceleration, since it usually suffers from the heavy communication cost due to
transferring huge amount of information between workers and the parameter
server. In-depth understanding on DNN has revealed that it is usually highly
redundant, that deleting a considerable proportion of the parameters will not
significantly decline the model performance. This redundancy property exposes a
great opportunity to reduce the communication cost by only transferring the
information of those significant parameters during the parallel training.
However, if we only transfer information of temporally significant parameters
of the latest snapshot, we may miss the parameters that are insignificant now
but have potential to become significant as the training process goes on. To
this end, we design an Explore-Exploit framework to dynamically choose the
subset to be communicated, which is comprised of the significant parameters in
the latest snapshot together with a random explored set of other parameters. We
propose to measure the significance of the parameter by the combination of its
magnitude and gradient. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
Slim-DP can achieve better training acceleration than standard data parallelism
and its communication-efficient version by saving communication time without
loss of accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We elaborate on the recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)
modulation technique, which provides significant advantages over orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in Doppler channels. We first derive the
input--output relation describing OTFS modulation and demodulation (mod/demod)
for delay--Doppler channels with arbitrary number of paths, with given delay
and Doppler values. We then propose a low-complexity message passing (MP)
detection algorithm, which is suitable for large-scale OTFS taking advantage of
the inherent channel sparsity. Since the fractional Doppler paths (i.e., not
exactly aligned with the Doppler taps) produce the inter Doppler interference
(IDI), we adapt the MP detection algorithm to compensate for the effect of IDI
in order to further improve performance. Simulations results illustrate the
superior performance gains of OTFS over OFDM under various channel conditions.

 <dc:description>  With the development of electronic media and the heterogeneity of Arabic data
on the Web, the idea of building a clean corpus for certain applications of
natural language processing, including machine translation, information
retrieval, question answer, become more and more pressing. In this manuscript,
we seek to create and develop our own corpus of pair's questions-texts. This
constitution then will provide a better base for our experimentation step.
Thus, we try to model this constitution by a method for Arabic insofar as it
recovers texts from the web that could prove to be answers to our factual
questions. To do this, we had to develop a java script that can extract from a
given query a list of html pages. Then clean these pages to the extent of
having a data base of texts and a corpus of pair's question-texts. In addition,
we give preliminary results of our proposal method. Some investigations for the
construction of Arabic corpus are also presented in this document.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the dynamic seminar management system named 'e-Sem',
developed according to the opensource software philosophy. Due to its dynamic
management functionality, it can equally adapt to any education environment
(Primary, Secondary, Tertiary). The purpose of the proposed dynamic system is
ease of use and handling, by any class of users, without the need of special
guidance. Also, students are given the opportunity to: a) register as users; b)
enroll in seminars in a simple way; c) receive e-learning material at any time
of day any day of week, and d) be informed of new announcements concerning the
seminar in which they are enrolled . In addition, the administrator and the
tutors have a number of tools such as : management seminars and trainees in a
friendly way, sending educational material as well as new announcements to the
trainees; the possibility of electronic recording of presence or absence of the
trainees in a seminar, and direct printing of a certificate of successful
attendance of a seminar for each trainee. The application also offers features
such as electronic organization, storage and presentation of educational
material, overcoming the limiting factors of space and time of classical
teaching, thus creating a dynamic environment

to promote this type of learning. From a pilot study, we show that they are

 <dc:description>  Light field cameras presents new capabilities, such as post-capture
refocusing and aperture control, through capturing directional and spatial
distribution of light rays in space. Among different light field camera
implementations, micro-lens array based light field cameras is a cost-effective
and compact approach to capture light field. One drawback of the micro-lens
array based light field cameras is low spatial resolution due to the fact that
a single sensor is shared to capture both spatial and angular information. To
address the low spatial resolution issue, we present a light field imaging
approach that captures and fuses multiple light fields to improve the spatial
resolution. For each capture, the light field sensor is shifted in fractional
micro-lens steps by means of an XY stage for optimal performance.

 <dc:description>  In this work we propose a methodology for an automatic food classification
system which recognizes the contents of the meal from the images of the food.
We developed a multi-layered deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture that takes advantages of the features from other deep networks and
improves the efficiency. Numerous classical handcrafted features and approaches
are explored, among which CNNs are chosen as the best performing features.
Networks are trained and fine-tuned using preprocessed images and the filter
outputs are fused to achieve higher accuracy. Experimental results on the
largest real-world food recognition database ETH Food-101 and newly contributed
Indian food image database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methodology as compared to many other benchmark deep learned CNN frameworks.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic framework for scene learning, recognition
and similarity detection, where scenes are taught via human examples. The
framework allows a robot to: (i) deal with the intrinsic vagueness associated
with determining spatial relations among objects; (ii) infer similarities and
dissimilarities in a set of scenes, and represent them in a hierarchical
structure represented in a Fuzzy ontology. In this paper, we briefly formalize
our approach and we provide a few use cases by way of illustration.
Nevertheless, we discuss how the framework can be used in real-world scenarios.

 <dc:title>Prosodic Features from Large Corpora of Child-Directed Speech as

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The impressive ability of children to acquire language is a widely studied
phenomenon, and the factors influencing the pace and patterns of word learning
remains a subject of active research. Although many models predicting the age
of acquisition of words have been proposed, little emphasis has been directed
to the raw input children achieve. In this work we present a comparatively
large-scale multi-modal corpus of prosody-text aligned child directed speech.
Our corpus contains automatically extracted word-level prosodic features, and
we investigate the utility of this information as predictors of age of
acquisition. We show that prosody features boost predictive power in a
regularized regression, and demonstrate their utility in the context of a
multi-modal factorized language models trained and tested on child-directed
speech.

 <dc:description>  In dynamical systems, local interactions between dynamical units generate
correlations which are stored and transmitted throughout the system, generating
the macroscopic behavior. However a framework to quantify and study this at the
microscopic scale is missing. Here we propose an 'information processing'
framework based on Shannon mutual information quantities between the initial
and future states. We apply it to the 256 elementary cellular automata (ECA),
which are the simplest possible dynamical systems exhibiting behaviors ranging
from simple to complex. Our main finding for ECA is that only a few features
are needed for full predictability and that the 'information integration'
(synergy) feature is always most predictive. Finally we apply the formalism to
foreign exchange (FX) and interest-rate swap (IRS) time series data and find
that the 2008 financial crisis marks a sudden and sustained regime shift (FX
and EUR IRS) resembling tipping point behavior. The USD IRS market exhibits
instead a slow and steady progression which appears consistent with the
hypothesis that this market is (part of) the driving force behind the crisis.
Our work suggests that the proposed framework is a promising way of predicting
emergent complex systemic behaviors in terms of the local information
processing of units.

 <dc:title>A Literature Based Approach to Define the Scope of Biomedical
  Ontologies: A Case Study on a Rehabilitation Therapy Ontology</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this article, we investigate our early attempts at building an ontology
describing rehabilitation therapies following brain injury. These therapies are
wide-ranging, involving interventions of many different kinds. As a result,
these therapies are hard to describe. As well as restricting actual practice,
this is also a major impediment to evidence-based medicine as it is hard to
meaningfully compare two treatment plans.
  Ontology development requires significant effort from both ontologists and
domain experts. Knowledge elicited from domain experts forms the scope of the
ontology. The process of knowledge elicitation is expensive, consumes experts'
time and might have biases depending on the selection of the experts. Various
methodologies and techniques exist for enabling this knowledge elicitation,
including community groups and open development practices. A related problem is
that of defining scope. By defining the scope, we can decide whether a concept
(i.e. term) should be represented in the ontology. This is the opposite of
knowledge elicitation, in the sense that it defines what should not be in the
ontology. This can be addressed by pre-defining a set of competency questions.
  These approaches are, however, expensive and time-consuming. Here, we
describe our work toward an alternative approach, bootstrapping the ontology
from an initially small corpus of literature that will define the scope of the
ontology, expanding this to a set covering the domain, then using information
extraction to define an initial terminology to provide the basis and the
competencies for the ontology. Here, we discuss four approaches to building a
suitable corpus that is both sufficiently covering and precise.

 <dc:title>Combining Prediction of Human Decisions with ISMCTS in Imperfect
  Information Games</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has been extended to many imperfect
information games. However, due to the added complexity that uncertainty
introduces, these adaptations have not reached the same level of practical
success as their perfect information counterparts. In this paper we consider
the development of agents that perform well against humans in imperfect
information games with partially observable actions. We introduce the
Semi-Determinized-MCTS (SDMCTS), a variant of the Information Set MCTS
algorithm (ISMCTS). More specifically, SDMCTS generates a predictive model of
the unobservable portion of the opponent's actions from historical behavioral
data. Next, SDMCTS performs simulations on an instance of the game where the
unobservable portion of the opponent's actions are determined. Thereby, it
facilitates the use of the predictive model in order to decrease uncertainty.
We present an implementation of the SDMCTS applied to the Cheat Game, a
well-known card game, with partially observable (and often deceptive) actions.
Results from experiments with 120 subjects playing a head-to-head Cheat Game
against our SDMCTS agents suggest that SDMCTS performs well against humans, and
its performance improves as the predictive model's accuracy increases.

 <dc:description>  The technical skill of surgeons directly impacts patient outcomes. Advanced
tracking systems enable the development of objective motion-based metrics for
skill evaluation, but these metrics are not sufficient to evaluate the
performance in complex surgical tasks. In this study, we developed metrics for
surgical skill evaluation that are based on the orientation of the surgical
instruments. Experienced robotic surgeons and novice users performed
teleoperated (using the da Vinci Research Kit) and open needle-driving. Task
time and the rate of orientation change successfully distinguished between
experienced surgeons and novice users. Path length and the normalized angular
displacement allowed for a good separation only in part of the experiment. Our
new promising metrics for surgical skill evaluation captured technical aspects
that are taught during surgeons' training. They provide complementing
evaluation to those of classical metrics. Orientation-based metrics add value
to skill assessment and may be an adjunct to classic objective metrics
providing more granular discrimination of skills.

 <dc:description>  In social networks, different users may have different privacy preferences
and there are many users with public identities. Most work on differentially
private social network data publication neglects this fact. We aim to release
the number of public users that a private user connects to within n hops,
called n-range Connection fingerprints(CFPs), under user-level personalized
privacy preferences. We proposed two schemes, Distance-based exponential budget
absorption (DEBA) and Distance-based uniformly budget absorption using Ladder
function (DUBA-LF), for privacy-preserving publication of the CFPs based on
Personalized differential privacy(PDP), and we conducted a theoretical analysis
of the privacy guarantees provided within the proposed schemes. The
implementation showed that the proposed schemes are superior in publication
errors on real datasets.

 <dc:description>  The increasing interconnectivity of industrial networks is one of the central
current hot topics. It is adressed by research institutes, as well as industry.
In order to perform the fourth industrial revolution, a full connectivity
between production facilities is necessary. Due to this connectivity, however,
an abundance of new attack vectors emerges. In the National Reference Project
for Industrial IT-Security (IUNO), these risks and threats are addressed and
solutions are developed. These solutions are especially applicable for small
and medium sized enterprises that have not as much means in staff as well as
money as larger companies. These enterprises should be able to implement the
solutions without much effort. The security solutions are derived from four use
cases and implemented prototypically. A further topic of this work are the
research areas of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence that
address the given challenges, as well as the solutions developed in the context
of IUNO. Aside from the project itself, a method for distributed network data
collection aggregation is presented, as a prerequisite for anomaly detection
for network security.

 <dc:description>  We explore the impact of long-range memory on the properties of a family of
quantum walks in a one-dimensional lattice and discrete time, which can be
understood as the quantum version of the classical &quot;Elephant Random Walk&quot;
non-Markovian process. This Elephant Quantum Walk is robustly superballistic
with the standard deviation showing a constant exponent, $\sigma \propto t^{3/
2}$ , whatever the quantum coin operator, on which the diffusion coefficient is
dependent. On the one hand, this result indicates that contrarily to the
classical case, the degree of superdiffusivity in quantum non- Markovian
processes of this kind is mainly ruled by the extension of memory rather than
other microscopic parameters that explicitly define the process. On the other
hand, these parameters reflect on the diffusion coefficient.

 <dc:description>  Mining dense subgraphs on multi-layer graphs is an interesting problem, which
has witnessed lots of applications in practice. To overcome the limitations of
the quasi-clique-based approach, we propose d-coherent core (d-CC), a new
notion of dense subgraph on multi-layer graphs, which has several elegant
properties. We formalize the diversified coherent core search (DCCS) problem,
which finds k d-CCs that can cover the largest number of vertices. We propose a
greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio of 1 - 1/e and two search
algorithms with an approximation ratio of 1/4. The experiments verify that the
search algorithms are faster than the greedy algorithm and produce comparably
good results as the greedy algorithm in practice. As opposed to the
quasi-clique-based approach, our DCCS algorithms can fast detect larger dense
subgraphs that cover most of the quasi-clique-based results.

 <dc:description>  Context: Refactoring is recognized as an effective practice to maintain
evolving software systems. For software libraries, we study how library
developers refactor their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), especially
when it impacts client users by breaking an API of the library. Objective: Our
work aims to understand how clients that use a library API are affected by
refactoring activities. We target popular libraries that potentially impact
more library client users. Method: We distinguish between library APIs based on
their client-usage (refereed to as client-used APIs) in order to understand the
extent to which API breakages relate to refactorings. Our tool-based approach
allows for a large-scale study across eight libraries (i.e., totaling 183
consecutive versions) with around 900 clients projects. Results: We find that
library maintainers are less likely to break client-used API classes.
Quantitatively, we find that refactoring activities break less than 37% of all
client-used APIs. In a more qualitative analysis, we show two documented cases
of where non-refactoring API breaking changes are motivated other maintenance
issues (i.e., bug fix and new features) and involve more complex refactoring
operations. Conclusion: Using our automated approach, we find that library
developers are less likely to break APIs and tend to break client-used APIs
when addressing these maintenance issues.

 <dc:description>  A wide variety of complex networks (social, biological, information etc.)
exhibit local clustering with substantial variation in the clustering
coefficient (the probability of neighbors being connected). Existing models of
large graphs capture power law degree distributions (Barab\'asi-Albert) and
small-world properties (Watts-Strogatz), but only limited clustering behavior.
We introduce a generalization of the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model of
random graphs which provably achieves a wide range of desired clustering
coefficient, triangle-to-edge and four-cycle-to-edge ratios for any given graph
size and edge density. Rather than choosing edges independently at random, in
the Random Overlapping Communities model, a graph is generated by choosing a
set of random, relatively dense subgraphs (&quot;communities&quot;). We discuss the
explanatory power of the model and some of its consequences.

we significantly speed up the computation by proposing a new optimization

 <dc:description>  In the research area of reinforcement learning (RL), frequently novel and
promising methods are developed and introduced to the RL community. However,
although many researchers are keen to apply their methods on real-world
problems, implementing such methods in real industry environments often is a
frustrating and tedious process. Generally, academic research groups have only
limited access to real industrial data and applications. For this reason, new
methods are usually developed, evaluated and compared by using artificial
software benchmarks. On one hand, these benchmarks are designed to provide
interpretable RL training scenarios and detailed insight into the learning
process of the method on hand. On the other hand, they usually do not share
much similarity with industrial real-world applications. For this reason we
used our industry experience to design a benchmark which bridges the gap
between freely available, documented, and motivated artificial benchmarks and
properties of real industrial problems. The resulting industrial benchmark (IB)
has been made publicly available to the RL community by publishing its Java and
Python code, including an OpenAI Gym wrapper, on Github. In this paper we
motivate and describe in detail the IB's dynamics and identify prototypic
experimental settings that capture common situations in real-world industry
control problems.

 <dc:description>  We study atomic routing games where every agent travels both along its
decided edges and through time. The agents arriving on an edge are first lined
up in a \emph{first-in-first-out} queue and may wait: an edge is associated
with a capacity, which defines how many agents-per-time-step can pop from the
queue's head and enter the edge, to transit for a fixed delay. We show that the
best-response optimization problem is not approximable, and that deciding the
existence of a Nash equilibrium is complete for the second level of the
polynomial hierarchy. Then, we drop the rationality assumption, introduce a
behavioral concept based on GPS navigation, and study its worst-case efficiency
ratio to coordination.

 <dc:title>Surjective H-Colouring over Reflexive Digraphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Surjective H-Colouring problem is to test if a given graph allows a
vertex-surjective homomorphism to a fixed graph H. The complexity of this
problem has been well studied for undirected (partially) reflexive graphs. We
introduce endo-triviality, the property of a structure that all of its
endomorphisms that do not have range of size 1 are automorphisms, as a means to
obtain complexity-theoretic classifications of Surjective H-Colouring in the
case of reflexive digraphs.
  Chen [2014] proved, in the setting of constraint satisfaction problems, that
Surjective H-Colouring is NP-complete if H has the property that all of its
polymorphisms are essentially unary. We give the first concrete application of
his result by showing that every endo-trivial reflexive digraph H has this
property. We then use the concept of endo-triviality to prove, as our main
result, a dichotomy for Surjective H-Colouring when H is a reflexive
tournament: if H is transitive, then Surjective H-Colouring is in NL, otherwise
it is NP-complete.
  By combining this result with some known and new results we obtain a
complexity classification for Surjective H-Colouring when H is a partially
reflexive digraph of size at most 3.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a fundamental problem of scene understanding: how to
parse a scene image into a structured configuration (i.e., a semantic object
hierarchy with object interaction relations). We propose a deep architecture
consisting of two networks: i) a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracting
the image representation for pixel-wise object labeling and ii) a recursive
neural network (RsNN) discovering the hierarchical object structure and the
inter-object relations. Rather than relying on elaborative annotations (e.g.,
manually labeled semantic maps and relations), we train our deep model in a
weakly-supervised learning manner by leveraging the descriptive sentences of
the training images. Specifically, we decompose each sentence into a semantic
tree consisting of nouns and verb phrases, and apply these tree structures to
discover the configurations of the training images. Once these scene
configurations are determined, then the parameters of both the CNN and RsNN are
updated accordingly by back propagation. The entire model training is
accomplished through an Expectation-Maximization method. Extensive experiments
show that our model is capable of producing meaningful and structured scene
configurations, and achieving more favorable scene labeling results on PASCAL
VOC 2012 and SYSU-Scenes datasets compared to other state-of-the-art
weakly-supervised deep learning methods. In particular, SYSU-Scenes is a
dedicated dataset released by us to facilitate further research on scene
parsing, which contains more than 5000 scene images with their sentence-based
semantic descriptions.

 <dc:description>  Privatizing data is a useful strategy for increasing parallelism in a shared
memory multithreaded program. Independent cores can compute independently on
duplicates of shared data, combining their results at the end of their
computations. Conventional approaches to privatization, however, rely on
explicit static or dynamic memory allocation for duplicated state, increasing
memory footprint and contention for cache resources, especially in shared
caches. In this work, we describe CCache, a system for on-demand privatization
of data manipulated by commutative operations. CCache garners the benefits of
privatization, without the increase in memory footprint or cache occupancy.
Each core in CCache dynamically privatizes commutatively manipulated data,
operating on a copy. Periodically or at the end of its computation, the core
merges its value with the value resident in memory, and when all cores have
merged, the in-memory copy contains the up-to-date value. We describe a
low-complexity architectural implementation of CCache that extends a
conventional multicore to support on-demand privatization without using
additional memory for private copies. We evaluate CCache on several high-value
applications, including random access key-value store, clustering, breadth
first search and graph ranking, showing speedups upto 3.2X.

 <dc:description>  Quantification of physiological changes in plants can capture different
drought mechanisms and assist in selection of tolerant varieties in a high
throughput manner. In this context, an accurate 3D model of plant canopy
provides a reliable representation for drought stress characterization in
contrast to using 2D images. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end
pipeline including 3D reconstruction, segmentation and feature extraction,
leveraging deep neural networks at various stages, for drought stress study. To
overcome the high degree of self-similarities and self-occlusions in plant
canopy, prior knowledge of leaf shape based on features from deep siamese
network are used to construct an accurate 3D model using structure from motion
on wheat plants. The drought stress is characterized with a deep network based
feature aggregation. We compare the proposed methodology on several
descriptors, and show that the network outperforms conventional methods.

 <dc:description>  With the ever-growing amounts of textual data from a large variety of
languages, domains, and genres, it has become standard to evaluate NLP
algorithms on multiple datasets in order to ensure consistent performance
across heterogeneous setups. However, such multiple comparisons pose
significant challenges to traditional statistical analysis methods in NLP and
can lead to erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose a Replicability
Analysis framework for a statistically sound analysis of multiple comparisons
between algorithms for NLP tasks. We discuss the theoretical advantages of this
framework over the current, statistically unjustified, practice in the NLP
literature, and demonstrate its empirical value across four applications:
multi-domain dependency parsing, multilingual POS tagging, cross-domain
sentiment classification and word similarity prediction.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the research in
computer vision, due to their ability to capture complex patterns, resulting in
high inference accuracies. However, the increasingly complex nature of these
neural networks means that they are particularly suited for server computers
with powerful GPUs. We envision that deep learning applications will be
eventually and widely deployed on mobile devices, e.g., smartphones,
self-driving cars, and drones. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to understand
the resource requirements (time, memory) of CNNs on mobile devices. First, by
deploying several popular CNNs on mobile CPUs and GPUs, we measure and analyze
the performance and resource usage for every layer of the CNNs. Our findings
point out the potential ways of optimizing the performance on mobile devices.
Second, we model the resource requirements of the different CNN computations.
Finally, based on the measurement, pro ling, and modeling, we build and
evaluate our modeling tool, Augur, which takes a CNN configuration (descriptor)
as the input and estimates the compute time and resource usage of the CNN, to
give insights about whether and how e ciently a CNN can be run on a given
mobile platform. In doing so Augur tackles several challenges: (i) how to
overcome pro ling and measurement overhead; (ii) how to capture the variance in
different mobile platforms with different processors, memory, and cache sizes;
and (iii) how to account for the variance in the number, type and size of
layers of the different CNN configurations.

 <dc:description>  Among the many additive manufacturing (AM) processes for metallic materials,
selective laser melting (SLM) is arguably the most versatile in terms of its
potential to realize complex geometries along with tailored microstructure.
However, the complexity of the SLM process, and the need for predictive
relation of powder and process parameters to the part properties, demands
further development of computational and experimental methods. This review
addresses the fundamental physical phenomena of SLM, with a special emphasis on
the associated thermal behavior. Simulation and experimental methods are
discussed according to three primary categories. First, macroscopic approaches
aim to answer questions at the component level and consider for example the
determination of residual stresses or dimensional distortion effects prevalent
in SLM. Second, mesoscopic approaches focus on the detection of defects such as
excessive surface roughness, residual porosity or inclusions that occur at the
mesoscopic length scale of individual powder particles. Third, microscopic
approaches investigate the metallurgical microstructure evolution resulting
from the high temperature gradients and extreme heating and cooling rates
induced by the SLM process. Consideration of physical phenomena on all of these
three length scales is mandatory to establish the understanding needed to
realize high part quality in many applications, and to fully exploit the
potential of SLM and related metal AM processes.

 <dc:title>Local Directional Relation Pattern for Unconstrained and Robust Face
  Retrieval</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dubey, Shiv Ram</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Face recognition is still a very demanding area of research. This problem
becomes more challenging in unconstrained environment and in the presence of
several variations like pose, illumination, expression, etc. Local descriptors
are widely used for this task. The existing local descriptors are not able to
utilize the wider local information to make the descriptor more discriminative.
The wider local information based descriptors mainly suffer due to the
increased dimensionality. In this paper, this problem is solved by encoding the
relationship among directional neighbors in an efficient manner. The
relationship between the center pixel and the encoded directional neighbors is
utilized further to form the proposed local directional relation pattern
(LDRP). The descriptor is inherently uniform illumination invariant. The
multi-scale mechanism is also adapted to further boost the discriminative
ability of the descriptor. The proposed descriptor is evaluated under the image
retrieval framework over face databases. Very challenging databases like PaSC,
LFW, PubFig, ESSEX, FERET, and AT&amp;T are used to test the discriminative ability
and robustness of LDRP descriptor. Results are also compared with the recent
state-of-the-art face descriptors such as LBP, LTP, LDP, LDN, LVP, DCP, LDGP
and LGHP. Very promising performance is observed using the proposed descriptor
over very appealing face databases as compared to the existing face
descriptors.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of assisting human dispatchers in operating power
grids in today's changing context using machine learning, with theaim of
increasing security and reducing costs. Power networks are highly regulated
systems, which at all times must meet varying demands of electricity with a
complex production system, including conventional power plants, less
predictable renewable energies (such as wind or solar power), and the
possibility of buying/selling electricity on the international market with more
and more actors involved at a Europeanscale. This problem is becoming ever more
challenging in an aging network infrastructure. One of the primary goals of
dispatchers is to protect equipment (e.g. avoid that transmission lines
overheat) with few degrees of freedom: we are considering in this paper solely
modifications in network topology, i.e. re-configuring the way in which lines,
transformers, productions and loads are connected in sub-stations. Using years
of historical data collected by the French Transmission Service Operator (TSO)
&quot;R\'eseau de Transport d'Electricit\'e&quot; (RTE), we develop novel machine
learning techniques (drawing on &quot;deep learning&quot;) to mimic human decisions to
devise &quot;remedial actions&quot; to prevent any line to violate power flow limits
(so-called &quot;thermal limits&quot;). The proposed technique is hybrid. It does not
rely purely on machine learning: every action will be tested with actual
simulators before being proposed to the dispatchers or implemented on the grid.

 <dc:description>  A new multifocus image fusion approach is presented in this paper. First the
contourlet transform is used to decompose the source images into different
components. Then, some salient features are extracted from components. In order
to extract salient features, spatial frequency is used. Subsequently, the best
coefficients from the components are selected by the maximum selection rule.
Finally, the inverse contourlet transform is applied to the selected
coefficients. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  With the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), various
organizations and individuals are debating about the progress of AI as a
blessing or a curse for the future of the society. This paper conducts an
investigation on how the public perceives the progress of AI by utilizing the
data shared on Twitter. Specifically, this paper performs a comparative
analysis on the understanding of users belonging to two categories -- general
AI-Tweeters (AIT) and expert AI-Tweeters (EAIT) who share posts about AI on
Twitter. Our analysis revealed that users from both the categories express
distinct emotions and interests towards AI. Users from both the categories
regard AI as positive and are optimistic about the progress of AI but the
experts are more negative than the general AI-Tweeters. Expert AI-Tweeters
share relatively large percentage of tweets about their personal news compared
to technical aspects of AI. However, the effects of automation on the future
are of primary concern to AIT than to EAIT. When the expert category is
sub-categorized, the emotion analysis revealed that students and industry
professionals have more insights in their tweets about AI than academicians.

 <dc:description>  Controller synthesis techniques for continuous systems with respect to
temporal logic specifications typically use a finite-state symbolic abstraction
of the system. Constructing this abstraction for the entire system is
computationally expensive, and does not exploit natural decompositions of many
systems into interacting components. We have recently introduced a new
relation, called (approximate) disturbance bisimulation for compositional
symbolic abstraction to help scale controller synthesis for temporal logic to
larger systems.
  In this paper, we extend the results to stochastic control systems modeled by
stochastic differential equations. Given any stochastic control system
satisfying a stochastic version of the incremental input-to-state stability
property and a positive error bound, we show how to construct a finite-state
transition system (if there exists one) which is disturbance bisimilar to the
given stochastic control system. Given a network of stochastic control systems,
we give conditions on the simultaneous existence of disturbance bisimilar
abstractions to every component allowing for compositional abstraction of the
network system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose the segmentation of noisy datasets into Multiple Inlier Structures
with a new Robust Estimator (MISRE). The scale of each individual structure is
estimated adaptively from the input data and refined by mean shift, without
tuning any parameter in the process, or manually specifying thresholds for
different estimation problems. Once all the data points were classified into
separate structures, these structures are sorted by their densities with the
strongest inlier structures coming out first. Several 2D and 3D synthetic and
real examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency, robustness and the
limitations of the MISRE algorithm.

 <dc:title>What you lose when you snooze: how duty cycling impacts on the contact

 <dc:description>  In opportunistic networks, putting devices in energy saving mode is crucial
to preserve their battery, and hence to increase the lifetime of the network
and foster user participation. A popular strategy for energy saving is duty
cycling. However, when in energy saving mode, users cannot communicate with
each other. The side effects of duty cycling are twofold. On the one hand, duty
cycling may reduce the number of usable contacts for delivering messages,
increasing intercontact times and delays. On the other hand, duty cycling may
break long contacts into smaller contacts, thus also reducing the capacity of
the opportunistic network. Despite the potential serious effects, the role
played by duty cycling in opportunistic networks has been often neglected in
the literature. In order to fill this gap, in this paper we propose a general
model for deriving the pairwise contact and intercontact times measured when a
duty cycling policy is superimposed on the original encounter process
determined only by node mobility. The model we propose is general, i.e., not
bound to a specific distribution of contact and intercontact times, and very
accurate, as we show exploiting two traces of real human mobility for
validation. Using this model, we derive several interesting results about the
properties of measured contact and intercontact times with duty cycling: their
distribution, how their coefficient of variation changes depending on the duty
cycle value, how the duty cycling affects the capacity and delay of an
opportunistic network. The applicability of these results is broad, ranging
from performance models for opportunistic networks that factor in the duty
cycling effect, to the optimisation of the duty cycle to meet a certain target
performance.

 <dc:description>  Car sharing is one of the key elements of a Mobility-on-Demand system, but it
still suffers from several shortcomings, the most significant of which is the
fleet unbalance during the day. What is typically observed in car sharing
systems, in fact, is a vehicle shortage in so-called hot spots (i.e., areas
with high demand) and vehicle accumulation in cold spots, due to the patterns
in people flows during the day. In this work, we overview the main approaches
to vehicle redistribution based on the type of vehicles the car sharing fleet
is composed of, and we evaluate their performance using a realistic car sharing
demand derived for a suburban area around Lyon, France. The main result of this
paper is that stackable vehicles can achieve a relocation performance close to
that of autonomous vehicles, significantly improving over the no-relocation
approach and over traditional relocation with standard cars.

 <dc:description>  While RANSAC-based methods are robust to incorrect image correspondences
(outliers), their hypothesis generators are not robust to correct image
correspondences (inliers) with positional error (noise). This slows down their
convergence because hypotheses drawn from a minimal set of noisy inliers can
deviate significantly from the optimal model. This work addresses this problem
by introducing ANSAC, a RANSAC-based estimator that accounts for noise by
adaptively using more than the minimal number of correspondences required to
generate a hypothesis. ANSAC estimates the inlier ratio (the fraction of
correct correspondences) of several ranked subsets of candidate correspondences
and generates hypotheses from them. Its hypothesis-generation mechanism
prioritizes the use of subsets with high inlier ratio to generate high-quality
hypotheses. ANSAC uses an early termination criterion that keeps track of the
inlier ratio history and terminates when it has not changed significantly for a
period of time. The experiments show that ANSAC finds good homography and
fundamental matrix estimates in a few iterations, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on two commonly used path assignment policies for agents
traversing a congested network: self-interested routing, and system-optimum
routing. In the self-interested routing policy each agent selects a path that
optimizes its own utility, while the system-optimum routing agents are assigned
paths with the goal of maximizing system performance. This paper considers a
scenario where a centralized network manager wishes to optimize utilities over
all agents, i.e., implement a system-optimum routing policy. In many real-life
scenarios, however, the system manager is unable to influence the route
assignment of all agents due to limited influence on route choice decisions.
Motivated by such scenarios, a computationally tractable method is presented
that computes the minimal amount of agents that the system manager needs to
influence (compliant agents) in order to achieve system optimal performance.
Moreover, this methodology can also determine whether a given set of compliant
agents is sufficient to achieve system optimum and compute the optimal route
assignment for the compliant agents to do so. Experimental results are
presented showing that in several large-scale, realistic traffic networks
optimal flow can be achieved with as low as 13% of the agent being compliant
and up to 54%.

 <dc:description>  In the fillable array problem one must maintain an array A[1..n] of $w$-bit
entries subject to random access reads and writes, and also a
$\texttt{fill}(\Delta)$ operation which sets every entry of to some
$\Delta\in\{0,\ldots,2^w-1\}$. We show that with just one bit of redundancy,
i.e. a data structure using $nw+1$ bits of memory,
$\texttt{read}/\texttt{fill}$ can be implemented in worst case constant time,
and $\texttt{write}$ can be implemented in either amortized constant time
(deterministically) or worst case expected constant (randomized). In the latter
case, we need to store an additional $O(\log n)$ random bits to specify a
permutation drawn from an $1/n^2$-almost pairwise independent family.

 <dc:description>  We document the data transfer workflow, data transfer performance, and other
aspects of staging approximately 56 terabytes of climate model output data from
the distributed Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive to the
National Energy Research Supercomputing Center (NERSC) at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory required for tracking and characterizing extratropical
storms, a phenomena of importance in the mid-latitudes. We present this
analysis to illustrate the current challenges in assembling multi-model data
sets at major computing facilities for large-scale studies of CMIP5 data.
Because of the larger archive size of the upcoming CMIP6 phase of model
intercomparison, we expect such data transfers to become of increasing
importance, and perhaps of routine necessity. We find that data transfer rates
using the ESGF are often slower than what is typically available to US
residences and that there is significant room for improvement in the data
transfer capabilities of the ESGF portal and data centers both in terms of
workflow mechanics and in data transfer performance. We believe performance
improvements of at least an order of magnitude are within technical reach using
current best practices, as illustrated by the performance we achieved in
transferring the complete raw data set between two high performance computing
facilities. To achieve these performance improvements, we recommend: that
current best practices (such as the Science DMZ model) be applied to the data
servers and networks at ESGF data centers; that sufficient financial and human
resources be devoted at the ESGF data centers for systems and network
engineering tasks to support high performance data movement; and that
performance metrics for data transfer between ESGF data centers and major
computing facilities used for climate data analysis be established, regularly
tested, and published.

 <dc:description>  Browser extensions have been established as a common feature present in
modern browsers. However, some extension systems risk exposing APIs which are
too permissive and cohesive with the browser's internal structure, thus leaving
a hole for malicious developers to exploit security critical functionality
within the browser itself. In this paper, we raise the awareness of the threats
caused by browser extensions by presenting a botnet framework based on
malicious extensions installed in the user's browser, and an exhaustive range
of attacks that can be launched in this framework. We systematically
categorize, describe and implement these attacks against Chrome, Firefox and
Firefox-for-Android, and verify experiments on Windows, Linux and Android
systems. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents to date the most
comprehensive analysis about the threats of botnet in modern browsers due to
the over-privileged capabilities possessed by browser extensions. We also
discuss countermeasures to the identified problems.

the topology optimization methods. The problem we seek to solve is the layout
problem. The main novelty of this work is to state the problem as an image

efficient pixel-wise image labeling technique to perform the topology
optimization. We introduce convolutional encoder-decoder architecture and the
overall approach of solving the above-described problem with high performance.
The conducted experiments demonstrate the significant acceleration of the
optimization process. The proposed approach has excellent generalization
properties. We demonstrate the ability of the application of the proposed model
to other problems. The successful results, as well as the drawbacks of the
current method, are discussed.

 <dc:description>  While much of the work in the design of convolutional networks over the last
five years has revolved around the empirical investigation of the importance of
depth, filter sizes, and number of feature channels, recent studies have shown
that branching, i.e., splitting the computation along parallel but distinct
threads and then aggregating their outputs, represents a new promising
dimension for significant improvements in performance. To combat the complexity
of design choices in multi-branch architectures, prior work has adopted simple
strategies, such as a fixed branching factor, the same input being fed to all
parallel branches, and an additive combination of the outputs produced by all
branches at aggregation points.
  In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to
learn the connections between branches in the network. Instead of being chosen
a priori by the human designer, the multi-branch connectivity is learned
simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing a single loss
function defined with respect to the end task. We demonstrate our approach on
the problem of multi-class image classification using three different datasets
where it yields consistently higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
&quot;ResNeXt&quot; multi-branch network given the same learning capacity.

 <dc:description>  Predicting traffic conditions has been recently explored as a way to relieve
traffic congestion. Several pioneering approaches have been proposed based on
traffic observations of the target location as well as its adjacent regions,
but they obtain somewhat limited accuracy due to lack of mining road topology.
To address the effect attenuation problem, we propose to take account of the
traffic of surrounding locations(wider than adjacent range). We propose an
end-to-end framework called DeepTransport, in which Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are utilized to obtain
spatial-temporal traffic information within a transport network topology. In
addition, attention mechanism is introduced to align spatial and temporal
information. Moreover, we constructed and released a real-world large traffic
condition dataset with 5-minute resolution. Our experiments on this dataset
demonstrate our method captures the complex relationship in temporal and
spatial domain. It significantly outperforms traditional statistical methods
and a state-of-the-art deep learning method.

 <dc:description>  In this report, we applied integrated gradients to explaining a neural
network for diabetic retinopathy detection. The integrated gradient is an
attribution method which measures the contributions of input to the quantity of
interest. We explored some new ways for applying this method such as explaining
intermediate layers, filtering out unimportant units by their attribution value
and generating contrary samples. Moreover, the visualization results extend the
use of diabetic retinopathy detection model from merely predicting to assisting
finding potential lesions.

 <dc:description>  In the context of the Electronic Health Record, automated diagnosis coding of
patient notes is a useful task, but a challenging one due to the large number
of codes and the length of patient notes. We investigate four models for
assigning multiple ICD codes to discharge summaries taken from both MIMIC II
and III. We present Hierarchical Attention-GRU (HA-GRU), a hierarchical
approach to tag a document by identifying the sentences relevant for each
label. HA-GRU achieves state-of-the art results. Furthermore, the learned
sentence-level attention layer highlights the model decision process, allows
easier error analysis, and suggests future directions for improvement.

 <dc:title>An attentive neural architecture for joint segmentation and parsing and

 <dc:description>  In this paper we develop a relatively simple and effective neural joint model
that performs both segmentation and dependency parsing. While the model arose
in the context of a particular application, we believe the general idea could
be translated to other settings where both (1) entities have to be identified
from text, and (2) dependency relationships between them. The application we
focus on here is the recently introduced problem of extracting the structured
description, which we name property tree, of a real estate property based on
the textual advertisement: convert an ad to a tree-structure indicating the
buildings, floors, rooms, etc. and how one is part of another. Previous work on
the problem focused on a hand-crafted feature-based pipeline approach
comprising two different modules, solving the two subtasks of the structured
prediction problem: (1) identify important entities of a property (e.g., rooms)
from classifieds and (2) structure them into a tree format. In this work, we
propose a new joint model that is able to tackle the two tasks simultaneously
and construct the property tree by (i) avoiding the error propagation and (ii)
exploiting the interactions between the subtasks. For this purpose, we perform
an extensive comparative study of the pipeline methods and the new proposed
joint model, reporting an improvement of over three percentage points in the
overall edge $F_1$ score of the property tree. Also, we have considered several
attention methods, to encourage our model to focus on salient tokens during the
construction of the property tree. Thus we experimentally demonstrate the
usefulness of attentive neural architectures for the proposed joint model,
showcasing a further improvement of two percentage points in edge $F_1$ score
for our application.

 <dc:description>  Transactive energy systems (TES) are emerging as a transformative solution
for the problems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase in
the use of distributed energy resources and a rapid acceleration in renewable
energy generation. These, on one hand, pose a decentralized power system
controls problem, requiring strategic microgrid control to maintain stability
for the community and for the utility. On the other hand, they require robust
financial markets operating on distributed software platforms that preserve
privacy. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a novel,
blockchain-based transactive energy system. We outline the key requirements and
motivation of this platform, describe the lessons learned, and provide a
description of key architectural components of this system.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, knapsack problems for (in general non-commutative) groups
have attracted attention. In this paper, the knapsack problem for wreath
products is studied. It turns out that decidability of knapsack is not
preserved under wreath product. On the other hand, the class of
knapsack-semilinear groups, where solutions sets of knapsack equations are
effectively semilinear, is closed under wreath product. As a consequence, we
obtain the decidability of knapsack for free solvable groups. Finally, it is
shown that for every non-trivial abelian group $G$, knapsack (as well as the
related subset sum problem) for the wreath product $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$ is
NP-complete.

 <dc:description>  Transactive microgrids are emerging as a transformative solution for the
problems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase in the use
of distributed energy resources and a rapid acceleration in renewable energy
generation, such as wind and solar power. Distributed ledgers have recently
found widespread interest in this domain due to their ability to provide
transactional integrity across decentralized computing nodes. However, the
existing state of the art has not focused on the privacy preservation
requirement of these energy systems -- the transaction level data can provide
much greater insights into a prosumer's behavior compared to smart meter data.
There are specific safety requirements in transactive microgrids to ensure the
stability of the grid and to control the load. To fulfil these requirements,
the distribution system operator needs transaction information from the grid,
which poses a further challenge to the privacy-goals. This problem is made
worse by requirement for off-blockchain communication in these networks. In
this paper, we extend a recently developed trading workflow called PETra and
describe our solution for communication and transactional anonymity.

 <dc:description>  Retouching can significantly elevate the visual appeal of photos, but many
casual photographers lack the expertise to do this well. To address this
problem, previous works have proposed automatic retouching systems based on
supervised learning from paired training images acquired before and after
manual editing. As it is difficult for users to acquire paired images that
reflect their retouching preferences, we present in this paper a deep learning
approach that is instead trained on unpaired data, namely a set of photographs
that exhibits a retouching style the user likes, which is much easier to
collect. Our system is formulated using deep convolutional neural networks that
learn to apply different retouching operations on an input image. Network
training with respect to various types of edits is enabled by modeling these
retouching operations in a unified manner as resolution-independent
differentiable filters. To apply the filters in a proper sequence and with
suitable parameters, we employ a deep reinforcement learning approach that
learns to make decisions on what action to take next, given the current state
of the image. In contrast to many deep learning systems, ours provides users
with an understandable solution in the form of conventional retouching edits,
rather than just a &quot;black box&quot; result. Through quantitative comparisons and
user studies, we show that this technique generates retouching results
consistent with the provided photo set.

 <dc:description>  Batch Normalization (BN) has proven to be an effective algorithm for deep
neural network training by normalizing the input to each neuron and reducing
the internal covariate shift. The space of weight vectors in the BN layer can
be naturally interpreted as a Riemannian manifold, which is invariant to linear
scaling of weights. Following the intrinsic geometry of this manifold provides
a new learning rule that is more efficient and easier to analyze. We also
propose intuitive and effective gradient clipping and regularization methods
for the proposed algorithm by utilizing the geometry of the manifold. The
resulting algorithm consistently outperforms the original BN on various types
of network architectures and datasets.

 <dc:description>  Reward engineering is an important aspect of reinforcement learning. Whether
or not the user's intentions can be correctly encapsulated in the reward
function can significantly impact the learning outcome. Current methods rely on
manually crafted reward functions that often require parameter tuning to obtain
the desired behavior. This operation can be expensive when exploration requires
systems to interact with the physical world. In this paper, we explore the use
of temporal logic (TL) to specify tasks in reinforcement learning. TL formula
can be translated to a real-valued function that measures its level of
satisfaction against a trajectory. We take advantage of this function and
propose temporal logic policy search (TLPS), a model-free learning technique
that finds a policy that satisfies the TL specification. A set of simulated
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of blockchain-enabled IoT applications, there is an increased
need for related software patterns, middleware concepts, and testing practices
to ensure adequate quality and productivity. IoT and blockchain each provide
different design goals, concepts, and practices that must be integrated,
including the distributed actor model and fault tolerance from IoT and
transactive information integrity over untrustworthy sources from blockchain.
Both IoT and blockchain are emerging technologies and both lack codified
patterns and practices for development of applications when combined. This
paper describes PlaTIBART, which is a platform for transactive IoT blockchain
applications with repeatable testing that combines the Actor pattern (which is
a commonly used model of computation in IoT) together with a custom Domain
Specific Language (DSL) and test network management tools. We show how
PlaTIBART has been applied to develop, test, and analyze fault-tolerant IoT
blockchain applications.

 <dc:description>  Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable
energy resources and improvements in battery technology. While these changes
enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management
challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these
challenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging,
which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a
transactive microgrid, &quot;prosumers&quot; (i.e., consumers with energy generation and
storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the
load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide
security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system.
On the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their
trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be
protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the
entire grid. This paper describes Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions
(PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that
enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra
builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for
communication, bidding, and trading.

 <dc:description>  Ambient backscatter communication technology has been introduced recently,
and is then quickly becoming a promising choice for self-sustainable
communication systems as an external power supply or a dedicated carrier
emitter is not required. By leveraging existing RF signal resources, ambient
backscatter technology can support sustainable and independent communications
and consequently open up a whole new set of applications that facilitate
Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this article, we study an integration of ambient
backscatter with wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). We first
present an overview of backscatter communication systems with an emphasis on
the emerging ambient backscatter technology. Then we propose a novel hybrid
transmitter design by combining the advantages of both ambient backscatter and
wireless powered communications. Furthermore, in the cognitive radio
environment, we introduce a multiple access scheme to coordinate the hybrid
data transmissions. The performance evaluation shows that the hybrid
transmitter outperforms traditional designs. In addition, we discuss some open
issues related to the ambient backscatter networking.

 <dc:description>  We study a classic Cournot market, which we extend to a two-stage game with
endogenous cost formation: the retailers' marginal cost represents purchases
from a price-setting, revenue-maximizing supplier. Any demand uncertainty falls
to the supplier, who acts first and sets the wholesale price under incomplete
information concerning the retailers' willingness to pay. We introduce the
generalized mean residual life (GMRL) function of the supplier's belief
distribution F and show that his revenue function is unimodal, if the GMRL
function is decreasing - (DGMRL) property - and F has finite second moment. In
this case, we characterize the supplier's optimal price as a fixed point of his
MRL function and provide a bound on the market-inefficiency due to demand
uncertainty, which is tight over the class of DMRL distributions. We then turn
to the class of DGMRL random variables and study their moments, limiting
behavior, and closure properties. Under the additional assumption that F has a
density, we establish its relationship to the widely used class of increasing
generalized failure rate (IGFR) random variables. If a random variable is IGFR,
then it is DGMRL. We provide a sufficient condition for the converse to be true
and show that the limiting behavior of the GMRL and GFR functions is closely
linked under a reciprocal relationship.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel type system for enforcing secure information flow in an
imperative language. Our work is motivated by the problem of statically
checking potential information leakage in Android applications. To this end, we
design a lightweight type system featuring Android permission model, where the
permissions are statically assigned to applications and are used to enforce
access control in the applications. We take inspiration from a type system by
Banerjee and Naumann (BN) to allow security types to be dependent on the
permissions of the applications. A novel feature of our type system is a typing
rule for conditional branching induced by permission testing, which introduces
a merging operator on security types, allowing more precise security policies
to be enforced. The soundness of our type system is proved with respect to a
notion of noninterference. In addition, a type inference algorithm is presented
for the underlying security type system, by reducing the inference problem to a
constraint solving problem in the lattice of security types.

 <dc:title>How regularization affects the critical points in linear networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the problem of representing and learning a
linear transformation using a linear neural network. In recent years, there has
been a growing interest in the study of such networks in part due to the
successes of deep learning. The main question of this body of research and also
of this paper pertains to the existence and optimality properties of the
critical points of the mean-squared loss function. The primary concern here is
the robustness of the critical points with regularization of the loss function.
An optimal control model is introduced for this purpose and a learning
algorithm (regularized form of backprop) derived for the same using the
Hamilton's formulation of optimal control. The formulation is used to provide a
complete characterization of the critical points in terms of the solutions of a
nonlinear matrix-valued equation, referred to as the characteristic equation.
Analytical and numerical tools from bifurcation theory are used to compute the
critical points via the solutions of the characteristic equation. The main
conclusion is that the critical point diagram can be fundamentally different
even with arbitrary small amounts of regularization.

 <dc:title>Weighted Sum-Throughput Maximization for Energy Harvesting Powered MIMO

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper develops a novel approach to obtaining the optimal scheduling
strategy in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multi-access channel (MAC), where
each transmitter is powered by an individual energy harvesting process. Relying
on the state-of-the-art convex optimization tools, the proposed approach
provides a low-complexity block coordinate ascent algorithm to obtain the
optimal transmission policy that maximizes the weighted sum-throughput for MIMO
MAC. The proposed approach can provide the optimal benchmarks for all practical
schemes in energy-harvesting powered MIMO MAC transmissions. Based on the
revealed structure of the optimal policy, we also propose an efficient online
scheme, which requires only causal knowledge of energy arrival realizations.
Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed novel
scheme.

 <dc:description>  Scene text is an important feature to be extracted, especially in
vision-based mobile robot navigation as many potential landmarks such as
nameplates and information signs contain text. In this paper, a novel two-step
text localization method for Indoor Mobile Robot Navigation is introduced. This
method is based on morphological operators and machine learning techniques and
can be used in real time environments. The proposed method has two steps. At
First, a new set of morphological operators is applied with a particular
sequence to extract high contrast areas that have high probability of text
existence. Using of morphological operators has many advantages such as: high
computation speed, being invariant to several geometrical transformations like
translation, rotations, and scaling, and being able to extract all areas
containing text. After extracting text candidate regions, a set of nine
features are extracted for accurate detection and deletion of the regions that
don't have text. These features are descriptors for texture properties and are
computed in real time. Then, we use a SVM classifier to detect the existence of
text in the region. Performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against a
number of widely used text localization algorithms and the results show that
this method can quickly and effectively localize and extract text regions from
real scenes and can be used in mobile robot navigation under an indoor
environment to detect text based landmarks.

 <dc:description>  Estimation of social influence in networks can be substantially biased in
observational studies due to homophily and network correlation in exposure to
exogenous events. Randomized experiments, in which the researcher intervenes in
the social system and uses randomization to determine how to do so, provide a
methodology for credibly estimating of causal effects of social behaviors. In
addition to addressing questions central to the social sciences, these
estimates can form the basis for effective marketing and public policy.
  In this review, we discuss the design space of experiments to measure social
influence through combinations of interventions and randomizations. We define
an experiment as combination of (1) a target population of individuals
connected by an observed interaction network, (2) a set of treatments whereby
the researcher will intervene in the social system, (3) a randomization
strategy which maps individuals or edges to treatments, and (4) a measurement
of an outcome of interest after treatment has been assigned. We review
experiments that demonstrate potential experimental designs and we evaluate
their advantages and tradeoffs for answering different types of causal
questions about social influence. We show how randomization also provides a
basis for statistical inference when analyzing these experiments.

 <dc:description>  Multi-atlas segmentation approach is one of the most widely-used image
segmentation techniques in biomedical applications. There are two major
challenges in this category of methods, i.e., atlas selection and label fusion.
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-atlas segmentation method that
formulates multi-atlas segmentation in a deep learning framework for better
solving these challenges. The proposed method, dubbed deep fusion net (DFN), is
a deep architecture that integrates a feature extraction subnet and a non-local
patch-based label fusion (NL-PLF) subnet in a single network. The network
parameters are learned by end-to-end training strategy for automatically
learning deep features that enable optimal performance in a NL-PLF framework.
Besides, the learned deep features are further utilized in defining a
similarity measure for atlas selection. We evaluate our proposed method on two
public cardiac MR databases of SATA-13 and LV-09 for left ventricle
segmentation, and our learned DFNs with extracted deep features for atlas
selection at testing phase achieve state-of-the-art accuracies, e.g., 0.833 in
averaged Dice metric (ADM) on SATA-13 database and 0.95 in ADM for epicardium
segmentation on LV-09 database. Besides, our method is robust to the
cross-database evaluation, e.g., the DFN learned on LV-09 database achieves
0.815 in ADM on SATA-13 database. We also test our proposed method on Cardiac
Atlas Project (CAP) testing set of MICCAI 2013 SATA Segmentation Challenge, and
our method achieves 0.815 in Dice metric, ranking as the highest result on this
dataset.

 <dc:title>Scaling Author Name Disambiguation with CNF Blocking</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  An author name disambiguation (AND) algorithm identifies a unique author
entity record from all similar or same publication records in scholarly or
similar databases. Typically, a clustering method is used that requires
calculation of similarities between each possible record pair. However, the
total number of pairs grows quadratically with the size of the author database
making such clustering difficult for millions of records. One remedy for this
is a blocking function that reduces the number of pairwise similarity
calculations. Here, we introduce a new way of learning blocking schemes by
using a conjunctive normal form (CNF) in contrast to the disjunctive normal
form (DNF). We demonstrate on PubMed author records that CNF blocking reduces
more pairs while preserving high pairs completeness compared to the previous
methods that use a DNF with the computation time significantly reduced. Thus,
these concepts in scholarly data can be better represented with CNFs. Moreover,
we also show how to ensure that the method produces disjoint blocks so that the
rest of the AND algorithm can be easily paralleled. Our CNF blocking tested on
the entire PubMed database of 80 million author mentions efficiently removes
82.17% of all author record pairs in 10 minutes.

 <dc:description>  This technical report presents an environment representation for use in
vision-based navigation. The representation has two useful properties: 1) it
has constant size, which can enable strong run-time guarantees to be made for
control algorithms using it, and 2) it is structurally similar to a camera
image space, which effectively allows control to operate in the sensor space
rather than employing difficult, and often inaccurate, projections into a
structurally different control space (e.g. Euclidean). The presented
representation is intended to form the basis of a vision-based subsumption
control architecture.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a
consensus ranking order over a collection of objects. We use the popular
Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model which allows us to probabilistically describe
pairwise comparisons between objects. In particular, we employ the Bayesian BTL
model which allows for meaningful prior assumptions and to cope with situations
where the number of objects is large and the number of comparisons between some
objects is small or even zero. For the conventional Bayesian BTL model, we
derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the Bayes risk of estimators for
norm-based distortion functions. We compare the information-theoretic lower
bound with the Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound we derive for the case when
the Bayes risk is the mean squared error. We illustrate the utility of the
bounds through simulations by comparing them with the error performance of an
expectation-maximization based inference algorithm proposed for the Bayesian
BTL model. We draw parallels between pairwise comparisons in the BTL model and
inter-player games represented as edges in a comparison graph and analyze the
effect of various graph structures on the lower bounds. We also extend the
information-theoretic and Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds to the more
general Bayesian BTL model which takes into account home-field advantage.

 <dc:description>  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the most common tasks of the natural
language processing. The purpose of NER is to find and classify tokens in text
documents into predefined categories called tags, such as person names,
quantity expressions, percentage expressions, names of locations,
organizations, as well as expression of time, currency and others. Although
there is a number of approaches have been proposed for this task in Russian
language, it still has a substantial potential for the better solutions. In
this work, we studied several deep neural network models starting from vanilla
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) then supplementing it with
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) as well as highway networks and finally adding
external word embeddings. All models were evaluated across three datasets:
Gareev's dataset, Person-1000, FactRuEval-2016. We found that extension of
Bi-LSTM model with CRF significantly increased the quality of predictions.
Encoding input tokens with external word embeddings reduced training time and
allowed to achieve state of the art for the Russian NER task.

 <dc:title>Colored fused filament fabrication</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Song, Haichuan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Filament fused fabrication is the method of choice for printing 3D models at
low cost, and is the de-facto standard for hobbyists, makers and schools.
Unfortunately, filament printers cannot truly reproduce colored objects. The
best current techniques rely on a form of dithering exploiting occlusion, that
was only demonstrated for shades of two base colors and that behaves
differently depending on surface slope.
  We explore a novel approach for 3D printing colored objects, capable of
creating controlled gradients of varying sharpness. Our technique exploits
off-the-shelves nozzles that are designed to mix multiple filaments in a small
melting chamber, obtaining intermediate colors once the mix is stabilized.
  We exploit this property to produce color gradients. We divide each input
layer into a set of sublayers, each having a different constant color. By
locally changing the thickness of the sublayers, we change the color that is
perceived at a given location. By optimizing the choice of colors of each
sublayer, we further improve quality and allow the use of different numbers of
input filaments.
  We demonstrate our results by building a functional color printer using low
cost, off-the-shelves components. Using our tool a user can paint a 3D model
and directly produce its physical counterpart, using any material and color
available for fused filament fabrication.

 <dc:title>Realtime State Estimation with tactile and visual sensing. Application
  to Planar Manipulation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Kuan-Ting</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rodriguez, Alberto</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Accurate and robust object state estimation enables successful object
manipulation. Visual sensing is widely used to estimate object poses. However,
in a cluttered scene or in a tight workspace, the robot's end-effector often
occludes the object from the visual sensor. The robot then loses visual
feedback and must fall back on open-loop execution.
  In this paper, we integrate both tactile and visual input using a framework
for solving the SLAM problem, iSAM (incremental smoothing and mapping), to
provide a fast and flexible solution. Visual sensing provides global pose
information but is noisy in general, whereas contact sensing is local, but its
measurements are more accurate relative to the end-effector. By combining them,
we aim to exploit their advantages and overcome their limitations. We explore
the technique in the context of a pusher-slider system. We adapt iSAM's
measurement cost and motion cost to the pushing scenario, and use an
instrumented setup to evaluate the estimation quality with different object
shapes, on different surface materials, and under different contact modes.

 <dc:title>Analytic Formulas for Renyi Entropy of Hidden Markov Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Breitner, Joachim</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Skorski, Maciej</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Determining entropy rates of stochastic processes is a fundamental and
difficult problem, with closed-form solutions known only for specific cases.
This paper pushes the state-of-the-art by solving the problem for Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) and Renyi entropies.
  While the problem for Markov chains reduces to studying the growth of a
matrix product, computations for HMMs involve \emph{products of random
matrices}. As a result, this case is much harder and no explicit formulas have
been known so far. We show how to circumvent this issue for Renyi entropy of
integer orders, reducing the problem again to a \emph{single matrix products}
where the matrix is formed from transition and emission probabilities by means
of tensor product.
  To obtain results in the asymptotic setting, we use a novel technique for
determining the growth of non-negative matrix powers. The classical approach is
the Frobenius-Perron theory, but it requires positivity assumptions; we instead
work directly with the spectral formula. As a consequence, our results do not
suffer from limitations such as irreducibility and aperiodicity. This improves
our understanding of the entropy rate even for standard (unhidden) Markov
chains.
  A recently published side-channel attack against RSA was proven effective
using our result, specialized to order 2.

 <dc:title>Functional Characterization of Deformation Fields</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Corman, Etienne</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ovsjanikov, Maks</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a novel representation for deformation fields of 3D
shapes, by considering the induced changes in the underlying metric. In
particular, our approach allows to represent a deformation field in a
coordinate-free way as a linear operator acting on real-valued functions
defined on the shape. Such a representation both provides a way to relate
deformation fields to other classical functional operators and enables analysis
and processing of deformation fields using standard linear-algebraic tools.
This opens the door to a wide variety of applications such as explicitly adding
extrinsic information into the computation of functional maps, intrinsic shape
symmetrization, joint deformation design through precise control of metric
distortion, and coordinate-free deformation transfer without requiring
pointwise correspondences. Our method is applicable to both surface and
volumetric shape representations and we guarantee the equivalence between the
operator-based and standard deformation field representation under mild
genericity conditions in the discrete setting. We demonstrate the utility of
our approach by comparing it with existing techniques and show how our
representation provides a powerful toolbox for a wide variety of challenging
problems.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on the modeling of musical melodies as networks. Notes of
a melody can be treated as nodes of a network. Connections are created whenever
notes are played in sequence. We analyze some main tracks coming from different
music genres, with melodies played using different musical instruments. We find
out that the considered networks are, in general, scale free networks and
exhibit the small world property. We measure the main metrics and assess
whether these networks can be considered as formed by sub-communities. Outcomes
confirm that peculiar features of the tracks can be extracted from this
analysis methodology. This approach can have an impact in several multimedia
applications such as music didactics, multimedia entertainment, and digital
music generation.

 <dc:description>  In addition to hardware wall-time restrictions commonly seen in
high-performance computing systems, it is likely that future systems will also
be constrained by energy budgets. In the present work, finite difference
algorithms of varying computational and memory intensity are evaluated with
respect to both energy efficiency and runtime on an Intel Ivy Bridge CPU node,
an Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing processor, and an NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU. The
conventional way of storing the discretised derivatives to global arrays for
solution advancement is found to be inefficient in terms of energy consumption
and runtime. In contrast, a class of algorithms in which the discretised
derivatives are evaluated on-the-fly or stored as thread-/process-local
variables (yielding high compute intensity) is optimal both with respect to
energy consumption and runtime. On all three hardware architectures considered,
a speed-up of ~2 and an energy saving of ~2 are observed for the high compute
intensive algorithms compared to the memory intensive algorithm. The energy
consumption is found to be proportional to runtime, irrespective of the power
consumed and the GPU has an energy saving of ~5 compared to the same algorithm
on a CPU node.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental problem in neuroscience is to characterize the dynamics of
spiking from the neurons in a circuit that is involved in learning about a
stimulus or a contingency. A key limitation of current methods to analyze
neural spiking data is the need to collapse neural activity over time or
trials, which may cause the loss of information pertinent to understanding the
function of a neuron or circuit. We introduce a new method that can determine
not only the trial-to-trial dynamics that accompany the learning of a
contingency by a neuron, but also the latency of this learning with respect to
the onset of a conditioned stimulus. The backbone of the method is a separable
two-dimensional (2D) random field (RF) model of neural spike rasters, in which
the joint conditional intensity function of a neuron over time and trials
depends on two latent Markovian state sequences that evolve separately but in
parallel. Classical tools to estimate state-space models cannot be applied
readily to our 2D separable RF model. We develop efficient statistical and
computational tools to estimate the parameters of the separable 2D RF model. We
apply these to data collected from neurons in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) in
an experiment designed to characterize the neural underpinnings of the
associative learning of fear in mice. Overall, the separable 2D RF model
provides a detailed, interpretable, characterization of the dynamics of neural
spiking that accompany the learning of a contingency.

 <dc:description>  Robot-assisted dressing offers an opportunity to benefit the lives of many
people with disabilities, such as some older adults. However, robots currently
lack common sense about the physical implications of their actions on people.
The physical implications of dressing are complicated by non-rigid garments,
which can result in a robot indirectly applying high forces to a person's body.
We present a deep recurrent model that, when given a proposed action by the
robot, predicts the forces a garment will apply to a person's body. We also
show that a robot can provide better dressing assistance by using this model
with model predictive control. The predictions made by our model only use
haptic and kinematic observations from the robot's end effector, which are
readily attainable. Collecting training data from real world physical
human-robot interaction can be time consuming, costly, and put people at risk.
Instead, we train our predictive model using data collected in an entirely
self-supervised fashion from a physics-based simulation. We evaluated our
approach with a PR2 robot that attempted to pull a hospital gown onto the arms
of 10 human participants. With a 0.2s prediction horizon, our controller
succeeded at high rates and lowered applied force while navigating the garment
around a persons fist and elbow without getting caught. Shorter prediction
horizons resulted in significantly reduced performance with the sleeve catching
on the participants' fists and elbows, demonstrating the value of our model's
predictions. These behaviors of mitigating catches emerged from our deep
predictive model and the controller objective function, which primarily
penalizes high forces.

 <dc:description>  For a graph $H$, a graph $G$ is an $H$-graph if it is an intersection graph
of connected subgraphs of some subdivision of $H$. $H$-graphs naturally
generalize several important graph classes like interval or circular-arc graph.
This class was introduced in the early 1990s by B\'i r\'o, Hujter, and Tuza.
Very recently, Chaplick et al. initiated the algorithmic study of $H$-graphs by
showing that a number of fundamental optimization problems are solvable in
polynomial time on $H$-graphs. We extend and complement these algorithmic
findings in several directions.
  First we show that for every fixed $H$, the class of $H$-graphs is of
logarithmically-bounded boolean-width. Pipelined with the plethora of known
algorithms on graphs of bounded boolean-width, this describes a large class of
problems solvable in polynomial time on $H$-graphs. We also observe that
$H$-graphs are graphs with polynomially many minimal separators. Combined with
the work of Fomin, Todinca and Villanger on algorithmic properties of such
classes of graphs, this identify another wide class of problems solvable in
polynomial time on $H$-graphs.
  The most fundamental optimization problems among the problems solvable in
polynomial time on $H$-graphs are Maximum Clique, Maximum Independent Set, and
Minimum Dominating Set. We provide a more refined complexity analysis of these
problems from the perspective of Parameterized Complexity. We show that Maximum
Independent Set, and Minimum Dominating Set are W[1]-hard being parameterized
by the size of $H$ and the size of the solution. On the other hand, we prove
that when $H$ is a tree, then Minimum Dominating Set is fixed-parameter
tractable parameterized (FPT) by the size of $H$.
  For Maximum Clique we show that it is W[1]-hard parameterized by the size of
$H$ but admits a polynomial kernel parameterized by $H$ and the solution size.

 <dc:description>  Effective collaboration between a robot and a person requires natural
communication. When a robot travels with a human companion, the robot should be
able to explain its navigation behavior in natural language. This paper
explains how a cognitively-based, autonomous robot navigation system produces
informative, intuitive explanations for its decisions. Language generation here
is based upon the robot's commonsense, its qualitative reasoning, and its
learned spatial model. This approach produces natural explanations in real time
for a robot as it navigates in a large, complex indoor environment.

 <dc:description>  Previous studies have demonstrated the empirical success of word embeddings
in various applications. In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning
distributed representations for text documents which many machine learning
algorithms take as input for a number of NLP tasks.
  We propose a neural network model, KeyVec, which learns document
representations with the goal of preserving key semantics of the input text. It
enables the learned low-dimensional vectors to retain the topics and important
information from the documents that will flow to downstream tasks. Our
empirical evaluations show the superior quality of KeyVec representations in
two different document understanding tasks.

we show that for any $(P_6,C_4)$-free graph $G$ it holds that $\chi(G)\le
\frac{3}{2}\omega(G)$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ are the chromatic number
and clique number of $G$, respectively. %Our bound is attained by $C_5$ and the
Petersen graph. Our bound is attained by several graphs, for instance, the
five-cycle, the Petersen graph, the Petersen graph with an additional universal
vertex, and all $4$-critical $(P_6,C_4)$-free graphs other than $K_4$ (see
\cite{HH17}). The new result unifies previously known results on the existence
of linear $\chi$-binding functions for several graph classes. Our proof is
based on a novel structure theorem on $(P_6,C_4)$-free graphs that do not
contain clique cutsets. Using this structure theorem we also design a
polynomial time $3/2$-approximation algorithm for coloring $(P_6,C_4)$-free
graphs. Our algorithm computes a coloring with $\frac{3}{2}\omega(G)$ colors
for any $(P_6,C_4)$-free graph $G$ in $O(n^2m)$ time.

 <dc:description>  Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of medical images in large datasets to
identify similar images when a query image is given can be very useful in
improving the diagnostic decision of the clinical experts and as well in
educational scenarios. In this paper, we used two stage classification and
retrieval approach to retrieve similar images. First, the Gabor filters are
applied to Radon-transformed images to extract features and to train a
multi-class SVM. Then based on the classification results and using an
extracted Gabor barcode, similar images are retrieved. The proposed method was
tested on IRMA dataset which contains more than 14,000 images. Experimental
results show the efficiency of our approach in retrieving similar images
compared to other Gabor-Radon-oriented methods.

 <dc:description>  Efficient and accurate state estimation is essential for the optimal
management of the future smart grid. However, to meet the requirements of
deploying the future grid at a large scale, the state estimation algorithm must
be able to accomplish two major tasks: (1) combining measurement data with
different qualities to attain an optimal state estimate and (2) dealing with
the large number of measurement data rendered by meter devices. To address
these two tasks, we first propose a practical solution using a very short word
length to represent a partial measurement of the system state in the meter
device to reduce the amount of data. We then develop a unified probabilistic
framework based on a Bayesian belief inference to incorporate measurements of
different qualities to obtain an optimal state estimate. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms other linear
estimators in different test scenarios. These findings indicate that the
proposed scheme not only has the ability to integrate data with different
qualities but can also decrease the amount of data that needs to be transmitted
and processed.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject
to a knapsack constraint. Our main contribution is an algorithm that achieves a
nearly-optimal, $1 - 1/e - \epsilon$ approximation, using
$(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon^4)} n \log^2{n}$ function evaluations and
arithmetic operations. Our algorithm is impractical but theoretically
interesting, since it overcomes a fundamental running time bottleneck of the
multilinear extension relaxation framework. This is the main approach for
obtaining nearly-optimal approximation guarantees for important classes of
constraints but it leads to $\Omega(n^2)$ running times, since evaluating the
multilinear extension is expensive. Our algorithm maintains a fractional
solution with only a constant number of entries that are strictly fractional,
which allows us to overcome this obstacle.

 <dc:description>  Securing the physical components of a city's interdependent critical
infrastructure (ICI) such as power, natural gas, and water systems is a
challenging task due to their interdependence and large number of involved
sensors. Using a novel integrated state-space model that captures the
interdependence, a two-stage cyber attack on ICI is studied in which the
attacker first compromises the ICI's sensors by decoding their messages, and,
subsequently, it alters the compromised sensors' data to cause state estimation
errors. To thwart such attacks, the administrator of the CIs must assign
protection levels to the sensors based on their importance in the state
estimation process. To capture the interdependence between the attacker and the
ICI administrator's actions and analyze their interactions, a Colonel Blotto
game framework is proposed. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of this game is
derived analytically. At this equilibrium, it is shown that the administrator
can strategically randomize between the protection levels of the sensors to
deceive the attacker. Simulation results coupled with theoretical analysis show
that, using the proposed game, the administrator can reduce the state
estimation error by at least $ 50\% $ compared to any non-strategic action. The
results also show that the ICI's administrator must consider the CIs inside a
city as a unified ICI for security analysis instead of assigning independent
protection levels to each individual CI, as is conventionally done.

 <dc:description>  Erasure codes play an important role in storage systems to prevent data loss.
In this work, we study a class of erasure codes called Multi-Erasure Locally
Recoverable Codes (ME-LRCs) for storage arrays. Compared to previous related
works, we focus on the construction of ME-LRCs over small fields. We first
develop upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of ME-LRCs. Our main
contribution is to propose a general construction of ME-LRCs based on
generalized tensor product codes, and study their erasure-correcting
properties. A decoding algorithm tailored for erasure recovery is given, and
correctable erasure patterns are identified. We then prove that our
construction yields optimal ME-LRCs with a wide range of code parameters, and
present some explicit ME-LRCs over small fields. Finally, we show that
generalized integrated interleaving (GII) codes can be treated as a subclass of
generalized tensor product codes, thus defining the exact relation between
these codes.

 <dc:description>  The central aim of most fields of data analysis and experimental scientific
investigation is to draw valid conclusions from a given data set. But when past
inferences guide future inquiries into the same dataset, reaching valid
inferences becomes significantly more difficult. In addition to avoiding the
overfitting that can result from adaptive analysis, a data analyst often wants
to use as little time and data as possible. A recent line of work in the theory
community has established mechanisms that provide low generalization error on
adaptive queries, yet there remain large gaps between established theoretical
results and how data analysis is done in practice. Many practitioners, for
instance, successfully employ bootstrapping and related sampling approaches in
order to maintain validity and speed up analysis, but prior to this work, no
theoretical analysis existed to justify employing such techniques in this
adaptive setting.
  In this paper, we show how these techniques can be used to provably guarantee
validity while speeding up analysis. Through this investigation, we initiate
the study of sub-linear time mechanisms to answer adaptive queries into
datasets. Perhaps surprisingly, we describe mechanisms that provide an
exponential speed-up per query over previous mechanisms, without needing to
increase the total amount of data needed for low generalization error. We also
provide a method for achieving statistically-meaningful responses even when the
mechanism is only allowed to see a constant number of samples from the data per
query.

 <dc:description>  Automatic skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopic images is an essential step
in computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. However, this task is challenging due
to significant variations of lesion appearances across different patients. This
challenge is further exacerbated when dealing with a large amount of image
data. In this paper, we extended our previous work by developing a deeper
network architecture with smaller kernels to enhance its discriminant capacity.
In addition, we explicitly included color information from multiple color
spaces to facilitate network training and thus to further improve the
segmentation performance. We extensively evaluated our method on the ISBI 2017
skin lesion segmentation challenge. By training with the 2000 challenge
training images, our method achieved an average Jaccard Index (JA) of 0.765 on
the 600 challenge testing images, which ranked itself in the first place in the
challenge

 <dc:description>  Parallel sentence extraction is a task addressing the data sparsity problem
found in multilingual natural language processing applications. We propose an
end-to-end deep neural network approach to detect translational equivalence
between sentences in two different languages. In contrast to previous
approaches, which typically rely on multiples models and various word alignment
features, by leveraging continuous vector representation of sentences we remove
the need of any domain specific feature engineering. Using a siamese
bidirectional recurrent neural networks, our results against a strong baseline
based on a state-of-the-art parallel sentence extraction system show a
significant improvement in both the quality of the extracted parallel sentences
and the translation performance of statistical machine translation systems. We
believe this study is the first one to investigate deep learning for the
parallel sentence extraction task.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Pareto Local Search (PLS) is a basic building block in many multiobjective
metaheuristics. In this paper, Parallel Pareto Local Search based on
Decomposition (PPLS/D) is proposed. PPLS/D decomposes the original search space
into L subregions and executes L parallel search processes in these subregions
simultaneously. Inside each subregion, the PPLS/D process is first guided by a
scalar objective function to approach the Pareto set quickly, then it finds
non-dominated solutions in this subregion. Our experimental studies on the
multiobjective Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming problems (mUBQPs)
with two to four objectives demonstrate the efficiency of PPLS/D. We
investigate the behavior of PPLS/D to understand its working mechanism.
Moreover, we propose a variant of PPLS/D called PPLS/D with Adaptive Expansion
(PPLS/D-AE), in which each process can search other subregions after it
converges in its own subregion. Its advantages and disadvantages have been
studied.

 <dc:description>  We study Sigma-Delta quantization methods coupled with appropriate
reconstruction algorithms for digitizing randomly sampled low-rank matrices. We
show that the reconstruction error associated with our methods decays
polynomially with the oversampling factor, and we leverage our results to
obtain root-exponential accuracy by optimizing over the choice of quantization
scheme. Additionally, we show that a random encoding scheme, applied to the
quantized measurements, yields a near-optimal exponential bit-rate. As an added
benefit, our schemes are robust both to noise and to deviations from the
low-rank assumption. In short, we provide a full generalization of analogous
results, obtained in the classical setup of bandlimited function acquisition,
and more recently, in the finite frame and compressed sensing setups to the
case of low-rank matrices sampled with sub-Gaussian linear operators. Finally,
we believe our techniques for generalizing results from the compressed sensing
setup to the analogous low-rank matrix setup is applicable to other
quantization schemes.

 <dc:description>  Let $G$ be a simple graph on $n$ vertices. We consider the problem LIS of
deciding whether there exists an induced subtree with exactly $i \leq n$
vertices and $\ell$ leaves in $G$. We study the associated optimization
problem, that consists in computing the maximal number of leaves, denoted by
$L_G(i)$, realized by an induced subtree with $i$ vertices, for $0 \le i \le
n$. We begin by proving that the LIS problem is NP-complete in general and then
we compute the values of the map $L_G$ for some classical families of graphs
and in particular for the $d$-dimensional hypercubic graphs $Q_d$, for $2 \leq
d \leq 6$. We also describe a nontrivial branch and bound algorithm that
computes the function $L_G$ for any simple graph $G$. In the special case where
$G$ is a tree of maximum degree $\Delta$, we provide a $\mathcal{O}(n^3\Delta)$
time and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ space algorithm to compute the function $L_G$.

surprisingly natural, efficient to collect and reflective of relevant and/or
trending topics. These self-dialogues provide training data for a generative
neural network as well as a basis for soft rules used by a matching score
component. Each match of a soft rule against a user utterance is associated
with a confidence score which we show is strongly indicative of reply quality,
allowing this component to self-censor and be effectively integrated with other
components. Edina's full architecture features a rule-based system backing off
to a matching score, backing off to a generative neural network. Our hybrid
data-driven methodology thus addresses both coverage limitations of a strictly
rule-based approach and the lack of guarantees of a strictly machine-learning
approach.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown impressive performance in
generating photo-realistic images. They fit generative models by minimizing
certain distance measure between the real image distribution and the generated
data distribution. Several distance measures have been used, such as
Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-divergence, and Wasserstein distance, and
choosing an appropriate distance measure is very important for training the
generative network. In this paper, we choose to use the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the distance metric, which has several nice theoretical
guarantees. In fact, generative moment matching network (GMMN) (Li, Swersky,
and Zemel 2015) is such a generative model which contains only one generator
network $G$ trained by directly minimizing MMD between the real and generated
distributions. However, it fails to generate meaningful samples on challenging
benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and LSUN. To improve on GMMN, we propose
to add an extra network $F$, called mapper. $F$ maps both real data
distribution and generated data distribution from the original data space to a
feature representation space $\mathcal{R}$, and it is trained to maximize MMD
between the two mapped distributions in $\mathcal{R}$, while the generator $G$
tries to minimize the MMD. We call the new model generative adversarial mapping
networks (GAMNs). We demonstrate that the adversarial mapper $F$ can help $G$
to better capture the underlying data distribution. We also show that GAMN
significantly outperforms GMMN, and is also superior to or comparable with
other state-of-the-art GAN based methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Bedrooms
datasets.

 <dc:description>  Recent work has shown impressive success in transferring painterly style to
images. These approaches, however, fall short of photorealistic style transfer.
Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still
exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. In this paper we propose an
approach that takes as input a stylized image and makes it more photorealistic.
It relies on the Screened Poisson Equation, maintaining the fidelity of the
stylized image while constraining the gradients to those of the original input
image. Our method is fast, simple, fully automatic and shows positive progress
in making a stylized image photorealistic. Our results exhibit finer details
and are less prone to artifacts than the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Because of the data deluge in scientific publication, finding relevant
information is getting harder and harder for researchers and readers. Building
an enhanced scientific search engine by taking semantic relations into account
poses a great challenge. As a starting point, semantic relations between
keywords from scientific articles could be extracted in order to classify
articles. This might help later in the process of browsing and searching for
content in a meaningful scientific way. Indeed, by connecting keywords, the
context of the article can be extracted. This paper aims to provide ideas to
build such a smart search engine and describes the initial contributions
towards achieving such an ambitious goal.

 <dc:title>Heuristic Online Goal Recognition in Continuous Domains</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Goal recognition is the problem of inferring the goal of an agent, based on
its observed actions. An inspiring approach - plan recognition by planning
(PRP) - uses off-the-shelf planners to dynamically generate plans for given
goals, eliminating the need for the traditional plan library. However, existing
PRP formulation is inherently inefficient in online recognition, and cannot be
used with motion planners for continuous spaces. In this paper, we utilize a
different PRP formulation which allows for online goal recognition, and for
application in continuous spaces. We present an online recognition algorithm,
where two heuristic decision points may be used to improve run-time
significantly over existing work. We specify heuristics for continuous domains,
prove guarantees on their use, and empirically evaluate the algorithm over
hundreds of experiments in both a 3D navigational environment and a cooperative
robotic team task.

 <dc:description>  Bio-inspired algorithms have received a significant amount of attention in

observation of two major survival rules of a species of woodlice, i.e.,
porcellio scaber, we design and propose an algorithm called the porcellio

differentiable and non-differential ones as well as the case with local
optimums. Numerical results based on benchmark problems are presented to

 <dc:description>  Exploiting multiple modalities for semantic scene parsing has been shown to
improve accuracy over the singlemodality scenario. However multimodal datasets
often suffer from problems such as data misalignment and label inconsistencies,
where the existing methods assume that corresponding regions in two modalities
must have identical labels. We propose to address this issue, by formulating
multimodal semantic labeling as inference in a CRF and introducing latent nodes
to explicitly model inconsistencies between two modalities. These latent nodes
allow us not only to leverage information from both domains to improve their
labeling, but also to cut the edges between inconsistent regions. We propose to
learn intradomain and inter-domain potential functions from training data to
avoid hand-tuning of the model parameters. We evaluate our approach on two
publicly available datasets containing 2D and 3D data. Thanks to our latent
nodes and our learning strategy, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in
both cases. Moreover, in order to highlight the benefits of the geometric
information and the potential of our method in simultaneous 2D/3D semantic and
geometric inference, we performed simultaneous inference of semantic and
geometric classes both in 2D and 3D that led to satisfactory improvements of
the labeling results in both datasets.

 <dc:description>  The reliable measurement of confidence in classifiers' predictions is very
important for many applications and is, therefore, an important part of
classifier design. Yet, although deep learning has received tremendous
attention in recent years, not much progress has been made in quantifying the
prediction confidence of neural network classifiers. Bayesian models offer a
mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but
usually come with prohibitive computational costs. In this paper we propose a
simple, scalable method to achieve a reliable confidence score, based on the
data embedding derived from the penultimate layer of the network. We
investigate two ways to achieve desirable embeddings, by using either a
distance-based loss or Adversarial Training. We then test the benefits of our
method when used for classification error prediction, weighting an ensemble of
classifiers, and novelty detection. In all tasks we show significant
improvement over traditional, commonly used confidence scores.

 <dc:description>  The analysis of enormous datasets with missing data entries is a standard
task in biological and medical data processing. Large-scale, multi-institution
clinical studies are the typical examples of such datasets. These sets make
possible the search for multi-parametric relations since from the plenty of the
data one is likely to find a satisfying number of subjects with the required
parameter ensembles. Specifically, finding combinatorial biomarkers for some
given condition also needs a very large dataset to analyze. For this goal,
statistical regression analysis is not the preferred tool of choice, since (i)
the {\em a priori} knowledge of the parameter-sets to analyze is missing, and
(ii) typically relatively few subjects have the interesting parameter-value
ensembles for the analysis. For fast and automatic multi-parametric relation
discovery association-rule finding tools are used for more than two decades in
the data-mining community. Here we present the SCARF webserver for {\em
generalized} association rule mining. Association rules are of the form: $a$
AND $b$ AND ... AND $x \rightarrow y$, meaning that the presence of properties
$a$ AND $b$ AND ... AND $x$ implies property $y$; our algorithm finds
generalized association rules, since it also finds logical disjunctions (i.e.,
ORs) at the left-hand side, allowing the discovery of more complex rules in a
more compressed form in the database. This feature also helps reducing the
typically very large result-tables of such studies, since allowing ORs in the
left-hand side of a single rule could include dozens of classical rules. The
capabilities of the SCARF algorithm were demonstrated in mining the Alzheimer's
database of the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) in our recent
publication (Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Vol. 73, pp. 300-307,
2017). Here we describe the webserver implementation of the algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Long quasi-cyclic codes of any fixed index $&gt;1$ have been shown to be
asymptotically good, depending on Artin primitive root conjecture in (A.
Alahmadi, C. G\&quot;uneri, H. Shoaib, P. Sol\'e, 2017). We use this recent result
to construct good long additive cyclic codes on any extension of fixed degree
of the base field. Similarly self-dual double circulant codes, and self-dual
four circulant codes, have been shown to be good, also depending on Artin
primitive root conjecture in (A. Alahmadi, F. \&quot;Ozdemir, P. Sol\'e, 2017) and (
M. Shi, H. Zhu, P. Sol\'e, 2017) respectively. Building on these recent
results, we can show that long cyclic codes are good over $\F_q,$ for many
classes of $q$'s. This is a partial solution to a fifty year old open problem.

 <dc:description>  We propose a theoretical framework for thinking about score normalization,
which confirms that normalization is not needed under (admittedly fragile)
ideal conditions. If, however, these conditions are not met, e.g. under
data-set shift between training and runtime, our theory reveals dependencies
between scores that could be exploited by strategies such as score
normalization. Indeed, it has been demonstrated over and over experimentally,
that various ad-hoc score normalization recipes do work. We present a first
attempt at using probability theory to design a generative score-space
normalization model which gives similar improvements to ZT-norm on the
text-dependent RSR 2015 database.

communication gap between visually impaired people and the society. Braille
remains the most popular tactile reading code even in this century. There are
numerous amount of literature locked up in Braille. Braille recognition not
only reduces time in reading or extracting information from Braille document
but also helps people engaged in special education for correcting papers and
other school related works. The availability of such a system will enhance
communication and collaboration possibilities with visually impaired people.
Existing works supports only documents in white either bright or dull in
colour. Hardly any work could be traced on hand printed ordinary documents in
Braille.

 <dc:description>  We study classic cake-cutting problems, but in discrete models rather than
using infinite-precision real values, specifically, focusing on their
communication complexity. Using general discrete simulations of classical
infinite-precision protocols (Robertson-Webb and moving-knife), we roughly
partition the various fair-allocation problems into 3 classes: &quot;easy&quot; (constant
number of rounds of logarithmic many bits), &quot;medium&quot; (poly-logarithmic total
communication), and &quot;hard&quot;. Our main technical result concerns two of the
&quot;medium&quot; problems (perfect allocation for 2 players and equitable allocation
for any number of players) which we prove are not in the &quot;easy&quot; class. Our main
open problem is to separate the &quot;hard&quot; from the &quot;medium&quot; classes.

 <dc:description>  We report on an extensive study of the current benefits and limitations of
deep learning approaches to robot vision and introduce a novel dataset used for
our investigation. To avoid the biases in currently available datasets, we
consider a human-robot interaction setting to design a data-acquisition
protocol for visual object recognition on the iCub humanoid robot. Considering
the performance of off-the-shelf models trained on off-line large-scale image
retrieval datasets, we show the necessity for knowledge transfer. Indeed, we
analyze different ways in which this last step can be done, and identify the
major bottlenecks in robotics scenarios. By studying both object categorization
and identification tasks, we highlight the key differences between object
recognition in robotics and in image retrieval tasks, for which the considered
deep learning approaches have been originally designed. In a nutshell, our
results confirm also in the considered setting the remarkable improvements
yield by deep learning, while pointing to specific open challenges that need to
be addressed for seamless deployment in robotics.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on an examination of an applicability of Recurrent Neural
Network models for detecting anomalous behavior of the CERN superconducting
magnets. In order to conduct the experiments, the authors designed and
implemented an adaptive signal quantization algorithm and a custom GRU-based
detector and developed a method for the detector parameters selection. Three
different datasets were used for testing the detector. Two artificially
generated datasets were used to assess the raw performance of the system
whereas the 231 MB dataset composed of the signals acquired from HiLumi magnets
was intended for real-life experiments and model training. Several different
setups of the developed anomaly detection system were evaluated and compared
with state-of-the-art OC-SVM reference model operating on the same data. The
OC-SVM model was equipped with a rich set of feature extractors accounting for
a range of the input signal properties. It was determined in the course of the
experiments that the detector, along with its supporting design methodology,
reaches F1 equal or very close to 1 for almost all test sets. Due to the
profile of the data, the best_length setup of the detector turned out to
perform the best among all five tested configuration schemes of the detection
system. The quantization parameters have the biggest impact on the overall
performance of the detector with the best values of input/output grid equal to
16 and 8, respectively. The proposed solution of the detection significantly
outperformed OC-SVM-based detector in most of the cases, with much more stable
performance across all the datasets.

 <dc:description>  In order to maximize the applicability of sentiment analysis results, it is
necessary to not only classify the overall sentiment (positive/negative) of a
given document but also to identify the main words that contribute to the
classification. However, most datasets for sentiment analysis only have the
sentiment label for each document or sentence. In other words, there is no
information about which words play an important role in sentiment
classification. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying key words
discriminating positive and negative sentences by using a weakly supervised
learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In our model,
each word is represented as a continuous-valued vector and each sentence is
represented as a matrix whose rows correspond to the word vector used in the
sentence. Then, the CNN model is trained using these sentence matrices as
inputs and the sentiment labels as the output. Once the CNN model is trained,
we implement the word attention mechanism that identifies high-contributing
words to classification results with a class activation map, using the weights
from the fully connected layer at the end of the learned CNN model. In order to
verify the proposed methodology, we evaluated the classification accuracy and
inclusion rate of polarity words using two movie review datasets. Experimental
result show that the proposed model can not only correctly classify the
sentence polarity but also successfully identify the corresponding words with
high polarity scores.

 <dc:description>  Wireless distributed systems as used in sensor networks, Internet-of-Things
and cyber-physical systems, impose high requirements on resource efficiency.
Advanced preprocessing and classification of data at the network edge can help
to decrease the communication demand and to reduce the amount of data to be
processed centrally. In the area of distributed acoustic sensing, the
combination of algorithms with a high classification rate and
resource-constraint embedded systems is essential. Unfortunately, algorithms
for acoustic event detection have a high memory and computational demand and
are not suited for execution at the network edge. This paper addresses these
aspects by applying structural optimizations to a convolutional neural network
for audio event detection to reduce the memory requirement by a factor of more
than 500 and the computational effort by a factor of 2.1 while performing 9.2%
better.

 <dc:title>B-CNN: Branch Convolutional Neural Network for Hierarchical
  Classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhu, Xinqi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bain, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifiers are traditionally
designed to have sequential convolutional layers with a single output layer.
This is based on the assumption that all target classes should be treated
equally and exclusively. However, some classes can be more difficult to
distinguish than others, and classes may be organized in a hierarchy of
categories. At the same time, a CNN is designed to learn internal
representations that abstract from the input data based on its hierarchical
layered structure. So it is natural to ask if an inverse of this idea can be
applied to learn a model that can predict over a classification hierarchy using
multiple output layers in decreasing order of class abstraction. In this paper,
we introduce a variant of the traditional CNN model named the Branch
Convolutional Neural Network (B-CNN). A B-CNN model outputs multiple
predictions ordered from coarse to fine along the concatenated convolutional
layers corresponding to the hierarchical structure of the target classes, which
can be regarded as a form of prior knowledge on the output. To learn with
B-CNNs a novel training strategy, named the Branch Training strategy
(BT-strategy), is introduced which balances the strictness of the prior with
the freedom to adjust parameters on the output layers to minimize the loss. In
this way we show that CNN based models can be forced to learn successively
coarse to fine concepts in the internal layers at the output stage, and that
hierarchical prior knowledge can be adopted to boost CNN models' classification
performance. Our models are evaluated to show that the B-CNN extensions improve
over the corresponding baseline CNN on the benchmark datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100.

 <dc:title>Efficient Computation and Covariance Analysis of Geometry-Based
  Stochastic Channel Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ferrand, Paul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we study a family of wireless channel simulation models called
geometry-based stochastic channel models (GBSCMs). Compared to more complex
ray-tracing simulation models, GBSCMs do not require an extensive
characterization of the propagation environment to provide wireless channel
realizations with adequate spatial and temporal statistics. The trade-off they
achieve between the quality of the simulated channels and the computational
complexity makes them popular in standardization bodies. Using the generic
formulation of the GBSCMs, we identify a matrix structure that can be used to
improve the performance of their implementations. Furthermore, this matrix
structure allows us to analyze the spatial covariance of the channel
realizations. We provide a way to efficiently compute the spatial covariance
matrix in most implementations of GBSCMs. In accordance to wide-sense
stationary and uncorrelated scattering hypotheses, this covariance is static in
frequency and does not evolve with user movement.

 <dc:description>  How to divide floor plans or navigation maps into a semantic representation,
such as rooms and corridors, is an important research question in fields such
as human-robot interaction, place categorization, or semantic mapping. While
most algorithms focus on segmenting robot built maps, those are not the only
types of map a robot, or its user, can use. We have developed a method for
segmenting maps from different modalities, focusing on robot built maps and
hand-drawn sketch maps, and show better results than state of the art for both
types.
  Our method segments the map by doing a convolution between the distance image
of the map and a circular kernel, and grouping pixels of the same value.
Segmentation is done by detecting ripple like patterns where pixel values vary
quickly, and merging neighboring regions with similar values.
  We identify a flaw in segmentation evaluation metric used in recent works and
propose a more consistent metric. We compare our results to ground-truth
segmentations of maps from a publicly available dataset, on which we obtain a
better Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) than state of the art with 0.98
compared to 0.85 for a recent Voronoi-based segmentation method and 0.78 for
the DuDe segmentation method. We also provide a dataset of sketches of an
indoor environment, with two possible sets of ground truth segmentations, on
which our method obtains a MCC of 0.82 against 0.40 for the Voronoi-based
segmentation method and 0.45 for DuDe.

 <dc:description>  The excellent performance of deep neural networks has enabled us to solve
several automatization problems, opening an era of autonomous devices. However,
current deep net architectures are heavy with millions of parameters and
require billions of floating point operations. Several works have been
developed to compress a pre-trained deep network to reduce memory footprint
and, possibly, computation. Instead of compressing a pre-trained network, in
this work, we propose a generic neural network layer structure employing
multilinear projection as the primary feature extractor. The proposed
architecture requires several times less memory as compared to the traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), while inherits the similar design
principles of a CNN. In addition, the proposed architecture is equipped with
two computation schemes that enable computation reduction or scalability.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of our compact projection that
outperforms traditional CNN, while requiring far fewer parameters.

 <dc:description>  Global registration of multi-view robot data is a challenging task.
Appearance-based global localization approaches often fail under drastic
view-point changes, as representations have limited view-point invariance. This
work is based on the idea that human-made environments contain rich semantics
which can be used to disambiguate global localization. Here, we present X-View,
a Multi-View Semantic Global Localization system. X-View leverages semantic
graph descriptor matching for global localization, enabling localization under
drastically different view-points. While the approach is general in terms of
the semantic input data, we present and evaluate an implementation on visual
data. We demonstrate the system in experiments on the publicly available
SYNTHIA dataset, on a realistic urban dataset recorded with a simulator, and on
real-world StreetView data. Our findings show that X-View is able to globally
localize aerial-to-ground, and ground-to-ground robot data of drastically
different view-points. Our approach achieves an accuracy of up to 85 % on
global localizations in the multi-view case, while the benchmarked baseline
appearance-based methods reach up to 70 %.

 <dc:description>  Recent research has demonstrated that Intel's SGX is vulnerable to various
software-based side-channel attacks. In particular, attacks that monitor CPU
caches shared between the victim enclave and untrusted software enable accurate
leakage of secret enclave data. Known defenses assume developer assistance,
require hardware changes, impose high overhead, or prevent only some of the
known attacks. In this paper we propose data location randomization as a novel
defensive approach to address the threat of side-channel attacks. Our main goal
is to break the link between the cache observations by the privileged adversary
and the actual data accesses by the victim. We design and implement a
compiler-based tool called DR.SGX that instruments enclave code such that data
locations are permuted at the granularity of cache lines. We realize the
permutation with the CPU's cryptographic hardware-acceleration units providing
secure randomization. To prevent correlation of repeated memory accesses we
continuously re-randomize all enclave data during execution. Our solution
effectively protects many (but not all) enclaves from cache attacks and
provides a complementary enclave hardening technique that is especially useful
against unpredictable information leakage.

 <dc:description>  We present CLEAR (Cross-Layer Exploration for Architecting Resilience), a
first of its kind framework which overcomes a major challenge in the design of
digital systems that are resilient to reliability failures: achieve desired
resilience targets at minimal costs (energy, power, execution time, area) by
combining resilience techniques across various layers of the system stack
(circuit, logic, architecture, software, algorithm). This is also referred to
as cross-layer resilience. In this paper, we focus on radiation-induced soft
errors in processor cores. We address both single-event upsets (SEUs) and
single-event multiple upsets (SEMUs) in terrestrial environments. Our framework
automatically and systematically explores the large space of comprehensive
resilience techniques and their combinations across various layers of the
system stack (586 cross-layer combinations in this paper), derives
cost-effective solutions that achieve resilience targets at minimal costs, and
provides guidelines for the design of new resilience techniques. Our results
demonstrate that a carefully optimized combination of circuit-level hardening,
logic-level parity checking, and micro-architectural recovery provides a highly
cost-effective soft error resilience solution for general-purpose processor
cores. For example, a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate is
achieved at only 2.1% energy cost for an out-of-order core (6.1% for an
in-order core) with no speed impact. However, (application-aware) selective
circuit-level hardening alone, guided by a thorough analysis of the effects of
soft errors on application benchmarks, provides a cost-effective soft error
resilience solution as well (with ~1% additional energy cost for a 50x
improvement in silent data corruption rate).

 <dc:description>  Using machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, we studied the
prediction of personal attributes from the text of tweets, such as gender,
occupation, and age groups. We applied word2vec to construct word vectors,
which were then used to vectorize tweet blocks. The resulting tweet vectors
were used as inputs for training models, and the prediction accuracy of those
models was examined as a function of the dimension of the tweet vectors and the
size of the tweet blacks. The results showed that the machine learning
algorithms could predict the three personal attributes of interest with 60-70%
accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Traditional medicine typically applies one-size-fits-all treatment for the
entire patient population whereas precision medicine develops tailored
treatment schemes for different patient subgroups. The fact that some factors
may be more significant for a specific patient subgroup motivates clinicians
and medical researchers to develop new approaches to subgroup detection and
analysis, which is an effective strategy to personalize treatment. In this
study, we propose a novel patient subgroup detection method, called Supervised
Biclustring (SUBIC) using convex optimization and apply our approach to detect
patient subgroups and prioritize risk factors for hypertension (HTN) in a
vulnerable demographic subgroup (African-American). Our approach not only finds
patient subgroups with guidance of a clinically relevant target variable but
also identifies and prioritizes risk factors by pursuing sparsity of the input
variables and encouraging similarity among the input variables and between the
input and target variables

 <dc:description>  Pedestrian analysis plays a vital role in intelligent video surveillance and
is a key component for security-centric computer vision systems. Despite that
the convolutional neural networks are remarkable in learning discriminative
features from images, the learning of comprehensive features of pedestrians for
fine-grained tasks remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a new
attention-based deep neural network, named as HydraPlus-Net (HP-net), that
multi-directionally feeds the multi-level attention maps to different feature
layers. The attentive deep features learned from the proposed HP-net bring
unique advantages: (1) the model is capable of capturing multiple attentions
from low-level to semantic-level, and (2) it explores the multi-scale
selectiveness of attentive features to enrich the final feature representations
for a pedestrian image. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed HP-net for pedestrian analysis on two tasks, i.e. pedestrian attribute
recognition and person re-identification. Intensive experimental results have
been provided to prove that the HP-net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
on various datasets.

 <dc:title>Educational game design: game elements for promoting engagement</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>He, Angela</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Engagement in educational games, a recently popular academic topic, has been
shown to increase learning performance, as well as a number of attitudinal
factors, such as intrinsic interest and motivation. However, there is a lack of
research on how games can be designed to promote engagement. This mixed methods
case study aimed to discover effective game elements for promoting 17-18 year
old high school students' engagement with an educational game. Using
within-case and cross-case analyses and triangulated data, 10 elements emerged
and were categorized into the constructs of story, gameplay, and atmosphere.
Examples and connections to the literature for each element are reported.
Findings implicate that educational game design for both learning and
engagement is composed of educational-game specific elements, game design for
solely engagement is similar for both educational and entertainment games, and
a gap on educational game design technique instead of theory should be
addressed to further benefit educational game development.

 <dc:title>A New Balanced Subdivision of a Simple Polygon for Time-Space Trade-off

 <dc:description>  We are given a read-only memory for input and a write-only stream for output.
For a positive integer parameter s, an s-workspace algorithm is an algorithm
using only $O(s)$ words of workspace in addition to the memory for input. In
this paper, we present an $O(n^2/s)$-time $s$-workspace algorithm for
subdividing a simple polygon into $O(\min\{n/s,s\})$ subpolygons of complexity
$O(\max\{n/s,s\})$.
  As applications of the subdivision, the previously best known time-space
trade-offs for the following three geometric problems are improved immediately:
(1) computing the shortest path between two points inside a simple $n$-gon, (2)
computing the shortest path tree from a point inside a simple $n$-gon, (3)
computing a triangulation of a simple $n$-gon. In addition, we improve the
algorithm for the second problem even further.

 <dc:description>  In a digital communication system, information is sent from one place to
another over a noisy communication channel using binary symbols (bits).
Original information is encoded by adding redundant bits, which are then used
by low--density parity--check (LDPC) codes to detect and correct errors that
may have been introduced during transmission. Error correction capability of an
LDPC code is severely degraded due to harmful structures such as small cycles
in its bipartite graph representation known as Tanner graph (TG). We introduce
an integer programming formulation to generate a TG for a given smallest cycle
length. We propose a branch-and-cut algorithm for its solution and investigate
structural properties of the problem to derive valid inequalities and variable
fixing rules. We introduce a heuristic to obtain feasible solutions of the
problem. Our computational experiments show that our algorithm can generate
LDPC codes without small cycles in acceptable amount of time for practically
relevant code lengths.

 <dc:description>  Power distribution grids are exploited by Power Line Communication (PLC)
technology to convey high frequency data signals. The natural conformation of
such power line networks causes a relevant part of the high frequency signals
traveling through them to be radiated instead of being conducted. This causes
not only electromagnetic interference (EMI) with devices positioned next to
power line cables, but also a consistent deterioration of the signal integrity.
Since existing PLC channel models do not take into account losses due to
radiation phenomena, this paper responds to the need of developing accurate
network simulators. A thorough analysis is herein presented about the conducted
and radiated effects on the signal integrity, digging into differential mode to
common mode signal conversion due to network imbalances. The outcome of this
work allows each network element to be described by a mixed-mode transmission
matrix. Furthermore, the classical per-unit-length equivalent circuit of
transmission lines is extended to incorporate radiation resistances. The
results of this paper lay the foundations for future developments of
comprehensive power line network models that incorporate conducted and radiated
phenomena.

activities in which workers are engaged. It accounts for over 75 per cent of
learning in the workplace. Enterprise Social Media (ESM) are increasingly used
as informal learning environments. According to the results of an

appropriate to promote ILW. Nevertheless, social aspects must be reconsidered
to address users' needs regarding content and access, quality information
indicators, moderation and control.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Java platform and third-party libraries provide various security features to
facilitate secure coding. However, misusing these features can cost tremendous
time and effort of developers or cause security vulnerabilities in software.
Prior research was focused on the misuse of cryptography and SSL APIs, but did
not explore the key fundamental research question: what are the biggest
challenges and vulnerabilities in secure coding practices? In this paper, we
conducted a comprehensive empirical study on StackOverflow posts to understand
developers' concerns on Java secure coding, their programming obstacles, and
potential vulnerabilities in their code. We observed that developers have
shifted their effort to the usage of authentication and authorization features
provided by Spring security--a third-party framework designed to secure
enterprise applications. Multiple programming challenges are related to APIs or
libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of
cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to
configure Spring security. More interestingly, we identified security
vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers. The vulnerabilities
included using insecure hash functions such as MD5, breaking SSL/TLS security
through bypassing certificate validation, and insecurely disabling the default
protection against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Our findings
reveal the insufficiency of secure coding assistance and education, and the gap
between security theory and coding practices.

 <dc:description>  One of the key challenges for operations researchers solving real-world
problems is designing and implementing high-quality heuristics to guide their
search procedures. In the past, machine learning techniques have failed to play
a major role in operations research approaches, especially in terms of guiding
branching and pruning decisions. We integrate deep neural networks into a
heuristic tree search procedure to decide which branch to choose next and to
estimate a bound for pruning the search tree of an optimization problem. We
call our approach Deep Learning assisted heuristic Tree Search (DLTS) and apply
it to a well-known problem from the container terminals literature, the
container pre-marshalling problem (CPMP). Our approach is able to learn
heuristics customized to the CPMP solely through analyzing the solutions to
CPMP instances, and applies this knowledge within a heuristic tree search to
produce the highest quality heuristic solutions to the CPMP to date.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, most recommender systems exploit user-provided ratings to infer
their preferences. However, the growing popularity of social and e-commerce
websites has encouraged users to also share comments and opinions through
textual reviews. In this paper, we introduce a new recommendation approach
which exploits the semantic annotation of user reviews to extract useful and
non-trivial information about the items to recommend. It also relies on the
knowledge freely available in the Web of Data, notably in DBpedia and Wikidata,
to discover other resources connected with the annotated entities. We evaluated
our approach in three domains, using both DBpedia and Wikidata. The results
showed that our solution provides a better ranking than another recommendation
method based on the Web of Data, while it improves in novelty with respect to
traditional techniques based on ratings. Additionally, our method achieved a
better performance with Wikidata than DBpedia.

 <dc:description>  We construct a fixed parameter algorithm parameterized by d and k that takes
as an input a graph G' obtained from a d-degenerate graph G by complementing on
at most k arbitrary subsets of the vertex set of G and outputs a graph H such
that G and H agree on all but f(d,k) vertices.
  Our work is motivated by the first order model checking in graph classes that
are first order interpretable in classes of sparse graphs. We derive as a
corollary that if G_0 is a graph class with bounded expansion, then the first
order model checking is fixed parameter tractable in the class of all graphs
that can obtained from a graph G from G_0 by complementing on at most k
arbitrary subsets of the vertex set of G; this implies an earlier result that
the first order model checking is fixed parameter tractable in graph classes
interpretable in classes of graphs with bounded maximum degree.

 <dc:description>  We present a parallel algorithm for computing the treewidth of a graph on a
GPU. We implement this algorithm in OpenCL, and experimentally evaluate its
performance. Our algorithm is based on an $O^*(2^{n})$-time algorithm that
explores the elimination orderings of the graph using a Held-Karp like dynamic
programming approach. We use Bloom filters to detect duplicate solutions.
  GPU programming presents unique challenges and constraints, such as
constraints on the use of memory and the need to limit branch divergence. We
experiment with various optimizations to see if it is possible to work around
these issues. We achieve a very large speed up (up to $77\times$) compared to
running the same algorithm on the CPU.

 <dc:description>  We propose a deep learning-based approach to the problem of premise
selection: selecting mathematical statements relevant for proving a given
conjecture. We represent a higher-order logic formula as a graph that is
invariant to variable renaming but still fully preserves syntactic and semantic
information. We then embed the graph into a vector via a novel embedding method
that preserves the information of edge ordering. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the HolStep dataset, improving the classification
accuracy from 83% to 90.3%.

 <dc:description>  Blockchain technology has evolved from being an immutable ledger of
transactions for cryptocurrencies to a programmable interactive the environment
for building distributed reliable applications. Although, blockchain technology
has been used to address various challenges, to our knowledge none of the
previous work focused on using blockchain to develop a secure and immutable
scientific data provenance management framework that automatically verifies the
provenance records. In this work, we leverage blockchain as a platform to
facilitate trustworthy data provenance collection, verification, and
management. The developed system utilizes smart contracts and open provenance
model (OPM) to record immutable data trails. We show that our proposed
framework can efficiently and securely capture and validate provenance data,
and prevent any malicious modification to the captured data as long as the
majority of the participants are honest.

 <dc:description>  Static cache analysis characterizes a program's cache behavior by determining
in a sound but approximate manner which memory accesses result in cache hits
and which result in cache misses. Such information is valuable in optimizing
compilers, worst-case execution time analysis, and side-channel attack
quantification and mitigation.Cache analysis is usually performed as a
combination of &quot;must&quot; and &quot;may&quot; abstract interpretations, classifying
instructions as either &quot;always hit&quot;, &quot;always miss&quot;, or &quot;unknown&quot;. Instructions
classified as &quot;unknown&quot; might result in a hit or a miss depending on program
inputs or the initial cache state. It is equally possible that they do in fact
always hit or always miss, but the cache analysis is too coarse to see it.Our
approach to eliminate this uncertainty consists in (i) a novel abstract
interpretation able to ascertain that a particular instruction may definitely
cause a hit and a miss on different paths, and (ii) an exact analysis, removing
all remaining uncertainty, based on model checking, using
abstract-interpretation results to prune down the model for scalability.We
evaluated our approach on a variety of examples; it notably improves precision
upon classical abstract interpretation at reasonable cost.

 <dc:title>Sparse Hierarchical Regression with Polynomials</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a novel method for exact hierarchical sparse polynomial
regression. Our regressor is that degree $r$ polynomial which depends on at
most $k$ inputs, counting at most $\ell$ monomial terms, which minimizes the
sum of the squares of its prediction errors. The previous hierarchical sparse
specification aligns well with modern big data settings where many inputs are
not relevant for prediction purposes and the functional complexity of the
regressor needs to be controlled as to avoid overfitting. We present a two-step
approach to this hierarchical sparse regression problem. First, we discard
irrelevant inputs using an extremely fast input ranking heuristic. Secondly, we
take advantage of modern cutting plane methods for integer optimization to
solve our resulting reduced hierarchical $(k, \ell)$-sparse problem exactly.
The ability of our method to identify all $k$ relevant inputs and all $\ell$
monomial terms is shown empirically to experience a phase transition.
Crucially, the same transition also presents itself in our ability to reject
all irrelevant features and monomials as well. In the regime where our method
is statistically powerful, its computational complexity is interestingly on par
with Lasso based heuristics. The presented work fills a void in terms of a lack
of powerful disciplined nonlinear sparse regression methods in high-dimensional
settings. Our method is shown empirically to scale to regression problems with
$n\approx 10,000$ observations for input dimension $p\approx 1,000$.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a class of distributed control policies for networks of
discrete-time linear systems with polytopic additive disturbances. The
objective is to restrict the network-level state and controls to user-specified
polyhedral sets for all times. This problem arises in many safety-critical
applications. We consider two problems. First, given a communication graph
characterizing the structure of the information flow in the network, we find
the optimal distributed control policy by solving a single linear program.
Second, we find the sparsest communication graph required for the existence of
a distributed invariance-inducing control policy. Illustrative examples,
including one on platooning, are presented.

 <dc:title>Integer Forcing: Effective SNR Distribution and Practical Block-Based

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Integer Forcing (IF) is a novel linear receiver architecture, where instead
of separating the codewords sent by each transmitter, and decoding them
individually, forces integer-valued linear combinations at each receive
antenna, and decodes the linear combinations. The original codewords are
obtained by inverting the integer-valued matrix. While demonstrating superior
performance, IF requires complex optimization in order to find the optimal
linear combinations, and demands either using multi-level nested lattice codes,
or reducing the rates of all transmitters to equal the weakest one. Finally,
the distribution of the resulting effective SNR is hard to evaluate.
  In this paper, we first give simple upper and lower bounds on the effective
SNR of a single linear combination in IF. These expressions allow us to easily
bound the distribution of the effective SNR for any given linear combination
used. We then suggest two simple block-based IF schemes. These schemes, while
sub-optimal, significantly reduce the complexity of the optimization process,
and, more importantly, do not require reducing the rates of all transmitters,
as decoding is done block-wise. Finally, we bound the distribution of the
effective SNR of the decoding schemes, and show via simulations the superiority
of block-wise schemes at low SNR.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the query evaluation problem for fixed queries over fully
dynamic databases where tuples can be inserted or deleted. The task is to
design a dynamic data structure that can immediately report the new result of a
fixed query after every database update. We consider unions of conjunctive
queries (UCQs) and focus on the query evaluation tasks testing (decide whether
an input tuple belongs to the query result), enumeration (enumerate, without
repetition, all tuples in the query result), and counting (output the number of
tuples in the query result).
  We identify three increasingly restrictive classes of UCQs which we call
t-hierarchical, q-hierarchical, and exhaustively q-hierarchical UCQs. Our main
results provide the following dichotomies: If the query's homomorphic core is
t-hierarchical (q-hierarchical, exhaustively q-hierarchical), then the testing
(enumeration, counting) problem can be solved with constant update time and
constant testing time (delay, counting time). Otherwise, it cannot be solved
with sublinear update time and sublinear testing time (delay, counting time),
unless the OV-conjecture and/or the OMv-conjecture fails.
  We also study the complexity of query evaluation in the dynamic setting in
the presence of integrity constraints, and we obtain according dichotomy
results for the special case of small domain constraints (i.e., constraints
which state that all values in a particular column of a relation belong to a
fixed domain of constant size).

 <dc:description>  The paper gives an introduction to rate equations in nonlinear continuum
mechanics which should obey specific transformation rules. Emphasis is placed
on the geometrical nature of the operations involved in order to clarify the
different concepts. The paper is particularly concerned with common classes of
constitutive equations based on corotational stress rates and their proper
implementation in time for solving initial boundary value problems. Hypoelastic
simple shear is considered as an example application for the derived theory and
algorithms.

 <dc:title>Adding successor: A transfer theorem for separation and covering</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Place, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zeitoun, Marc</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a class C of word languages, the C-separation problem asks for an
algorithm that, given as input two regular languages, decides whether there
exists a third language in C containing the first language, while being
disjoint from the second. Separation is usually investigated as a means to
obtain a deep understanding of the class C.
  In the paper, we are mainly interested in classes defined by logical
formalisms. Such classes are often built on top of each other: given some
logic, one builds a stronger one by adding new predicates to its signature. A
natural construction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this
paper, we present a transfer result applying to this construction: we show that
for suitable logically defined classes, separation for the logic enriched with
the successor relation reduces to separation for the original logic. Our
theorem also applies to a problem that is stronger than separation: covering.
Moreover, we actually present two reductions: one for languages of finite words
and the other for languages of infinite words.

 <dc:title>Introducing DeepBalance: Random Deep Belief Network Ensembles to Address
  Class Imbalance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Xenopoulos, Peter</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Class imbalance problems manifest in domains such as financial fraud
detection or network intrusion analysis, where the prevalence of one class is
much higher than another. Typically, practitioners are more interested in
predicting the minority class than the majority class as the minority class may
carry a higher misclassification cost. However, classifier performance
deteriorates in the face of class imbalance as oftentimes classifiers may
predict every point as the majority class. Methods for dealing with class
imbalance include cost-sensitive learning or resampling techniques. In this
paper, we introduce DeepBalance, an ensemble of deep belief networks trained
with balanced bootstraps and random feature selection. We demonstrate that our
proposed method outperforms baseline resampling methods such as SMOTE and
under- and over-sampling in metrics such as AUC and sensitivity when applied to
a highly imbalanced financial transaction data. Additionally, we explore
performance and training time implications of various model parameters.
Furthermore, we show that our model is easily parallelizable, which can reduce
training times. Finally, we present an implementation of DeepBalance in R.

 <dc:title>Measuring the Eccentricity of Items</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The long-tail phenomenon tells us that there are many items in the tail.
However, not all tail items are the same. Each item acquires different kinds of
users. Some items are loved by the general public, while some items are
consumed by eccentric fans. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, item
eccentricity, to incorporate this difference between consumers of the items.
Eccentric items are defined as items that are consumed by eccentric users. We
used this metric to analyze two real-world datasets of music and movies and
observed the characteristics of items in terms of eccentricity. The results
showed that our defined eccentricity of an item does not change much over time,
and classified eccentric and noneccentric items present significantly distinct
characteristics. The proposed metric effectively separates the eccentric and
noneccentric items mixed in the tail, which could not be done with the previous
measures, which only consider the popularity of items.

 <dc:description>  We consider partially-specified optimization problems where the goal is to
actively, but efficiently, acquire missing information about the problem in
order to solve it. An algorithm designer wishes to solve a linear program (LP),
$\max \mathbf{c}^T \mathbf{x}$ s.t. $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{b},
\mathbf{x} \ge \mathbf{0}$, but does not initially know some of the parameters.
The algorithm can iteratively choose an unknown parameter and gather
information in the form of a noisy sample centered at the parameter's (unknown)
value. The goal is to find an approximately feasible and optimal solution to
the underlying LP with high probability while drawing a small number of
samples. We focus on two cases. (1) When the parameters $\mathbf{c}$ of the
objective are initially unknown, we take an information-theoretic approach and
give roughly matching upper and lower sample complexity bounds, with an
(inefficient) successive-elimination algorithm. (2) When the parameters
$\mathbf{b}$ of the constraints are initially unknown, we propose an efficient
algorithm combining techniques from the ellipsoid method for LP and
confidence-bound approaches from bandit algorithms. The algorithm adaptively
gathers information about constraints only as needed in order to make progress.
We give sample complexity bounds for the algorithm and demonstrate its
improvement over a naive approach via simulation.

 <dc:description>  Lubiw showed that several variants of Graph Isomorphism are NP-complete,
where the solutions are required to satisfy certain additional constraints
[SICOMP 10, 1981]. One of these, called Isomorphism With Restrictions, is to
decide for two given graphs $X_1=(V,E_1)$ and $X_2=(V,E_2)$ and a subset
$R\subseteq V\times V$ of forbidden pairs whether there is an isomorphism $\pi$
from $X_1$ to $X_2$ such that $\pi(i)\neq j$ for all $(i,j)\in R$. We prove
that this problem and several of its generalizations are in fact in FPT:
  - The problem of deciding whether there is an isomorphism between two graphs
that moves k vertices and satisfies Lubiw-style constraints is in FPT, with k
and the size of $R$ as parameters. The problem remains in FPT if a CNF of such
constraints is allowed. It follows that the problem to decide whether there is
an isomorphism that moves exactly k vertices is in FPT. This solves a question
left open in our article on exact weight automorphisms [STACS 2017].
  - When the weight and complexity are unrestricted, finding isomorphisms that
satisfy a CNF of Lubiw-style constraints can be solved in FPT with access to a
GI oracle.
  - Checking if there is an isomorphism $\pi$ between two graphs with
complexity t is also in FPT with t as parameter, where the complexity of a
permutation is the Cayley measure defined as the minimum number t such that
$\pi$ can be expressed as a product of t transpositions.
  - We consider a more general problem in which the vertex set of a graph X is
partitioned into Red and Blue, and we are interested in an automorphism that
stabilizes Red and Blue and moves exactly k vertices in Blue, where k is the
parameter. This problem was introduced by [Downey and Fellows 1999], and we
showed [STACS 2017] that it is W[1]-hard even with color classes of size 4
inside Red. Now, for color classes of size at most 3 inside Red, we show the
problem is in FPT.

 <dc:title>An Axiomatic Study of Scoring Rule Markets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Frongillo, Rafael</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Waggoner, Bo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Prediction markets are well-studied in the case where predictions are
probabilities or expectations of future random variables. In 2008, Lambert, et
al. proposed a generalization, which we call &quot;scoring rule markets&quot; (SRMs), in
which traders predict the value of arbitrary statistics of the random
variables, provided these statistics can be elicited by a scoring rule.
Surprisingly, despite active recent work on prediction markets, there has not
yet been any investigation into the properties of more general SRMs. To
initiate such a study, we ask the following question: in what sense are SRMs
&quot;markets&quot;? We classify SRMs according to several axioms that capture
potentially desirable qualities of a market, such as the ability to freely
exchange goods (contracts) for money. Not all SRMs satisfy our axioms: once a
contract is purchased in any market for prediction the median of some variable,
there will not necessarily be any way to sell that contract back, even in a
very weak sense. Our main result is a characterization showing that slight
generalizations of cost-function-based markets are the only markets to satisfy
all of our axioms for finite-outcome random variables. Nonetheless, we find
that several SRMs satisfy weaker versions of our axioms, including a novel
share-based market mechanism for ratios of expected values.

 <dc:description>  We present an extended analytic formula for the calculation of the
temperature profile along a bondwire embedded in a package. The resulting
closed formula is built by coupling the heat transfer equations of the bondwire
and the surrounding moulding compound by means of auxiliary variables that stem
from an \emph{ad-hoc} linearisation and mediate the wire-mould thermal
interaction. The model, which corrects typical simplifications in previously
introduced analytic models, is also optimised against carefully taken
experimental samples representing fusing events of bondwires within real
packages.

 <dc:title>A Simple and Efficient MapReduce Algorithm for Data Cube Materialization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Data cube materialization is a classical database operator introduced in Gray
et al.~(Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Vol.~1), which is critical for
many analysis tasks. Nandi et al.~(Transactions on Knowledge and Data
Engineering, Vol.~6) first studied cube materialization for large scale
datasets using the MapReduce framework, and proposed a sophisticated
modification of a simple broadcast algorithm to handle a dataset with a 216GB
cube size within 25 minutes with 2k machines in 2012. We take a different
approach, and propose a simple MapReduce algorithm which (1) minimizes the
total number of copy-add operations, (2) leverages locality of computation, and
(3) balances work evenly across machines. As a result, the algorithm shows
excellent performance, and materialized a real dataset with a cube size of
35.0G tuples and 1.75T bytes in 54 minutes, with 0.4k machines in 2014.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the canonical generalization of the well-studied Longest
Increasing Subsequence problem to multiple sequences, called $k$-LCIS: Given
$k$ integer sequences $X_1,\dots,X_k$ of length at most $n$, the task is to
determine the length of the longest common subsequence of $X_1,\dots,X_k$ that
is also strictly increasing. Especially for the case of $k=2$ (called LCIS for
short), several algorithms have been proposed that require quadratic time in
the worst case.
  Assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), we prove a tight
lower bound, specifically, that no algorithm solves LCIS in (strongly)
subquadratic time. Interestingly, the proof makes no use of normalization
tricks common to hardness proofs for similar problems such as LCS. We further
strengthen this lower bound (1) to rule out $O((nL)^{1-\varepsilon})$ time
algorithms for LCIS, where $L$ denotes the solution size, (2) to rule out
$O(n^{k-\varepsilon})$ time algorithms for $k$-LCIS, and (3) to follow already
from weaker variants of SETH. We obtain the same conditional lower bounds for
the related Longest Common Weakly Increasing Subsequence problem.

 <dc:description>  We propose a memory-model-aware static program analysis method for accurately
analyzing the behavior of concurrent software running on processors with weak
consistency models such as x86-TSO, SPARC-PSO, and SPARC-RMO. At the center of
our method is a unified framework for deciding the feasibility of inter-thread
interferences to avoid propagating spurious data flows during static analysis
and thus boost the performance of the static analyzer. We formulate the
checking of interference feasibility as a set of Datalog rules which are both
efficiently solvable and general enough to capture a range of hardware-level
memory models. Compared to existing techniques, our method can significantly
reduce the number of bogus alarms as well as unsound proofs. We implemented the
method and evaluated it on a large set of multithreaded C programs. Our
experiments showthe method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques in terms of accuracy with only moderate run-time overhead.

 <dc:description>  Interrupts have been widely used in safety-critical computer systems to
handle outside stimuli and interact with the hardware, but reasoning about
interrupt-driven software remains a difficult task. Although a number of static
verification techniques have been proposed for interrupt-driven software, they
often rely on constructing a monolithic verification model. Furthermore, they
do not precisely capture the complete execution semantics of interrupts such as
nested invocations of interrupt handlers. To overcome these limitations, we
propose an abstract interpretation framework for static verification of
interrupt-driven software that first analyzes each interrupt handler in
isolation as if it were a sequential program, and then propagates the result to
other interrupt handlers. This iterative process continues until results from
all interrupt handlers reach a fixed point. Since our method never constructs
the global model, it avoids the up-front blowup in model construction that
hampers existing, non-modular, verification techniques. We have evaluated our
method on 35 interrupt-driven applications with a total of 22,541 lines of
code. Our results show the method is able to quickly and more accurately
analyze the behavior of interrupts.

 <dc:description>  Developing a safe and efficient collision avoidance policy for multiple
robots is challenging in the decentralized scenarios where each robot generate
its paths without observing other robots' states and intents. While other
distributed multi-robot collision avoidance systems exist, they often require
extracting agent-level features to plan a local collision-free action, which
can be computationally prohibitive and not robust. More importantly, in
practice the performance of these methods are much lower than their centralized
counterparts.
  We present a decentralized sensor-level collision avoidance policy for
multi-robot systems, which directly maps raw sensor measurements to an agent's
steering commands in terms of movement velocity. As a first step toward
reducing the performance gap between decentralized and centralized methods, we
present a multi-scenario multi-stage training framework to find an optimal
policy which is trained over a large number of robots on rich, complex
environments simultaneously using a policy gradient based reinforcement
learning algorithm. We validate the learned sensor-level collision avoidance
policy in a variety of simulated scenarios with thorough performance
evaluations and show that the final learned policy is able to find time
efficient, collision-free paths for a large-scale robot system. We also
demonstrate that the learned policy can be well generalized to new scenarios
that do not appear in the entire training period, including navigating a
heterogeneous group of robots and a large-scale scenario with 100 robots.

network, due to either safety-related considerations (e.g., workzone
operations) or congestion management schemes (e.g., speed harmonization
systems). These abrupt changes in speed limit can result in shock- wave
formation and cause travel time unreliability. Therefore, designing a
platooning strategy for tracking a reference velocity profile is critical to
enabling end-to-end platooning. Accordingly, this study introduces a
generalized control model to track a desired velocity profile, while ensuring
safety in the platoon of autonomous vehicles. We define appropriate natural
error terms and the target curve in the state space of the control system,
which is the set of points where all error terms vanish and corresponds to the
case when all vehicles move with the desired velocities and in the minimum safe
distance between them. In this way, we change the tracking velocity profile
problem into a state- feedback stabilization problem with respect to the target
curve. Under certain mild assumptions on the Lipschitz constant of the speed
drop profile, we show that the stabilizing feedback can be obtained via
introducing a natural dynamics for the maximum of the error terms for each
vehicle. Moreover, we show that with this stabilizing feedback collisions will
not occur if the initial state of the system of vehicles is sufficiently close
to the target curve. We also show that the error terms remain bounded
throughout the time and space. Two scenarios were simulated, with and without
initial perturbations, and results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
control model in tracking the speed drop while ensuring safety and string
stability.

 <dc:description>  Dexterous multi-fingered hands are extremely versatile and provide a generic
way to perform multiple tasks in human-centric environments. However,
effectively controlling them remains challenging due to their high
dimensionality and large number of potential contacts. Deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) provides a model-agnostic approach to control complex dynamical
systems, but has not been shown to scale to high-dimensional dexterous
manipulation. Furthermore, deployment of DRL on physical systems remains
challenging due to sample inefficiency. Thus, the success of DRL in robotics
has thus far been limited to simpler manipulators and tasks. In this work, we
show that model-free DRL with natural policy gradients can effectively scale up
to complex manipulation tasks with a high-dimensional 24-DoF hand, and solve
them from scratch in simulated experiments. Furthermore, with the use of a
small number of human demonstrations, the sample complexity can be
significantly reduced, and enable learning within the equivalent of a few hours
of robot experience. We demonstrate successful policies for multiple complex
tasks: object relocation, in-hand manipulation, tool use, and door opening.

 <dc:description>  Exploration in environments with sparse rewards has been a persistent problem
in reinforcement learning (RL). Many tasks are natural to specify with a sparse
reward, and manually shaping a reward function can result in suboptimal
performance. However, finding a non-zero reward is exponentially more difficult
with increasing task horizon or action dimensionality. This puts many
real-world tasks out of practical reach of RL methods. In this work, we use
demonstrations to overcome the exploration problem and successfully learn to
perform long-horizon, multi-step robotics tasks with continuous control such as
stacking blocks with a robot arm. Our method, which builds on top of Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradients and Hindsight Experience Replay, provides an
order of magnitude of speedup over RL on simulated robotics tasks. It is simple
to implement and makes only the additional assumption that we can collect a
small set of demonstrations. Furthermore, our method is able to solve tasks not
solvable by either RL or behavior cloning alone, and often ends up
outperforming the demonstrator policy.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a constraint-based flow-sensitive static analysis for concurrent
programs by iteratively composing thread-modular abstract interpreters via the
use of a system of lightweight constraints. Our method is compositional in that
it first applies sequential abstract interpreters to individual threads and
then composes their results. It is flow-sensitive in that the causality
ordering of interferences (flow of data from global writes to reads) is modeled
by a system of constraints. These interference constraints are lightweight
since they only refer to the execution order of program statements as opposed
to their numerical properties: they can be decided efficiently using an
off-the-shelf Datalog engine. Our new method has the advantage of being more
accurate than existing, flow-insensitive, static analyzers while remaining
scalable and providing the expected soundness and termination guarantees even
for programs with unbounded data. We implemented our method and evaluated it on
a large number of benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness at increasing the
accuracy of thread-modular abstract interpretation.

 <dc:description>  Low latency is highly desirable for cloud services. To achieve low response
time, stringent timing requirements are needed for task scheduling in a
large-scale server farm spanning thousands of servers. In this paper, we
conduct an in-depth analysis for distributed Join-the-Idle-Queue (JIQ), a
promising new approximation of an idealized task-scheduling algorithm. In
particular, we derive semi-closed form expressions for the delay performance of
distributed JIQ, and we propose a new variant of distributed JIQ that offers
clear advantages over alternative algorithms for large systems.

 <dc:description>  The Virtual Environment for Neutrinos (VENu) is a virtual reality-based
visualisation of the MicroBooNE detector. MicroBooNE is a liquid-argon-based
neutrino experiment, which is currently operating in Fermilab's Booster
neutrino beam. The new VENu smartphone app provides informative explanations
about neutrinos and uses real MicroBooNE neutrino data that can be visualised
inside a virtual representation of the MicroBooNE detector. Available for both
iOS and Android, the VENu app can be downloaded for free from the Apple and
Google marketplaces. The app enables users to immerse themselves inside the
MicroBooNE particle detector and to see particle tracks inside. This can be
done in Virtual Reality mode, where the users can pair their smartphone with
any consumer virtual reality headset and see the detector in 3D. To encourage
learning in a fun environment, a game is also available, guiding users to learn
about neutrinos and how to detect them. They can also try to &quot;catch&quot;' neutrinos
themselves in 3D mode. The app is currently being pursued for a QuarkNet
neutrino master class and outreach events at several universities and labs
worldwide.

 <dc:description>  Most demand management approaches with non-mandatory policies assume full
users' cooperation, which may not be the case given users' beliefs, needs and

including incentives both with and without money. The mechanism is validated by
means of simulation, modeling the consumers as a finite multiagent system which
evolves until a stable state, and social incentives diffusion using opinion
dynamics.

 <dc:description>  In a cognitive radio network, a secondary user learns the spectrum
environment and dynamically accesses the channel where the primary user is
inactive. At the same time, a primary user emulation (PUE) attacker can send
falsified primary user signals and prevent the secondary user from utilizing
the available channel. The best attacking strategies that an attacker can apply
have not been well studied. In this paper, for the first time, we study optimal
PUE attack strategies by formulating an online learning problem where the
attacker needs to dynamically decide the attacking channel in each time slot
based on its attacking experience. The challenge in our problem is that since
the PUE attack happens in the spectrum sensing phase, the attacker cannot
observe the reward on the attacked channel. To address this challenge, we
utilize the attacker's observation capability. We propose online learning-based
attacking strategies based on the attacker's observation capabilities. Through
our analysis, we show that with no observation within the attacking slot, the
attacker loses on the regret order, and with the observation of at least one
channel, there is a significant improvement on the attacking performance.
Observation of multiple channels does not give additional benefit to the
attacker (only a constant scaling) though it gives insight on the number of
observations required to achieve the minimum constant factor. Our proposed
algorithms are optimal in the sense that their regret upper bounds match their
corresponding regret lower-bounds. We show consistency between simulation and
analytical results under various system parameters.

 <dc:description>  Virtualization technologies have evolved along with the development of
computational environments since virtualization offered needed features at that
time such as isolation, accountability, resource allocation, resource fair
sharing and so on. Novel processor technologies bring to commodity computers
the possibility to emulate diverse environments where a wide range of
computational scenarios can be run. Along with processors evolution, system
developers have created different virtualization mechanisms where each new
development enhanced the performance of previous virtualized environments.
Recently, operating system-based virtualization technologies captured the
attention of communities abroad (from industry to academy and research) because
their important improvements on performance area.
  In this paper, the features of three container-based operating systems
virtualization tools (LXC, Docker and Singularity) are presented. LXC, Docker,
Singularity and bare metal are put under test through a customized single node
HPL-Benchmark and a MPI-based application for the multi node testbed. Also the
disk I/O performance, Memory (RAM) performance, Network bandwidth and GPU
performance are tested for the COS technologies vs bare metal. Preliminary
results and conclusions around them are presented and discussed.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we show synchronization for a group of output passive agents
that communicate with each other according to an underlying communication graph
to achieve a common goal. We propose a distributed event-triggered control
framework that will guarantee synchronization and considerably decrease the
required communication load on the band-limited network. We define a general
Byzantine attack on the event-triggered multi-agent network system and
characterize its negative effects on synchronization. The Byzantine agents are
capable of intelligently falsifying their data and manipulating the underlying
communication graph by altering their respective control feedback weights. We
introduce a decentralized detection framework and analyze its steady-state and
transient performances. We propose a way of identifying individual Byzantine
neighbors and a learning-based method of estimating the attack parameters.
Lastly, we propose learning-based control approaches to mitigate the negative
effects of the adversarial attack.

 <dc:description>  Depth first search is a natural algorithmic technique for constructing a
closed route that visits all vertices of a graph. This paper considers a
variant of such search strategies for edge-weighted trees, where the length of
each route is bounded by a positive integer $B$ (e.g. due to limited energy
resources of the searcher). The objective is to cover all the edges of a tree
$T$ using the minimum number of routes, each starting and ending at the root
and each being of length at most $B$. To this end, we analyze the following
natural greedy tree traversal process that is based on decomposing a depth
first search traversal into a sequence of limited length routes. Given any
arbitrary depth first search traversal $R$ of the tree $T$, we cover $R$ with
routes $R_1,\ldots,R_l$, each of length at most $B$ such that: $R_i$ starts at
the root, reaches directly the farthest point of $R$ visited by $R_{i-1}$, then
$R_i$ continues along the path $R$ as far as possible, and finally $R_i$
returns to the root. We call the above algorithm piecemeal-DFS and we prove
that it achieves the asymptotically minimal number of routes $l$, regardless of
the choice of $R$. Our analysis also shows that the total length of the
traversal (and thus the traversal time) of piecemeal-DFS is asymptotically
minimum for any piecemeal exploration, again regardless of the choice of the
original depth first search traversal $R$. The fact that $R$ can be chosen
arbitrarily makes our approach suitable for construction of distributed and
online algorithms, i.e., when the input tree $T$ is not known in advance,
$R_i$'s can be constructed locally without any knowledge of the yet unvisited
part of $T$. Moreover, our results show that depth first search is efficient
for energy constrained exploration of trees, even though it is known that the
same does not hold for the exploration of arbitrary graphs.

 <dc:description>  Software integrity measurement and attestation (M&amp;A) are critical
technologies for evaluating the trustworthiness of software platforms. To best
support these technologies, next generation systems must provide a centralized
service for securely selecting, collecting, and evaluating integrity
measurements. Centralization of M&amp;A avoids duplication, minimizes security
risks to the system, and ensures correct ad- ministration of integrity policies
and systems. This paper details the desirable features and properties of such a
system, and introduces Maat, a prototype implementation of an M&amp;A service that
meets these properties. Maat is a platform service that provides a centralized
policy-driven framework for determining which measurement tools and protocols
to use to meet the needs of a given integrity evaluation. Maat simplifies the
task of integrating integrity measurements into a range of larger trust
decisions such as authentication, network access control, or delegated
computations.

 <dc:description>  We present the first model and algorithm for L1-norm kernel PCA. While
L2-norm kernel PCA has been widely studied, there has been no work on L1-norm
kernel PCA. For this non-convex and non-smooth problem, we offer geometric
understandings through reformulations and present an efficient algorithm where
the kernel trick is applicable. To attest the efficiency of the algorithm, we
provide a convergence analysis including linear rate of convergence. Moreover,
we prove that the output of our algorithm is a local optimal solution to the
L1-norm kernel PCA problem. We also numerically show its robustness when
extracting principal components in the presence of influential outliers, as
well as its runtime comparability to L2-norm kernel PCA. Lastly, we introduce
its application to outlier detection and show that the L1-norm kernel PCA based
model outperforms especially for high dimensional data.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes distributed algorithms for multi-agent networks to
achieve a solution in finite time to a linear equation $Ax=b$ where $A$ has
full row rank, and with the minimum $l_1$-norm in the underdetermined case
(where $A$ has more columns than rows). The underlying network is assumed to be
undirected and fixed, and an analytical proof is provided for the proposed
algorithm to drive all agents' individual states to converge to a common value,
viz a solution of $Ax=b$, which is the minimum $l_1$-norm solution in the
underdetermined case. Numerical simulations are also provided as validation of
the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:description>  A distributed discrete-time algorithm is proposed for multi-agent networks to
achieve a common least squares solution of a group of linear equations, in
which each agent only knows some of the equations and is only able to receive
information from its nearby neighbors. For fixed, connected, and undirected
networks, the proposed discrete-time algorithm results in each agents solution
estimate to converging exponentially fast to the same least squares solution.
Moreover, the convergence does not require careful choices of time-varying
small step sizes.

 <dc:description>  Online social platforms are beset with hateful speech - content that
expresses hatred for a person or group of people. Such content can frighten,
intimidate, or silence platform users, and some of it can inspire other users
to commit violence. Despite widespread recognition of the problems posed by
such content, reliable solutions even for detecting hateful speech are lacking.
In the present work, we establish why keyword-based methods are insufficient
for detection. We then propose an approach to detecting hateful speech that
uses content produced by self-identifying hateful communities as training data.
Our approach bypasses the expensive annotation process often required to train
keyword systems and performs well across several established platforms, making
substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  While recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have allowed autonomous
learning agents to succeed at a variety of complex tasks, existing algorithms
generally require a lot of training data. One way to increase the speed at
which agents are able to learn to perform tasks is by leveraging the input of
human trainers. Although such input can take many forms, real-time,
scalar-valued feedback is especially useful in situations where it proves
difficult or impossible for humans to provide expert demonstrations. Previous
approaches have shown the usefulness of human input provided in this fashion
(e.g., the TAMER framework), but they have thus far not considered
high-dimensional state spaces or employed the use of deep learning. In this
paper, we do both: we propose Deep TAMER, an extension of the TAMER framework
that leverages the representational power of deep neural networks in order to
learn complex tasks in just a short amount of time with a human trainer. We
demonstrate Deep TAMER's success by using it and just 15 minutes of
human-provided feedback to train an agent that performs better than humans on
the Atari game of Bowling - a task that has proven difficult for even
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.

 <dc:description>  We consider complex networks where line failures occur indirectly as line
flows are influenced by fluctuating input at nodes, a prime example being a
power grid where power is generated by renewable sources. We examine the
propagation of such emergent failures in the small noise regime, combining
concepts from statistical physics and the physics of power flow. In particular
we characterize rigorously and explicitly the configuration of inputs
responsible for failures and cascades, and analyze the propagation of failures,
which often is not of nearest-neighbor type.

 <dc:title>Recognition of feature curves on 3D shapes using an algebraic approach

 <dc:description>  Feature curves are largely adopted to highlight shape features, such as sharp
lines, or to divide surfaces into meaningful segments, like convex or concave
regions. Extracting these curves is not sufficient to convey prominent and
meaningful information about a shape. We have first to separate the curves
belonging to features from those caused by noise and then to select the lines,
which describe non-trivial portions of a surface. The automatic detection of
such features is crucial for the identification and/or annotation of relevant
parts of a given shape. To do this, the Hough transform (HT) is a feature
extraction technique widely used in image analysis, computer vision and digital
image processing, while, for 3D shapes, the extraction of salient feature
curves is still an open problem.
  Thanks to algebraic geometry concepts, the HT technique has been recently
extended to include a vast class of algebraic curves, thus proving to be a
competitive tool for yielding an explicit representation of the diverse feature
lines equations. In the paper, for the first time we apply this novel extension
of the HT technique to the realm of 3D shapes in order to identify and localize
semantic features like patterns, decorations or anatomical details on 3D
objects (both complete and fragments), even in the case of features partially
damaged or incomplete. The method recognizes various features, possibly
compound, and it selects the most suitable feature profiles among families of
algebraic curves.

 <dc:description>  Side-look synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) can produce very high quality images
of the sea-floor. When viewing this imagery, a human observer can often easily
identify various sea-floor textures such as sand ripple, hard-packed sand, sea
grass and rock. In this paper, we present the Possibilistic Fuzzy Local
Information C-Means (PFLICM) approach to segment SAS imagery into sea-floor
regions that exhibit these various natural textures. The proposed PFLICM method
incorporates fuzzy and possibilistic clustering methods and leverages (local)
spatial information to perform soft segmentation. Results are shown on several
SAS scenes and compared to alternative segmentation approaches.

 <dc:description>  This work provides a unified framework for addressing the problem of visual
supervised domain adaptation and generalization with deep models. The main idea
is to exploit the Siamese architecture to learn an embedding subspace that is
discriminative, and where mapped visual domains are semantically aligned and
yet maximally separated. The supervised setting becomes attractive especially
when only few target data samples need to be labeled. In this scenario,
alignment and separation of semantic probability distributions is difficult
because of the lack of data. We found that by reverting to point-wise
surrogates of distribution distances and similarities provides an effective
solution. In addition, the approach has a high speed of adaptation, which
requires an extremely low number of labeled target training samples, even one
per category can be effective. The approach is extended to domain
generalization. For both applications the experiments show very promising
results.

 <dc:description>  Sentence-level classification and sequential labeling are two fundamental
tasks in language understanding. While these two tasks are usually modeled
separately, in reality, they are often correlated, for example in intent
classification and slot filling, or in topic classification and named-entity
recognition. In order to utilize the potential benefits from their
correlations, we propose a jointly trained model for learning the two tasks
simultaneously via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This model predicts
the sentence-level category and the word-level label sequence from the stepwise
output hidden representations of LSTM. We also introduce a novel mechanism of
&quot;sparse attention&quot; to weigh words differently based on their semantic relevance
to sentence-level classification. The proposed method outperforms baseline
models on ATIS and TREC datasets.

 <dc:description>  Surgery risk assessment is an effective tool for physicians to manage the
treatment of patients, but most current research projects fall short in
providing a comprehensive platform to evaluate the patients' surgery risk in
terms of different complications. The recent evolution of big data analysis
techniques makes it possible to develop a real-time platform to dynamically
analyze the surgery risk from large-scale patients information. In this paper,
we propose the Intelligent Perioperative System (IPS), a real-time system that
assesses the risk of postoperative complications (PC) and dynamically interacts
with physicians to improve the predictive results. In order to process large
volume patients data in real-time, we design the system by integrating several
big data computing and storage frameworks with the high through-output
streaming data processing components. We also implement a system prototype
along with the visualization results to show the feasibility of system design.

 <dc:title>Fast Barcode Retrieval for Consensus Contouring</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Marking tumors and organs is a challenging task suffering from both inter-
and intra-observer variability. The literature quantifies observer variability
by generating consensus among multiple experts when they mark the same image.
Automatically building consensus contours to establish quality assurance for
image segmentation is presently absent in the clinical practice. As the
\emph{big data} becomes more and more available, techniques to access a large
number of existing segments of multiple experts becomes possible. Fast
algorithms are, hence, required to facilitate the search for similar cases. The
present work puts forward a potential framework that tested with small datasets
(both synthetic and real images) displays the reliability of finding similar
images. In this paper, the idea of content-based barcodes is used to retrieve
similar cases in order to build consensus contours in medical image
segmentation. This approach may be regarded as an extension of the conventional
atlas-based segmentation that generally works with rather small atlases due to
required computational expenses. The fast segment-retrieval process via
barcodes makes it possible to create and use large atlases, something that
directly contributes to the quality of the consensus building. Because the
accuracy of experts' contours must be measured, we first used 500 synthetic
prostate images with their gold markers and delineations by 20 simulated users.
The fast barcode-guided computed consensus delivered an average error of
$8\%\!\pm\!5\%$ compared against the gold standard segments. Furthermore, we
used magnetic resonance images of prostates from 15 patients delineated by 5
oncologists and selected the best delineations to serve as the gold-standard
segments. The proposed barcode atlas achieved a Jaccard overlap of
$87\%\!\pm\!9\%$ with the contours of the gold-standard segments.

 <dc:title>On the Approximation of Toeplitz Operators for Nonparametric

 <dc:description>  Given a stable SISO LTI system $G$, we investigate the problem of estimating
the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm of $G$, denoted $||G||_\infty$, when $G$ is only
accessible via noisy observations. Wahlberg et al. recently proposed a
nonparametric algorithm based on the power method for estimating the top
eigenvalue of a matrix. In particular, by applying a clever time-reversal
trick, Wahlberg et al. implement the power method on the top left $n \times n$
corner $T_n$ of the Toeplitz (convolution) operator associated with $G$. In
this paper, we prove sharp non-asymptotic bounds on the necessary length $n$
needed so that $||T_n||$ is an $\varepsilon$-additive approximation of
$||G||_\infty$. Furthermore, in the process of demonstrating the sharpness of
our bounds, we construct a simple family of finite impulse response (FIR)
filters where the number of timesteps needed for the power method is
arbitrarily worse than the number of timesteps needed for parametric FIR
identification via least-squares to achieve the same $\varepsilon$-additive
approximation.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel neural machine reading model for open-domain
question answering at scale. Existing machine comprehension models typically
assume that a short piece of relevant text containing answers is already
identified and given to the models, from which the models are designed to
extract answers. This assumption, however, is not realistic for building a
large-scale open-domain question answering system which requires both deep text
understanding and identifying relevant text from corpus simultaneously.
  In this paper, we introduce Neural Comprehensive Ranker (NCR) that integrates
both passage ranking and answer extraction in one single framework. A Q&amp;A
system based on this framework allows users to issue an open-domain question
without needing to provide a piece of text that must contain the answer.
Experiments show that the unified NCR model is able to outperform the
states-of-the-art in both retrieval of relevant text and answer extraction.

 <dc:description>  Embedded, continual learning for autonomous and adaptive behavior is a key
application of neuromorphic hardware designed to mimic the dynamics and
architecture of biological neural networks. However, neuromorphic
implementations of embedded learning at large scales that are both flexible and
efficient have been hindered by a lack of a suitable algorithmic framework. As
a result, most neuromorphic hardware are trained off-line on large clusters of
dedicated processors or GPUs and transferred post hoc to the device. We address
this by introducing the neural and synaptic array transceiver (NSAT), a
neuromorphic computational framework facilitating flexible and efficient
embedded learning. NSAT supports event-driven supervised, unsupervised and
reinforcement learning algorithms including deep learning. We demonstrate the
NSAT in a wide range of tasks, including the simulation of Mihalas-Niebur
neuron, dynamic neural fields, event-driven random back-propagation for
event-based deep learning, event-based contrastive divergence for unsupervised
learning, and voltage-based learning rules for sequence learning. We anticipate
that this contribution will establish the foundation for a new generation of
devices enabling adaptive mobile systems, wearable devices, and robots with
data-driven autonomy.

 <dc:description>  Human activity recognition is one of the important research topics in
computer vision and video understanding. It is often assumed that high quality
video sequences are available for recognition. However, relaxing such a
requirement and implementing robust recognition using videos having reduced
data rates can achieve efficiency in storing and transmitting video data.
Three-dimensional video scalability, which refers to the possibility of
reducing spatial, temporal, and quality resolutions of videos, is an effective
way for flexible representation and management of video data. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of the video scalability on multi-view activity
recognition. We employ both a spatiotemporal feature extraction-based method
and a deep learning-based method using convolutional and recurrent neural
networks. The recognition performance of the two methods is examined, along
with in-depth analysis regarding how their performance vary with respect to
various scalability combinations. In particular, we demonstrate that the deep
learning-based method can achieve significantly improved robustness in
comparison to the feature-based method. Furthermore, we investigate optimal
scalability combinations with respect to bitrate in order to provide useful
guidelines for an optimal operation policy in resource-constrained activity
recognition systems.

 <dc:description>  The ability to deploy neural networks in real-world, safety-critical systems
is severely limited by the presence of adversarial examples: slightly perturbed
inputs that are misclassified by the network. In recent years, several
techniques have been proposed for training networks that are robust to such
examples; and each time stronger attacks have been devised, demonstrating the
shortcomings of existing defenses. This highlights a key difficulty in
designing an effective defense: the inability to assess a network's robustness
against future attacks. We propose to address this difficulty through formal
verification techniques. We construct ground truths: adversarial examples with
provably minimal perturbation. We demonstrate how ground truths can serve to
assess the effectiveness of attack techniques, by comparing the adversarial
examples produced to the ground truths; and also of defense techniques, by
measuring the increase in distortion to ground truths in the hardened network
versus the original. We use this technique to assess recently suggested attack
and defense techniques.

training Recurrent Neural Networks and are particularly suited for temporal
inferencing and pattern recognition. We provide a specific example of a
candidate hardware unit based on a combination of soft-magnets, spin-orbit

 <dc:description>  In environments with energy and processing constraints, such as sensor
networks and embedded devices, sending raw information over wireless networks
can be costly. In order to reduce the amount of transmitted data and ultimately
save energy, we can compress data before transmission. In this paper, we tackle
such problem in the IoT domain by deploying two widely used libraries to
deliver asynchronous messages and data compression/decompression. We evaluate
both our methodology and the compression/decompression performance of the
embedded library in a micro-controller for IoT.

 <dc:description>  Videos captured by consumer cameras often exhibit temporal variations in
color and tone that are caused by camera auto-adjustments like white-balance
and exposure. When such videos are sub-sampled to play fast-forward, as in the
increasingly popular forms of timelapse and hyperlapse videos, these temporal
variations are exacerbated and appear as visually disturbing high frequency
flickering. Previous techniques to photometrically stabilize videos typically
rely on computing dense correspondences between video frames, and use these
correspondences to remove all color changes in the video sequences. However,
this approach is limited in fast-forward videos that often have large content
changes and also might exhibit changes in scene illumination that should be
preserved. In this work, we propose a novel photometric stabilization algorithm
for fast-forward videos that is robust to large content-variation across
frames. We compute pairwise color and tone transformations between neighboring
frames and smooth these pair-wise transformations while taking in account the
possibility of scene/content variations. This allows us to eliminate
high-frequency fluctuations, while still adapting to real variations in scene
characteristics. We evaluate our technique on a new dataset consisting of
controlled synthetic and real videos, and demonstrate that our techniques
outperforms the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  The large-scale online management systems (e.g. Moodle), online web forums
(e.g. Piazza), and online homework systems (e.g. WebAssign) have been widely
used in the blended courses recently. Instructors can use these systems to
deliver class content and materials. Students can communicate with the
classmates, share the course materials, and discuss the course questions via
the online forums. With the increased use of the online systems, a large amount
of students' interaction data has been collected. This data can be used to
analyze students' learning behaviors and predict students' learning outcomes.
In this work, we collected students' interaction data in three different
blended courses. We represented the data as directed graphs and investigated
the correlation between the social graph properties and students' final grades.
Our results showed that in all these classes, students who asked more answers
and received more feedbacks on the forum tend to obtain higher grades. The
significance of this work is that we can use the results to encourage students
to participate more in forums to learn the class materials better; we can also
build a predictive model based on the social metrics to show us low performing
students early in the semester.

includes two tasks, namely user intent classification and online testing of
task-oriented dialogue. To consider the different sources of the data for
training and developing, the first task can also be divided into two sub tasks.
Both the two tasks are coming from the real problems when using the
applications developed by industry. The evaluation data is provided by the

 <dc:title>Information Geometry Connecting Wasserstein Distance and

 <dc:description>  Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold of
probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which
is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the
other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which
reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we
propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework
connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We
primarily considered a discrete case consisting of $n$ elements and studied the
geometry of the probability simplex $S_{n-1}$, which is the set of all
probability distributions over $n$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was
introduced in $S_{n-1}$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from
distribution ${\mathbf{p}}$ to distribution ${\mathbf{q}}$, where
${\mathbf{p}}$, ${\mathbf{q}} \in S_{n-1}$. We relaxed the optimal
transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal
solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The
entropy-relaxed optimal cost $C({\mathbf{p}}, {\mathbf{q}})$ was
computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but
does not define a distance because it is not minimized at
${\mathbf{p}}={\mathbf{q}}$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the
computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the
manifold $S_{n-1} \times S_{n-1}$ of optimal transportation plans. We fully
explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation
plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in
$S_{n-1}$ that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the
KL-divergence.

 <dc:description>  We performed an empirical comparison of ICA and PCA algorithms by applying
them on two simulated noisy time series with varying distribution parameters
and level of noise. In general, ICA shows better results than PCA because it
takes into account higher moments of data distribution. On the other hand, PCA
remains quite sensitive to the level of correlations among signals.

 <dc:description>  Vision based player detection is important in sports applications. Accuracy,
efficiency, and low memory consumption are desirable for real-time tasks such
as intelligent broadcasting and automatic event classification. In this paper,
we present a cascaded convolutional neural network (CNN) that satisfies all
three of these requirements. Our method first trains a binary
(player/non-player) classification network from labeled image patches. Then,
our method efficiently applies the network to a whole image in testing. We
conducted experiments on basketball and soccer games. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can accurately detect players under challenging
conditions such as varying illumination, highly dynamic camera movements and
motion blur. Comparing with conventional CNNs, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on both games with 1000x fewer parameters (i.e., it
is light}.

 <dc:title>Beacon-referenced Mutual Pursuit in Three Dimensions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Motivated by station-keeping applications in various unmanned settings, this
paper introduces a steering control law for a pair of agents operating in the
vicinity of a fixed beacon in a three-dimensional environment. This feedback
law is a modification of the previously studied three-dimensional constant
bearing (CB) pursuit law, in the sense that it incorporates an additional term
to allocate attention to the beacon. We investigate the behavior of the
closed-loop dynamics for a two agent mutual pursuit system in which each agent
employs the beacon-referenced CB pursuit law with regards to the other agent
and a stationary beacon. Under certain assumptions on the associated control
parameters, we demonstrate that this problem admits circling equilibria wherein
the agents move on circular orbits with a common radius, in planes
perpendicular to a common axis passing through the beacon. As the common radius
and distances from the beacon are determined by choice of parameters in the
feedback law, this approach provides a means to engineer desired formations in
a three-dimensional setting.

 <dc:description>  Although artificial intelligence is currently one of the most interesting
areas in scientific research, the potential threats posed by emerging AI
systems remain a source of persistent controversy. To address the issue of AI
threat, this study proposes a standard intelligence model that unifies AI and
human characteristics in terms of four aspects of knowledge, i.e., input,
output, mastery, and creation. Using this model, we observe three challenges,
namely, expanding of the von Neumann architecture; testing and ranking the
intelligence quotient of naturally and artificially intelligent systems,
including humans, Google, Bing, Baidu, and Siri; and finally, the dividing of
artificially intelligent systems into seven grades from robots to Google Brain.
Based on this, we conclude that AlphaGo belongs to the third grade.

 <dc:description>  Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has become a salient technology for
improving the spectral efficiency of the next generation 5G wireless
communication networks. In this paper, the achievable average rate of an
Opportunistic Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (O-NOMA) based Cooperative
Relaying System (CRS) is studied under Rician fading channels with Channel
State Information (CSI) available at the source terminal. Based on CSI, for
opportunistic transmission, the source immediately chooses either the direct
transmission or the cooperative NOMA transmission using the relay, which can
provide better achievable average rate performance than the existing
Conventional-NOMA (C-NOMA) based CRS with no CSI at the source node.
Furthermore, a mathematical expression is also derived for the achievable
average rate and the results are compared with C-NOMA based CRS with no CSI at
the transmitter end, over a range of increasing power allocation coefficients,
transmit Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and average channel powers. Numerical
results show that the CRS using O-NOMA with CSI achieves better spectral
efficiency in terms of the achievable average rate than the Conventional-NOMA
based CRS without CSI. To check the consistency of the derived analytical
results, Monte Carlo simulations are performed which verify that the results
are consistent and matched well with the simulation results.

 <dc:description>  We propose a top-down algorithm for multiple testing on directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent hypotheses and edges specify a partial
ordering in which hypotheses must be tested. The procedure is guaranteed to
reject a sub-DAG with bounded false discovery rate (FDR) while satisfying the
logical constraint that a rejected node's parents must also be rejected. It is
designed for sequential testing settings, when the DAG structure is known a
priori, but the p-values are obtained selectively (such as sequential
conduction of experiments), but the algorithm is also applicable in
non-sequential settings when all p-values can be calculated in advance (such as
variable/model selection). Our DAGGER algorithm, shorthand for Greedily
Evolving Rejections on DAGs, allows for independence, positive or arbitrary
dependence of the p-values, and is guaranteed to work on two different types of
DAGs: (a) intersection DAGs in which all nodes are intersection hypotheses,
with parents being supersets of children, or (b) general DAGs in which all
nodes may be elementary hypotheses. The DAGGER procedure has the appealing
property that it specializes to known algorithms in the special cases of trees
and line graphs, and simplifies to the classic Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
when the DAG has no edges. We explore the empirical performance of DAGGER using
simulations, as well as a real dataset corresponding to a gene ontology DAG,
showing that it performs favorably in terms of time and power.

 <dc:description>  Tree decompositions facilitate computations on complex graphs by grouping
vertices into bags interconnected in an acyclic structure; hence their
importance in a plethora of problems such as query evaluation over databases
and inference over probabilistic graphical models. Different applications take
varying benefits from different tree decompositions, and hence, measure them by
diverse (sometime complex) cost functions. For generic cost functions (such as
width or fill-in), an optimal tree decomposition can be computed in some cases,
notably when the number of minimal separators is bounded by a polynomial (due
to Bouchitte and Todinca); we refer to this assumption as &quot;poly-MS.&quot; Yet, in
general, finding an optimal tree decomposition is computationally intractable
even for these cost functions, and approximations or heuristics are commonly
used. Furthermore, the generic cost functions hardly cover the benefit measures
needed in practice. Therefore, it has recently been proposed to devise
algorithms for enumerating many decomposition candidates for applications to
select from using specialized, or even machine-learned, cost functions.
  We present the first algorithm for enumerating the minimal triangulations of
a graph by increasing cost, for a wide class of cost functions. Consequently,
we get ranked enumeration of the (non-redundant) tree decompositions of a
graph, for a class of cost functions that substantially generalizes the above
generic ones. On the theoretical side, we establish the guarantee of polynomial
delay if poly-MS is assumed, or if we are interested only in decompositions of
a width bounded by a constant. Lastly, we describe an experimental evaluation
on graphs of various domains (join queries, Bayesian networks and random
graphs), and explore both the applicability of the poly-MS assumption and the
performance of our algorithm relative to the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  As AI is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge
of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is
to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems
cooperate in problem-solving, but also it is a necessary step in the process of
building trust as humans migrate greater responsibility to such systems. The
challenge is to find effective ways to communicate the foundations of AI-driven
behaviour, when the algorithms that drive it are far from transparent to
humans. In this paper we consider the opportunities that arise in AI planning,
exploiting the model-based representations that form a familiar and common
basis for communication with users, while acknowledging the gap between
planning algorithms and human problem-solving.

 <dc:description>  Detection of engagement during a conversation is an important function of
human-robot interaction. The level of user engagement can influence the
dialogue strategy of the robot. Our motivation in this work is to detect
several behaviors which will be used as social signal inputs for a real-time
engagement recognition model. These behaviors are nodding, laughter, verbal
backchannels and eye gaze. We describe models of these behaviors which have
been learned from a large corpus of human-robot interactions with the android
robot ERICA. Input data to the models comes from a Kinect sensor and a
microphone array. Using our engagement recognition model, we can achieve
reasonable performance using the inputs from automatic social signal detection,
compared to using manual annotation as input.

 <dc:description>  Let $E$ be a finite set and $\mathcal P$, $\mathcal S$, $\mathcal L$ three
classes of subsets of $E$, and $r$ a function defined on $2^E$. In this paper,
we give an algorithm for testing if the quadruple $(\mathcal P, \mathcal S,
\mathcal L, r)$ is the locked structure of a given matroid, i.e., recognizing
if $(\mathcal P, \mathcal S, \mathcal L, r)$ defines a matroid. This problem is
intractable. Our algorithm improves the running time complexity of a previous
algorithm due to Spinrad. We deduce a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing
large classes of matroids called polynomially locked matroids and uniform
matroids.

 <dc:description>  Network functions virtualization provides opportunities to design, deploy,
and manage networking services. It utilizes cloud computing virtualization
services that run on high-volume servers, switches, and storage hardware to
virtualize network functions. Virtualization techniques can be used in IP
multimedia subsystem (IMS) cloud computing to develop different networking
functions (e.g., load balancing and call admission control). IMS network
signaling happens through session initiation protocol (SIP). An open issue is
the control of overload that occurs when an SIP server lacks sufficient CPU and
memory resources to process all messages. This paper proposes a virtual load
balanced call admission controller (VLB-CAC) for the cloud-hosted SIP servers.
VLB-CAC determines the optimal call admission rates and signaling paths for
admitted calls along with the optimal allocation of CPU and memory resources of
the SIP servers. This optimal solution is derived through a new linear
programming model. This model requires some critical information of SIP servers
as input. Further, VLB-CAC is equipped with an autoscaler to overcome resource
limitations. The proposed scheme is implemented in smart applications on
virtual infrastructure (SAVI) which serves as a virtual testbed. An assessment
of the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the efficiency of the
proposed work.

 <dc:description>  Learning instead of designing robot controllers can greatly reduce
engineering effort required, while also em- phasizing robustness. Despite
considerable progress in simula- tion, applying learning directly in hardware
is still challenging, in part due to the necessity to explore potentially
unstable parameters. We explore the of concept shaping the reward landscape
with training wheels; temporary modifications of the physical hardware that
facilitate learning. We demonstrate the concept with a robot leg mounted on a
boom learning to hop fast. This proof of concept embodies typical challenges
such as instability and contact, while being simple enough to empirically map
out and visualize the reward landscape. Based on our results we propose three
criteria for designing effective training wheels for learning in robotics.

 <dc:description>  Robotic harvesting of crops has the potential to disrupt current agricultural
practices. A key element to enabling robotic harvesting is to safely remove the
crop from the plant which often involves locating and cutting the peduncle, the
part of the crop that attaches it to the main stem of the plant.
  In this paper we present a comparative study of two methods for performing
peduncle detection. The first method is based on classic colour and geometric
features obtained from the scene with a support vector machine classifier,
referred to as PFH-SVM. The second method is an efficient deep neural network
approach, MiniInception, that is able to be deployed on a robotic platform. In
both cases we employ a secondary filtering process that enforces reasonable
assumptions about the crop structure, such as the proximity of the peduncle to
the crop. Our tests are conducted on Harvey, a sweet pepper harvesting robot,
and is evaluated in a greenhouse using two varieties of sweet pepper, Ducati
and Mercuno. We demonstrate that the MiniInception method achieves impressive
accuracy and considerably outperforms the PFH-SVM approach achieving an F1
score of 0.564 and 0.302 respectively.

 <dc:title>Fast online low-rank tensor subspace tracking by CP decomposition using

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of online subspace tracking of a partially observed
high-dimensional data stream corrupted by noise, where we assume that the data
lie in a low-dimensional linear subspace. This problem is cast as an online
low-rank tensor completion problem. We propose a novel online tensor subspace
tracking algorithm based on the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, dubbed
OnLine Low-rank Subspace tracking by TEnsor CP Decomposition (OLSTEC). The
proposed algorithm especially addresses the case in which the subspace of
interest is dynamically time-varying. To this end, we build up our proposed
algorithm exploiting the recursive least squares (RLS), which is the
second-order gradient algorithm. Numerical evaluations on synthetic datasets
and real-world datasets such as communication network traffic, environmental
data, and surveillance videos, show that the proposed OLSTEC algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art online algorithms in terms of the convergence rate
per iteration.

 <dc:title>Shapley Facility Location Games</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Facility location games have been a topic of major interest in economics,
operations research and computer science, starting from the seminal work by
Hotelling. Spatial facility location models have successfully predicted the
outcome of competition in a variety of scenarios. In a typical facility
location game, users/customers/voters are mapped to a metric space representing
their preferences, and each player picks a point (facility) in that space. In
most facility location games considered in the literature, users are assumed to
act deterministically: given the facilities chosen by the players, users are
attracted to their nearest facility. This paper introduces facility location
games with probabilistic attraction, dubbed Shapley facility location games,
due to a surprising connection to the Shapley value. The specific attraction
function we adopt in this model is aligned with the recent findings of the
behavioral economics literature on choice prediction. Given this model, our
first main result is that Shapley facility location games are potential games;
hence, they possess pure Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the latter is true for any
compact user space, any user distribution over that space, and any number of
players. Note that this is in sharp contrast to Hotelling facility location
games. In our second main result we show that under the assumption that players
can compute an approximate best response, approximate equilibrium profiles can
be learned efficiently by the players via dynamics. Our third main result is a
bound on the Price of Anarchy of this class of games, as well as showing the
bound is tight. Ultimately, we show that player payoffs coincide with their
Shapley value in a coalition game, where coalition gains are the social welfare
of the users.

 <dc:description>  Storage and transmission in big data are discussed in this paper, where
message importance is taken into account. Similar to Shannon Entropy and Renyi
Entropy, we define non-parametric message important measure (NMIM) as a measure
for the message importance in the scenario of big data, which can characterize
the uncertainty of random events. It is proved that the proposed NMIM can
sufficiently describe two key characters of big data: rare events finding and
large diversities of events. Based on NMIM, we first propose an effective
compressed encoding mode for data storage, and then discuss the channel
transmission over some typical channel models. Numerical simulation results
show that using our proposed strategy occupies less storage space without
losing too much message importance, and there are growth region and saturation
region for the maximum transmission, which contributes to designing of better
practical communication system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the design of deep neural architectures, recent studies have demonstrated
the benefits of grouping subnetworks into a larger network. For examples, the
Inception architecture integrates multi-scale subnetworks and the residual
network can be regarded that a residual unit combines a residual subnetwork
with an identity shortcut. In this work, we embrace this observation and
propose the Competitive Pathway Network (CoPaNet). The CoPaNet comprises a
stack of competitive pathway units and each unit contains multiple parallel
residual-type subnetworks followed by a max operation for feature competition.
This mechanism enhances the model capability by learning a variety of features
in subnetworks. The proposed strategy explicitly shows that the features
propagate through pathways in various routing patterns, which is referred to as
pathway encoding of category information. Moreover, the cross-block shortcut
can be added to the CoPaNet to encourage feature reuse. We evaluated the
proposed CoPaNet on four object recognition benchmarks: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
SVHN, and ImageNet. CoPaNet obtained the state-of-the-art or comparable results
using similar amounts of parameters. The code of CoPaNet is available at:

 <dc:description>  Given a line segment $I=[0,L]$, the so-called barrier, and a set of $n$
sensors with varying ranges positioned on the line containing $I$, the barrier
coverage problem is to move the sensors so that they cover $I$, while
minimising the total movement. In the case when all the sensors have the same
radius the problem can be solved in $O(n \log n)$ time (Andrews and Wang,
Algorithmica 2017). If the sensors have different radii the problem is known to
be NP-hard to approximate within a constant factor (Czyzowicz et al., ADHOC-NOW
2009). We strengthen this result and prove that no polynomial time
$\rho^{1-\varepsilon}$-approximation algorithm exists unless $P=NP$, where
$\rho$ is the ratio between the largest radius and the smallest radius. Even
when we restrict the number of sensors that are allowed to move by a parameter
$k$, the problem turns out to be W[1]-hard. On the positive side we show that a
$((2+\varepsilon)\rho+2/\varepsilon)$-approximation can be computed in
$O(n^3/\varepsilon^2)$ time and we prove fixed-parameter tractability when
parameterized by the total movement assuming all numbers in the input are
integers.

 <dc:description>  We introduce set packing games as an abstraction of situations in which $n$
selfish players select subsets of a finite set of indivisible items, and
analyze the quality of several equilibria for this class of games. Assuming
that players are able to approximately play equilibrium strategies, we show
that the total quality of the resulting equilibrium solutions is only
moderately suboptimal. Our results are tight bounds on the price of anarchy for
three equilibrium concepts, namely Nash equilibria, subgame perfect equilibria,
and an equilibrium concept that we refer to as $k$-collusion Nash equilibrium.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a privacy preserving encoding framework for
identification applications covering biometrics, physical object security and
the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed framework is based on a sparsifying
transform, which consists of a trained linear map, an element-wise
nonlinearity, and privacy amplification. The sparsifying transform and privacy
amplification are not symmetric for the data owner and data user. We
demonstrate that the proposed approach is closely related to sparse ternary
codes (STC), a recent information-theoretic concept proposed for fast
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high dimensional feature spaces
that being machine learning in nature also offers significant benefits in
comparison to sparse approximation and binary embedding approaches. We
demonstrate that the privacy of the database outsourced to a server as well as
the privacy of the data user are preserved at a low computational cost, storage
and communication burdens.

 <dc:description>  Collective urban mobility embodies the residents' local insights on the city.
Mobility practices of the residents are produced from their spatial choices,
which involve various considerations such as the atmosphere of destinations,
distance, past experiences, and preferences. The advances in mobile computing
and the rise of geo-social platforms have provided the means for capturing the
mobility practices; however, interpreting the residents' insights is
challenging due to the scale and complexity of an urban environment, and its
unique context. In this paper, we present MobInsight, a framework for making
localized interpretations of urban mobility that reflect various aspects of the
urbanism. MobInsight extracts a rich set of neighborhood features through
holistic semantic aggregation, and models the mobility between all-pairs of
neighborhoods. We evaluate MobInsight with the mobility data of Barcelona and
demonstrate diverse localized and semantically-rich interpretations.

 <dc:description>  The graph edit distance (GED) is a well-established distance measure widely
used in many applications. However, existing methods for the GED computation
suffer from several drawbacks including oversized search space, huge memory
consumption, and lots of expensive backtracking. In this paper, we present
BSS_GED, a novel vertex-based mapping method for the GED computation. First, we
create a small search space by reducing the number of invalid and redundant
mappings involved in the GED computation. Then, we utilize beam-stack search
combined with two heuristics to efficiently compute GED, achieving a flexible
trade-off between available memory and expensive backtracking. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BSS GED is highly efficient for the GED
computation on sparse as well as dense graphs and outperforms the
state-of-the-art GED methods. In addition, we also apply BSS_GED to the graph
similarity search problem and the practical results confirm its efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic Flows were introduced by Ford and Fulkerson in 1958 to model flows
over time. They define edge capacities to be the total amount of flow that can
enter an edge {\em in one time unit}. Each edge also has a length, representing
the time needed to traverse it. Dynamic Flows have been used to model many
problems including traffic congestion, hop-routing of packets and evacuation
protocols in buildings. While the basic problem of moving the maximal amount of
supplies from sources to sinks is polynomial time solvable, natural minor
modifications can make it NP-hard.
  One such modification is that flows be confluent, i.e., all flows leaving a
vertex must leave along the same edge. This corresponds to natural conditions
in, e.g., evacuation planning and hop routing.
  We investigate the single-sink Confluent Quickest Flow problem. The input is
a graph with edge capacities and lengths, sources with supplies and a sink. The
problem is to find a confluent flow minimizing the time required to send
supplies to the sink. Our main results include: a) Logarithmic
Non-Approximability: Directed Confluent Quickest Flows cannot be approximated
in polynomial time with an $O(\log n)$ approximation factor, unless $P=NP$.
  b) Polylogarithmic Bicriteria Approximations: Polynomial time $(O(\log^8 n),
O(\log^2 \kappa))$ bicritera approximation algorithms for the Confluent
Quickest Flow problem where $\kappa$ is the number of sinks, in both directed
and undirected graphs.
  Corresponding results are also developed for the Confluent Maximum Flow over
timeproblem. The techniques developed also improve recent approximation
algorithms for static confluent flows.

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with a compositional approach for constructing
abstractions of interconnected discrete-time stochastic control systems. The
abstraction framework is based on new notions of so-called stochastic
simulation functions, using which one can quantify the distance between
original interconnected stochastic control systems and their abstractions in
the probabilistic setting. Accordingly, one can leverage the proposed results
to perform analysis and synthesis over abstract interconnected systems, and
then carry the results over concrete ones. In the first part of the paper, we
derive sufficient small-gain type conditions for the compositional
quantification of the distance in probability between the interconnection of
stochastic control subsystems and that of their abstractions. In the second
part of the paper, we focus on the class of discrete-time linear stochastic
control systems with independent noises in the abstract and concrete
subsystems. For this class of systems, we propose a computational scheme to
construct abstractions together with their corresponding stochastic simulation
functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by
constructing an abstraction (totally 4 dimensions) of the interconnection of
four discrete-time linear stochastic control subsystems (together 100
dimensions) in a compositional fashion.

 <dc:description>  The opportunistic routing has advantages on improving the packet delivery
ratio between source node and candidate set (PDRsc). However, considering the
frequent topology variation in wireless sensor networks, how to improve and
control the PDR has not been investigated in detail. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose an efficient and reliable topology control based opportunistic
routing algorithm (ERTO) which takes PDRsc into account. In ERTO, the
interference and transmission power loss are taken into account during the
calculation of PDRsc. The PDRsc, the expected energy consumption, and the
relationship between transmission power and node degree are considered to
calculate the optimal transmission power and relay node degree jointly. For
improving the routing effective and reducing the calculation complexity, we
introduce the multi-objective optimization into the topology control. During
the routing process, nodes calculate the optimal transmission power and relay
node degree according to the properties of Pareto optimal solution set, by
which the optimal solutions can be selected. Based on these innovations, the
energy consumption, the transmission delay, and the throughout have been
improved greatly compared with the traditional power control based
opportunistic routing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  A recent theoretical analysis shows the equivalence between non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF) and spectral clustering based approach to subspace
clustering. As NMF and many of its variants are essentially linear, we
introduce a nonlinear NMF with explicit orthogonality and derive general
kernel-based orthogonal multiplicative update rules to solve the subspace
clustering problem. In nonlinear orthogonal NMF framework, we propose two
subspace clustering algorithms, named kernel-based non-negative subspace
clustering KNSC-Ncut and KNSC-Rcut and establish their connection with spectral
normalized cut and ratio cut clustering. We further extend the nonlinear
orthogonal NMF framework and introduce a graph regularization to obtain a
factorization that respects a local geometric structure of the data after the
nonlinear mapping. The proposed NMF-based approach to subspace clustering takes
into account the nonlinear nature of the manifold, as well as its intrinsic
local geometry, which considerably improves the clustering performance when
compared to the several recently proposed state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Background: Understanding the condition of OSS projects is important to
analyze features and predict the future of projects. In the field of demography
and economics, health and wealth are considered to understand the condition of
a country. Aim: In this paper, we apply this framework to OSS projects to
understand the communities and the evolution of OSS projects from the
perspectives of health and wealth. Method: We define two measures of Workforce
(WF) and Gross Product Pull Requests (GPPR). We analyze OSS projects in GitHub
and investigate three typical cases. Results: We find that wealthy projects
attract and rely on the casual workforce. Less wealthy projects may require
additional efforts from their more experienced contributors. Conclusions: This
paper presents an approach to assess the relationship between health and wealth
of OSS projects. An interactive demo of our analysis is available at

 <dc:title>Improved approximate near neighbor search without false negatives for
  $l_2$</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wygocki, Piotr</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new algorithm for the $c$--approximate nearest neighbor search
without false negatives for $l_2^d$. We enhance the dimension reduction method
presented in \cite{wygos_red} and combine it with the standard results of Indyk
and Motwani~\cite{motwani}. We present an efficient algorithm with Las Vegas
guaranties for any $c&gt;1$. This improves over the previous results, which
require $c=\omega(\log\log{n})$ \cite{wygos_red}, where $n$ is the number of
the input points. Moreover, we improve both the query time and the
pre-processing time.
  Our algorithm is tunable, which allows for different compromises between the
query and the pre-processing times. In order to illustrate this flexibility, we
present two variants of the algorithm. The &quot;efficient query&quot; variant involves
the query time of $O(d^2)$ and the polynomial pre-processing time. The
&quot;efficient pre-processing&quot; variant involves the pre-processing time equal to
$O(d^{\omega-1} n)$ and the query time sub-linear in $n$, where $\omega$ is the
exponent in the complexity of the fast matrix multiplication.
  In addition, we introduce batch versions of the mentioned algorithms, where
the queries come in batches of size $d$. In this case, the amortized query time
of the &quot;efficient query&quot; algorithm is reduced to $O(d^{\omega -1})$.

 <dc:title>Preconditioners for Saddle Point Problems on Truncated Domains in Phase
  Separation Modelling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kumar, Pawan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The discretization of Cahn-Hilliard equation with obstacle potential leads to
a block 2 by 2 non-linear system, where the p1, 1q block has a non-linear and
non-smooth term. Recently a globally convergent Newton Schur method was
proposed for the non-linear Schur complement corresponding to this non-linear
system. The solver may be seen as an inexact Uzawa method which has the falvour
of an active set method in the sense that the active sets are first identified
by solving a quadratic obstacle problem corresponding to the p1, 1q block of
the block 2 by 2 nonlinear system, and a new decent direction is obtained after
discarding the active set region. The problem becomes linear on nonactive set,
and corresponds to solving a linear saddle point problem on truncated domains.
For solving the quadratic obstacle problem, various optimal multigrid like
methods have been proposed. In this paper solvers for the truncated saddle
point problem is considered. Three preconditioners are considered, two of them
have block diagonal structure, and the third one has block tridiagonal
structure. One of the block diagonal preconditioners is obtained by adding
certain scaling of stiffness and mass matrices, whereas, the remaining two
involves Schur complement. Eigenvalue bound and condition number estimates are
derived for the preconditioned untruncated problem. It is shown that the
extreme eigenvalues of the preconditioned truncated system remain bounded by
the extreme eigenvalues of the preconditioned untruncated system. Numerical
experiments confirm the optimality of the solvers.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A series of problems in different fields such as physics and chemistry are
modeled by differential equations. Differential equations are divided into
partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations which can be
linear or nonlinear. One approach to solve those kinds of equations is using
orthogonal functions into spectral methods. In this paper, we firstly describe
Laguerre, Hermite, and Sinc orthogonal functions. Secondly, we select three
interesting problems which are modeled as differential equations over the
interval $[0, +\infty)$. Then, we use the collocation method as a spectral
method for solving those selected problems and compare the performance of
Laguerre, Hermite, and Sinc orthogonal functions in solving those types of
equations.

in recent years. In this paper we introduce two new coding/decoding algorithms
using Fibonacci $Q$-matrices and $R$-matrices. Our models are based on the

 <dc:description>  Word embeddings are a powerful approach for analyzing language, and
exponential family embeddings (EFE) extend them to other types of data. Here we
develop structured exponential family embeddings (S-EFE), a method for
discovering embeddings that vary across related groups of data. We study how
the word usage of U.S. Congressional speeches varies across states and party
affiliation, how words are used differently across sections of the ArXiv, and
how the co-purchase patterns of groceries can vary across seasons. Key to the
success of our method is that the groups share statistical information. We
develop two sharing strategies: hierarchical modeling and amortization. We
demonstrate the benefits of this approach in empirical studies of speeches,
abstracts, and shopping baskets. We show how S-EFE enables group-specific
interpretation of word usage, and outperforms EFE in predicting held-out data.

matrix factorization. We treat it completely in a simpler fashion than previous
proofs using a new type of interpolation method developed in [1]. We then show
how to harness the structure in &quot;layers&quot; of tensor estimation in order to
obtain a formula for the mutual information for the order 3 problem from the
knowledge of the formula for the order 2 problem, still using the same kind of
interpolation. Our proof technique straightforwardly general- izes and allows
to rigorously obtain the mutual information at any order in a recursive way.

 <dc:title>A New Approach for a Better Load Balancing and a Better Distribution of

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing is a new paradigm where data and services of Information
Technology are provided via the Internet by using remote servers. It represents
a new way of delivering computing resources allowing access to the network on
demand. Cloud computing consists of several services, each of which can hold
several tasks. As the problem of scheduling tasks is an NP-complete problem,
the task management can be an important element in the technology of cloud
computing. To optimize the performance of virtual machines hosted in cloud
computing, several algorithms of scheduling tasks have been proposed. In this
paper, we present an approach allowing to solve the problem optimally and to
take into account the QoS constraints based on the different user requests.
This technique, based on the Branch and Bound algorithm, allows to assign tasks
to different virtual machines while ensuring load balance and a better
distribution of resources. The experimental results show that our approach
gives very promising results for an effective tasks planning. - See more at:

 <dc:description>  Vagueness is something everyone is familiar with. In fact, most people think
that vagueness is closely related to language and exists only there. However,
vagueness is a property of the physical world. Quantum computers harness
superposition and entanglement to perform their computational tasks. Both
superposition and entanglement are vague processes. Thus quantum computers,
which process exact data without &quot;exploiting&quot; vagueness, are actually vague

 <dc:title>Simple Problems: The Simplicial Gluing Structure of Pareto Sets and
  Pareto Fronts</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hamada, Naoki</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quite a few studies on real-world applications of multi-objective
optimization reported that their Pareto sets and Pareto fronts form a
topological simplex. Such a class of problems was recently named the simple
problems, and their Pareto set and Pareto front were observed to have a gluing
structure similar to the faces of a simplex. This paper gives a theoretical
justification for that observation by proving the gluing structure of the
Pareto sets/fronts of subproblems of a simple problem. The simplicity of
standard benchmark problems is studied.

 <dc:description>  Component-based design is a different way of constructing systems which
offers numerous benefits, in particular, decreasing the complexity of system
design. However, deploying components into a system is a challenging and
error-prone task. Model checking is one of the reliable methods that
automatically and systematically analyse the correctness of a given system. Its
brute-force check of the state space significantly expands the level of
confidence in the system. Nevertheless, model checking is limited by a critical
problem so-called State Space Explosion (SSE). To benefit from model checking,
appropriate methods to reduce SSE, is required. In two last decades, a great
number of methods to mitigate the state space explosion have been proposed
which have many similarities, dissimilarities, and unclear concepts in some
cases. This research, firstly, aims at present a review and brief discussion of
the methods of handling SSE problem and classify them based on their
similarities, principle and characteristics. Second, it investigates the
methods for handling SSE problem in verifying Component-based system (CBS) and
provides insight into CBS verification limitations that have not been addressed
yet. The analysis in this research has revealed the patterns, specific
features, and gaps in the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we identified
and discussed suitable methods to soften SSE problem in CBS and underlined the
key challenges for future research efforts.

 <dc:description>  Rule extraction from black-box models is critical in domains that require
model validation before implementation, as can be the case in credit scoring
and medical diagnosis. Though already a challenging problem in statistical
learning in general, the difficulty is even greater when highly non-linear,
recursive models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are fit to data.
Here, we study the extraction of rules from second order recurrent neural
networks trained to recognize the Tomita grammars. We show that production
rules can be stably extracted from trained RNNs and that in certain cases the
rules outperform the trained RNNs.

 <dc:title>Towards Universal Semantic Tagging</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Abzianidze, Lasha</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bos, Johan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper proposes the task of universal semantic tagging---tagging word
tokens with language-neutral, semantically informative tags. We argue that the
task, with its independent nature, contributes to better semantic analysis for
wide-coverage multilingual text. We present the initial version of the semantic
tagset and show that (a) the tags provide semantically fine-grained
information, and (b) they are suitable for cross-lingual semantic parsing. An
application of the semantic tagging in the Parallel Meaning Bank supports both
of these points as the tags contribute to formal lexical semantics and their
cross-lingual projection. As a part of the application, we annotate a small
corpus with the semantic tags and present new baseline result for universal
semantic tagging.

 <dc:description>  The online ads trading platform plays a crucial role in connecting publishers
and advertisers and generates tremendous value in facilitating the convenience
of our lives. It has been evolving into a more and more complicated structure.
In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the revenue for the seller
side via utilizing proper reserve price for the auctions in a dynamical way.
  Predicting the optimal reserve price for each auction in the repeated auction
marketplaces is a non-trivial problem. However, we were able to come up with an
efficient method of improving the seller revenue by mainly focusing on
adjusting the reserve price for those high-value inventories. Previously, no
dedicated work has been performed from this perspective. Inspired by Paul and
Michael, our model first identifies the value of the inventory by predicting
the top bid price bucket using a cascade of classifiers. The cascade is
essential in significantly reducing the false positive rate of a single
classifier. Based on the output of the first step, we build another cluster of
classifiers to predict the price separations between the top two bids. We
showed that although the high-value auctions are only a small portion of all
the traffic, successfully identifying them and setting correct reserve price
would result in a significant revenue lift. Moreover, our optimization is
compatible with all other reserve price models in the system and does not
impact their performance. In other words, when combined with other models, the
enhancement on exchange revenue will be aggregated. Simulations on randomly
sampled Yahoo ads exchange (YAXR) data showed stable and expected lift after
applying our model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, achievable information rates (AIR) for fiber optical
communications are discussed. It is shown that AIRs such as the mutual
information and generalized mutual information are good design metrics for
coded optical systems. The theoretical predictions of AIRs are compared to the
performance of modern codes including low-parity density check (LDPC) and polar
codes. Two different computation methods for these AIRs are also discussed:
Monte-Carlo integration and Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Closed-form ready-to-use
approximations for such computations are provided for arbitrary constellations
and the multidimensional AWGN channel. The computation of AIRs in optical
experiments and simulations is also discussed.

 <dc:description>  The demand for cloud computing is increasing because of the popularity of
digital devices and the wide use of the Internet. Among cloud computing
services, most consumers use cloud storage services that provide mass storage.
This is because these services give them various additional functions as well
as storage. It is easy to access cloud storage services using smartphones. With
increasing utilization, it is possible for malicious users to abuse cloud
storage services. Therefore, a study on digital forensic investigation of cloud
storage services is necessary. This paper proposes new procedure for
investigating and analyzing the artifacts of all accessible devices, such as
Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android smartphone.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new approach to cost-effective, high-throughput
hardware designs for Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoders. The proposed
approach, called Non-Surjective Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders (NS-FAIDs),
exploits the robustness of message-passing LDPC decoders to inaccuracies in the
calculation of exchanged messages, and it is shown to provide a unified
framework for several designs previously proposed in the literature. NS-FAIDs
are optimized by density evolution for regular and irregular LDPC codes, and
are shown to provide different trade-offs between hardware complexity and
decoding performance. Two hardware architectures targeting high-throughput
applications are also proposed, integrating both Min-Sum (MS) and NS-FAID
decoding kernels. ASIC post synthesis implementation results on 65nm CMOS
technology show that NS-FAIDs yield significant improvements in the throughput
to area ratio, by up to 58.75% with respect to the MS decoder, with even better
or only slightly degraded error correction performance.

 <dc:description>  We provide a framework for determining the centralities of agents in a broad
family of random networks. Current understanding of network centrality is
largely restricted to deterministic settings, but practitioners frequently use
random network models to accommodate data limitations or prove asymptotic
results. Our main theorems show that on large random networks, centrality
measures are close to their expected values with high probability. We
illustrate the economic consequences of these results by presenting three
applications: (1) In network formation models based on community structure
(called stochastic block models), we show network segregation and differences
in community size produce inequality. Benefits from peer effects tend to accrue
disproportionately to bigger and better-connected communities. (2) When link
probabilities depend on geography, we can compute and compare the centralities
of agents in different locations. (3) In models where connections depend on
several independent characteristics, we give a formula that determines
centralities 'characteristic-by-characteristic'. The basic techniques from
these applications, which use the main theorems to reduce questions about
random networks to deterministic calculations, extend to many network games.

 <dc:title>Runtime Distributions and Criteria for Restarts</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lorenz, Jan-Hendrik</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Randomized algorithms sometimes employ a restart strategy. After a certain
number of steps, the current computation is aborted and restarted with a new,
independent random seed. In some cases, this results in an improved overall
expected runtime. This work introduces properties of the underlying runtime
distribution which determine whether restarts are advantageous. The most
commonly used probability distributions admit the use of a scale and a location
parameter. Location parameters shift the density function to the right, while
scale parameters affect the spread of the distribution. It is shown that for
all distributions scale parameters do not influence the usefulness of restarts
and that location parameters only have a limited influence. This result
simplifies the analysis of the usefulness of restarts. The most important
runtime probability distributions are the log-normal, the Weibull, and the
Pareto distribution. In this work, these distributions are analyzed for the
usefulness of restarts. Secondly, a condition for the optimal restart time (if
it exists) is provided. The log-normal, the Weibull, and the generalized Pareto
distribution are analyzed in this respect. Moreover, it is shown that the
optimal restart time is also not influenced by scale parameters and that the
influence of location parameters is only linear.

 <dc:description>  Timing detection is the first step and very important in wireless
communication systems. Timing detection performance is usually affected by the
frequency offset. Therefore, it is a challenge to design the synchronization
signal in massive narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) scenarios where the
frequency offset is usually large due to the low cost requirement. In this
paper, we firstly proposed a new general synchronization signal structure with
a couple of sequences which are conjugated to remove the potential timing error
arose from large frequency offset. Then, we analyze the suitable sequence for
our proposed synchronization signal structure and discuss a special ZC sequence
as an example. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate our proposed
synchronization signal can work well when the frequency offset is large. It
means that our proposed synchronization signal design is very suitable for the
massive NB-IoT.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes Concurrent-Access Obfuscated Store (CAOS), a construction
for remote data storage that provides access-pattern obfuscation in a
honest-but-curious adversarial model, while allowing for low bandwidth overhead
and client storage. Compared to the state of the art, the main advantage of
CAOS is that it supports concurrent access without a proxy, for multiple
read-only clients and a single read-write client. Concurrent access is achieved
by letting clients maintain independent maps that describe how the data is
stored. These maps might diverge from client to client, but it is guaranteed
that no client will ever lose track of current data. We achieve efficiency and
concurrency at the expense of perfect obfuscation: in CAOS the extent to which
access patterns are hidden is determined by the resources allocated to its
built-in obfuscation mechanism. To assess this trade-off we provide both a
security and a performance analysis of our protocol instance. We additionally
provide a proof-of-concept implementation.

 <dc:description>  We present an optimised multi-modal dialogue agent for interactive learning
of visually grounded word meanings from a human tutor, trained on real
human-human tutoring data. Within a life-long interactive learning period, the
agent, trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), must be able to handle
natural conversations with human users and achieve good learning performance
(accuracy) while minimising human effort in the learning process. We train and
evaluate this system in interaction with a simulated human tutor, which is
built on the BURCHAK corpus -- a Human-Human Dialogue dataset for the visual
learning task. The results show that: 1) The learned policy can coherently
interact with the simulated user to achieve the goal of the task (i.e. learning
visual attributes of objects, e.g. colour and shape); and 2) it finds a better
trade-off between classifier accuracy and tutoring costs than hand-crafted
rule-based policies, including ones with dynamic policies.

 <dc:description>  We present a multi-modal dialogue system for interactive learning of
perceptually grounded word meanings from a human tutor. The system integrates
an incremental, semantic parsing/generation framework - Dynamic Syntax and Type
Theory with Records (DS-TTR) - with a set of visual classifiers that are
learned throughout the interaction and which ground the meaning representations
that it produces. We use this system in interaction with a simulated human
tutor to study the effects of different dialogue policies and capabilities on
the accuracy of learned meanings, learning rates, and efforts/costs to the
tutor. We show that the overall performance of the learning agent is affected
by (1) who takes initiative in the dialogues; (2) the ability to express/use
their confidence level about visual attributes; and (3) the ability to process
elliptical and incrementally constructed dialogue turns. Ultimately, we train
an adaptive dialogue policy which optimises the trade-off between classifier
accuracy and tutoring costs.

 <dc:description>  We motivate and describe a new freely available human-human dialogue dataset
for interactive learning of visually grounded word meanings through ostensive
definition by a tutor to a learner. The data has been collected using a novel,
character-by-character variant of the DiET chat tool (Healey et al., 2003;
Mills and Healey, submitted) with a novel task, where a Learner needs to learn
invented visual attribute words (such as &quot; burchak &quot; for square) from a tutor.
As such, the text-based interactions closely resemble face-to-face conversation
and thus contain many of the linguistic phenomena encountered in natural,
spontaneous dialogue. These include self-and other-correction, mid-sentence
continuations, interruptions, overlaps, fillers, and hedges. We also present a
generic n-gram framework for building user (i.e. tutor) simulations from this
type of incremental data, which is freely available to researchers. We show
that the simulations produce outputs that are similar to the original data
(e.g. 78% turn match similarity). Finally, we train and evaluate a
Reinforcement Learning dialogue control agent for learning visually grounded
word meanings, trained from the BURCHAK corpus. The learned policy shows
comparable performance to a rule-based system built previously.

 <dc:description>  When using stochastic gradient descent to solve large-scale machine learning
problems, a common practice of data processing is to shuffle the training data,
partition the data across multiple machines if needed, and then perform several
epochs of training on the re-shuffled (either locally or globally) data. The
above procedure makes the instances used to compute the gradients no longer
independently sampled from the training data set. Then does the distributed SGD
method have desirable convergence properties in this practical situation? In
this paper, we give answers to this question. First, we give a mathematical
formulation for the practical data processing procedure in distributed machine
learning, which we call data partition with global/local shuffling. We observe
that global shuffling is equivalent to without-replacement sampling if the
shuffling operations are independent. We prove that SGD with global shuffling
has convergence guarantee in both convex and non-convex cases. An interesting
finding is that, the non-convex tasks like deep learning are more suitable to
apply shuffling comparing to the convex tasks. Second, we conduct the
convergence analysis for SGD with local shuffling. The convergence rate for
local shuffling is slower than that for global shuffling, since it will lose
some information if there's no communication between partitioned data. Finally,
we consider the situation when the permutation after shuffling is not uniformly
distributed (insufficient shuffling), and discuss the condition under which
this insufficiency will not influence the convergence rate. Our theoretical
results provide important insights to large-scale machine learning, especially
in the selection of data processing methods in order to achieve faster
convergence and good speedup. Our theoretical findings are verified by
extensive experiments on logistic regression and deep neural networks.

 <dc:title>On the Capacity of Face Representation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Face recognition is a widely used technology with numerous large-scale
applications, such as surveillance, social media and law enforcement. There has
been tremendous progress in face recognition accuracy over the past few
decades, much of which can be attributed to deep learning based approaches
during the last five years. Indeed, automated face recognition systems are now
believed to surpass human performance in some scenarios. Despite this progress,
a crucial question still remains unanswered: given a face representation, how
many identities can it resolve? In other words, what is the capacity of the
face representation? A scientific basis for estimating the capacity of a given
face representation will not only benefit the evaluation and comparison of
different face representation methods, but will also establish an upper bound
on the scalability of an automatic face recognition system. We cast the face
capacity estimation problem under the information theoretic framework of
capacity of a Gaussian noise channel. By explicitly accounting for two sources
of representational noise: epistemic (model) uncertainty and aleatoric (data)
variability, our approach is able to estimate the capacity of any given face
representation. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we estimate the
capacity of a 128-dimensional state-of-the-art deep neural network based face
representation, FaceNet. Our numerical experiments indicate that, (a) our
capacity estimation model yields a capacity upper bound of $1\times10^{12}$ for
the FaceNet representation at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 5%, (b) the
capacity reduces drastically as you lower the desired FAR with an estimate of
$2\times10^{7}$ and $6\times10^{3}$ at FAR of 0.1% and 0.001%, respectively),
and (c) the performance of the FaceNet representation is significantly below
the theoretical limit.

 <dc:description>  Four key processes in data integration are: data preparation (i.e.,
extracting, transforming, and cleaning data), schema integration (i.e.,
identifying attribute correspondences), entity resolution (i.e., finding
clusters of records that represent the same entity) and entity consolidation
(i.e., merging each cluster into a 'golden record', which contains the
canonical value for each attribute). In real-world scenarios, Master Data
Management (MDM) is often employed to perform the last two steps using a
'match-merge' module, which is driven by a collection of user-written match and
merge rules. However, it is well understood that such solutions often fail to
scale to the sizes and complexity of problems currently being addressed.
  Scalable solutions to entity resolution have been previously developed to
generate a collection of clusters of records representing the same entity. In
this paper, we propose a scalable entity consolidation algorithm to merge these
clusters into 'golden records'. We first automatically generate matching rules
from the clusters and then group these rules into sets with common
characteristics to cut down on the number which must be verified by a human.
Next, for the human-approved rule groups, we apply them to merge the duplicate
attribute values in the clusters. Finally, we employ existing truth discovery
methods, such as majority consensus (MC), to resolve remaining conflicts in the
clusters. We applied our methods on three real-world datasets. In a dataset
with 31,023 clusters and 80,451 duplicate records, 72,239 matching rules were
generated. By having a human con rm only 100 algorithm-generated rule groups,
we achieved a recall of 75% and a precision of 98% for merging duplicate
attribute values. When we invoked our algorithm prior to running MC, we
improved the precision of golden record construction by 40%.

 <dc:description>  Estimating shape and appearance of a three dimensional object from a given
set of images is a classic research topic that is still actively pursued. Among
the various techniques available, PS is distinguished by the assumption that
the underlying input images are taken from the same point of view but under
different lighting conditions. The most common techniques provide the shape
information in terms of surface normals. In this work, we instead propose to
minimise a much more natural objective function, namely the reprojection error
in terms of depth. Minimising the resulting non-trivial variational model for
PS allows to recover the depth of the photographed scene directly. As a solving
strategy, we follow an approach based on a recently published optimisation
scheme for non-convex and non-smooth cost functions.
  The main contributions of our paper are of theoretical nature. A technical
novelty in our framework is the usage of matrix differential calculus. We
supplement our approach by a detailed convergence analysis of the resulting
optimisation algorithm and discuss possibilities to ease the computational
complexity. At hand of an experimental evaluation we discuss important
properties of the method. Overall, our strategy achieves more accurate results
than competing approaches. The experiments also highlights some practical
aspects of the underlying optimisation algorithm that may be of interest in a
more general context.

This result serves as mathematical foundation for the analysis of machine
learning algorithms based on compositions of functions. As a direct
consequence, the corresponding infinite-dimensional minimization problems can
be recast into (nonlinear) finite-dimensional minimization problems, which can
be tackled with nonlinear optimization algorithms. Moreover, we show how
concatenated machine learning problems can be reformulated as neural networks
and how our representer theorem applies to a broad class of state-of-the-art
deep learning methods.

 <dc:description>  The interest in accelerating black-box optimizers has resulted in several
surrogate model-assisted version of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy, a state-of-the-art continuous black-box optimizer. The version called
Surrogate CMA-ES uses Gaussian processes or random forests surrogate models
with a generation-based evolution control. This paper presents an adaptive
improvement for S-CMA-ES based on a general procedure introduced with the
s*ACM-ES algorithm, in which the number of generations using the surrogate
model before retraining is adjusted depending on the performance of the last
instance of the surrogate. Three algorithms that differ in the measure of the
surrogate model's performance are evaluated on the COCO/BBOB framework. The
results show a minor improvement on S-CMA-ES with constant model lifelengths,
especially when larger lifelengths are considered.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel approach to learn word embeddings based on an extended
version of the distributional hypothesis. Our model derives word embedding
vectors using the etymological composition of words, rather than the context in
which they appear. It has the strength of not requiring a large text corpus,
but instead it requires reliable access to etymological roots of words, making
it specially fit for languages with logographic writing systems. The model
consists on three steps: (1) building an etymological graph, which is a
bipartite network of words and etymological roots, (2) obtaining the
biadjacency matrix of the etymological graph and reducing its dimensionality,
(3) using columns/rows of the resulting matrices as embedding vectors. We test
our model in the Chinese and Sino-Korean vocabularies. Our graphs are formed by
a set of 117,000 Chinese words, and a set of 135,000 Sino-Korean words. In both
cases we show that our model performs well in the task of synonym discovery.

module. Compared to conventional crawlers, OmniCrawler module possesses an
extra degree of freedom for sideways rolling motion, and the circular
crosssection of the module enables holonomic motion of the robot. These
advantages are further enhanced by the introduction of Omnidirectional joint
with-in the module, which is the key contribution of this paper. This achieves
high maneuverability and adaptability of the OmniCrawler module on an uneven
surface. The Omni-directional bending is realized by means of two mechanisms: a
Telescopic screw drive mechanism, and an arrangement of two independent 1-DOF
joints aligned at 90? with respect to each other. The hybrid soft-rigid
structure of the module provides compliant pathways for lug-chain assembly
which allows crawling motion even in the bent configuration of the module. We
show that the unique modular design unveils its versatility in terms of
achieving compliance on an uneven surface, demonstrating its applications in
different robotic platforms, such as an in-pipeline robot, Quadruped, snake
robot, and exhibiting hybrid locomotive traits in various configurations of the
robots with the help of simulations and experiments results on real robot
prototype.

 <dc:title>The 2CNF Boolean Formula Satisfiability Problem and the Linear Space
  Hypothesis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yamakami, Tomoyuki</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We aim at investigating the solvability/insolvability of nondeterministic
logarithmic-space (NL) decision, search, and optimization problems
parameterized by size parameters using simultaneously polynomial time and
sub-linear space on multi-tape deterministic Turing machines. We are
particularly focused on a special NL-complete problem, 2SAT--the 2CNF Boolean
formula satisfiability problem--parameterized by the number of Boolean
variables. It is shown that 2SAT with n variables and m clauses can be solved
simultaneously polynomial time and n/2^{c\sqrt{log{n}}} polylog(m+n)$ space for
an absolute constant c&gt;0. This fact inspires us to propose a new, practical
working hypothesis, called the linear space hypothesis (LSH), which states that
2SAT_3--a restricted variant of 2SAT in which each variable of a given 2CNF
formula appears as literals in at most 3 clauses--cannot be solved
simultaneously in polynomial time using strictly &quot;sub-linear&quot; (i.e., n^e
polylog(n) for a certain constant e in (0,1)) space. An immediate consequence
of this working hypothesis is L=/=NL. Moreover, we use our hypothesis as a
plausible basis to lead to the insolvability of various NL search problems as
well as the nonapproximability of NL optimization problems.
  For our investigation, since standard logarithmic-space reductions may no
longer preserve polynomial-time sub-linear-space complexity, we need to
introduce a new, practical notion of &quot;short reduction.&quot; It turns out that the
complement of 2SAT_3 is complete for a restricted version of NL, called
Syntactic NL or simply SNL, under such short reductions. This fact supports the
legitimacy of our working hypothesis.

 <dc:description>  In the load balancing problem, introduced by Graham in the 1960s (SIAM J. of
Appl. Math. 1966, 1969), jobs arriving online have to be assigned to machines
so to minimize an objective defined on machine loads. A long line of work has
addressed this problem for both the makespan norm and arbitrary $\ell_q$-norms
of machine loads. Recent literature (e.g., Azar et al., STOC 2013; Im et al.,
FOCS 2015) has further expanded the scope of this problem to vector loads, to
capture jobs with multi-dimensional resource requirements in applications such
as data centers. In this paper, we completely resolve the job scheduling
problem for both scalar and vector jobs on related machines, i.e., where each
machine has a given speed and the time taken to process a job is inversely
proportional to the speed of the machine it is assigned on.
  We show the following results. For scalar scheduling, we give a constant
competitive algorithm for optimizing any $\ell_q$-norm for related machines.
The only previously known result was for the makespan norm. For vector
scheduling, there are two natural variants for vector scheduling, depending on
whether the speed of a machine is dimension-dependent or not. We show a sharp
contrast between these two variants, proving that they are respectively
equivalent to unrelated machines and identical machines for the makespan norm.
We also extend these results to arbitrary $\ell_q$-norms of the machine loads.
No previous results were known for vector scheduling on related machines.

 <dc:description>  GANs provide a framework for training generative models which mimic a data
distribution. However, in many cases we wish to train these generative models
to optimize some auxiliary objective function within the data it generates,
such as making more aesthetically pleasing images. In some cases, these
objective functions are difficult to evaluate, e.g. they may require human
interaction. Here, we develop a system for efficiently improving a GAN to
target an objective involving human interaction, specifically generating images
that increase rates of positive user interactions. To improve the generative
model, we build a model of human behavior in the targeted domain from a
relatively small set of interactions, and then use this behavioral model as an
auxiliary loss function to improve the generative model. We show that this
system is successful at improving positive interaction rates, at least on
simulated data, and characterize some of the factors that affect its
performance.

 <dc:description>  Even though speech-emotion recognition (SER) has been receiving much
attention as research topic, there are still some disputes about which vocal
features can identify certain emotion. Emotion expression is also known to be
differed according to the cultural backgrounds that make it important to study
SER specific to the culture where the language belongs to. Furthermore, only a
few studies addresses the SER in Indonesian which what this study attempts to
explore. In this study, we extract simple features from 3420 voice data
gathered from 38 participants. The features are compared by means of linear
mixed effect model which shows that people who are in emotional and
non-emotional state can be differentiated by their speech duration. Using SVM
and speech duration as input feature, we achieve 76.84% average accuracy in
classifying emotional and non-emotional speech.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Conflict-Free Colorings in the Plane</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study dynamic conflict-free colorings in the plane, where the goal is to
maintain a conflict-free coloring (CF-coloring for short) under insertions and
deletions.
  - First we consider CF-colorings of a set $S$ of unit squares with respect to
points. Our method maintains a CF-coloring that uses $O(\log n)$ colors at any
time, where $n$ is the current number of squares in $S$, at the cost of only
$O(\log n)$ recolorings per insertion or deletion of a square. We generalize
the method to rectangles whose sides have lengths in the range $[1,c]$, where
$c$ is a fixed constant. Here the number of used colors becomes $O(\log^2 n)$.
The method also extends to arbitrary rectangles whose coordinates come from a
fixed universe of size $N$, yielding $O(\log^2 N \log^2 n)$ colors. The number
of recolorings for both methods stays in $O(\log n)$.
  - We then present a general framework to maintain a CF-coloring under
insertions for sets of objects that admit a unimax coloring with a small number
of colors in the static case. As an application we show how to maintain a
CF-coloring with $O(\log^3 n)$ colors for disks (or other objects with linear
union complexity) with respect to points at the cost of $O(\log n)$ recolorings
per insertion. We extend the framework to the fully-dynamic case when the
static unimax coloring admits weak deletions. As an application we show how to
maintain a CF-coloring with $O(\sqrt{n} \log^2 n)$ colors for points with
respect to rectangles, at the cost of $O(\log n)$ recolorings per insertion and
$O(1)$ recolorings per deletion. These are the first results on fully-dynamic
CF-colorings in the plane, and the first results for semi-dynamic CF-colorings
for non-congruent objects.

 <dc:description>  We show that for all given $n,t,w \in \{1,2,...\}$ with $n&lt;2^w$, an array of
$n$ entries of $w$ bits each can be represented on a word RAM with a word
length of $w$ bits in at most $nw+\lceil n(t/(2 w))^t\rceil$ bits of
uninitialized memory to support constant-time initialization of the whole array
and $O(t)$-time reading and writing of individual array entries. At one end of
this tradeoff, we achieve initialization and access (i.e., reading and writing)
in constant time with $nw+\lceil n/w^t\rceil$ bits for arbitrary fixed $t$, to
be compared with $nw+\Theta(n)$ bits for the best previous solution, and at the
opposite end, still with constant-time initialization, we support $O(\log
n)$-time access with just $nw+1$ bits, which is optimal for arbitrary access
times if the initialization executes fewer than $n$ steps.

 <dc:description>  We used to marry people to which we were somehow connected to: friends of
friends, schoolmates, neighbours. Since we were more connected to people
similar to us, we were likely to marry someone from our own race.
  However, online dating has changed this pattern: people who meet online tend
to be complete strangers. Given that one-third of modern marriages start
online, we investigate theoretically, using random graphs and matching theory,
the effects of those previously absent ties in the diversity of modern
societies.
  We find that when a society benefits from previously absent ties, social
integration occurs rapidly, even if the number of partners met online is small.
Our findings are consistent with the sharp increase in interracial marriages in
the U.S. in the last two decades.

 <dc:title>What Automated Planning can do for Business Process Management</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Marrella, Andrea</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Business Process Management (BPM) is a central element of today
organizations. Despite over the years its main focus has been the support of
processes in highly controlled domains, nowadays many domains of interest to
the BPM community are characterized by ever-changing requirements,
unpredictable environments and increasing amounts of data that influence the
execution of process instances. Under such dynamic conditions, BPM systems must
increase their level of automation to provide the reactivity and flexibility
necessary for process management. On the other hand, the Artificial
Intelligence (AI) community has concentrated its efforts on investigating
dynamic domains that involve active control of computational entities and
physical devices (e.g., robots, software agents, etc.). In this context,
Automated Planning, which is one of the oldest areas in AI, is conceived as a
model-based approach to synthesize autonomous behaviours in automated way from
a model. In this paper, we discuss how automated planning techniques can be
leveraged to enable new levels of automation and support for business
processing, and we show some concrete examples of their successful application
to the different stages of the BPM life cycle.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we develop a notion of Quillen bifibration which combines
the two notions of Grothendieck bifibration and of Quillen model structure. In
particular, given a bifibration $p:\mathcal E\to\mathcal B$, we describe when a
family of model structures on the fibers $\mathcal E_A$ and on the basis
category $\mathcal B$ combines into a model structure on the total category
$\mathcal E$, such that the functor $p$ preserves cofibrations, fibrations and
weak equivalences. Using this Grothendieck construction for model structures,
we revisit the traditional definition of Reedy model structures, and possible
generalizations, and exhibit their bifibrational nature.

 <dc:description>  Utilities use demand response to shift or reduce electricity usage of
flexible loads, to better match electricity demand to power generation. A
common mechanism is peak pricing (PP), where consumers pay reduced (increased)
prices for electricity during periods of low (high) demand, and its simplicity
allows consumers to understand how their consumption affects costs. However,
new consumer technologies like internet-connected smart thermostats simplify
real-time pricing (RP), because such devices can automate the tradeoff between
costs and consumption. These devices enable consumer choice under RP by
abstracting this tradeoff into a question of quality of service (e.g., comfort)
versus price. This paper uses a principal-agent framework to design PP and RP
rates for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) to address adverse
selection due to variations in consumer comfort preferences. We formulate the
pricing problem as a stochastic bilevel program, and numerically solve it by
reformulation as a mixed integer program (MIP). Last, we compare the
effectiveness of different pricing schemes on reductions of peak load or load
variability. We find that PP pricing induces HVAC consumption to spike high
(before), spike low (during), and spike high (after) the PP event, whereas RP
achieves reductions in peak loads and load variability while preventing large
spikes in electricity usage.

 <dc:description>  Enabling robots to autonomously navigate complex environments is essential
for real-world deployment. Prior methods approach this problem by having the
robot maintain an internal map of the world, and then use a localization and
planning method to navigate through the internal map. However, these approaches
often include a variety of assumptions, are computationally intensive, and do
not learn from failures. In contrast, learning-based methods improve as the
robot acts in the environment, but are difficult to deploy in the real-world
due to their high sample complexity. To address the need to learn complex
policies with few samples, we propose a generalized computation graph that
subsumes value-based model-free methods and model-based methods, with specific
instantiations interpolating between model-free and model-based. We then
instantiate this graph to form a navigation model that learns from raw images
and is sample efficient. Our simulated car experiments explore the design
decisions of our navigation model, and show our approach outperforms
single-step and $N$-step double Q-learning. We also evaluate our approach on a
real-world RC car and show it can learn to navigate through a complex indoor
environment with a few hours of fully autonomous, self-supervised training.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel framework for the automatic discovery and recognition of
human motion primitives from motion capture data. Human motion primitives are
discovered by optimizing the 'motion flux', a quantity which depends on the
motion of a group of skeletal joints. Models of each primitive category are
computed via non-parametric Bayes methods and recognition is performed based on
their geometric properties. A normalization of the primitives is proposed in
order to make them invariant with respect to anatomical variations and data
sampling rate. Using our framework we build a publicly available dataset of
human motion primitives based on motion capture sequences taken from well-known
datasets. We expect that our framework, by providing an objective way for
discovering and categorizing human motion, will be a useful tool in numerous
research fields related to Robotics including human inspired motion generation,
learning by demonstration, and intuitive human-robot interaction.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel family of distances, called the chord gap divergences,

statistical Bhattacharyya distance that is frequently met in applications. We

analyze the performance of the $k$-means++ clustering with respect to that new
dissimilarity measure by introducing the Taylor-Lagrange remainder form of the

 <dc:description>  Execution monitor of high-level robot actions can be effectively improved by
visual monitoring the state of the world in terms of preconditions and
postconditions that hold before and after the execution of an action.
Furthermore a policy for searching where to look at, either for verifying the
relations that specify the pre and postconditions or to refocus in case of a
failure, can tremendously improve the robot execution in an uncharted
environment. It is now possible to strongly rely on visual perception in order
to make the assumption that the environment is observable, by the amazing
results of deep learning. In this work we present visual execution monitoring
for a robot executing tasks in an uncharted Lab environment. The execution
monitor interacts with the environment via a visual stream that uses two DCNN
for recognizing the objects the robot has to deal with and manipulate, and a
non-parametric Bayes estimation to discover the relations out of the DCNN
features. To recover from lack of focus and failures due to missed objects we
resort to visual search policies via deep reinforcement learning.

 <dc:description>  In autonomous driving, imitation learning of driving behavior is an active
area of research as it enables generalization to many different environments
where current hand-crafted approaches are limited in their application.
Steering and motor commands are trained i.e. as an output of a deep neural
network, based on expert examples. However, this approach makes it often hard
to judge the actual real-life performance, beyond loss-function and validation
values. Current used metrics are often weakly expressive as they count the
number of crashes or human interventions while driving (Bojarski et. al 2016).
Furthermore, by learning from the example of a human expert, the performance of
the human instructor will heavily determine the performance of driving. We
propose a novel way to train obstacle avoidance and navigation using a
multi-task network with minimal human interaction and show a detailed way of
measuring the actual driving performance of the network after training. A path
planner with perfect information about the environment trains a model-car to
act on vision input alone to navigate in a narrow office space. For different
sub-spaces of that scenario, where the very same trajectories have to be driven
by the car in each run, an in-depth analysis of the trajectories before and
after training is performed. This makes it possible to compare the actual
driving behavior to training factors as the distribution of the input data and
values of the loss- and validation-function in great detail. Furthermore, it is
possible to measure how well chosen parameters of the desired behavior, as set
in the path planner, are preserved in the resulting trajectories.

 <dc:description>  Current tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA) require users to manually
select data attributes, statistical computations and visual encodings. This can
be daunting for large-scale, complex data. We introduce Foresight, a
visualization recommender system that helps the user rapidly explore large
high-dimensional datasets through &quot;guideposts.&quot; A guidepost is a visualization
corresponding to a pronounced instance of a statistical descriptor of the
underlying data, such as a strong linear correlation between two attributes,
high skewness or concentration about the mean of a single attribute, or a
strong clustering of values. For each descriptor, Foresight initially presents
visualizations of the &quot;strongest&quot; instances, based on an appropriate ranking
metric. Given these initial guideposts, the user can then look at &quot;nearby&quot;
guideposts by issuing &quot;guidepost queries&quot; containing constraints on metric
type, metric strength, data attributes, and data values. Thus, the user can
directly explore the network of guideposts, rather than the overwhelming space
of data attributes and visual encodings. Foresight also provides for each
descriptor a global visualization of ranking-metric values to both help orient
the user and ensure a thorough exploration process. Foresight facilitates
interactive exploration of large datasets using fast, approximate sketching to
compute ranking metrics. We also contribute insights on EDA practices of data
scientists, summarizing results from an interview study we conducted to inform
the design of Foresight.

 <dc:description>  Photometric stereo is a method for estimating the normal vectors of an object
from images of the object under varying lighting conditions. Motivated by
several recent works that extend photometric stereo to more general objects and
lighting conditions, we study a new robust approach to photometric stereo that
utilizes dictionary learning. Specifically, we propose and analyze two
approaches to adaptive dictionary regularization for the photometric stereo
problem. First, we propose an image preprocessing step that utilizes an
adaptive dictionary learning model to remove noise and other non-idealities
from the image dataset before estimating the normal vectors. We also propose an
alternative model where we directly apply the adaptive dictionary
regularization to the normal vectors themselves during estimation. We study the
practical performance of both methods through extensive simulations, which
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of both methods in the presence of
noise.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that can tremendously
revolutionize health care thus benefiting both hospitals, doctors and patients.
In this context, protecting the IoT in health care against interference,
including service attacks and malwares, is challenging. Opacity is a
confidentiality property capturing a system's ability to keep a subset of its
behavior hidden from passive observers. In this work, we seek to introduce an
IoT-based heart attack detection system, that could be life-saving for patients
without risking their need for privacy through the verification and enforcement
of opacity. Our main contributions are the use of a tool to verify opacity in
three of its forms, so as to detect privacy leaks in our system. Furthermore,
we develop an efficient, Symbolic Observation Graph (SOG)-based algorithm for
enforcing opacity.

 <dc:description>  We study the task of unsupervised domain adaptation, where no labeled data
from the target domain is provided during training time. To deal with the
potential discrepancy between the source and target distributions, both in
features and labels, we exploit a copula-based regression framework. The
benefits of this approach are two-fold: (a) it allows us to model a broader
range of conditional predictive densities beyond the common exponential family,
(b) we show how to leverage Sklar's theorem, the essence of the copula
formulation relating the joint density to the copula dependency functions, to
find effective feature mappings that mitigate the domain mismatch. By
transforming the data to a copula domain, we show on a number of benchmark
datasets (including human emotion estimation), and using different regression
models for prediction, that we can achieve a more robust and accurate
estimation of target labels, compared to recently proposed feature
transformation (adaptation) methods.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we attempt to learn a neural network policy for dynamic,
underactuated locomotion tasks. Learning a policy for such a task is non
trivial due to the dynamic, fast changing, non linear and contact rich dynamics
of this task. We use existing trajectory optimization techniques to optimize a
set of policies. For this, we present a method that allows to learn contact
rich dynamics for underactuated systems in a sample efficient manner. Using a
new kind of neural network architecture, we are able to preserve more control
structure and information from the optimized policies. This way, the network
output is more interpretable. We analyze the quality of the learned dynamics
and the robustness as well as generalization of the learned network policy on a
set of tasks for a simulated hopping task. We also inspect if the network has
learned reasonable control structures from the optimized policies.

more effort to building data integration (DI) systems, in order to truly
advance the field. Toward this goal, we make three contributions. First, we
draw on our recent industrial experience to discuss the limitations of current
DI systems. Second, we propose an agenda to build a new kind of DI systems to
address these limitations. These systems guide users through the DI workflow,
step by step. They provide tools to address the &quot;pain points&quot; of the steps, and
tools are built on top of the Python data science and Big Data ecosystem
(PyData). We discuss how to foster an ecosystem of such tools within PyData,
then use it to build DI systems for collaborative/cloud/crowd/lay user
settings. Finally, we discuss ongoing work at Wisconsin, which suggests that
these DI systems are highly promising and building them raises many interesting
research challenges.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we present a method to learn the interaction topology of a
network of agents undergoing linear consensus updates in a non invasive manner.
Our approach is based on multivariate Wiener filtering, which is known to
recover spurious edges apart from the true edges in the topology. The main
contribution of this work is to show that in the case of undirected consensus
networks, all spurious links obtained using Wiener filtering can be identified
using frequency response of the Wiener filters. Thus, the exact interaction
topology of the agents is unveiled. The method presented requires time series
measurements of the state of the agents and does not require any knowledge of
link weights. To the best of our knowledge this is the first approach that
provably reconstructs the structure of undirected consensus networks with
correlated noise. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method developed
through numerical simulations as well as experiments on a five node network of
Raspberry Pis.

 <dc:title>Gradient Flows in Filtering and Fisher-Rao Geometry</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Uncertainty propagation and filtering can be interpreted as gradient flows
with respect to suitable metrics in the infinite dimensional manifold of
probability density functions. Such a viewpoint has been put forth in recent
literature, and a systematic way to formulate and solve the same for linear
Gaussian systems has appeared in our previous work where the gradient flows
were realized via proximal operators with respect to Wasserstein metric arising
in optimal mass transport. In this paper, we derive the evolution equations as
proximal operators with respect to Fisher-Rao metric arising in information
geometry. We develop the linear Gaussian case in detail and show that a
template two step optimization procedure proposed earlier by the authors still
applies. Our objective is to provide new geometric interpretations of known
equations in filtering, and to clarify the implication of different choices of
metric.

 <dc:description>  The exponential growth in smartphone adoption is contributing to the
availability of vast amounts of human behavioral data. This data enables the
development of increasingly accurate data-driven user models that facilitate
the delivery of personalized services which are often free in exchange for the
use of its customers' data. Although such usage conventions have raised many
privacy concerns, the increasing value of personal data is motivating diverse
entities to aggressively collect and exploit the data. In this paper, we unfold
profiling scenarios around mobile HTTP(S) traffic, focusing on those that have
limited but meaningful segments of the data. The capability of the scenarios to
profile personal information is examined with real user data, collected
in-the-wild from 61 mobile phone users for a minimum of 30 days. Our study
attempts to model heterogeneous user traits and interests, including
personality, boredom proneness, demographics, and shopping interests. Based on
our modeling results, we discuss various implications to personalization,
privacy, and personal data rights.

 <dc:description>  Traditional resource management systems rely on a centralized approach to
manage users running on each resource. The centralized resource management
system is not scalable for large-scale servers as the number of users running
on shared resources is increasing dramatically and the centralized manager may
not have enough information about applications' need. In this paper we propose
a distributed game-theoretic resource management approach using market auction
mechanism to find optimal strategy in a resource competition game. The
applications learn through repeated interactions to choose their action on
choosing the shared resources. Specifically, we look into two case studies of
cache competition game and main processor and co-processor congestion game. We
enforce costs for each resource and derive bidding strategy. Accurate
evaluation of the proposed approach show that our distributed allocation is
scalable and outperforms the static and traditional approaches.

 <dc:title>A Gaussian mixture model representation of endmember variability in
  hyperspectral unmixing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhou, Yuan</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Hyperspectral unmixing while considering endmember variability is usually
performed by the normal compositional model (NCM), where the endmembers for
each pixel are assumed to be sampled from unimodal Gaussian distributions.
However, in real applications, the distribution of a material is often not
Gaussian. In this paper, we use Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to represent the
endmember variability. We show, given the GMM starting premise, that the
distribution of the mixed pixel (under the linear mixing model) is also a GMM
(and this is shown from two perspectives). The first perspective originates
from the random variable transformation and gives a conditional density
function of the pixels given the abundances and GMM parameters. With proper
smoothness and sparsity prior constraints on the abundances, the conditional
density function leads to a standard maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem which
can be solved using generalized expectation maximization. The second
perspective originates from marginalizing over the endmembers in the GMM, which
provides us with a foundation to solve for the endmembers at each pixel. Hence,
our model can not only estimate the abundances and distribution parameters, but
also the distinct endmember set for each pixel. We tested the proposed GMM on
several synthetic and real datasets, and showed its potential by comparing it
to current popular methods.

 <dc:description>  Pattern matching is a powerful tool for symbolic computations. Applications
include term rewriting systems, as well as the manipulation of symbolic
expressions, abstract syntax trees, and XML and JSON data. It also allows for
an intuitive description of algorithms in the form of rewrite rules. We present
the open source Python module MatchPy, which offers functionality and
expressiveness similar to the pattern matching in Mathematica. In particular,
it includes syntactic pattern matching, as well as matching for commutative
and/or associative functions, sequence variables, and matching with
constraints. MatchPy uses new and improved algorithms to efficiently find
matches for large pattern sets by exploiting similarities between patterns. The
performance of MatchPy is investigated on several real-world problems.

 <dc:title>Complex Correntropy Function: properties, and application to a channel

 <dc:creator>Guimar&#xe3;es, Jo&#xe3;o</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The use of correntropy as a similarity measure has been increasing in
different scenarios due to the well-known ability to extract high-order
statistic information from data. Recently, a new similarity measure between
complex random variables was defined and called complex correntropy. Based on a
Gaussian kernel, it extends the benefits of correntropy to complex-valued data.
However, its properties have not yet been formalized. This paper studies the
properties of this new similarity measure and extends this definition to
positive-definite kernels. Complex correntropy is applied to a channel
equalization problem as good results are achieved when compared with other
algorithms such as the complex least mean square (CLMS), complex recursive
least squares (CRLS), and least absolute deviation (LAD).

 <dc:title>Real-Time Wind Noise Detection and Suppression with Neural-Based Signal

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Active wind noise detection and suppression techniques are a new and
essential paradigm for enhancing ASR-based functionality with smart glasses, in
addition to other wearable and smart devices in the broader IoT (Internet of
things). In this paper, we develop two separate algorithms for wind noise
detection and suppression, respectively, operational in a challenging,
low-energy regime. Together, these algorithms comprise a robust wind noise
suppression system. In the first case, we advance a real-time wind detection
algorithm (RTWD) that uses two distinct sets of low-dimensional signal features
to discriminate the presence of wind noise with high accuracy. For wind noise
suppression, we employ an additional algorithm - attentive neural wind
suppression (ANWS) - that utilizes a neural network to reconstruct the wearer
speech signal from wind-corrupted audio in the spectral regions that are most
adversely affected by wind noise. Finally, we test our algorithms through
real-time experiments using low-power, multi-microphone devices with a wind
simulator under challenging detection criteria and a variety of wind
intensities.

 <dc:description>  DC loads (such as computers, data centres, electric vehicle chargers, and LED
lamps) and dc distributed energy resources (such as fuel cells, solar
photovoltaics, and energy storages) are rapidly growing in electric power
systems, so dc systems are being introduced as emerging practical investment
solutions compared to traditional ac options. DC microgrids offer several
advantages such as the elimination of need for synchronizing generators and
easier supply of dc loads. Hybrid microgrids can benefit from the advantages of
both ac and dc microgrid types. Moreover, there would be a huge reduction in
the number of required power converters which would enhance the microgrid
efficiency and reduce investment and operation costs. This paper introduces
hybrid ac/dc microgrid as a viable solution compared to individual ac or dc
microgrids and focuses on its planning. The objective of the hybrid microgrid
planning is to minimize the microgrid total cost, including investment cost of
distributed energy resources (DERs) and converters, operation cost of DERs, the
cost of energy exchange with the utility grid, and the cost of unserved energy
during the planning horizon. The economic viability of the microgrid planning
is investigated in this paper and it is shown how the optimal DER generation
mix, the type of feeders, as well as the point of connection of DERs to feeders
can be determined by updating the traditional ac microgrid planning model.
Numerical simulations on a test microgrid exhibit the merits of the proposed
model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we revisit the recently established theoretical guarantees for
the convergence of the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm of sampling from a smooth
and (strongly) log-concave density. We improve, in terms of constants, the
existing results when the accuracy of sampling is measured in the Wasserstein
distance and provide further insights on relations between, on the one hand,
the Langevin Monte Carlo for sampling and, on the other hand, the gradient
descent for optimization. More importantly, we establish non-asymptotic
guarantees for the accuracy of a version of the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm
that is based on inaccurate evaluations of the gradient. Finally, we propose a
variable-step version of the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm that has two
advantages. First, its step-sizes are independent of the target accuracy and,
second, its rate provides a logarithmic improvement over the constant-step
Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Historically, high energy physics computing has been performed on large
purpose-built computing systems. These began as single-site compute facilities,
but have evolved into the distributed computing grids used today. Recently,
there has been an exponential increase in the capacity and capability of
commercial clouds. Cloud resources are highly virtualized and intended to be
able to be flexibly deployed for a variety of computing tasks. There is a
growing nterest among the cloud providers to demonstrate the capability to
perform large-scale scientific computing. In this paper, we discuss results
from the CMS experiment using the Fermilab HEPCloud facility, which utilized
both local Fermilab resources and virtual machines in the Amazon Web Services
Elastic Compute Cloud. We discuss the planning, technical challenges, and
lessons learned involved in performing physics workflows on a large-scale set
of virtualized resources. In addition, we will discuss the economics and
operational efficiencies when executing workflows both in the cloud and on
dedicated resources.

 <dc:description>  Traffic analysis is a type of attack on secure communications systems, in
which the adversary extracts useful patterns and information from the observed
traffic. This paper improves and extends an efficient traffic analysis attack,
called &quot;statistical disclosure attack.&quot; Moreover, we propose a solution to
defend against the improved (and, a fortiori, the original) statistical
disclosure attack. Our solution delays the attacker considerably, meaning that
he should gather significantly more observations to be able to deduce
meaningful information from the traffic.

 <dc:title>Small Satellite Constellation Separation using Linear Programming based
  Differential Drag Commands</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the optimal control of an arbitrarily large constellation of small
satellites operating in low Earth orbit. Simulating the lack of on-board
propulsion, we limit our actuation to the use of differential drag maneuvers to
make in-plane changes to the satellite orbits. We propose an efficient method
to separate a cluster of satellites into a desired constellation shape while
respecting actuation constraints and maximizing the operational lifetime of the
constellation. By posing the problem as a linear program, we solve for the
optimal drag commands for each of the satellites on a daily basis with a
shrinking-horizon model predictive control approach. We then apply this control
strategy in a nonlinear orbital dynamics simulation with a simple, varying
atmospheric density model. We demonstrate the ability to control a cluster of
100+ satellites starting at the same initial conditions in a circular low Earth
orbit to form an equally spaced constellation (with a relative angular
separation error tolerance of one-tenth a degree). The constellation separation
task can be executed in 71 days, a time frame that is competitive for the
state-of-the-practice. This method allows us to trade the time required to
converge to the desired constellation with a sacrifice in the overall
constellation lifetime, measured as the maximum altitude loss experienced by
one of the satellites in the group after the separation maneuvers.

 <dc:title>Intelligent Cross-layer and Reliable Opportunistic Routing Algorithm for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For improving the efficiency and the reliability of the opportunistic routing
algorithm, in this paper, we propose the cross-layer and reliable opportunistic
routing algorithm (CBRT) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, which introduces the
improved efficiency fuzzy logic and humoral regulation inspired topology
control into the opportunistic routing algorithm. In CBRT, the inputs of the
fuzzy logic system are the relative variance (rv) of the metrics rather than
the values of the metrics, which reduces the number of fuzzy rules
dramatically. Moreover, the number of fuzzy rules does not increase when the
number of inputs increases. For reducing the control cost, in CBRT, the node
degree in the candidate relays set is a range rather than a constant number.
The nodes are divided into different categories based on their node degree in
the candidate relays set. The nodes adjust their transmission range based on
which categories that they belong to. Additionally, for investigating the
effection of the node mobility on routing performance, we propose a link
lifetime prediction algorithm which takes both the moving speed and moving
direction into account. In CBRT, the source node determines the relaying
priorities of the relaying nodes based on their utilities. The relaying node
which the utility is large will have high priority to relay the data packet. By
these innovations, the network performance in CBRT is much better than that in
ExOR; however, the computation complexity is not increased in CBRT.

them to dictate the access to their collections of data. Revisiting the
fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses
capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal
notions for reasoning about access. This contribution presents a practical,
correct, auditable, transparent, distributed, and decentralized mechanism that
is well-matched to the current emerging environments including Internet of
Things, smart city, precision medicine, and autonomous cars. It is based on
well-tested principles and practices used in a distributed authorization,

 <dc:description>  This study presents systems submitted by the University of Texas at Dallas,
Center for Robust Speech Systems (UTD-CRSS) to the MGB-3 Arabic Dialect
Identification (ADI) subtask. This task is defined to discriminate between five
dialects of Arabic, including Egyptian, Gulf, Levantine, North African, and
Modern Standard Arabic. We develop multiple single systems with different
front-end representations and back-end classifiers. At the front-end level,
feature extraction methods such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
and two types of bottleneck features (BNF) are studied for an i-Vector
framework. As for the back-end level, Gaussian back-end (GB), and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) classifiers are applied alternately. The best
submission (contrastive) is achieved for the ADI subtask with an accuracy of
76.94% by augmenting the randomly chosen part of the development dataset.
Further, with a post evaluation correction in the submitted system, final
accuracy is increased to 79.76%, which represents the best performance achieved
so far for the challenge on the test dataset.

 <dc:description>  The increased network flexibility introduced by new technologies, such as
Software-Defined Networking, let operators consider running their networks at
higher utilization levels. Traditionally, networks were operated at a small
fraction of their capacities (30-40%); recently, however, operators are
considering running their networks harder (60% utilization and above). Higher
utilization can increase the network operator's revenue, but this gain comes at
a cost: daily traffic fluctuations and failures might overload the network. We
call such network congestion situations Resource Crunch. Dealing with Resource
Crunch requires certain types of flexibility in the system. We focus on
settings with flexible bandwidth requirements, e.g., allocated connections can
tolerate service degradation. This can allow a new connection to be provisioned
- a connection that would otherwise be blocked. In these situations, the
network operator needs to make an informed decision, since degrading a
high-paying connection to allocate a low-value connection is not sensible. We
offer strategies for deciding whether or not to serve a connection (and which
other connections to degrade) focusing on maximizing profits during Resource
Crunch. Our solutions use a new abstraction of the network state, called a
Connection Adjacency Graph (CAG), to devise an efficient methods to decide
whether or not to serve a demand, and which other connections to degrade. The
concept of CAG is further elaborated, and we investigate an optional optional
simplification step capable of reducing the problem's complexity. Finally, we
compare our method to existing greedy approaches and show that our method
outperforms them during Resource Crunch.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the application of the probabilistic linear
discriminant analysis (PLDA) to speaker diarization of telephone conversations.
We introduce using a variational Bayes (VB) approach for inference under a PLDA
model for modeling segmental i-vectors in speaker diarization. Deterministic
annealing (DA) algorithm is imposed in order to avoid local optimal solutions
in VB iterations. We compare our proposed system with a well-known system that
applies k-means clustering on principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients
of segmental i-vectors. We used summed channel telephone data from the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 2008 Speaker Recognition
Evaluation (SRE) as the test set in order to evaluate the performance of the
proposed system. We achieve about 20% relative improvement in Diarization Error
Rate (DER) compared to the baseline system.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, multiprocessing is mainstream with exponentially increasing number
of processors. Load balancing is, therefore, a critical operation for the
efficient execution of parallel algorithms. In this paper we consider the
fundamental class of tree-based algorithms that are notoriously irregular, and
hard to load-balance with existing static techniques. We propose a hybrid load
balancing method using the utility of statistical random sampling in estimating
the tree depth and node count distributions to uniformly partition an input
tree. To conduct an initial performance study, we implemented the method on an
Intel Xeon Phi accelerator system. We considered the tree traversal operation
on both regular and irregular unbalanced trees manifested by Fibonacci and
unbalanced (biased) randomly generated trees, respectively. The results show
scalable performance for up to the 60 physical processors of the accelerator,
as well as an extrapolated 128 processors case.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel 3DOF pedestrian trajectory prediction approach
for autonomous mobile service robots. While most previously reported methods
are based on learning of 2D positions in monocular camera images, our approach
uses range-finder sensors to learn and predict 3DOF pose trajectories (i.e. 2D
position plus 1D rotation within the world coordinate system). Our approach,
T-Pose-LSTM (Temporal 3DOF-Pose Long-Short-Term Memory), is trained using
long-term data from real-world robot deployments and aims to learn
context-dependent (environment- and time-specific) human activities. Our
approach incorporates long-term temporal information (i.e. date and time) with
short-term pose observations as input. A sequence-to-sequence LSTM
encoder-decoder is trained, which encodes observations into LSTM and then
decodes as predictions. For deployment, it can perform on-the-fly prediction in
real-time. Instead of using manually annotated data, we rely on a robust human
detection, tracking and SLAM system, providing us with examples in a global
coordinate system. We validate the approach using more than 15K pedestrian
trajectories recorded in a care home environment over a period of three months.
The experiment shows that the proposed T-Pose-LSTM model advances the
state-of-the-art 2D-based method for human trajectory prediction in long-term
mobile robot deployments.

 <dc:description>  For intelligent robotics applications, extending 3D mapping to 3D semantic
mapping enables robots to, not only localize themselves with respect to the
scene's geometrical features but also simultaneously understand the higher
level meaning of the scene contexts. Most previous methods focus on geometric
3D reconstruction and scene understanding independently notwithstanding the
fact that joint estimation can boost the accuracy of the semantic mapping. In
this paper, a dense RGB-D semantic mapping system with a Pixel-Voxel network is
proposed, which can perform dense 3D mapping while simultaneously recognizing
and semantically labelling each point in the 3D map. The proposed Pixel-Voxel
network obtains global context information by using PixelNet to exploit the RGB
image and meanwhile, preserves accurate local shape information by using
VoxelNet to exploit the corresponding 3D point cloud. Unlike the existing
architecture that fuses score maps from different models with equal weights, we
proposed a Softmax weighted fusion stack that adaptively learns the varying
contributions of PixelNet and VoxelNet, and fuses the score maps of the two
models according to their respective confidence levels. The proposed
Pixel-Voxel network achieves the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
performance on the SUN RGB-D benchmark dataset. The runtime of the proposed
system can be boosted to 11-12Hz, enabling near to real-time performance using
an i7 8-cores PC with Titan X GPU.

 <dc:description>  We study a multi-period demand response management problem in the smart grid
with multiple companies and their consumers. We model the interactions by a
Stackelberg game, where companies are the leaders and consumers are the
followers. It is shown that this game has a unique equilibrium at which the
companies set prices to maximize their revenues while the consumers respond
accordingly to maximize their utilities subject to their local constraints.
Closed-form expressions are provided for the corresponding strategies of all
players. Based on these closed-form solutions, a power allocation game has been
formulated, and which is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash
equilibrium, for which closed-form expressions are provided. For privacy, we
provide a distributed algorithm for the computation of all optimal strategies.
We study the asymptotic behavior of equilibrium strategies when the numbers of
periods and consumers grow. We find an appropriate company-to-user ratio for
the large population regime. Furthermore, it is shown, both analytically and
numerically, that the multi-period scheme, compared with the single-period one,
provides more incentives for energy consumers to participate in demand
response. We conduct a case study on real life data from the EcoGrid EU
experiment to demonstrate the performance of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Future fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks, equipped with energy
harvesting devices, are uniquely positioned to closely interoperate with smart
grid. New interoperable functionalities are discussed in stochastic two-way
energy trading and online planning to improve efficiency and productivity.
Challenges lie in the unavailability of a-priori knowledge on future wireless
channels, energy pricing and harvesting. Lyapunov optimization techniques are
utilized to address the challenges and stochastically optimize energy trading
and planning. Particularly, it is able to decouple the optimization of energy
trading and planning during individual time slots, hence eliminating the need
for joint optimization across a large number of slots.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an ultra-wideband (UWB) aided localization and mapping
system that leverages on inertial sensor and depth camera. Inspired by the fact
that visual odometry (VO) system, regardless of its accuracy in the short term,
still faces challenges with accumulated errors in the long run or under
unfavourable environments, the UWB ranging measurements are fused to remove the
visual drift and improve the robustness. A general framework is developed which
consists of three parallel threads, two of which carry out the visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and UWB localization respectively. The other mapping thread
integrates visual tracking constraints into a pose graph with the proposed
smooth and virtual range constraints, such that an optimization is performed to
provide robust trajectory estimation. Experiments show that the proposed system
is able to create dense drift-free maps in real-time even running on an
ultra-low power processor in featureless environments.

 <dc:description>  Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising medical imaging modality providing
the spatial resolution of ultrasound (US) imaging and the contrast of pure
optical imaging. For linear-array PAI, a beamformer has to be used as the
reconstruction algorithm. Delay-and-sum (DAS) is the most prevalent beamforming
algorithm in PAI. However, using DAS beamformer leads to low resolution images
along with significant effects of the off-axis signals. Coherence factor (CF)
is a weighting method in which each pixel of the reconstructed image is
weighted, based on the spatial spectrum of the aperture, to improve the
contrast. In this paper, it has been shown that the numerator of the formula of
CF contains a DAS algebra, and it was proposed to use the
delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS) beamformer instead of the available DAS on the
numerator. The proposed weighting technique, modified CF (MCF), has been
evaluated numerically and experimentally compared to CF, and it was shown that
MCF leads to lower sidelobes and better detectable targets. The quantitative
results of the experiment show that MCF leads to for about 45% and 40%
improvement, in comparison with CF, in the terms of signal-to-noise ratio and
full-width-half-maximum, respectively.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes how to adapt a static code analyzer to help novice
programmers. Current analyzers have been built to give feedback to experienced
programmers who build new applications or systems. The type of feedback and the
type of analysis of these tools focusses on mistakes that are relevant within
that context, and help with debugging the system. When teaching novice
programmers this type of advice is often not particularly useful. It would be
instead more useful to use these techniques to find problem in the
understanding of students of important programming concepts. This paper first
explores in what respect static analyzers support the learning and teaching of
programming can be implemented based on existing static analysis technology. It
presents an extension to static analyzer PMD was made so that feedback messages
appear which are easier to understand for novice programmers. To answer the
question if these techniques are able to find conceptual mistakes that are
characteristic for novice programmers make, we ran it over a number of student
projects, and compared these results with publicly available mature software
projects.

 <dc:description>  Language understanding (LU) and dialogue policy learning are two essential
components in conversational systems. Human-human dialogues are not
well-controlled and often random and unpredictable due to their own goals and
speaking habits. This paper proposes a role-based contextual model to consider
different speaker roles independently based on the various speaking patterns in
the multi-turn dialogues. The experiments on the benchmark dataset show that
the proposed role-based model successfully learns role-specific behavioral
patterns for contextual encoding and then significantly improves language
understanding and dialogue policy learning tasks.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Spoken language understanding (SLU) is an essential component in
conversational systems. Most SLU component treats each utterance independently,
and then the following components aggregate the multi-turn information in the
separate phases. In order to avoid error propagation and effectively utilize
contexts, prior work leveraged history for contextual SLU. However, the
previous model only paid attention to the content in history utterances without
considering their temporal information and speaker roles. In the dialogues, the
most recent utterances should be more important than the least recent ones.
Furthermore, users usually pay attention to 1) self history for reasoning and
2) others' utterances for listening, the speaker of the utterances may provides
informative cues to help understanding. Therefore, this paper proposes an
attention-based network that additionally leverages temporal information and
speaker role for better SLU, where the attention to contexts and speaker roles
can be automatically learned in an end-to-end manner. The experiments on the
benchmark Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 4 (DSTC4) dataset show that the
time-aware dynamic role attention networks significantly improve the
understanding performance.

 <dc:description>  PCANet, as one noticeable shallow network, employs the histogram
representation for feature pooling. However, there are three main problems
about this kind of pooling method. First, the histogram-based pooling method
binarizes the feature maps and leads to inevitable discriminative information
loss. Second, it is difficult to effectively combine other visual cues into a
compact representation, because the simple concatenation of various visual cues
leads to feature representation inefficiency. Third, the dimensionality of
histogram-based output grows exponentially with the number of feature maps
used. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a novel shallow network
model, named as PCANet-II. Compared with the histogram-based output, the second
order pooling not only provides more discriminative information by preserving
both the magnitude and sign of convolutional responses, but also dramatically
reduces the size of output features. Thus we combine the second order
statistical pooling method with the shallow network, i.e., PCANet. Moreover, it
is easy to combine other discriminative and robust cues by using the second
order pooling. So we introduce the binary feature difference encoding scheme
into our PCANet-II to further improve robustness. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our proposed PCANet-II method.

 <dc:description>  Even if only the acoustic channel is considered, human communication is
highly multi-modal. Non-lexical cues provide a variety of information such as
emotion or agreement. The ability to process such cues is highly relevant for
spoken dialog systems, especially in assistance systems. In this paper we focus
on the recognition of non-lexical confirmations such as &quot;mhm&quot;, as they enhance
the system's ability to accurately interpret human intent in natural
communication. The architecture uses a Support Vector Machine to detect
confirmations based on acoustic features. In a systematic comparison, several
feature sets were evaluated for their performance on a corpus of human-agent
interaction in a setting with naive users including elderly and cognitively
impaired people. Our results show that using stacked formants as features yield
an accuracy of 84% outperforming regular formants and MFCC or pitch based
features for online classification.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on a typical cooperative communication system with
one pair of source and destination, where a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
flying from a start location to an end location serves as a mobile relay. To
efficiently utilize energy in ambient environment, the UAV's transmission
capability is powered exclusively by radio signal transmitted from the source
via the power-splitting mechanism. In such a cooperative communication system,
we study the end-to-end cooperative throughput maximization problem by
optimizing the UAV's power profile, power-splitting ratio profile and
trajectory for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
protocols. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems: profile optimization
given trajectory and trajectory optimization given profile. The former one is
solved via the dual decomposition with in-depth analysis and the latter one is
solved via successive convex optimization, by which a lower bound is
iteratively maximized. Then the end-to-end cooperative throughput maximization
problem is solved by alternately solving the two subproblems. The numerical
results show that with the proposed optimal solution, choice for the UAV's
power profile and power-splitting ratio profile is more long-sighted than the
greedy strategy from our previous work and the successive optimization is able
to converge in a few rounds of iteration. Moreover, as for the end-to-end
cooperative throughput, the proposed optimal solution outperforms both static
and greedy strategies, especially for the AF protocol.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary many-objective optimization has been gaining increasing
attention from the evolutionary computation research community. Much effort has
been devoted to addressing this issue by improving the scalability of
multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, such as Pareto-based,
decomposition-based, and indicator-based approaches. Different from current
work, we propose a novel algorithm in this paper called AnD, which consists of
an angle-based selection strategy and a shift-based density estimation
strategy. These two strategies are employed in the environmental selection to
delete the poor individuals one by one. Specifically, the former is devised to
find a pair of individuals with the minimum vector angle, which means that
these two individuals share the most similar search direction. The latter,
which takes both the diversity and convergence into account, is adopted to
compare these two individuals and to delete the worse one. AnD has a simple
structure, few parameters, and no complicated operators. The performance of AnD
is compared with that of seven state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary
algorithms on a variety of benchmark test problems with up to 15 objectives.
The experimental results suggest that AnD can achieve highly competitive
performance. In addition, we also verify that AnD can be readily extended to
solve constrained many-objective optimization problems.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we analyze the performance of full-duplex relay selection
(FDRS) in spectrum-sharing networks. Contrary to half-duplex relaying,
full-duplex relaying (FDR) enables simultaneous listening/forwarding at the
secondary relay(s), thereby allowing for a higher spectral efficiency. However,
since the source and relay simultaneously transmit in FDR, their superimposed
signal at the primary receiver should now satisfy the existing interference
constraint, which can considerably limit the secondary network throughput. In
this regard, relay selection can offer an adequate solution to boost the
secondary throughput while satisfying the imposed interference limit. We first
analyze the performance of opportunistic FDRS with residual self-interference
(RSI) by deriving the exact cumulative distribution function of its end-to-end
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio under Nakagami-m fading. We also
evaluate the offered diversity gain of relay selection for different
full-duplex cooperation schemes in the presence/absence of a direct
source-destination link. When the adopted RSI link gain model is sublinear in
the relay power, which agrees with recent research findings, we show that
remarkable diversity gain can be recovered even in the presence of an
interfering direct link. Second, we evaluate the end-to-end performance of FDRS
with interference constraints due to the presence of a primary receiver.
Finally, the presented exact theoretical findings are verified by numerical
simulations.

which is the key concept behind solutions to the adaptive leakage-exploiting
attacks, and will very likely to become mandatory in the design of new
searchable encryption schemes. For a long time, forward privacy implies
inefficiency and thus most existing searchable encryption schemes do not
support it. Very recently, Bost (CCS 2016) showed that forward privacy can be
obtained without inducing a large communication overhead. However, Bost's
scheme is constructed with a relatively inefficient public key cryptographic
primitive, and has a poor I/O performance. Both of the deficiencies
significantly hinder the practical efficiency of the scheme, and prevent it
from scaling to large data settings. To address the problems, we first present
FAST, which achieves forward privacy and the same communication efficiency as
Bost's scheme, but uses only symmetric cryptographic primitives. We then
present FASTIO, which retains all good properties of FAST, and further improves
I/O efficiency. We implemented the two schemes and compared their performance
with Bost's scheme. The experiment results show that both our schemes are
highly efficient, and FASTIO achieves a much better scalability due to its
optimized I/O.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised segmentation of action segments in egocentric videos is a
desirable feature in tasks such as activity recognition and content-based video
retrieval. Reducing the search space into a finite set of action segments
facilitates a faster and less noisy matching. However, there exist a
substantial gap in machine understanding of natural temporal cuts during a
continuous human activity. This work reports on a novel gaze-based approach for
segmenting action segments in videos captured using an egocentric camera. Gaze
is used to locate the region-of-interest inside a frame. By tracking two simple
motion-based parameters inside successive regions-of-interest, we discover a
finite set of temporal cuts. We present several results using combinations (of
the two parameters) on a dataset, i.e., BRISGAZE-ACTIONS. The dataset contains
egocentric videos depicting several daily-living activities. The quality of the
temporal cuts is further improved by implementing two entropy measures.

 <dc:description>  Classification of rocks is one of the fundamental tasks in a geological
study. The process requires a human expert to examine sampled thin section
images under a microscope. In this study, we propose a method that uses
microscope automation, digital image acquisition, edge detection and colour
analysis (histogram). We collected 60 digital images from 20 standard thin
sections using a digital camera mounted on a conventional microscope. Each
image is partitioned into a finite number of cells that form a grid structure.
Edge and colour profile of pixels inside each cell determine its
classification. The individual cells then determine the thin section image
classification via a majority voting scheme. Our method yielded successful
results as high as 90% to 100% precision.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a new algorithm for solar energy forecasting from a
sequence of Cloud Optical Depth (COD) images. The algorithm is based on the
following simple observation: the dynamics of clouds represented by COD images
resembles the motion (transport) of a density in a fluid flow. This suggests
that, to forecast the motion of COD images, it is sufficient to forecast the
flow. The latter, in turn, can be accomplished by fitting a parametric model of
the fluid flow to the COD images observed in the past. Namely, the learning
phase of the algorithm is composed of the following steps: (i) given a sequence
of COD images, the snapshots of the optical flow are estimated from two
consecutive COD images; (ii) these snapshots are then assimilated into a
Navier-Stokes Equation (NSE), i.e. an initial velocity field for NSE is
selected so that the corresponding NSE' solution is as close as possible to the
optical flow snapshots. The prediction phase consists of utilizing a linear
transport equation, which describes the propagation of COD images in the fluid
flow predicted by NSE, to estimate the future motion of the COD images. The
algorithm has been tested on COD images provided by two geostationary
operational environmental satellites from NOAA serving the west-hemisphere.

 <dc:description>  LCD codes are linear codes with important cryptographic applications.
Recently, a method has been presented to transform any linear code into an LCD
code with the same parameters when it is supported on a finite field with
cardinality larger than 3. Hence, the study of LCD codes is mainly open for
binary and ternary fields. Subfield-subcodes of $J$-affine variety codes are a
generalization of BCH codes which have been successfully used for constructing
good quantum codes. We describe binary and ternary LCD codes constructed as
subfield-subcodes of $J$-affine variety codes and provide some new and good LCD
codes coming from this construction.

 <dc:description>  Many popular applications use traces of user data to offer various services
to their users, example applications include driver-assistance systems and
smart home services. However, revealing user information to such applications
puts users' privacy at stake, as adversaries can infer sensitive private
information about the users such as their behaviors, interests, and locations.
Recent research shows that adversaries can compromise users' privacy when they
use such applications even when the traces of users' information are protected
by mechanisms like anonymization and obfuscation. In this work, we derive the
theoretical bounds on the privacy of users of these applications when standard
protection mechanisms are deployed. We build on our recent study in the area of
location privacy, in which we introduced formal notions of location privacy for
anonymization-based location privacy-protection mechanisms. More specifically,
we derive the fundamental limits of user privacy when both anonymization and
obfuscation-based protection mechanisms are applied to users' time series of
data. We investigate the impact of such mechanisms on the tradeoff between
privacy protection and user utility. In particular, we study achievability
results for the case where the time-series of users are governed by an i.i.d.
process. The converse results are proved both for the i.i.d. case as well as
the more general Markov Chain model. We demonstrate that as the number of users
in the network grows, the obfuscation-anonymization plane can be divided into
two regions: in the first region, all users have perfect privacy, and, in the
second region, no user has privacy.

 <dc:title>Diagramming the Class Diagram: Toward a Unified Modeling Methodology</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Al-Fedaghi, Sabah</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The object-oriented class is, in general, the most utilized element in
programming and modeling. It is employed throughout the software development
process, from early domain analysis phases to later maintenance phases. A class
diagram typically uses elements of graph theory, e.g., boxes, ovals, lines.
Many researchers have examined the class diagram layout from different
perspectives, including visibility, juxtaposability, and aesthetics. While
software systems can be incredibly complex, class diagrams represent a very
broad picture of the system as a whole. The key to understanding of such
complexity is use of tools such as diagrams at various levels of
representation. This paper develops a more elaborate diagrammatic description
of the class diagram that includes flows of attributes, thus providing a basic
representation for specifying behavior and control instead of merely listing
methods.

 <dc:description>  Even though many machine algorithms have been proposed for entity resolution,
it remains very challenging to find a solution with quality guarantees. In this
paper, we propose a novel HUman and Machine cOoperative (HUMO) framework for
entity resolution (ER), which divides an ER workload between machine and human.
HUMO enables a mechanism for quality control that can flexibly enforce both
precision and recall levels. We introduce the optimization problem of HUMO,
minimizing human cost given a quality requirement, and then present three
optimization approaches: a conservative baseline one purely based on the
monotonicity assumption of precision, a more aggressive one based on sampling
and a hybrid one that can take advantage of the strengths of both previous
approaches. Finally, we demonstrate by extensive experiments on real and
synthetic datasets that HUMO can achieve high-quality results with reasonable
return on investment (ROI) in terms of human cost, and it performs considerably
better than the state-of-the-art alternative in quality control.

 <dc:description>  Vector-space models, from word embeddings to neural network parsers, have
many advantages for NLP. But how to generalise from fixed-length word vectors
to a vector space for arbitrary linguistic structures is still unclear. In this
paper we propose bag-of-vector embeddings of arbitrary linguistic graphs. A
bag-of-vector space is the minimal nonparametric extension of a vector space,
allowing the representation to grow with the size of the graph, but not tying
the representation to any specific tree or graph structure. We propose
efficient training and inference algorithms based on tensor factorisation for
embedding arbitrary graphs in a bag-of-vector space. We demonstrate the
usefulness of this representation by training bag-of-vector embeddings of
dependency graphs and evaluating them on unsupervised semantic induction for
the Semantic Textual Similarity and Natural Language Inference tasks.

 <dc:description>  Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables a client to perform searches
over its outsourced encrypted files while preserving privacy of the files and
queries. Dynamic schemes, where files can be added or removed, leak more
information than static schemes. For dynamic schemes, forward privacy requires
that a newly added file cannot be linked to previous searches. We present a new
dynamic SSE scheme that achieves forward privacy by replacing the keys revealed
to the server on each search. Our scheme is efficient and parallelizable and
outperforms the best previous schemes providing forward privacy, and achieves
competitive performance with dynamic schemes without forward privacy. We
provide a full security proof in the random oracle model. In our experiments on
the Wikipedia archive of about four million pages, the server takes one second
to perform a search with 100,000 results.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that for some tasks, labeled data sets may be hard to
gather. Therefore, we wished to tackle here the problem of having insufficient
training data. We examined learning methods from unlabeled data after an
initial training on a limited labeled data set. The suggested approach can be
used as an online learning method on the unlabeled test set. In the general
classification task, whenever we predict a label with high enough confidence,
we treat it as a true label and train the data accordingly. For the semantic
segmentation task, a classic example for an expensive data labeling process, we
do so pixel-wise. Our suggested approaches were applied on the MNIST data-set
as a proof of concept for a vision classification task and on the ADE20K
data-set in order to tackle the semi-supervised semantic segmentation problem.

partial differential equations. The Deep Ritz method is naturally nonlinear,
naturally adaptive and has the potential to work in rather high dimensions. The
framework is quite simple and fits well with the stochastic gradient descent
method used in deep learning. We illustrate the method on several problems
including some eigenvalue problems.

 <dc:description>  Wrist-wearables such as smartwatches and fitness bands are equipped with a
variety of high-precision sensors that enable collection of rich contextual
information related to the wearer and his/her surroundings and support a
variety of novel context- and activity-based applications. The presence of such
a diverse set of on-board sensors, however, also expose an additional attack
surface which, if not adequately protected, could be potentially exploited to
leak private user information. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate
the feasibility of a new vulnerability that attempts to take advantage of a
wrist-wearable's seemingly innocuous and poorly regulated motion sensors to
infer a user's input on mechanical devices typically used to secure physical
access, for example, combination locks. In this direction, we outline two
motion-based inference frameworks: i) a deterministic attack framework that
attempts to infer a lock's unlock combination from the wrist motion
(specifically, angular displacement) data obtained from a wrist-wearable's
gyroscope sensor, and ii) a probabilistic attack framework that extends the
output of the deterministic framework to produce a ranked list of likely unlock
combinations. Further, we conduct a thorough empirical evaluation of the
proposed frameworks by employing unlocking-related motion data collected from
human subject participants in a variety of controlled and realistic settings.
Evaluation results from these experiments demonstrate that motion data from
wrist-wearables can be effectively employed as an information side-channel to
significantly reduce the unlock combination search-space of commonly-found
combination locks, thus compromising the physical security provided by these
locks.

 <dc:title>Parameterized Algorithms for Conflict-free Colorings of Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reddy, I. Vinod</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the conflict-free coloring of graphs induced by
neighborhoods. A coloring of a graph is conflict-free if every vertex has a
uniquely colored vertex in its neighborhood. The conflict-free coloring problem
is to color the vertices of a graph using the minimum number of colors such
that the coloring is conflict-free. We consider both closed neighborhoods,
where the neighborhood of a vertex includes itself, and open neighborhoods,
where a vertex does not included in its neighborhood. We study the
parameterized complexity of conflict-free closed neighborhood coloring and
conflict-free open neighborhood coloring problems. We show that both problems
are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the cluster vertex
deletion number of the input graph. This generalizes the result of Gargano et
al.(2015) that conflict-free coloring is fixed-parameter tractable
parameterized by the vertex cover number. Also, we show that both problems
admit an additive constant approximation algorithm when parameterized by the
distance to threshold graphs.
  We also study the complexity of the problem on special graph classes. We show
that both problems can be solved in polynomial time on cographs. For split
graphs, we give a polynomial time algorithm for closed neighborhood
conflict-free coloring problem, whereas we show that open neighborhood
conflict-free coloring is NP-complete. We show that interval graphs can be
conflict-free colored using at most four colors.

 <dc:description>  Motion planning has evolved from coping with simply geometric problems to
physics-based ones that incorporate the kinodynamic and the physical
constraints imposed by the robot and the physical world. Therefore, the
criteria for evaluating physics-based motion planners goes beyond the
computational complexity (e.g. in terms of planning time) usually used as a
measure for evaluating geometrical planners, in order to consider also the
quality of the solution in terms of dynamical parameters. This study proposes
an evaluation criteria and analyzes the performance of several kinodynamic
planners, which are at the core of physics-based motion planning, using
different scenarios with fixed and manipulatable objects. RRT, EST, KPIECE and
SyCLoP are used for the benchmarking. The results show that KPIECE computes the
time-optimal solution with heighest success rate, whereas, SyCLoP compute the
most power-optimal solution among the planners used.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel approach to robust surface reconstruction from
photometric stereo normal vector maps that is particularly well-suited for
reconstructing surfaces from noisy gradients. Specifically, we propose an
adaptive dictionary learning based approach that attempts to simultaneously
integrate the gradient fields while sparsely representing the spatial patches
of the reconstructed surface in an adaptive dictionary domain. We show that our
formulation learns the underlying structure of the surface, effectively acting
as an adaptive regularizer that enforces a smoothness constraint on the
reconstructed surface. Our method is general and may be coupled with many
existing approaches in the literature to improve the integrity of the
reconstructed surfaces. We demonstrate the performance of our method on
synthetic data as well as real photometric stereo data and evaluate its
robustness to noise.

 <dc:title>Towards Understanding the Evolution of Vocabulary Terms in Knowledge
  Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Vocabularies are used for modeling data in Knowledge Graphs (KG) like the
Linked Open Data Cloud and Wikidata. During their lifetime, the vocabularies of
the KGs are subject to changes. New terms are coined, while existing terms are
modified or declared as deprecated. We first quantify the amount and frequency
of changes in vocabularies. Subsequently, we investigate to which extend and
when the changes are adopted in the evolution of the KGs. We conduct our
experiments on three large-scale KGs for which time-stamped snapshots are
available, namely the Billion Triples Challenge datasets, Dynamic Linked Data
Observatory dataset, and Wikidata. Our results show that the change frequency
of terms is rather low, but can have high impact when adopted on a large amount
of distributed graph data on the web. Furthermore, not all coined terms are
used and most of the deprecated terms are still used by data publishers. There
are variations in the adoption time of terms coming from different vocabularies
ranging from very fast (few days) to very slow (few years). Surprisingly, there
are also adoptions we could observe even before the vocabulary changes are
published. Understanding this adoption is important, since otherwise it may
lead to wrong assumptions about the modeling status of data published on the
web and may result in difficulties when querying the data from distributed
sources.

 <dc:title>Homomorphisms are indeed a good basis for counting: Three fixed-template
  dichotomy theorems, for the price of one</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Hubie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many natural combinatorial quantities can be expressed by counting the number
of homomorphisms to a fixed relational structure. For example, the number of
3-colorings of an undirected graph $G$ is equal to the number of homomorphisms
from $G$ to the $3$-clique. In this setup, the structure receiving the
homomorphisms is often referred to as a template; we use the term template
function to refer to a function, from structures to natural numbers, that is
definable as the number of homomorphisms to a fixed template. There is a
literature that studies the complexity of template functions.
  The present work is concerned with relating template functions to the
problems of counting, with respect to various fixed templates, the number of
two particular types of homomorphisms: surjective homomorphisms and what we
term condensations.
  In this article, we explain how any problem of counting surjective
homomorphisms to a fixed template is polynomial-time equivalent to computing a
linear combination of template functions; we also show this for any problem of
counting condensations to a fixed template. Via a theorem that characterizes
the complexity of computing such a linear combination, we show how a known
dichotomy for template functions can be used to infer a dichotomy for counting
surjective homomorphisms on fixed templates, and likewise a dichotomy for
counting condensations on fixed templates. Our study is strongly inspired by,
based on, and can be viewed as a dual of the graph motif framework of
Curticapean, Dell, and Marx (STOC 2017); that framework is in turn based on
work of Lov\'asz (2012).

 <dc:title>$\kappa$-PMP: Enhancing Physics-based Motion Planners with
  Knowledge-based Reasoning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Physics-based motion planning is a challenging task, since it requires the
computation of the robot motions while allowing possible interactions with
(some of) the obstacles in the environment. Kinodynamic motion planners
equipped with a dynamic engine acting as state propagator are usually used for
that purpose. The difficulties arise in the setting of the adequate forces for
the interactions and because these interactions may change the pose of the
manipulatable obstacles, thus either facilitating or preventing the finding of
a solution path. The use of knowledge can alleviate the stated difficulties.
This paper proposes the use of an enhanced state propagator composed of a
dynamic engine and a low-level geometric reasoning process that is used to
determine how to interact with the objects, i.e. from where and with which
forces. The proposal, called \k{appa}-PMP can be used with any kinodynamic
planner, thus giving rise to e.g. \k{appa}-RRT. The approach also includes a
preprocessing step that infers from a semantic abstract knowledge described in
terms of an ontology the manipulation knowledge required by the reasoning
process. The proposed approach has been validated with several examples
involving an holonomic mobile robot, a robot with differential constraints and
a serial manipulator, and benchmarked using several state-of-the art
kinodynamic planners. The results showed a significant difference in the power
consumption with respect to simple physics-based planning, an improvement in
the success rate and in the quality of the solution paths.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the problem of estimating the phenotypic traits
of plants from color images and elevation maps of field plots. We focus on
emergence and biomass traits - two important indicators of crop growth and
health. We employ a state-of-the-art deconvolutional network for segmentation
and convolutional architectures, with residual learning in the final stages,
for trait estimation. Our intention was to design estimation architectures that
behave like high dimensional nonlinear regression models. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work on emergence counting and biomass estimation
based on deep learning. Evaluation was performed on two different species of
wheat, grown in field plots for an experimental plant breeding study. Our
framework achieves satisfactory performance with mean and standard deviation of
absolute difference of 1.20 and 1.53 counts for emergence and 1.45 and 2.05 for
biomass estimation. Our results for counting wheat plants from field images is
comparable to the accuracy reported for the similar, but arguably less
difficult, task of counting leaves from pictures of rosettes grown in pots. Our
results for biomass estimation improve upon all previously proposed approaches
in the literature.

 <dc:description>  A resistive deep belief network (R-DBN) architecture is developed using the
physics of nanomagnets to provide a natural hardware representation for
individual probabilistic neurons. Probabilistic spin logic devices (p-bits) are
modeled to demonstrate a sigmoidal activation function. A hybrid CMOS/spin
based weighted array structure is designed to implement a restricted Boltzmann
machine (RBM). Device-level simulations based on precise physics relations are
used to validate the sigmoidal relation between the output probability of a
p-bit and its input currents. Characteristics of the resistive networks and
p-bits are modeled in SPICE to perform a circuit-level simulation, which
investigates the performance, area, and power consumption tradeoffs of the
weighted array. In the application-level simulation, an R-DBN is implemented in
MATLAB for digit recognition using the extracted device and circuit behavioral
models. The MNIST data set is used to assess the accuracy of the R-DBN using
100 to 5,000 training images for five distinct network topologies. The results
indicate that a baseline error rate of 36.8% for a 784x10 R-DBN trained by 100
samples can be reduced to only 3.7% using a 784x800x800x10 R-DBN trained by
5,000 input samples. Finally, power dissipation and accuracy tradeoffs for
probabilistic computing mechanisms using resistive devices are identified.

 <dc:description>  Event learning is one of the most important problems in AI. However,
notwithstanding significant research efforts, it is still a very complex task,
especially when the events involve the interaction of humans or agents with
other objects, as it requires modeling human kinematics and object movements.
This study proposes a methodology for learning complex human-object interaction
(HOI) events, involving the recording, annotation and classification of event
interactions. For annotation, we allow multiple interpretations of a motion
capture by slicing over its temporal span, for classification, we use
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) sequential models with Conditional Randon Field
(CRF) for constraints of outputs. Using a setup involving captures of
human-object interaction as three dimensional inputs, we argue that this
approach could be used for event types involving complex spatio-temporal
dynamics.

 <dc:description>  We propose an efficient meta-algorithm for Bayesian estimation problems that
is based on low-degree polynomials, semidefinite programming, and tensor
decomposition. The algorithm is inspired by recent lower bound constructions
for sum-of-squares and related to the method of moments. Our focus is on sample
complexity bounds that are as tight as possible (up to additive lower-order
terms) and often achieve statistical thresholds or conjectured computational
thresholds.
  Our algorithm recovers the best known bounds for community detection in the
sparse stochastic block model, a widely-studied class of estimation problems
for community detection in graphs. We obtain the first recovery guarantees for
the mixed-membership stochastic block model (Airoldi et el.) in constant
average degree graphs---up to what we conjecture to be the computational
threshold for this model. We show that our algorithm exhibits a sharp
computational threshold for the stochastic block model with multiple
communities beyond the Kesten--Stigum bound---giving evidence that this task
may require exponential time.
  The basic strategy of our algorithm is strikingly simple: we compute the
best-possible low-degree approximation for the moments of the posterior
distribution of the parameters and use a robust tensor decomposition algorithm
to recover the parameters from these approximate posterior moments.

 <dc:description>  Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on distributed computing platforms
where sensing, computing, actuation, and communication resources are shared by
a multitude of applications. Such `cyber-physical cloud computing platforms'
present novel challenges because the system is built from mobile embedded
devices, is inherently distributed, and typically suffers from highly
fluctuating connectivity among the modules. Architecting software for these
systems raises many challenges not present in traditional cloud computing.
Effective management of constrained resources and application isolation without
adversely affecting performance are necessary. Autonomous fault management and
real-time performance requirements must be met in a verifiable manner. It is
also both critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose diverse
software applications have changing demands for computational and communication
resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of
security.
  The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered architecture
consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and
component-structured applications. The component model facilitates the
construction of software applications from modular and reusable components that
are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined
mechanisms. The complexity of creating applications and performing system
integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven
development process that relies on a domain-specific modeling language and its
accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing
infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for
verification and validation.

 <dc:description>  Distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems executing mixed criticality
task sets are increasingly being deployed in mobile and embedded cloud
computing platforms, including space applications. These DRE systems must not
only operate over a range of temporal and spatial scales, but also require
stringent assurances for secure interactions between the system's tasks without
violating their individual timing constraints. To address these challenges,
this paper describes a novel distributed operating system focusing on the
scheduler design to support the mixed criticality task sets. Empirical results
from experiments involving a case study of a cluster of satellites emulated in
a laboratory testbed validate our claims.

 <dc:description>  In an information-rich world, people's time and attention must be divided
among rapidly changing information sources and the diverse tasks demanded of
them. How people decide which of the many sources, such as scientific articles
or patents, to read and use in their own work affects dissemination of
scholarly knowledge and adoption of innovation. We analyze the choices people
make about what information to propagate on the citation networks of Physical
Review journals, US patents and legal opinions. We observe regularities in
behavior consistent with human bounded rationality: rather than evaluate all
available choices, people rely on simply cognitive heuristics to decide what
information to attend to. We demonstrate that these heuristics bias choices, so
that people preferentially propagate information that is easier to discover,
often because it is newer or more popular. However, we do not find evidence
that popular sources help to amplify the spread of information beyond making it
more salient. Our paper provides novel evidence of the critical role that
bounded rationality plays in the decisions to allocate attention in social
communication.

 <dc:description>  We study the proportional chore division problem where a protocol wants to
divide a negatively valued object, called chore, among $n$ different players.
The goal is to find an allocation such that cost of the chore assigned to each
player be at most $1/n$ of the total cost. This problem is the dual variant of
the cake cutting problem in which we want to allocate a desirable object.
Edmonds and Pruhs showed that any protocol for the proportional cake cutting
must use at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ queries in the worst case, however,
finding a lower bound for the proportional chore division remained an
interesting open problem. We show that chore division and cake cutting problems
are closely related to each other and provide an $\Omega(n \log n)$ lower bound
for chore division. We also consider the problem when players have unequal
entitlements and show that any protocol for chore division and cake cutting
must use an unbounded number of queries. Finally, we present a simple algorithm
that allocates a chore among the players with unequal entitlements using an
unbounded but finite number of queries.

 <dc:description>  Text messaging is the most widely used form of computer- mediated
communication (CMC). Previous findings have shown that linguistic factors can
reliably indicate messages as deceptive. For example, users take longer and use
more words to craft deceptive messages than they do truthful messages. Existing
research has also examined how factors, such as student status and gender,
affect rates of deception and word choice in deceptive messages. However, this
research has been limited by small sample sizes and has returned contradicting
findings. This paper aims to address these issues by using a dataset of text
messages collected from a large and varied set of participants using an Android
messaging application. The results of this paper show significant differences
in word choice and frequency of deceptive messages between male and female
participants, as well as between students and non-students.

 <dc:description>  We are developing a system for human-robot communication that enables people
to communicate with robots in a natural way and is focused on solving problems
in a shared space. Our strategy for developing this system is fundamentally
data-driven: we use data from multiple input sources and train key components
with various machine learning techniques. We developed a web application that
is collecting data on how two humans communicate to accomplish a task, as well
as a mobile laboratory that is instrumented to collect data on how two humans
communicate to accomplish a task in a physically shared space. The data from
these systems will be used to train and fine-tune the second stage of our
system, in which the robot will be simulated through software. A physical robot
will be used in the final stage of our project. We describe these instruments,
a test-suite and performance metrics designed to evaluate and automate the data
gathering process as well as evaluate an initial data set.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a bilinear composition loss function to address
the problem of image dehazing. Previous methods in image dehazing use a
two-stage approach which first estimate the transmission map followed by clear
image estimation. The drawback of a two-stage method is that it tends to boost
local image artifacts such as noise, aliasing and blocking. This is especially
the case for heavy haze images captured with a low quality device. Our method
is based on convolutional neural networks. Unique in our method is the bilinear
composition loss function which directly model the correlations between
transmission map, clear image, and atmospheric light. This allows errors to be
back-propagated to each sub-network concurrently, while maintaining the
composition constraint to avoid overfitting of each sub-network. We evaluate
the effectiveness of our proposed method using both synthetic and real world
examples. Extensive experiments show that our method outperfoms
state-of-the-art methods especially for haze images with severe noise level and
compressions.

 <dc:description>  Evaluation and validation of complicated control systems are crucial to
guarantee usability and safety. Usually, failure happens in some very rarely
encountered situations, but once triggered, the consequence is disastrous.
Accelerated Evaluation is a methodology that efficiently tests those
rarely-occurring yet critical failures via smartly-sampled test cases. The
distribution used in sampling is pivotal to the performance of the method, but
building a suitable distribution requires case-by-case analysis. This paper
proposes a versatile approach for constructing sampling distribution using
kernel method. The approach uses statistical learning tools to approximate the
critical event sets and constructs distributions based on the unique properties
of Gaussian distributions. We applied the method to evaluate the automated
vehicles. Numerical experiments show proposed approach can robustly identify
the rare failures and significantly reduce the evaluation time.

 <dc:description>  We study automatic title generation for a given block of text and present a
method called DTATG to generate titles. DTATG first extracts a small number of
central sentences that convey the main meanings of the text and are in a
suitable structure for conversion into a title. DTATG then constructs a
dependency tree for each of these sentences and removes certain branches using
a Dependency Tree Compression Model we devise. We also devise a title test to
determine if a sentence can be used as a title. If a trimmed sentence passes
the title test, then it becomes a title candidate. DTATG selects the title
candidate with the highest ranking score as the final title. Our experiments
showed that DTATG can generate adequate titles. We also showed that
DTATG-generated titles have higher F1 scores than those generated by the
previous methods.

this issue, we introduce a lottery model in which each client $j$ is allowed to
submit a parameter $p_j \in [0,1]$ and we look for a random solution that
covers every client $j$ with probability at least $p_j$. Our techniques include
a randomized rounding procedure to round a point inside a matroid intersection
polytope to a basis plus at most one extra item such that all marginal
probabilities are preserved and such that a certain linear function of the
variables does not decrease in the process with probability one.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we establish a zero-sum, hybrid state stochastic game model
for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against different
types of attacks. With the increasingly integrated properties of cyber-physical
systems (CPS) today, security is a challenge for critical infrastructures.
Though resilient control and detecting techniques for a specific model of
attack have been proposed, to analyze and design detection and defense
mechanisms against multiple types of attacks for CPSs requires new system
frameworks. Besides security, other requirements such as optimal control cost
also need to be considered. The hybrid game model we propose in this work
contains physical states that are described by the system dynamics, and a cyber
state that represents the detection mode of the system composed by a set of
subsystems. A strategy means selecting a subsystem by combining one controller,
one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at
each state. Based on the game model, we propose a suboptimal value iteration
algorithm for a finite horizon game, and prove that the algorithm results an
upper bound for the value of the finite horizon game. A moving-horizon approach
is also developed in order to provide a scalable and real-time computation of
the switching strategies. Both algorithms aims at obtaining a saddle-point
equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control
cost. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we
compare the results with previously system designs that only equipped with one
type of controller.

 <dc:title>Prediction and Control of Projectile Impact Point using Approximate
  Statistical Moments</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, trajectory prediction and control design for a desired hit
point of a projectile is studied. Projectiles are subject to environment noise
such as wind effect and measurement noise. In addition, mathematical models of
projectiles contain a large number of important states that should be taken
into account for having a realistic prediction. Furthermore, dynamics of
projectiles contain nonlinear functions such as monomials and sine functions.
To address all these issues we formulate a stochastic model for the projectile.
We showed that with a set of transformations projectile dynamics only contains
nonlinearities of the form of monomials. In the next step we derived
approximate moment dynamics of this system using mean-field approximation. Our
method still suffers from size of the system. To address this problem we
selected a subset of first- and second-order statistical moments and we showed
that they give reliable approximations of the mean and standard deviation of
the impact point for a real projectile. Finally we used these selected moments
to derive a control law that reduces error to hit a desired point.

 <dc:description>  We present a new method to translate videos to commands for robotic
manipulation using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Our framework first
extracts deep features from the input video frames with a deep Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN). Two RNN layers with an encoder-decoder architecture are
then used to encode the visual features and sequentially generate the output
words as the command. We demonstrate that the translation accuracy can be
improved by allowing a smooth transaction between two RNN layers and using the
state-of-the-art feature extractor. The experimental results on our new
challenging dataset show that our approach outperforms recent methods by a fair
margin. Furthermore, we combine the proposed translation module with the vision
and planning system to let a robot perform various manipulation tasks. Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a full-size humanoid robot
WALK-MAN.

 <dc:description>  The development of higher order finite elements methods has become an active
research area. The deformation method for mesh generation has achieved a
prescribed positive Jacobian determinant constraint and it has been a useful
method for mesh adaptation. In this work, the deformation method is combined
with local refinement to generate higher order meshes. 2D and 3D numerical
examples of element order p=3 are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
new algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The response time of jobs with multiple parallel tasks is a critical
performance metric in many systems, including MapReduce systems, coded data
storage systems, etc. However, tight analytical characterizations of the
response time of such jobs are largely unknown except for highly degenerate
cases. The difficulty is rooted in the fact that a job with multiple tasks is
considered complete only when all of its tasks complete processing; i.e., the
job response time is the maximum of the response times of its tasks, which is
hard to analyze since these task response times are generally not independent.
  In this paper, we approach this problem by studying when the response times
of a job's tasks are close to being independent. We consider a limited
fork-join model with $n$ servers, where each job consists of $k^{(n)}\le n$
tasks. Upon arrival, each job chooses $k^{(n)}$ distinct servers uniformly at
random and sends one task to each server. We assume Poisson job arrivals and
generally distributed task service times. We establish that under the condition
$k^{(n)} = o(n^{1/4})$, the steady state response times at any $k^{(n)}$
servers are asymptotically independent, as $n$ grows large. This result greatly
generalizes the asymptotic-independence type of results in the literature where
asymptotic independence is shown only for a fixed constant number of queues. We
then further show that the job response time converges to the maximum of
independent task response times, in a proper sense. This gives the first
asymptotically tight analytical characterization of the response time of a
multi-task parallel job. To complement the asymptotic independence result, we
also show that when $k^{(n)}=\Theta(n)$, any number of multiple queues are not
asymptotically independent. Analysis for the regime of $k^{(n)}$ between
$o(n^{1/4})$ and $\Theta(n)$ remains open.

 <dc:description>  The Residual Networks of Residual Networks (RoR) exhibits excellent
performance in the image classification task, but sharply increasing the number
of feature map channels makes the characteristic information transmission
incoherent, which losses a certain of information related to classification
prediction, limiting the classification performance. In this paper, a Pyramidal
RoR network model is proposed by analysing the performance characteristics of
RoR and combining with the PyramidNet. Firstly, based on RoR, the Pyramidal RoR
network model with channels gradually increasing is designed. Secondly, we
analysed the effect of different residual block structures on performance, and
chosen the residual block structure which best favoured the classification
performance. Finally, we add an important principle to further optimize
Pyramidal RoR networks, drop-path is used to avoid over-fitting and save
training time. In this paper, image classification experiments were performed
on CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN datasets, and we achieved the current lowest
classification error rates were 2.96%, 16.40% and 1.59%, respectively.
Experiments show that the Pyramidal RoR network optimization method can improve
the network performance for different data sets and effectively suppress the
gradient disappearance problem in DCNN training.

 <dc:description>  Consider a simple locally finite hypergraph on a countable vertex set, where
each edge represents one unit of load which should be distributed among the
vertices defining the edge. An allocation of load is called balanced if load
cannot be moved from a vertex to another that is carrying less load. We analyze
the properties of balanced allocations of load. We extend the concept of
balancedness from finite hypergraphs to their local weak limits in the sense of
Benjamini and Schramm (2001) and Aldous and Steele (2004). To do this, we
define a notion of unimodularity for hypergraphs which could be considered an
extension of unimodularity in graphs. We give a variational formula for the
balanced load distribution and, in particular, we characterize it in the
special case of unimodular hypergraph Galton Watson processes. Moreover, we
prove the convergence of the maximum load under some conditions. Our work is an
extension to hypergraphs of Anantharam and Salez (2016), which considered load
balancing in graphs, and is aimed at more comprehensively resolving conjectures
of Hajek (1990).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the personalized text search problem. The keyword
based search method in conventional algorithms has a low efficiency in
understanding users' intention since the semantic meaning, user profile, user
interests are not always considered. Firstly, we propose a novel text search
algorithm using a inverse filtering mechanism that is very efficient for label
based item search. Secondly, we adopt the Bayesian network to implement the
user interest prediction for an improved personalized search. According to user
input, it searches the related items using keyword information, predicted user
interest. Thirdly, the word vectorization is used to discover potential targets
according to the semantic meaning. Experimental results show that the proposed
search engine has an improved efficiency and accuracy and it can operate on
embedded devices with very limited computational resources.

 <dc:description>  The recent success of crowdfunding for supporting new and innovative products
has been overwhelming with over 34 Billion Dollars raised in 2015. In many
crowdfunding platforms, firms set a campaign threshold and contributions are
collected only if this threshold is reached. During the campaign, consumers are
uncertain as to the ex-post value of the product, the business model viability,
and the seller's reliability. Consumer who commit to a contribution therefore
gambles. This gamble is effected by the campaign's threshold. Contributions to
campaigns with higher thresholds are collected only if a greater number of
agents find the offering acceptable. Therefore, high threshold serves as a
social insurance and thus in high-threshold campaigns, potential contributors
feel more at ease with contributing. We introduce the crowdfunding game and
explore the contributor's dilemma in the context of experience goods. We
discuss equilibrium existence and related social welfare, information
aggregation and revenue implications.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep reinforcement learning for multi-agent cooperation and competition has
been a hot topic recently. This paper focuses on cooperative multi-agent
problem based on actor-critic methods under local observations settings. Multi
agent deep deterministic policy gradient obtained state of art results for some
multi-agent games, whereas, it cannot scale well with growing amount of agents.
In order to boost scalability, we propose a parameter sharing deterministic
policy gradient method with three variants based on neural networks, including
actor-critic sharing, actor sharing and actor sharing with partially shared
critic. Benchmarks from rllab show that the proposed method has advantages in
learning speed and memory efficiency, well scales with growing amount of
agents, and moreover, it can make full use of reward sharing and
exchangeability if possible.

 <dc:description>  Given the constantly growing proliferation of false claims online in recent
years, there has been also a growing research interest in automatically
distinguishing false rumors from factually true claims. Here, we propose a
general-purpose framework for fully-automatic fact checking using external
sources, tapping the potential of the entire Web as a knowledge source to
confirm or reject a claim. Our framework uses a deep neural network with LSTM
text encoding to combine semantic kernels with task-specific embeddings that
encode a claim together with pieces of potentially-relevant text fragments from
the Web, taking the source reliability into account. The evaluation results
show good performance on two different tasks and datasets: (i) rumor detection
and (ii) fact checking of the answers to a question in community question
answering forums.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a gated convolutional neural network and a temporal
attention-based localization method for audio classification, which won the 1st
place in the large-scale weakly supervised sound event detection task of
Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2017
challenge. The audio clips in this task, which are extracted from YouTube
videos, are manually labeled with one or a few audio tags but without
timestamps of the audio events, which is called as weakly labeled data. Two
sub-tasks are defined in this challenge including audio tagging and sound event
detection using this weakly labeled data. A convolutional recurrent neural
network (CRNN) with learnable gated linear units (GLUs) non-linearity applied
on the log Mel spectrogram is proposed. In addition, a temporal attention
method is proposed along the frames to predicate the locations of each audio
event in a chunk from the weakly labeled data. We ranked the 1st and the 2nd as
a team in these two sub-tasks of DCASE 2017 challenge with F value 55.6\% and
Equal error 0.73, respectively.

 <dc:description>  We explore the idea of automatically crafting a tuning dataset for
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) that makes the hyper-parameters of the
SMT system more robust with respect to some specific deficiencies of the
parameter tuning algorithms. This is an under-explored research direction,
which can allow better parameter tuning. In this paper, we achieve this goal by
selecting a subset of the available sentence pairs, which are more suitable for
specific combinations of optimizers, objective functions, and evaluation
measures. We demonstrate the potential of the idea with the pairwise ranking
optimization (PRO) optimizer, which is known to yield too short translations.
We show that the learning problem can be alleviated by tuning on a subset of
the development set, selected based on sentence length. In particular, using
the longest 50% of the tuning sentences, we achieve two-fold tuning speedup,
and improvements in BLEU score that rival those of alternatives, which fix
BLEU+1's smoothing instead.

 <dc:description>  While reigning models of diffusion have privileged the structure of a given
social network as the key to informational exchange, real human interactions do
not appear to take place on a single graph of connections. Using data collected
from a pilot study of the spread of HIV awareness in social networks of
homeless youth, we show that health information did not diffuse in the field
according to the processes outlined by dominant models. Since physical network
diffusion scenarios often diverge from their more well-studied counterparts on
digital networks, we propose an alternative Activation Jump Model (AJM) that
describes information diffusion on physical networks from a multi-agent team
perspective. Our model exhibits two main differentiating features from leading
cascade and threshold models of influence spread: 1) The structural composition
of a seed set team impacts each individual node's influencing behavior, and 2)
an influencing node may spread information to non-neighbors. We show that the
AJM significantly outperforms existing models in its fit to the observed
node-level influence data on the youth networks. We then prove theoretical
results, showing that the AJM exhibits many well-behaved properties shared by
dominant models. Our results suggest that the AJM presents a flexible and more
accurate model of network diffusion that may better inform influence
maximization in the field.

 <dc:description>  Online communities have been able to develop large, open-source software
(OSS) projects like Linux and Firefox throughout the successful collaborations
carried out by their members over the Internet. However, online communities
also involve creative arts domains such as animation, video games, and music.
Despite their growing popularity, the factors that lead to successful
collaborations in these communities are not entirely understood. In this paper,
we present a study on creative collaboration in a music community where authors
write songs together by 'overdubbing,' that is, by mixing a new track with an
existing audio recording. We analyzed the relationship between song- and
author-related measures and the likelihood of a song being overdubbed. We found
that recent songs, as well as songs with many reactions, are more likely to be
overdubbed; authors with a high status in the community and a recognizable
identity write songs that the community tends to build upon.

 <dc:description>  More than five years after their emergence, altmetrics are still seen as a
promise to complement traditional citation-based indicators. However, no study
has focused on their potential usefulness to capture the impact of scholarly
books. While recent literature shows that citation indicators cannot fully
capture the impact of books, other studies have suggested alternative
indicators such as usage, publishers' prestige or library holdings. In this
paper, we calculate 18 indicators which range from altmetrics to library
holdings, views, downloads or citations to the production of monographs of a
Spanish university using the bibliometric suite PlumX from EBSCO. The objective
of the study is to adopt a multidimensional perspective on the analysis of
books and understand the level of complementarity between these different
indicators. Also, we compare the overview offered by this range of indicators
when applied to monographs with the traditional bibliometric perspective
focused on journal articles and citation impact. We observe a low presence of
altmetric indicators for monographs, even lower than for journal articles and a
predominance of library holdings, confirming this indicator as the most
promising one towards the analysis of the impact of books.

 <dc:description>  Matrix syntax is a formal model of syntactic relations in language. The
purpose of this paper is to explain its mathematical foundations, for an
audience with some formal background. We make an axiomatic presentation,
motivating each axiom on linguistic and practical grounds. The resulting
mathematical structure resembles some aspects of quantum mechanics. Matrix
syntax allows us to describe a number of language phenomena that are otherwise
very difficult to explain, such as linguistic chains, and is arguably a more
economical theory of language than most of the theories proposed in the context
of the minimalist program in linguistics. In particular, sentences are
naturally modeled as vectors in a Hilbert space with a tensor product
structure, built from 2x2 matrices belonging to some specific group.

 <dc:title>S-CHIRP: Secure Communication for Heterogeneous IoTs with Round-Robin

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work introduces CHIRP - an algorithm for communication between
ultra-portable heterogeneous IoT devices with a type of round-robin protection
mechanism. This algorithm is presented both in its basic form as well as in a
secured form in order to secure and maintain trust boundaries and communication
within specific groups of heterogeneous devices. The specific target
application scenarios includes resource constrained environments where a
co-located swarm of devices (adversarial in mission or objective) is also
present. CHIRP, and its secured version (S-CHIRP), enables complete
peer-to-peer communication of a $n$-agent network of devices in as few as n
rounds. In addition to the n-round cycle length, the proposed communication
mechanism has the following major properties: nodes communication is entirely
decentralized, communication is resilient to the loss of nodes, and finally
communication is resilient to the (re)-entry of nodes. Theoretical models show
that even the secure implementation of this mechanism is capable of scaling to
IoT swarms in the million device range with memory constraints in the &lt; 10 MB
range

 <dc:description>  A terrain is an x-monotone polygonal curve, i.e., successive vertices have
increasing x-coordinates. Terrain Guarding can be seen as a special case of the
famous art gallery problem where one has to place at most $k$ guards on a
terrain made of $n$ vertices in order to fully see it. In 2010, King and Krohn
showed that Terrain Guarding is NP-complete [SODA '10, SIAM J. Comput. '11]
thereby solving a long-standing open question. They observe that their proof
does not settle the complexity of Orthogonal Terrain Guarding where the terrain
only consists of horizontal or vertical segments; those terrains are called
rectilinear or orthogonal. Recently, Ashok et al. [SoCG'17] presented an FPT
algorithm running in time $k^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ for Dominating Set in the
visibility graphs of rectilinear terrains without 180-degree vertices. They ask
if Orthogonal Terrain Guarding is in P or NP-hard. In the same paper, they give
a subexponential-time algorithm running in $n^{O(\sqrt n)}$ (actually even
$n^{O(\sqrt k)}$) for the general Terrain Guarding and notice that the hardness
proof of King and Krohn only disproves a running time $2^{o(n^{1/4})}$ under
the ETH. Hence, there is a significant gap between their $2^{O(n^{1/2} \log
n)}$-algorithm and the no $2^{o(n^{1/4})}$ ETH-hardness implied by King and
Krohn's result. In this paper, we answer those two remaining questions. We
adapt the gadgets of King and Krohn to rectilinear terrains in order to prove
that even Orthogonal Terrain Guarding is NP-complete. Then, we show how their
reduction from Planar 3-SAT (as well as our adaptation for rectilinear
terrains) can actually be made linear (instead of quadratic).

 <dc:title>Efficient Preconditioning for Noisy Separable NMFs by Successive
  Projection Based Low-Rank Approximations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The successive projection algorithm (SPA) can quickly solve a nonnegative
matrix factorization problem under a separability assumption. Even if noise is
added to the problem, SPA is robust as long as the perturbations caused by the
noise are small. In particular, robustness against noise should be high when
handling the problems arising from real applications. The preconditioner
proposed by Gillis and Vavasis (2015) makes it possible to enhance the noise
robustness of SPA. Meanwhile, an additional computational cost is required. The
construction of the preconditioner contains a step to compute the top-$k$
truncated singular value decomposition of an input matrix. It is known that the
decomposition provides the best rank-$k$ approximation to the input matrix; in
other words, a matrix with the smallest approximation error among all matrices
of rank less than $k$. This step is an obstacle to an efficient implementation
of the preconditioned SPA.
  To address the cost issue, we propose a modification of the algorithm for
constructing the preconditioner. Although the original algorithm uses the best
rank-$k$ approximation, instead of it, our modification uses an alternative.
Ideally, this alternative should have high approximation accuracy and low
computational cost. To ensure this, our modification employs a rank-$k$
approximation produced by an SPA based algorithm. We analyze the accuracy of
the approximation and evaluate the computational cost of the algorithm. We then
present an empirical study revealing the actual performance of the SPA based
rank-$k$ approximation algorithm and the modified preconditioned SPA.

 <dc:description>  Encrypting data before sending it to the cloud protects it against hackers
and malicious insiders, but requires the cloud to compute on encrypted data.
Trusted (hardware) modules, e.g., secure enclaves like Intel's SGX, can very
efficiently run entire programs in encrypted memory. However, it already has
been demonstrated that software vulnerabilities give an attacker ample
opportunity to insert arbitrary code into the program. This code can then
modify the data flow of the program and leak any secret in the program to an
observer in the cloud via SGX side-channels. Since any larger program is rife
with software vulnerabilities, it is not a good idea to outsource entire
programs to an SGX enclave. A secure alternative with a small trusted code base
would be fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) -- the holy grail of encrypted
computation. However, due to its high computational complexity it is unlikely
to be adopted in the near future. As a result researchers have made several
proposals for transforming programs to perform encrypted computations on less
powerful encryption schemes. Yet, current approaches fail on programs that make
control-flow decisions based on encrypted data. In this paper, we introduce the
concept of data flow authentication (DFAuth). DFAuth prevents an adversary from
arbitrarily deviating from the data flow of a program. Hence, an attacker
cannot perform an attack as outlined before on SGX. This enables that all
programs, even those including operations on control-flow decision variables,
can be computed on encrypted data. We implemented DFAuth using a novel
authenticated homomorphic encryption scheme, a Java bytecode-to-bytecode
compiler producing fully executable programs, and SGX enclaves. A transformed
neural network that performs machine learning on sensitive medical data can be
evaluated on encrypted inputs and encrypted weights in 0.86 seconds.

 <dc:description>  Cell-Free (CF) Massive MIMO is an alternative topology for Massive MIMO
networks, where a large number of single-antenna access points (APs) are
distributed over the coverage area. There are no cells but all users are
jointly served by the APs using network MIMO methods. In prior work, it has
been claimed that CF Massive MIMO inherits the basic properties of cellular
Massive MIMO, namely channel hardening and favorable propagation. In this
paper, we evaluate if one can rely on these properties when having a realistic
stochastic AP deployment. Our results show that the level of channel hardening
depends strongly on the propagation environment and there is generally little
hardening, except when the pathloss exponent is small. We further show that
using 5--10 antennas per AP, instead of one, we can greatly improve the
hardening. The level of favorable propagation is affected by the propagation
environment and by the distance between the users, where only spatially well
separated users exhibit favorable propagation. The conclusion is that we cannot
rely on channel hardening and favorable propagation when analyzing and
designing CF Massive MIMO networks, but we need to use achievable rate
expressions and resource allocation schemes that work well in the absence of
these properties. Some options are described in this paper.

 <dc:title>Leaky Abstraction In Online Experimentation Platforms: A Conceptual
  Framework To Categorize Common Challenges</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kluck, Timo</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Vermeer, Lukas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online experimentation platforms abstract away many of the details of
experimental design, ensuring experimenters do not have to worry about
sampling, randomisation, subject tracking, data collection, metric definition
and interpretation of results. The recent success and rapid adoption of these
platforms in the industry might in part be attributed to the ease-of-use these
abstractions provide. Previous authors have pointed out there are common
pitfalls to avoid when running controlled experiments on the web and emphasised
the need for experts familiar with the entire software stack to be involved in
the process.
  In this paper, we argue that these pitfalls and the need to understand the
underlying complexity are not the result of shortcomings specific to existing
platforms which might be solved by better platform design. We postulate that
they are a direct consequence of what is commonly referred to as &quot;the law of
leaky abstractions&quot;. That is, it is an inherent feature of any software
platform that details of its implementation leak to the surface, and that in
certain situations, the platform's consumers necessarily need to understand
details of underlying systems in order to make proficient use of it.
  We present several examples of this concept, including examples from
literature, and suggest some possible mitigation strategies that can be
employed to reduce the impact of abstraction leakage. The conceptual framework
put forward in this paper allows us to explicitly categorize experimentation
pitfalls in terms of which specific abstraction is leaking, thereby aiding
implementers and users of these platforms to better understand and tackle the
challenges they face.

 <dc:description>  Wikipedia is the biggest encyclopedia ever created and the fifth most visited
website in the world. Tens of millions of people surf it every day, seeking
answers to various questions. Collective user activity on its pages leaves
publicly available footprints of human behavior, making Wikipedia an excellent
source for analysis of collective behavior. In this work, we propose a
distributed graph-based event extraction model, inspired by the Hebbian
learning theory. The model exploits collective effect of the dynamics to
discover events. We focus on data-streams with underlying graph structure and
perform several large-scale experiments on the Wikipedia visitor activity data.
We show that the presented model is scalable regarding time-series length and
graph density, providing a distributed implementation of the proposed
algorithm. We extract dynamical patterns of collective activity and demonstrate
that they correspond to meaningful clusters of associated events, reflected in
the Wikipedia articles. We also illustrate evolutionary dynamics of the graphs
over time to highlight changing nature of visitors' interests. Finally, we
discuss clusters of events that model collective recall process and represent
collective memories - common memories shared by a group of people.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of a clickbait is to make a link so appealing that people click
on it. However, the content of such articles is often not related to the title,
shows poor quality, and at the end leaves the reader unsatisfied.
  To help the readers, the organizers of the clickbait challenge
(http://www.clickbait-challenge.org/) asked the participants to build a machine
learning model for scoring articles with respect to their &quot;clickbaitness&quot;.
  In this paper we propose to solve the clickbait problem with an ensemble of
Linear SVM models, and our approach was tested successfully in the challenge:
it showed great performance of 0.036 MSE and ranked 3rd among all the solutions
to the contest.

 <dc:description>  Redundancy for straggler mitigation, originally in data download and more
recently in distributed computing context, has been shown to be effective both
in theory and practice. Analysis of systems with redundancy has drawn
significant attention and numerous papers have studied pain and gain of
redundancy under various service models and assumptions on the straggler
characteristics. We here present a cost (pain) vs. latency (gain) analysis of
using simple replication or erasure coding for straggler mitigation in
executing jobs with many tasks. We quantify the effect of the tail of task
execution times and discuss tail heaviness as a decisive parameter for the cost
and latency of using redundancy. Specifically, we find that coded redundancy
achieves better cost vs. latency tradeoff than simple replication and can yield
reduction in both cost and latency under less heavy tailed execution times. We
show that delaying redundancy is not effective in reducing cost and that
delayed relaunch of stragglers can yield significant reduction in cost and
latency. We validate these observations by comparing with the simulations that
use empirical distributions extracted from Google cluster data.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the main foci of robotics is nowadays centered in providing a great
degree of autonomy to robots. A fundamental step in this direction is to give
them the ability to plan in discrete and continuous spaces to find the required
motions to complete a complex task. In this line, some recent approaches
describe tasks with Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and reason on discrete actions
to guide sampling-based motion planning, with the aim of finding
dynamically-feasible motions that satisfy the temporal-logic task
specifications. The present paper proposes an LTL planning approach enhanced
with the use of ontologies to describe and reason about the task, on the one
hand, and that includes physics-based motion planning to allow the purposeful
manipulation of objects, on the other hand. The proposal has been implemented
and is illustrated with didactic examples with a mobile robot in simple
scenarios where some of the goals are occupied with objects that must be
removed in order to fulfill the task.

 <dc:title>Network Link Dimensioning based on Statistical Analysis and Modeling of
  Real Internet Traffic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alasmar, Mohammed</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Link dimensioning is used by ISPs to properly provision the capacity of their
network links. Operators have to make provisions for sudden traffic bursts and
network failures to assure uninterrupted operations. In practice, traffic
averages are used to roughly estimate required capacity. More accurate
solutions often require traffic statistics easily obtained from packet
captures, e.g. variance. Our investigations on real Internet traffic have
emphasized that the traffic shows high variations at small aggregation times,
which indicates that the traffic is self-similar and has a heavy-tailed
characteristics. Self-similarity and heavy-tailedness are of great importance
for network capacity planning purposes. Traffic modeling process should
consider all Internet traffic characteristics. Thereby, the quality of service
(QoS) of the network would not affected by any mismatching between the real
traffic properties and the reference statistical model.
  This paper proposes a new class of traffic profiles that is better suited for
metering bursty Internet traffic streams. We employ bandwidth provisioning to
determine the lowest required bandwidth capacity level for a network link, such
that for a given traffic load, a desired performance target is met. We validate
our approach using packet captures from real IP-based networks.
  The proposed link dimensioning approach starts by measuring the statistical
parameters of the available traces, and then the degree of fluctuations in the
traffic has been measured. This is followed by choosing a proper model to fit
the traffic such as lognormal and generalized extreme value distributions.
Finally, the optimal capacity for the link can be estimated by deploying the
bandwidth provisioning approach. It has been shown that the heavy tailed
distributions give more precise values for the link capacity than the Gaussian
model.

 <dc:description>  Generating videos from text has proven to be a significant challenge for
existing generative models. We tackle this problem by training a conditional
generative model to extract both static and dynamic information from text. This
is manifested in a hybrid framework, employing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The static features, called &quot;gist,&quot;
are used to sketch text-conditioned background color and object layout
structure. Dynamic features are considered by transforming input text into an
image filter. To obtain a large amount of data for training the deep-learning
model, we develop a method to automatically create a matched text-video corpus
from publicly available online videos. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework generates plausible and diverse videos, while accurately
reflecting the input text information. It significantly outperforms baseline
models that directly adapt text-to-image generation procedures to produce
videos. Performance is evaluated both visually and by adapting the inception
score used to evaluate image generation in GANs.

 <dc:description>  A square-contact representation of a planar graph $G=(V,E)$ maps vertices in
$V$ to interior-disjoint axis-aligned squares in the plane and edges in $E$ to
adjacencies between the sides of the corresponding squares. In this paper, we
study proper square-contact representations of planar graphs, in which any two
squares are either disjoint or share infinitely many points.
  We characterize the partial $2$-trees and the triconnected cycle-trees
allowing for such representations. For partial $2$-trees our characterization
uses a simple forbidden subgraph whose structure forces a separating triangle
in any embedding. For the triconnected cycle-trees, a subclass of the
triconnected simply-nested graphs, we use a new structural decomposition for
the graphs in this family, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we
study square-contact representations of general triconnected simply-nested
graphs with respect to their outerplanarity index.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel system identification and tracking method for
PieceWise Smooth (PWS) nonlinear stochastic hybrid systems. We are able to
correctly identify and track challenging problems with diverse dynamics and low
dimensional transitions. We exploit the composite structure system to learn a
simpler model on each component/mode. We use Gaussian Process Regression
techniques to learn smooth, nonlinear manifolds across mode transitions,
guard-regions, and make multi-step ahead predictions on each mode dynamics. We
combine a PWS non-linear model with a particle filter to effectively track
multi-modal transitions. We further use synthetic oversampling techniques to
address the challenge of detecting mode transition which is sparse compared to
mode dynamics. This work provides an effective form of model learning in a
complex hybrid system, which can be useful for future integration in a
reinforcement learning setting. We compare multi-step prediction and tracking
performance against traditional dynamical system tracking methods, such as EKF
and Switching Gaussian Processes, and show that this framework performs
significantly better, being able to correctly track complex dynamics with
sparse transitions.

 <dc:description>  Software ecosystems have had a tremendous impact on computing and society,
capturing the attention of businesses, researchers, and policy makers alike.
Massive ecosystems like the JavaScript node package manager (npm) is evidence
of how packages are readily available for use by software projects. Due to its
high-dimension and complex properties, software ecosystem analysis has been
limited. In this paper, we leverage topological methods in visualize the
high-dimensional datasets from a software ecosystem. Topological Data Analysis
(TDA) is an emerging technique to analyze high-dimensional datasets, which
enables us to study the shape of data. We generate the npm software ecosystem
topology to uncover insights and extract patterns of existing libraries by
studying its localities. Our real-world example reveals many interesting
insights and patterns that describes the shape of a software ecosystem.

 <dc:description>  We study the central problem in data privacy: how to share data with an
analyst while providing both privacy and utility guarantees to the user that
owns the data. We present an estimation-theoretic analysis of the
privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) in this setting. Here, an analyst is allowed to
reconstruct (in a mean-squared error sense) certain functions of the data
(utility), while other private functions should not be reconstructed with
distortion below a certain threshold (privacy). We demonstrate how a
$\chi^2$-based information measure captures the fundamental PUT, and
characterize several properties of this function. In particular, we give a
sharp bound for the PUT. We then propose a convex program to compute
privacy-assuring mappings when the functions to be disclosed and hidden are
known a priori. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our approach to finite
samples.

application of qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) frameworks for
classification of human-object interaction in three dimensional space, in
comparison with the use of quantitative feature extraction approaches for the
same purpose. In particular, we modify QSRLib, a library that allows
computation of Qualitative Spatial Relations and Calculi, and employ it for
feature extraction, before inputting features into our neural network models.
Using an experimental setup involving motion captures of human-object
interaction as three dimensional inputs, we observe that the use of qualitative
spatial features significantly improves the performance of our machine learning
algorithm against our baseline, while quantitative features of similar kinds
fail to deliver similar improvement. We also observe that sequential
representations of QSR features yield the best classification performance. A
result of our learning method is a simple approach to the qualitative
representation of 3D activities as compositions of 2D actions that can be
visualized and learned using 2-dimensional QSR.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a class of Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit problems where the
reward can be modeled as the noisy output of a time varying linear stochastic
dynamic system that satisfies some boundedness constraints. The class allows
many seemingly different problems with time varying option characteristics to
be considered in a single framework. It also opens up the possibility of
considering many new problems of practical importance. For instance it affords
the simultaneous consideration of temporal option unavailabilities and the
depen- dencies between options with time varying option characteristics in a
seamless manner. We show that, for this class of problems, the combination of
any Upper Confidence Bound type algorithm with any efficient reward estimator
for the expected reward ensures the logarithmic bounding of the expected
cumulative regret. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by the
explicit consideration of a new example of practical interest.

 <dc:description>  Natural language provides a widely accessible and expressive interface for
robotic agents. To understand language in complex environments, agents must
reason about the full range of language inputs and their correspondence to the
world. Such reasoning over language and vision is an open problem that is
receiving increasing attention. While existing data sets focus on visual
diversity, they do not display the full range of natural language expressions,
such as counting, set reasoning, and comparisons.
  We propose a simple task for natural language visual reasoning, where images
are paired with descriptive statements. The task is to predict if a statement
is true for the given scene. This abstract describes our existing synthetic
images corpus and our current work on collecting real vision data.

 <dc:description>  Finding patterns in data and being able to retrieve information from those
patterns is an important task in Information retrieval. Complex search
requirements which are not fulfilled by simple string matching and require
exploring certain patterns in data demand a better query engine that can
support searching via structured queries. In this article, we built a
structured query engine which supports searching data through structured
queries on the lines of ElasticSearch. We will show how we achieved real time
indexing and retrieving of data through a RESTful API and how complex queries
can be created and processed using efficient data structures we created for
storing the data in structured way. Finally, we will conclude with an example
of movie recommendation system built on top of this query engine.

 <dc:title>An Efficient Oblivious Database for the Public Cloud</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Hardware enclaves such as Intel SGX are a promising technology to increase
the security of databases outsourced to the cloud. These enclaves provide an
execution environment isolated from the hypervisor/OS, and encryption of data
in memory. However, for applications that use large amounts of
memory---including most realistic databases---enclaves do not protect against
access pattern leaks, where an attacker observes which locations in memory are
accessed. The naive way to address this issue, using Oblivious RAM (ORAM)
primitives, adds prohibitive overhead. In this paper, we propose ObliDB, a
database that co-designs both its data structures (e.g., oblivious B+ trees)
and physical operators to accelerate oblivious relational queries, giving up to
329$\times$ speedup over naive ORAM. On analytics workloads, ObliDB ranges from
competitive to 19$\times$ faster than previous oblivious systems designed only
for analytics, such as Opaque, and comes within 2.6$\times$ of Spark SQL.
Moreover, ObliDB also supports point queries, insertions, and deletions with
latencies of 3--10ms, which is 7--22$\times$ faster than previously published
oblivious data structures, and makes ObliDB suitable for transactional
workloads too. To our knowledge, ObliDB is the first general-purpose oblivious
database to approach practical performance.

 <dc:description>  We examine the problem of learning and planning on high-dimensional domains
with long horizons and sparse rewards. Recent approaches have shown great
successes in many Atari 2600 domains. However, domains with long horizons and
sparse rewards, such as Montezuma's Revenge and Venture, remain challenging for
existing methods. Methods using abstraction (Dietterich 2000; Sutton, Precup,
and Singh 1999) have shown to be useful in tackling long-horizon problems. We
combine recent techniques of deep reinforcement learning with existing
model-based approaches using an expert-provided state abstraction. We construct
toy domains that elucidate the problem of long horizons, sparse rewards and
high-dimensional inputs, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms
previous methods on these domains. Our abstraction-based approach outperforms
Deep Q-Networks (Mnih et al. 2015) on Montezuma's Revenge and Venture, and
exhibits backtracking behavior that is absent from previous methods.

 <dc:description>  Patrolling consists of scheduling perpetual movements of a collection of
mobile robots, so that each point of the environment is regularly revisited by
any robot in the collection. In previous research, it was assumed that all
points of the environment needed to be revisited with the same minimal
frequency. In this paper we study efficient patrolling protocols for points
located on a path, where each point may have a different constraint on
frequency of visits. The problem of visiting such divergent points was recently
posed by Gasieniec et al. in [13], where the authors study protocols using a
single robot patrolling a set of $n$ points located in nodes of a complete
graph and in Euclidean spaces. The focus in this paper is on patrolling with
two robots. We adopt a scenario in which all points to be patrolled are located
on a line. We provide several approximation algorithms concluding with the best
currently known $\sqrt 3$-approximation.

 <dc:description>  Computational Humor, as the name implies, studies humor from a computational
perspective, and it fosters several tasks, such as humor recognition, humor
generation and humor scoring. The area has been little explored, making it
attractive to tackle by novel Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
techniques. However, human-curated data is necessary. In this work we present a
corpus of almost 40,000 tweets written in Spanish and crowd-annotated by their
humor and funniness value with respect to several people on the Internet. It is
equally divided between tweets coming from humorous accounts and from
non-humorous accounts. There is certain humor value agreement between the
raters, with a Krippendorff's alpha value of 0.3654, that allows building a
humor classifier upon it. However, it shows an absence of agreement in the
funniness value. The dataset is available for general usage and has already
been used successfully for humor recognition. Additionally, more aspects of the
dataset are analyzed in this paper, such as the distribution by the number of
annotations and by categories.

Recently, deep learning with a metric learning loss has become a common
framework for ReID. In this paper, we also propose a new metric learning loss
with hard sample mining called margin smaple mining loss (MSML) which can
achieve better accuracy compared with other metric learning losses, such as
triplet loss. In experi- ments, our proposed methods outperforms most of the
state-of-the-art algorithms on Market1501, MARS, CUHK03 and CUHK-SYSU.

 <dc:title>Weighted-SVD: Matrix Factorization with Weights on the Latent Factors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Matrix Factorization models, sometimes called the latent factor models,
are a family of methods in the recommender system research area to (1) generate
the latent factors for the users and the items and (2) predict users' ratings
on items based on their latent factors. However, current Matrix Factorization
models presume that all the latent factors are equally weighted, which may not
always be a reasonable assumption in practice. In this paper, we propose a new
model, called Weighted-SVD, to integrate the linear regression model with the
SVD model such that each latent factor accompanies with a corresponding weight
parameter. This mechanism allows the latent factors have different weights to
influence the final ratings. The complexity of the Weighted-SVD model is
slightly larger than the SVD model but much smaller than the SVD++ model. We
compared the Weighted-SVD model with several latent factor models on five
public datasets based on the Root-Mean-Squared-Errors (RMSEs). The results show
that the Weighted-SVD model outperforms the baseline methods in all the
experimental datasets under almost all settings.

 <dc:description>  The performance analysis of free space optical communication (FSO) system
using relays and spatial diversity at the source is studied in this paper. The
effect of atmospheric turbulence and attenuation, caused by different weather
conditions and geometric losses, has also been considered for analysis. The
exact closed-form expressions are presented for bit error rate (BER) of M-ary
quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) technique for multi-hop multiple-input
single-output (MISO) FSO system under log-normal fading channel. Furthermore,
the link performance of multi-hop MISO and multi-hop single-input and
single-output (SISO) FSO systems are compared to the different systems using
on-off keying (OOK), repetition codes (RCs) and M-ary pulse amplitude
modulation (M-PAM) techniques. A significant performance enhancement in terms
of BER analysis and SNR gains is shown for multi-hop MISO and multi-hop SISO
FSO systems with M-QAM over other existing systems with different modulation
schemes. Moreover, Monte-Carlo simulations are used to validate the accuracy
and consistency of the derived analytical results. Numerical results show that
M-QAM modulated multi-hop MISO and multi-hop SISO FSO system with relays and
spatial diversity outperforms other systems while having the same spectral
efficiency of each system.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have become widely used, obtaining remarkable results in
domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language
processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation,
and bio-informatics, where they have produced results comparable to human
experts. However, these networks can be easily fooled by adversarial
perturbations: minimal changes to correctly-classified inputs, that cause the
network to mis-classify them. This phenomenon represents a concern for both
safety and security, but it is currently unclear how to measure a network's
robustness against such perturbations. Existing techniques are limited to
checking robustness around a few individual input points, providing only very
limited guarantees. We propose a novel approach for automatically identifying
safe regions of the input space, within which the network is robust against
adversarial perturbations. The approach is data-guided, relying on clustering
to identify well-defined geometric regions as candidate safe regions. We then
utilize verification techniques to confirm that these regions are safe or to
provide counter-examples showing that they are not safe. We also introduce the
notion of targeted robustness which, for a given target label and region,
ensures that a NN does not map any input in the region to the target label. We
evaluated our technique on the MNIST dataset and on a neural network
implementation of a controller for the next-generation Airborne Collision
Avoidance System for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). For these networks, our
approach identified multiple regions which were completely safe as well as some
which were only safe for specific labels. It also discovered several
adversarial perturbations of interest.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present an approach to deep visuomotor control using
structured deep dynamics models. Our deep dynamics model, a variant of
SE3-Nets, learns a low-dimensional pose embedding for visuomotor control via an
encoder-decoder structure. Unlike prior work, our dynamics model is structured:
given an input scene, our network explicitly learns to segment salient parts
and predict their pose-embedding along with their motion modeled as a change in
the pose space due to the applied actions. We train our model using a pair of
point clouds separated by an action and show that given supervision only in the
form of point-wise data associations between the frames our network is able to
learn a meaningful segmentation of the scene along with consistent poses. We
further show that our model can be used for closed-loop control directly in the
learned low-dimensional pose space, where the actions are computed by
minimizing error in the pose space using gradient-based methods, similar to
traditional model-based control. We present results on controlling a Baxter
robot from raw depth data in simulation and in the real world and compare
against two baseline deep networks. Our method runs in real-time, achieves good
prediction of scene dynamics and outperforms the baseline methods on multiple
control runs. Video results can be found at:

 <dc:description>  In this work, we analyse and model a real life financial loan application
belonging to a sample bank in the Netherlands. The log is robust in terms of
data, containing a total of 262 200 event logs, belonging to 13 087 different
credit applications. The dataset is heterogeneous and consists of a mixture of
computer generated automatic processes and manual human tasks. The goal is to
work out a decision model, which represents the underlying tasks that make up
the loan application service, and to assess potential areas of improvement of
the institution's internal processes. To this end we study the impact of
incomplete event logs for the extraction and analysis of business processes. It
is quite common that event logs are incomplete with several amounts of missing
information (for instance, workers forget to register their tasks). Absence of
data is translated into a drastic decrease of precision and compromises the
decision models, leading to biased and unrepresentative results. We investigate
how classical probabilistic models are affected by incomplete event logs and we
explore quantum-like probabilistic inferences as an alternative mathematical
model to classical probability. This work represents a first step towards
systematic investigation of the impact of quantum interference in a real life
large scale decision scenario. The results obtained in this study indicate
that, under high levels of uncertainty, the quantum-like models generate
quantum interference terms, which allow an additional non-linear
parameterisation of the data. Experimental results attest the efficiency of the
quantum-like Bayesian networks, since the application of interference terms is
able to reduce the error percentage of inferences performed over quantum-like
models when compared to inferences produced by classical models.

 <dc:description>  We present a method for evaluating the sensitivity of deep reinforcement
learning (RL) policies. We also formulate a zero-sum dynamic game for designing
robust deep reinforcement learning policies. Our approach mitigates the
brittleness of policies when agents are trained in a simulated environment and
are later exposed to the real world where it is hazardous to employ RL
policies. The first problem we address is illustrating and demonstrating to
verify our assumptions that deep RL policies are sensitive to disturbances,
unmodeled dynamics or outright noise. In the second phase, we train two agents
simultaneously in a zero-sum dynamic game; the goal is to drive the system
dynamics to a saddle region. Using a variant of the guided policy search (GPS)
algorithm, we evaluate, test and verify our assumptions. Our agent learns to
adopt robust policies that require less samples for learning the dynamics.

 <dc:description>  In the online multiple testing problem, p-values corresponding to different
null hypotheses are observed one by one, and the decision of whether or not to
reject the current hypothesis must be made immediately, after which the next
p-value is observed. Alpha-investing algorithms to control the false discovery
rate (FDR), formulated by Foster and Stine, have been generalized and applied
to many settings, including quality-preserving databases in science and
multiple A/B or multi-armed bandit tests for internet commerce. This paper
improves the class of generalized alpha-investing algorithms (GAI) in four
ways: (a) we show how to uniformly improve the power of the entire class of
monotone GAI procedures by awarding more alpha-wealth for each rejection,
giving a win-win resolution to a recent dilemma raised by Javanmard and
Montanari, (b) we demonstrate how to incorporate prior weights to indicate
domain knowledge of which hypotheses are likely to be non-null, (c) we allow
for differing penalties for false discoveries to indicate that some hypotheses
may be more important than others, (d) we define a new quantity called the
decaying memory false discovery rate (mem-FDR) that may be more meaningful for
truly temporal applications, and which alleviates problems that we describe and
refer to as &quot;piggybacking&quot; and &quot;alpha-death&quot;. Our GAI++ algorithms incorporate
all four generalizations simultaneously, and reduce to more powerful variants
of earlier algorithms when the weights and decay are all set to unity. Finally,
we also describe a simple method to derive new online FDR rules based on an
estimated false discovery proportion.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of the distributed fusion of multi-object
posteriors in the labeled random finite set filtering framework, using
Generalized Covariance Intersection (GCI) method. Our analysis shows that GCI
fusion with labeled multi-object densities strongly relies on label
consistencies between local multi-object posteriors at different sensor nodes,
and hence suffers from a severe performance degradation when perfect label
consistencies are violated. Moreover, we mathematically analyze this phenomenon
from the perspective of Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information and the
so called yes-object probability. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a novel
and general solution for the distributed fusion with labeled multi-object
densities that is robust to label inconsistencies between sensors.
Specifically, the labeled multi-object posteriors are firstly marginalized to
their unlabeled posteriors which are then fused using GCI method. We also
introduce a principled method to construct the labeled fused density and
produce tracks formally. Based on the developed theoretical framework, we
present tractable algorithms for the family of generalized labeled
multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filters including $\delta$-GLMB, marginalized
$\delta$-GLMB and labeled multi-Bernoulli filters. The robustness and
efficiency of the proposed distributed fusion algorithm are demonstrated in
challenging tracking scenarios via numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies content caching in cloud-aided wireless networks where
small cell base stations with limited storage are connected to the cloud via
limited capacity fronthaul links. By formulating a utility (inverse of service
delay) maximization problem, we propose a cache update algorithm based on
spatio-temporal traffic demands. To account for the large number of contents,
we propose a content clustering algorithm to group similar contents.
Subsequently, with the aid of regret learning at small cell base stations and
the cloud, each base station caches contents based on the learned content
popularity subject to its storage constraints. The performance of the proposed
caching algorithm is evaluated for sparse and dense environments while
investigating the tradeoff between global and local class popularity.
Simulation results show 15% and 40% gains in the proposed method compared to
various baselines.

 <dc:description>  Shape reconstruction techniques using structured light have been widely
researched and developed due to their robustness, high precision, and density.
Because the techniques are based on decoding a pattern to find correspondences,
it implicitly requires that the projected patterns be clearly captured by an
image sensor, i.e., to avoid defocus and motion blur of the projected pattern.
Although intensive researches have been conducted for solving defocus blur, few
researches for motion blur and only solution is to capture with extremely fast
shutter speed. In this paper, unlike the previous approaches, we actively
utilize motion blur, which we refer to as a light flow, to estimate depth.
Analysis reveals that minimum two light flows, which are retrieved from two
projected patterns on the object, are required for depth estimation. To
retrieve two light flows at the same time, two sets of parallel line patterns
are illuminated from two video projectors and the size of motion blur of each
line is precisely measured. By analyzing the light flows, i.e. lengths of the
blurs, scene depth information is estimated. In the experiments, 3D shapes of
fast moving objects, which are inevitably captured with motion blur, are
successfully reconstructed by our technique.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for data hiding in the fingerprint
minutiae template, which is the most popular in fingerprint recognition
systems. Various strategies are proposed in data embedding in order to maintain
the accuracy of fingerprint recognition as well as the undetectability of data
hiding. In bits replacement based data embedding, we replace the last few bits
of each element of the original minutiae template with the data to be hidden.
This strategy can be further improved using an optimized bits replacement based
data embedding, which is able to minimize the impact of data hiding on the
performance of fingerprint recognition. The third strategy is an order
preserving mechanism which is proposed to reduce the detectability of data
hiding. By using such a mechanism, it would be difficult for the attacker to
differentiate the minutiae template with hidden data from the original minutiae
templates. The experimental results show that the proposed data hiding scheme
achieves sufficient capacity for hiding common personal data, where the
accuracy of fingerprint recognition is acceptable after the data hiding.

 <dc:description>  One of the solutions of depth imaging of moving scene is to project a static
pattern on the object and use just a single image for reconstruction. However,
if the motion of the object is too fast with respect to the exposure time of
the image sensor, patterns on the captured image are blurred and reconstruction
fails. In this paper, we impose multiple projection patterns into each single
captured image to realize temporal super resolution of the depth image
sequences. With our method, multiple patterns are projected onto the object
with higher fps than possible with a camera. In this case, the observed pattern
varies depending on the depth and motion of the object, so we can extract
temporal information of the scene from each single image. The decoding process
is realized using a learning-based approach where no geometric calibration is
needed. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method where sequential
shapes are reconstructed from a single image. Both quantitative evaluations and
comparisons with recent techniques were also conducted.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In NLP, convolution neural networks (CNNs) have benefited less than recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) from attention mechanisms. We hypothesize that this is
because attention in CNNs has been mainly implemented as attentive pooling
(i.e., it is applied to pooling) rather than as attentive convolution (i.e., it
is integrated into convolution). Convolution is the differentiator of CNNs in
that it can powerfully model the higher-level representation of a word by
taking into account its local fixed-size context in input text $t^x$. In this
work, we propose an attentive convolution network, AttentiveConvNet. It extends
the context scope of the convolution operation, deriving higher-level features
for a word not only from local context, but also from information extracted
from nonlocal context by the attention mechanism commonly used in RNNs. This
nonlocal context can come (i) from parts of the input text $t^x$ that are
distant or (ii) from a second input text, the context text $t^y$. In an
evaluation on sentence relation classification (textual entailment and answer
sentence selection) and text classification, experiments demonstrate that
AttentiveConvNet has state-of-the-art performance and outperforms RNN/CNN
variants with and without attention.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the symmetric version of matrix multiplication we study the
plethysm $S^k(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$ of the adjoint representation $\mathfrak{sl}_n$
of the Lie group $SL_n$. In particular, we describe the decomposition of this
representation into irreducible components for $k=3$, and find highest weight
vectors for all irreducible components. Relations to fast matrix
multiplication, in particular the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor are presented.

 <dc:description>  The advent and proliferation of social media have led to the development of
mathematical models describing the evolution of beliefs/opinions in an
ecosystem composed of socially interacting users. The goal is to gain insights
into collective dominant social beliefs and into the impact of different
components of the system, such as users' interactions, while being able to
predict users' opinions. Following this thread, in this paper we consider a
fairly general dynamical model of social interactions, which captures all the
main features exhibited by a social system. For such model, by embracing a
mean-field approach, we derive a diffusion differential equation that
represents asymptotic belief dynamics, as the number of users grows large. We
then analyze the steady-state behavior as well as the time dependent
(transient) behavior of the system. In particular, for the steady-state
distribution, we obtain simple closed-form expressions for a relevant class of
systems, while we propose efficient semi-analytical techniques in the most
general cases. At last, we develop an efficient semi-analytical method to
analyze the dynamics of the users' belief over time, which can be applied to a
remarkably large class of systems.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the behavior of experts who seek to make predictions with
maximum impact on an audience. At a known future time, a certain continuous
random variable will be realized. A public prediction gradually converges to
the outcome, and an expert has access to a more accurate prediction. We study
when the expert should reveal his information, when his reward is based on a
proper scoring rule (e.g., is proportional to the change in log-likelihood of
the outcome).
  In Azar et. al. (2016), we analyzed the case where the expert may make a
single prediction. In this paper, we analyze the case where the expert is
allowed to revise previous predictions. This leads to a rather different set of
dilemmas for the strategic expert. We find that it is optimal for the expert to
always tell the truth, and to make a new prediction whenever he has a new
signal. We characterize the expert's expectation for his total reward, and show
asymptotic limits

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Spectral Doppler ultrasound imaging allows visualizing blood flow by
estimating its velocity distribution over time. Duplex ultrasound is a modality
in which an ultrasound system is used for displaying simultaneously both B-mode
images and spectral Doppler data. In B-mode imaging short wide-band pulses are
used to achieve sufficient spatial resolution in the images. In contrast, for
Doppler imaging, narrow-band pulses are preferred in order to attain increased
spectral resolution. Thus, the acquisition time must be shared between the two
sequences. In this work, we propose a non-uniform slow-time transmission scheme
for spectral Doppler, based on nested arrays, which reduces the number of
pulses needed for accurate spectrum recovery. We derive the minimal number of
Doppler emissions needed, using this approach, for perfect reconstruction of
the blood spectrum in a noise-free environment. Next, we provide two spectrum
recovery techniques which achieve this minimal number. The first method
performs efficient recovery based on the fast Fourier transform. The second
allows for continuous recovery of the Doppler frequencies, thus avoiding
off-grid error leakage, at the expense of increased complexity. The performance
of the techniques is evaluated using realistic Field II simulations, showing
accurate estimation of the blood velocity spectrum using only 12% of the
transmissions. The time gained, where no Doppler pulses are sent, can be used
to enable the display of both blood velocities and high quality B-mode images
at a high frame rate.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers coordinated multicast beamforming in a multi-cell
multigroup multiple-input single-output system. Each base station (BS) serves
multiple groups of users by forming a single beam with common information per
group. We propose centralized and distributed beamforming algorithms for two
different optimization targets. The first objective is to minimize the total
transmission power of all the BSs while guaranteeing the user-specific minimum
quality-of-service targets. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method is used to
approximate the non-convex multicast problem as a semidefinite program (SDP),
which is solvable via centralized processing. Subsequently, two alternative
distributed methods are proposed. The first approach turns the SDP into a
two-level optimization via primal decomposition. At the higher level,
inter-cell interference powers are optimized for fixed beamformers while the
lower level locally optimizes the beamformers by minimizing BS-specific
transmit powers for the given inter-cell interference constraints. The second
distributed solution is enabled via an alternating direction method of
multipliers, where the inter-cell interference optimization is divided into a
local and a global optimization by forcing the equality via consistency
constraints. We further propose a centralized and a simple distributed
beamforming design for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
balancing problem in which the minimum SINR among the users is maximized with
given per-BS power constraints. This problem is solved via the bisection method
as a series of SDP feasibility problems. The simulation results show the
superiority of the proposed coordinated beamforming algorithms over traditional
non-coordinated transmission schemes, and illustrate the fast convergence of
the distributed methods.

 <dc:description>  Advances in multimaterial 3D printing have the potential to reproduce various
visual appearance attributes of an object in addition to its shape. Since many
existing 3D file formats encode color and translucency by RGBA textures mapped
to 3D shapes, RGBA information is particularly important for practical
applications. In contrast to color (encoded by RGB), which is specified by the
object's reflectance, selected viewing conditions and a standard observer,
translucency (encoded by A) is neither linked to any measurable physical nor
perceptual quantity. Thus, reproducing translucency encoded by A is open for
interpretation.
  In this paper, we propose a rigorous definition for A suitable for use in
graphical 3D printing, which is independent of the 3D printing hardware and
software, and which links both optical material properties and perceptual
uniformity for human observers. By deriving our definition from the absorption
and scattering coefficients of virtual homogenous reference materials with an
isotropic phase function, we achieve two important properties. First, a simple
adjustment of A is possible, which preserves the translucency appearance if an
object is rescaled for printing. Second, determining the value of A for a real
(potentially non-homogenous) material, can be achieved by minimizing a distance
function between light transport measurements of this material and simulated
measurements of the reference materials. Such measurements can be conducted by
commercial spectrophotometers used in graphic arts.
  Finally, we conduct visual experiments employing the method of constant
stimuli, and derive from them an embedding of A into a nearly
perceptually-uniform scale of translucency for the reference materials.

 <dc:description>  The Rowhammer bug allows unauthorized modification of bits in DRAM cells from
unprivileged software, enabling powerful privilege-escalation attacks.
Sophisticated Rowhammer countermeasures have been presented, aiming at
mitigating the Rowhammer bug or its exploitation. However, the state of the art
provides insufficient insight on the completeness of these defenses.
  In this paper, we present novel Rowhammer attack and exploitation primitives,
showing that even a combination of all defenses is ineffective. Our new attack
technique, one-location hammering, breaks previous assumptions on requirements
for triggering the Rowhammer bug, i.e., we do not hammer multiple DRAM rows but
only keep one DRAM row constantly open. Our new exploitation technique, opcode
flipping, bypasses recent isolation mechanisms by flipping bits in a
predictable and targeted way in userspace binaries. We replace conspicuous and
memory-exhausting spraying and grooming techniques with a novel reliable
technique called memory waylaying. Memory waylaying exploits system-level
optimizations and a side channel to coax the operating system into placing
target pages at attacker-chosen physical locations. Finally, we abuse Intel SGX
to hide the attack entirely from the user and the operating system, making any
inspection or detection of the attack infeasible. Our Rowhammer enclave can be
used for coordinated denial-of-service attacks in the cloud and for privilege
escalation on personal computers. We demonstrate that our attacks evade all
previously proposed countermeasures for commodity systems.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a comprehensive performance analysis of diffusion based
direct, dual-hop, and multi-hop molecular communication systems with Brownian
motion and drift in the presence of various distortions such as inter-symbol
interference (ISI), multi-source interference (MSI), and counting errors.
Optimal decision rules are derived employing the likelihood ratio tests (LRTs)
for symbol detection at each of the cooperative as well as the destination
nanomachines. Further, closed-form expressions are also derived for the
probabilities of detection, false alarm at the individual cooperative,
destination nanomachines, as well as the overall end-to-end probability of
error for source-destination communication. The results also characterize the
impact of detection performance of the intermediate cooperative nanomachine(s)
on the end-to-end performance of dual/multi hop diffusive molecular
communication systems. In addition, capacity expressions are also derived for
direct, dual-hop, and multi-hop molecular communication scenarios. Simulation
results are presented to corroborate the theoretical results derived and also,
to yield insights into system performance.

 <dc:description>  Time series data have exploded due to the popularity of new applications,
like data center management and IoT. Time series data management system (TSDB),
emerges to store and query the large volume of time series data. Subsequence
matching is critical in many time series mining algorithms, and extensive
approaches have been proposed. However, the shift of distributed storage system
and the performance gap make these approaches not compatible with TSDB. To fill
this gap, we propose a new index structure, KV-index, and the corresponding
matching algorithm, KV-match. KV-index is a file-based structure, which can be
easily implemented on local files, HDFS or HBase tables. KV-match algorithm
probes the index efficiently with a few sequential scans. Moreover, two
optimization techniques, window reduction and window reordering, are proposed
to further accelerate the processing. To support the query of arbitrary
lengths, we extend KV-match to KV-match$_{DP}$, which utilizes multiple varied
length indexes to process the query simultaneously. A two-dimensional dynamic
programming algorithm is proposed to find the optimal query segmentation. We
implement our approach on both local files and HBase tables, and conduct
extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Results show that
our index is of comparable size to the popular tree-style index while our query
processing is order of magnitudes more efficient.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a performance analysis for diffusive molecular
communication with mobile transmit and receive nanomachines. To begin with, the
optimal test is obtained for symbol detection at the receiver nanomachine.
Subsequently, closed-form expressions are derived for the probabilities of
detection and false alarm, probability of error, and capacity considering also
aberrations such as multi-source interference, inter-symbol interference, and
counting errors. Simulation results are presented to corroborate the
theoretical results derived and also, to yield various insights into the
performance of the system. Interestingly, it is shown that the performance of
the mobile diffusive molecular communication can be significantly enhanced by
allocating large fraction of total available molecules for transmission as the

 <dc:description>  Various studies have empirically shown that the majority of Java and Android
apps misuse cryptographic libraries, causing devastating breaches of data
security. Therefore, it is crucial to detect such misuses early in the
development process. The fact that insecure usages are not the exception but
the norm precludes approaches based on property inference and anomaly
detection.
  In this paper, we present CrySL, a definition language that enables
cryptography experts to specify the secure usage of the cryptographic libraries
that they provide. CrySL combines the generic concepts of method-call sequences
and data-flow constraints with domain-specific constraints related to
cryptographic algorithms and their parameters. We have implemented a compiler
that translates a CrySL ruleset into a context- and flow-sensitive
demand-driven static analysis. The analysis automatically checks a given Java
or Android app for violations of the CrySL-encoded rules.
  We empirically evaluated our ruleset through analyzing 10,001 Android apps.
Our results show that misuse of cryptographic APIs is still widespread, with
96% of apps containing at least one misuse. However, we observed fewer of the
misuses that were reported in previous work.

 <dc:description>  Highlights in a sport video are usually referred as actions that stimulate
excitement or attract attention of the audience. A big effort is spent in
designing techniques which find automatically highlights, in order to
automatize the otherwise manual editing process. Most of the state-of-the-art
approaches try to solve the problem by training a classifier using the
information extracted on the tv-like framing of players playing on the game
pitch, learning to detect game actions which are labeled by human observers
according to their perception of highlight. Obviously, this is a long and
expensive work. In this paper, we reverse the paradigm: instead of looking at
the gameplay, inferring what could be exciting for the audience, we directly
analyze the audience behavior, which we assume is triggered by events happening
during the game. We apply deep 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) to
extract visual features from cropped video recordings of the supporters that
are attending the event. Outputs of the crops belonging to the same frame are
then accumulated to produce a value indicating the Highlight Likelihood (HL)
which is then used to discriminate between positive (i.e. when a highlight
occurs) and negative samples (i.e. standard play or time-outs). Experimental
results on a public dataset of ice-hockey matches demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method and promote further research in this new exciting direction.

 <dc:description>  Current remote sensing image classification problems have to deal with an
unprecedented amount of heterogeneous and complex data sources. Upcoming
missions will soon provide large data streams that will make land cover/use
classification difficult. Machine learning classifiers can help at this, and
many methods are currently available. A popular kernel classifier is the
Gaussian process classifier (GPC), since it approaches the classification
problem with a solid probabilistic treatment, thus yielding confidence
intervals for the predictions as well as very competitive results to
state-of-the-art neural networks and support vector machines. However, its
computational cost is prohibitive for large scale applications, and constitutes
the main obstacle precluding wide adoption. This paper tackles this problem by
introducing two novel efficient methodologies for Gaussian Process (GP)
classification. We first include the standard random Fourier features
approximation into GPC, which largely decreases its computational cost and
permits large scale remote sensing image classification. In addition, we
propose a model which avoids randomly sampling a number of Fourier frequencies,
and alternatively learns the optimal ones within a variational Bayes approach.
The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in complex problems of
cloud detection from multispectral imagery and infrared sounding data.
Excellent empirical results support the proposal in both computational cost and
accuracy.

 <dc:description>  In the recent years, intensive research work has been dedicated to prove
conditional lower bounds in order to reveal the inner structure of the class P.
These conditional lower bounds are based on many popular conjectures on
well-studied problems. One of the most heavily used conjectures is the
celebrated Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). It turns out that
conditional hardness proved based on SETH goes, in many cases, through an
intermediate problem - the Orthogonal Vectors (OV) problem.
  Almost all research work regarding conditional lower bound was concentrated
on time complexity. Very little attention was directed toward space complexity.
In a recent work, Goldstein et al.[WADS 2017] set the stage for proving
conditional lower bounds regarding space and its interplay with time. In this
spirit, it is tempting to investigate the space complexity of a data structure
variant of OV which is called \emph{OV indexing}. In this problem $n$ boolean
vectors of size $c\log{n}$ are given for preprocessing. As a query, a vector
$v$ is given and we are required to verify if there is an input vector that is
orthogonal to it or not.
  This OV indexing problem is interesting in its own, but it also likely to
have strong implications on problems known to be conditionally hard, in terms
of time complexity, based on OV. Having this in mind, we study OV indexing in
this paper from many aspects. We give some space-efficient algorithms for the
problem, show a tradeoff between space and query time, describe how to solve
its reporting variant, shed light on an interesting connection between this
problem and the well-studied SetDisjointness problem and demonstrate how it can
be solved more efficiently on random input.

 <dc:description>  While mobile edge computing (MEC) alleviates the computation and power
limitations of mobile devices, additional latency is incurred when offloading
tasks to remote MEC servers. In this work, the power-delay tradeoff in the
context of task offloading is studied in a multi-user MEC scenario. In contrast
with current system designs relying on average metrics (e.g., the average queue
length and average latency), a novel network design is proposed in which
latency and reliability constraints are taken into account. This is done by
imposing a probabilistic constraint on users' task queue lengths and invoking
results from extreme value theory to characterize the occurrence of
low-probability events in terms of queue length (or queuing delay) violation.
The problem is formulated as a computation and transmit power minimization
subject to latency and reliability constraints, and solved using tools from
Lyapunov stochastic optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, while examining the power-delay
tradeoff and required computational resources for various computation
intensities.

 <dc:description>  Entity Resolution (ER) is a fundamental problem with many applications.
Machine learning (ML)-based and rule-based approaches have been widely studied
for decades, with many efforts being geared towards which features/attributes
to select, which similarity functions to employ, and which blocking function to
use - complicating the deployment of an ER system as a turn-key system. In this
paper, we present DeepER, a turn-key ER system powered by deep learning (DL)
techniques. The central idea is that distributed representations and
representation learning from DL can alleviate the above human efforts for
tuning existing ER systems. DeepER makes several notable contributions:
encoding a tuple as a distributed representation of attribute values, building
classifiers using these representations and a semantic aware blocking based on
LSH, and learning and tuning the distributed representations for ER. We
evaluate our algorithms on multiple benchmark datasets and achieve competitive
results while requiring minimal interaction with experts.

 <dc:title>Lasso Regularization Paths for NARMAX Models via Coordinate Descent</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new algorithm for estimating NARMAX models with L1
regularization for models represented as a linear combination of basis
functions. Due to the L1-norm penalty the Lasso estimation tends to produce
some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models.
The proposed algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent to compute the
parameters of the NARMAX models for the entire regularization path and, to the
best of the authors knowledge, it is first the algorithm to allow the inclusion
of error regressors in the Lasso estimation. This is made possible by updating
the regressor matrix along with the parameter vector. In comparative timings we
find that this modification does not harm the global efficiency of the
algorithm and can provide the most important regressors in very few inexpensive
iterations. The method is illustrated for linear and polynomial models by means
of two examples.

 <dc:description>  In order to enable Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) to assist in complex,
unknown, unstructured environments, they must be able to navigate with
guaranteed safety, even when faced with a cluttered environment they have no
prior knowledge of. While trajectory optimization-based local planners have
been shown to perform well in these cases, prior work either does not address
how to deal with local minima in the optimization problem, or solves it by
using an optimistic global planner.
  We present a conservative trajectory optimization-based local planner,
coupled with a local exploration strategy that selects intermediate goals. We
perform extensive simulations to show that this system performs better than the
standard approach of using an optimistic global planner, and also outperforms
doing a single exploration step when the local planner is stuck. The method is
validated through experiments in a variety of highly cluttered environments
including a dense forest. These experiments show the complete system running in
real time fully onboard an MAV, mapping and replanning at 4 Hz.

 <dc:description>  Concern about how to aggregate sensitive user data without compromising
individual privacy is a major barrier to greater availability of data. The
model of differential privacy has emerged as an accepted model to release
sensitive information while giving a statistical guarantee for privacy. Many
different algorithms are possible to address different target functions. We
focus on the core problem of count queries, and seek to design mechanisms to
release data associated with a group of n individuals. Prior work has focused
on designing mechanisms by raw optimization of a loss function, without regard
to the consequences on the results. This can leads to mechanisms with
undesirable properties, such as never reporting some outputs (gaps), and
overreporting others (spikes). We tame these pathological behaviors by
introducing a set of desirable properties that mechanisms can obey. Any
combination of these can be satisfied by solving a linear program (LP) which
minimizes a cost function, with constraints enforcing the properties. We focus
on a particular cost function, and provide explicit constructions that are
optimal for certain combinations of properties, and show a closed form for
their cost. In the end, there are only a handful of distinct optimal mechanisms
to choose between: one is the well-known (truncated) geometric mechanism; the
second a novel mechanism that we introduce here, and the remainder are found as
the solution to particular LPs. These all avoid the bad behaviors we identify.
We demonstrate in a set of experiments on real and synthetic data which is
preferable in practice, for different combinations of data distributions,
constraints, and privacy parameters.

 <dc:description>  Data analytic applications built upon big data processing frameworks such as
Apache Spark are an important class of applications. Many of these applications
are not latency-sensitive and thus can run as batch jobs in data centers. By
running multiple applications on a computing host, task co-location can
significantly improve the server utilization and system throughput. However,
effective task co-location is a non-trivial task, as it requires an
understanding of the computing resource requirement of the co-running
applications, in order to determine what tasks, and how many of them, can be
co-located.
  In this paper, we present a mixture-of-experts approach to model the memory
behavior of Spark applications. We achieve this by learning, off-line, a range
of specialized memory models on a range of typical applications; we then
determine at runtime which of the memory models, or experts, best describes the
memory behavior of the target application. We show that by accurately
estimating the resource level that is needed, a co-location scheme can
effectively determine how many applications can be co-located on the same host
to improve the system throughput, by taking into consideration the memory and
CPU requirements of co-running application tasks. Our technique is applied to a
set of representative data analytic applications built upon the Apache Spark
framework. We evaluated our approach for system throughput and average
normalized turnaround time on a multi-core cluster. Our approach achieves over
83.9% of the performance delivered using an ideal memory predictor. We obtain,
on average, 8.69x improvement on system throughput and a 49% reduction on
turnaround time over executing application tasks in isolation, which translates
to a 1.28x and 1.68x improvement over a state-of-the-art co-location scheme for
system throughput and turnaround time respectively.

 <dc:description>  Automatic design of organic materials requires black-box optimization in a
vast chemical space. In conventional molecular design algorithms, a molecule is
built as a combination of predetermined fragments. Recently, deep neural
network models such as variational auto encoders (VAEs) and recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) are shown to be effective in de novo design of molecules
without any predetermined fragments. This paper presents a novel python library
ChemTS that explores the chemical space by combining Monte Carlo tree search
(MCTS) and an RNN. In a benchmarking problem of optimizing the octanol-water
partition coefficient and synthesizability, our algorithm showed superior
efficiency in finding high-scoring molecules. ChemTS is available at

 <dc:creator>de Lamare, Rodrigo C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel distributed low-rank scheme and adaptive
algorithms for distributed estimation over wireless networks. The proposed
distributed scheme is based on a transformation that performs dimensionality
reduction at each agent of the network followed by transmission of a reduced
set of parameters to other agents and reduced-dimension parameter estimation.
Distributed low-rank joint iterative estimation algorithms based on alternating
optimization strategies are developed, which can achieve significantly reduced
communication overhead and improved performance when compared with existing
techniques. A computational complexity analysis of the proposed and existing
low-rank algorithms is presented along with an analysis of the convergence of
the proposed techniques. Simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed
strategies in applications of wireless sensor networks and smart grids.
