 <dc:title>Biologically Inspired Hierarchical Model for Feature Extraction and
  Localization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Liang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Feature extraction and matching are among central problems of computer
vision. It is inefficent to search features over all locations and scales.
Neurophysiological evidence shows that to locate objects in a digital image the
human visual system employs visual attention to a specific object while
ignoring others. The brain also has a mechanism to search from coarse to fine.
In this paper, we present a feature extractor and an associated hierarchical
searching model to simulate such processes. With the hierarchical
representation of the object, coarse scanning is done through the matching of
the larger scale and precise localization is conducted through the matching of
the smaller scale. Experimental results justify the proposed model in its
effectiveness and efficiency to localize features.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a concatenated coding scheme for a high rate
$2\times 2$ multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system over slow fading
channels. The inner code is the Golden code \cite{Golden05} and the outer code
is a trellis code. Set partitioning of the Golden code is designed specifically
to increase the minimum determinant. The branches of the outer trellis code are
labeled with these partitions. Viterbi algorithm is applied for trellis
decoding. In order to compute the branch metrics a lattice sphere decoder is
used. The general framework for code optimization is given. The performance of
the proposed concatenated scheme is evaluated by simulation. It is shown that
the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over uncoded Golden
code.

 <dc:title>Quantum Fuzzy Sets: Blending Fuzzy Set Theory and Quantum Computation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mannucci, Mirco A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article we investigate a way in which quantum computing can be used
to extend the class of fuzzy sets. The core idea is to see states of a quantum
register as characteristic functions of quantum fuzzy subsets of a given set.
As the real unit interval is embedded in the Bloch sphere, every fuzzy set is
automatically a quantum fuzzy set. However, a generic quantum fuzzy set can be
seen as a (possibly entangled) superposition of many fuzzy sets at once,
offering new opportunities for modeling uncertainty. After introducing the main
framework of quantum fuzzy set theory, we analyze the standard operations of
fuzzification and defuzzification from our viewpoint. We conclude this
preliminary paper with a list of possible applications of quantum fuzzy sets to
pattern recognition, as well as future directions of pure research in quantum
fuzzy set theory.

 <dc:description>  We introduces the umodules, a generalisation of the notion of graph module.
The theory we develop captures among others undirected graphs, tournaments,
digraphs, and $2-$structures. We show that, under some axioms, a unique
decomposition tree exists for umodules. Polynomial-time algorithms are provided
for: non-trivial umodule test, maximal umodule computation, and decomposition
tree computation when the tree exists. Our results unify many known
decomposition like modular and bi-join decomposition of graphs, and a new
decomposition of tournaments.

 <dc:title>Univariate polynomial real root isolation: Continued Fractions revisited</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present algorithmic, complexity and implementation results concerning real
root isolation of integer univariate polynomials using the continued fraction
expansion of real algebraic numbers. One motivation is to explain the method's
good performance in practice. We improve the previously known bound by a factor
of $d \tau$, where $d$ is the polynomial degree and $\tau$ bounds the
coefficient bitsize, thus matching the current record complexity for real root
isolation by exact methods. Namely, the complexity bound is $\sOB(d^4 \tau^2)$
using the standard bound on the expected bitsize of the integers in the
continued fraction expansion. We show how to compute the multiplicities within
the same complexity and extend the algorithm to non square-free polynomials.
Finally, we present an efficient open-source \texttt{C++} implementation in the
algebraic library \synaps, and illustrate its efficiency as compared to other
available software. We use polynomials with coefficient bitsize up to 8000 and
degree up to 1000.

 <dc:description>  We show several ways to round a real matrix to an integer one such that the
rounding errors in all rows and columns as well as the whole matrix are less
than one. This is a classical problem with applications in many fields, in
particular, statistics.
  We improve earlier solutions of different authors in two ways. For rounding
matrices of size $m \times n$, we reduce the runtime from $O((m n)^2 Second,
our roundings also have a rounding error of less than one in all initial
intervals of rows and columns. Consequently, arbitrary intervals have an error
of at most two. This is particularly useful in the statistics application of
controlled rounding.
  The same result can be obtained via (dependent) randomized rounding. This has
the additional advantage that the rounding is unbiased, that is, for all
entries $y_{ij}$ of our rounding, we have $E(y_{ij}) = x_{ij}$, where $x_{ij}$
is the corresponding entry of the input matrix.

 <dc:title>Universal decoding with an erasure option</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by applications of rateless coding, decision feedback, and ARQ, we
study the problem of universal decoding for unknown channels, in the presence
of an erasure option. Specifically, we harness the competitive minimax
methodology developed in earlier studies, in order to derive a universal
version of Forney's classical erasure/list decoder, which in the erasure case,
optimally trades off between the probability of erasure and the probability of
undetected error. The proposed universal erasure decoder guarantees universal
achievability of a certain fraction $\xi$ of the optimum error exponents of
these probabilities (in a sense to be made precise in the sequel). A
single--letter expression for $\xi$, which depends solely on the coding rate
and the threshold, is provided. The example of the binary symmetric channel is
studied in full detail, and some conclusions are drawn.

 <dc:description>  Fuzzy automata, whose input alphabet is a set of numbers or symbols, are a
formal model of computing with values. Motivated by Zadeh's paradigm of
computing with words rather than numbers, Ying proposed a kind of fuzzy
automata, whose input alphabet consists of all fuzzy subsets of a set of
symbols, as a formal model of computing with all words. In this paper, we
introduce a somewhat general formal model of computing with (some special)
words. The new features of the model are that the input alphabet only comprises
some (not necessarily all) fuzzy subsets of a set of symbols and the fuzzy
transition function can be specified arbitrarily. By employing the methodology
of fuzzy control, we establish a retraction principle from computing with words
to computing with values for handling crisp inputs and a generalized extension
principle from computing with words to computing with all words for handling
fuzzy inputs. These principles show that computing with values and computing
with all words can be respectively implemented by computing with words. Some
algebraic properties of retractions and generalized extensions are addressed as
well.

 <dc:description>  Catalog Services play a vital role on Data Grids by allowing users and
applications to discover and locate the data needed. On large Data Grids, with
hundreds of geographically distributed sites, centralized Catalog Services do
not provide the required scalability, performance or fault-tolerance. In this
article, we start by presenting and discussing the general requirements on Grid
Catalogs of applications being developed by the EGEE user community. This
provides the motivation for the second part of the article, where we present
the replication and distribution mechanisms we have designed and implemented
into the AMGA Metadata Catalog, which is part of the gLite software stack being
developed for the EGEE project. Implementing these mechanisms in the catalog
itself has the advantages of not requiring any special support from the
relational database back-end, of being database independent, and of allowing
tailoring the mechanisms to the specific requirements and characteristics of
Metadata Catalogs.

 <dc:description>  The science of complexity is based on a new way of thinking that stands in
sharp contrast to the philosophy underlying Newtonian science, which is based
on reductionism, determinism, and objective knowledge. This paper reviews the
historical development of this new world view, focusing on its philosophical
foundations. Determinism was challenged by quantum mechanics and chaos theory.
Systems theory replaced reductionism by a scientifically based holism.
Cybernetics and postmodern social science showed that knowledge is
intrinsically subjective. These developments are being integrated under the
header of &quot;complexity science&quot;. Its central paradigm is the multi-agent system.
Agents are intrinsically subjective and uncertain about their environment and
future, but out of their local interactions, a global organization emerges.
Although different philosophers, and in particular the postmodernists, have
voiced similar ideas, the paradigm of complexity still needs to be fully
assimilated by philosophy. This will throw a new light on old philosophical
issues such as relativism, ethics and the role of the subject.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the problems faced with interoperability between two
programming languages, with respect to GNU Octave, and GTK API written in C, to
provide the GTK API on Octave.Octave-GTK is the fusion of two different API's:
one exported by GNU Octave [scientific computing tool] and the other GTK [GUI
toolkit]; this enables one to use GTK primitives within GNU Octave, to build
graphical front ends,at the same time using octave engine for number crunching
power. This paper illustrates our implementation of binding logic, and shows
results extended to various other libraries using the same base code generator.
Also shown, are methods of code generation, binding automation, and the niche
we plan to fill in the absence of GUI in Octave. Canonical discussion of
advantages, feasibility and problems faced in the process are elucidated.

vector channel operating under a strict complexity constraint at the receiver
is introduced. According to this constraint, detected bits, obtained by
performing hard decisions directly on the channel's matched filter output, must
be the same as the transmitted binary inputs. An asymptotic analysis is carried
out using mathematical tools imported from the study of neural networks, and it
is shown that, under a bounded noise assumption, such complexity-constrained
channel exhibits a non-trivial Shannon-theoretic capacity. It is found that
performance relies on rigorous interference-based multiuser cooperation at the
transmitter and that this cooperation is best served when all transmitters use
the same amplitude.

 <dc:description>  We investigate a prototypical agent-based model, the Naming Game, on random
geometric networks. The Naming Game is a minimal model, employing local
communications that captures the emergence of shared communication schemes
(languages) in a population of autonomous semiotic agents. Implementing the
Naming Games on random geometric graphs, local communications being local
broadcasts, serves as a model for agreement dynamics in large-scale,
autonomously operating wireless sensor networks. Further, it captures essential
features of the scaling properties of the agreement process for
spatially-embedded autonomous agents. We also present results for the case when
a small density of long-range communication links are added on top of the
random geometric graph, resulting in a &quot;small-world&quot;-like network and yielding
a significantly reduced time to reach global agreement.

 <dc:title>Semantically Correct Query Answers in the Presence of Null Values</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bravo, Loreto</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For several reasons a database may not satisfy a given set of integrity
constraints(ICs), but most likely most of the information in it is still
consistent with those ICs; and could be retrieved when queries are answered.
Consistent answers to queries wrt a set of ICs have been characterized as
answers that can be obtained from every possible minimally repaired consistent
version of the original database. In this paper we consider databases that
contain null values and are also repaired, if necessary, using null values. For
this purpose, we propose first a precise semantics for IC satisfaction in a
database with null values that is compatible with the way null values are
treated in commercial database management systems. Next, a precise notion of
repair is introduced that privileges the introduction of null values when
repairing foreign key constraints, in such a way that these new values do not
create an infinite cycle of new inconsistencies. Finally, we analyze how to
specify this kind of repairs of a database that contains null values using
disjunctive logic programs with stable model semantics.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a distributed source coding scheme called successive Wyner-Ziv
coding. We show that any point in the rate region of the quadratic Gaussian CEO
problem can be achieved via the successive Wyner-Ziv coding. The concept of
successive refinement in the single source coding is generalized to the
distributed source coding scenario, which we refer to as distributed successive
refinement. For the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem, we establish a necessary
and sufficient condition for distributed successive refinement, where the
successive Wyner-Ziv coding scheme plays an important role.

 <dc:description>  We investigate knowledge exchange among commercial organisations, the
rationale behind it and its effects on the market. Knowledge exchange is known
to be beneficial for industry, but in order to explain it, authors have used
high level concepts like network effects, reputation and trust. We attempt to
formalise a plausible and elegant explanation of how and why companies adopt
information exchange and why it benefits the market as a whole when this
happens. This explanation is based on a multi-agent model that simulates a
market of software providers. Even though the model does not include any
high-level concepts, information exchange naturally emerges during simulations
as a successful profitable behaviour. The conclusions reached by this
agent-based analysis are twofold: (1) A straightforward set of assumptions is
enough to give rise to exchange in a software market. (2) Knowledge exchange is
shown to increase the efficiency of the market.

 <dc:title>Polynomial Constraint Satisfaction, Graph Bisection, and the Ising
  Partition Function</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Scott, Alexander D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sorkin, Gregory B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a problem class we call Polynomial Constraint Satisfaction
Problems, or PCSP. Where the usual CSPs from computer science and optimization
have real-valued score functions, and partition functions from physics have
monomials, PCSP has scores that are arbitrary multivariate formal polynomials,
or indeed take values in an arbitrary ring.
  Although PCSP is much more general than CSP, remarkably, all (exact,
exponential-time) algorithms we know of for 2-CSP (where each score depends on
at most 2 variables) extend to 2-PCSP, at the expense of just a polynomial
factor in running time. Specifically, we extend the reduction-based algorithm
of Scott and Sorkin; the specialization of that approach to sparse random
instances, where the algorithm runs in polynomial expected time;
dynamic-programming algorithms based on tree decompositions; and the
split-and-list matrix-multiplication algorithm of Williams.
  This gives the first polynomial-space exact algorithm more efficient than
exhaustive enumeration for the well-studied problems of finding a minimum
bisection of a graph, and calculating the partition function of an Ising model,
and the most efficient algorithm known for certain instances of Maximum
Independent Set. Furthermore, PCSP solves both optimization and counting
versions of a wide range of problems, including all CSPs, and thus enables
samplers including uniform sampling of optimal solutions and Gibbs sampling of
all solutions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The class $(r,2)$-CSP, or simply Max 2-CSP, consists of constraint
satisfaction problems with at most two $r$-valued variables per clause. For
instances with $n$ variables and $m$ binary clauses, we present an $O(n
r^{5+19m/100})$-time algorithm which is the fastest polynomial-space algorithm
for many problems in the class, including Max Cut. The method also proves a
treewidth bound $\tw(G) \leq (13/75+o(1))m$, which gives a faster Max 2-CSP
algorithm that uses exponential space: running in time
$\Ostar{2^{(13/75+o(1))m}}$, this is fastest for most problems in Max 2-CSP.
Parametrizing in terms of $n$ rather than $m$, for graphs of average degree $d$
we show a simple algorithm running time $\Ostar{2^{(1-\frac{2}{d+1})n}}$, the
fastest polynomial-space algorithm known.
  In combination with ``Polynomial CSPs'' introduced in a companion paper,
these algorithms also allow (with an additional polynomial-factor overhead in
space and time) counting and sampling, and the solution of problems like Max
Bisection that escape the usual CSP framework.
  Linear programming is key to the design as well as the analysis of the
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We consider the interpretations of notions of access control (permissions,
interdictions, obligations, and user rights) as run-time properties of
information systems specified as event systems with fairness. We give proof
rules for verifying that an access control policy is enforced in a system, and
consider preservation of access control by refinement of event systems. In
particular, refinement of user rights is non-trivial; we propose to combine
low-level user rights and system obligations to implement high-level user
rights.

 <dc:description>  A game-theoretic model is proposed to study the cross-layer problem of joint
power and rate control with quality of service (QoS) constraints in
multiple-access networks. In the proposed game, each user seeks to choose its
transmit power and rate in a distributed manner in order to maximize its own
utility and at the same time satisfy its QoS requirements. The user's QoS
constraints are specified in terms of the average source rate and average
delay. The utility function considered here measures energy efficiency and the
delay includes both transmission and queueing delays. The Nash equilibrium
solution for the proposed non-cooperative game is derived and a closed-form
expression for the utility achieved at equilibrium is obtained. It is shown
that the QoS requirements of a user translate into a &quot;size&quot; for the user which
is an indication of the amount of network resources consumed by the user. Using
this framework, the tradeoffs among throughput, delay, network capacity and
energy efficiency are also studied.

 <dc:description>  A $K$-user pseudo-orthogonal (PO) randomly spread CDMA system, equivalent to
transmission over a subset of $K'\leq K$ single-user Gaussian channels, is
introduced. The high signal-to-noise ratio performance of the PO-CDMA is
analyzed by rigorously deriving its asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) in
the large system limit. Interestingly, the $K'$-optimized PO-CDMA transceiver
scheme yields an AME which is practically equal to 1 for system loads smaller
than 0.1 and lower bounded by 1/4 for increasing loads. As opposed to the
vanishing efficiency of linear multiuser detectors, the derived efficiency is
comparable to the ultimate CDMA efficiency achieved for the intractable optimal
multiuser detector.

hyperexponential solutions of associated systems and one-dimensional
submodules. The hyperexponential solutions are computed recursively by solving
a sequence of first-order ordinary matrix equations. As the recursion proceeds,
the matrix equations will have constant coefficients with respect to the
operators that have been considered.

where it is shown that qubits carry information that is sqrt n / ln n times
classical information, where n is the number of components in the measurement

this exponential nature of quantum information is that the computational

 <dc:description>  Through the Internet and the World-Wide Web, a vast number of information
sources has become available, which offer information on various subjects by
different providers, often in heterogeneous formats. This calls for tools and
methods for building an advanced information-processing infrastructure. One
issue in this area is the selection of suitable information sources in query
answering. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this
problem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources
(prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user
query. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of
the information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a
formal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as
well). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a
query description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection
programs, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured
nature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must
carefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and
furthermore combine it with possible user preferences. A prototype
implementation of our approach has been realized exploiting the DLV KR system
and its plp front-end for prioritized ELPs. We describe a representative
example involving specific movie databases, and report about experimental
results.

 <dc:description>  Usually, probabilistic automata and probabilistic grammars have crisp symbols
as inputs, which can be viewed as the formal models of computing with values.
In this paper, we first introduce probabilistic automata and probabilistic
grammars for computing with (some special) words in a probabilistic framework,
where the words are interpreted as probabilistic distributions or possibility
distributions over a set of crisp symbols. By probabilistic conditioning, we
then establish a retraction principle from computing with words to computing
with values for handling crisp inputs and a generalized extension principle
from computing with words to computing with all words for handling arbitrary
inputs. These principles show that computing with values and computing with all
words can be respectively implemented by computing with some special words. To
compare the transition probabilities of two near inputs, we also examine some
analytical properties of the transition probability functions of generalized
extensions. Moreover, the retractions and the generalized extensions are shown
to be equivalence-preserving. Finally, we clarify some relationships among the
retractions, the generalized extensions, and the extensions studied recently by
Qiu and Wang.

 <dc:title>How to Run Mathematica Batch-files in Background ?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Maiti, Santanu K.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Mathematical Software</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mathematica is a versatile equipment for doing numeric and symbolic
computations and it has wide spread applications in all branches of science.
Mathematica has a complete consistency to design it at every stage that gives
it multilevel capability and helps advanced usage evolve naturally. Mathematica
functions work for any precision of number and it can be easily computed with
symbols, represented graphically to get the best answer. Mathematica is a
robust software development that can be used in any popular operating systems
and it can be communicated with external programs by using proper mathlink
commands.
  Sometimes it is quite desirable to run jobs in background of a computer which
can take considerable amount of time to finish, and this allows us to do work
on other tasks, while keeping the jobs running. Most of us are very familiar to
run jobs in background for the programs written in the languages like C, C++,
F77, F90, F95, etc. But the way of running jobs, written in a mathematica
notebook, in background is quite different from the conventional method. In
this article, we explore how to create a mathematica batch-file from a
mathematica notebook and run it in background. Here we concentrate our study
only for the Unix version, but one can run mathematica programs in background
for the Windows version as well by using proper mathematica batch-file.

 <dc:title>Simplicial models of social aggregation I</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mannucci, Mirco A.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the foundational ideas for a new way of modeling social
aggregation. Traditional approaches have been using network theory, and the
theory of random networks. Under that paradigm, every social agent is
represented by a node, and every social interaction is represented by a segment
connecting two nodes. Early work in family interactions, as well as more recent
work in the study of terrorist organizations, shows that network modeling may
be insufficient to describe the complexity of human social structures.
Specifically, network theory does not seem to have enough flexibility to
represent higher order aggregations, where several agents interact as a group,
rather than as a collection of pairs. The model we present here uses a well
established mathematical theory, the theory of simplicial complexes, to address
this complex issue prevalent in interpersonal and intergroup communication. The
theory enables us to provide a richer graphical representation of social
interactions, and to determine quantitative mechanisms to describe the
robustness of a social structure. We also propose a methodology to create
random simplicial complexes, with the purpose of providing a new method to
simulate computationally the creation and disgregation of social structures.
Finally, we propose several measures which could be taken and observed in order
to describe and study an actual social aggregation occurring in interpersonal
and intergroup contexts.

 <dc:description>  We consider a distributed source coding system in which several observations
are communicated to the decoder using limited transmission rate. The
observations must be separately coded. We introduce a robust distributed coding
scheme which flexibly trades off between system robustness and compression
efficiency. The optimality of this coding scheme is proved for various special

 <dc:description>  The problem of choosing the optimal multipath components to be employed at a
minimum mean square error (MMSE) selective Rake receiver is considered for an
impulse radio ultra-wideband system. First, the optimal finger selection
problem is formulated as an integer programming problem with a non-convex
objective function. Then, the objective function is approximated by a convex
function and the integer programming problem is solved by means of constraint
relaxation techniques. The proposed algorithms are suboptimal due to the
approximate objective function and the constraint relaxation steps. However,
they perform better than the conventional finger selection algorithm, which is
suboptimal since it ignores the correlation between multipath components, and
they can get quite close to the optimal scheme that cannot be implemented in
practice due to its complexity. In addition to the convex relaxation
techniques, a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach is proposed, which does not
need any approximations or integer relaxations. This iterative algorithm is
based on the direct evaluation of the objective function, and can achieve
near-optimal performance with a reasonable number of iterations. Simulation
results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed finger
selection algorithms with that of the conventional and the optimal schemes.

 <dc:description>  This article addresses the problem of two- and higher dimensional pattern
matching, i.e. the identification of instances of a template within a larger
signal space, which is a form of registration. Unlike traditional correlation,
we aim at obtaining more selective matchings by considering more strict
comparisons of gray-level intensity. In order to achieve fast matching, a
nonlinear thresholded version of the fast Fourier transform is applied to a
gray-level decomposition of the original 2D image. The potential of the method
is substantiated with respect to real data involving the selective
identification of neuronal cell bodies in gray-level images.

 <dc:description>  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. An ordering of $G$ is a bijection $\alpha: V\dom
\{1,2,..., |V|\}.$ For a vertex $v$ in $G$, its closed neighborhood is
$N[v]=\{u\in V: uv\in E\}\cup \{v\}.$ The profile of an ordering $\alpha$ of
$G$ is $\prf_{\alpha}(G)=\sum_{v\in V}(\alpha(v)-\min\{\alpha(u): u\in
N[v]\}).$ The profile $\prf(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of $\prf_{\alpha}(G)$
over all orderings $\alpha$ of $G$. It is well-known that $\prf(G)$ is the
minimum number of edges in an interval graph $H$ that contains $G$ is a
subgraph. Since $|V|-1$ is a tight lower bound for the profile of connected
graphs $G=(V,E)$, the parametrization above the guaranteed value $|V|-1$ is of
particular interest. We show that deciding whether the profile of a connected
graph $G=(V,E)$ is at most $|V|-1+k$ is fixed-parameter tractable with respect
to the parameter $k$. We achieve this result by reduction to a problem kernel
of linear size.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of finding a B-term wavelet representation
of a given discrete function $f \in \real^n$ whose distance from f is
minimized. The problem is well understood when we seek to minimize the
Euclidean distance between f and its representation. The first known algorithms
for finding provably approximate representations minimizing general $\ell_p$
distances (including $\ell_\infty$) under a wide variety of compactly supported
wavelet bases are presented in this paper. For the Haar basis, a polynomial
time approximation scheme is demonstrated. These algorithms are applicable in
the one-pass sublinear-space data stream model of computation. They generalize
naturally to multiple dimensions and weighted norms. A universal representation
that provides a provable approximation guarantee under all p-norms
simultaneously; and the first approximation algorithms for bit-budget versions
of the problem, known as adaptive quantization, are also presented. Further, it
is shown that the algorithms presented here can be used to select a basis from
a tree-structured dictionary of bases and find a B-term representation of the
given function that provably approximates its best dictionary-basis
representation.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the achievable rate of data transmission from sources to sinks
through a multiple-relay network. We study achievable rates for omniscient
coding, in which all nodes are considered in the coding design at each node. We
find that, when maximizing the achievable rate, not all nodes need to
``cooperate'' with all other nodes in terms of coding and decoding. This leads
us to suggest a constrained network, whereby each node only considers a few
neighboring nodes during encoding and decoding. We term this myopic coding and
calculate achievable rates for myopic coding. We show by examples that, when
nodes transmit at low SNR, these rates are close to that achievable by
omniscient coding, when the network is unconstrained . This suggests that a
myopic view of the network might be as good as a global view. In addition,
myopic coding has the practical advantage of being more robust to topology
changes. It also mitigates the high computational complexity and large
buffer/memory requirements of omniscient coding schemes.

 <dc:description>  We propose new algorithms for the computation of the first N terms of a
vector (resp. a basis) of power series solutions of a linear system of
differential equations at an ordinary point, using a number of arithmetic
operations which is quasi-linear with respect to N. Similar results are also
given in the non-linear case. This extends previous results obtained by Brent
and Kung for scalar differential equations of order one and two.

 <dc:title>On the Shannon Covers of Certain Irreducible Constrained Systems of

 <dc:description>  A construction of Crochemore, Mignosi and Restivo in the automata theory
literature gives a presentation of a finite-type constrained system (FTCS) that
is deterministic and has a relatively small number of states. This construction
is thus a good starting point for determining the minimal deterministic
presentation, known as the Shannon cover, of an FTCS. We analyze in detail the
Crochemore-Mignosi-Restivo (CMR) construction in the case when the list of
forbidden words defining the FTCS is of size at most two. We show that if the
FTCS is irreducible, then an irreducible presentation for the system can be
easily obtained by deleting a prescribed few states from the CMR presentation.
By studying the follower sets of the states in this irreducible presentation,
we are able to explicitly determine the Shannon cover in some cases. In
particular, our results show that the CMR construction directly yields the
Shannon cover in the case of an irreducible FTCS with exactly one forbidden
word, but this is not in general the case for FTCS's with two forbidden words.

 <dc:description>  Positioning systems in self-organizing networks generally rely on
measurements such as delay and received signal strength, which may be difficult
to obtain and often require dedicated equipment. An alternative to such
approaches is to use simple connectivity information, that is, the presence or
absence of a link between any pair of nodes, and to extend it to hop-counts, in
order to obtain an approximate coordinate system. Such an approximation is
sufficient for a large number of applications, such as routing. In this paper,
we propose Jumps, a positioning system for those self-organizing networks in
which other types of (exact) positioning systems cannot be used or are deemed
to be too costly. Jumps builds a multiple coordinate system based solely on
nodes neighborhood knowledge. Jumps is interesting in the context of wireless
sensor networks, as it neither requires additional embedded equipment nor
relies on any nodes capabilities. While other approaches use only three
hop-count measurements to infer the position of a node, Jumps uses an arbitrary
number. We observe that an increase in the number of measurements leads to an
improvement in the localization process, without requiring a high dense
environment. We show through simulations that Jumps, when compared with
existing approaches, reduces the number of nodes sharing the same coordinates,
which paves the way for functions such as position-based routing.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We address the problem of delay in an arithmetic coding system. Due to the
nature of the arithmetic coding process, source sequences causing arbitrarily
large encoding or decoding delays exist. This phenomena raises the question of
just how large is the expected input to output delay in these systems, i.e.,
once a source sequence has been encoded, what is the expected number of source
letters that should be further encoded to allow full decoding of that sequence.
In this paper, we derive several new upper bounds on the expected delay for a
memoryless source, which improve upon a known bound due to Gallager. The bounds
provided are uniform in the sense of being independent of the sequence's
history. In addition, we give a sufficient condition for a source to admit a
bounded expected delay, which holds for a stationary ergodic Markov source of
any order.

 <dc:description>  Cognitive radios have been proposed as a means to implement efficient reuse
of the licensed spectrum. The key feature of a cognitive radio is its ability
to recognize the primary (licensed) user and adapt its communication strategy
to minimize the interference that it generates. We consider a communication
scenario in which the primary and the cognitive user wish to communicate to
different receivers, subject to mutual interference. Modeling the cognitive
radio as a transmitter with side-information about the primary transmission, we
characterize the largest rate at which the cognitive radio can reliably
communicate under the constraint that (i) no interference is created for the
primary user, and (ii) the primary encoder-decoder pair is oblivious to the
presence of the cognitive radio.

 <dc:description>  The relationship between two important problems in tree pattern matching, the
largest common subtree and the smallest common supertree problems, is
established by means of simple constructions, which allow one to obtain a
largest common subtree of two trees from a smallest common supertree of them,
and vice versa. These constructions are the same for isomorphic, homeomorphic,
topological, and minor embeddings, they take only time linear in the size of
the trees, and they turn out to have a clear algebraic meaning.

 <dc:description>  The biologically-inspired swarm paradigm is being used to design
self-organizing systems of locally interacting artificial agents. A major
difficulty in designing swarms with desired characteristics is understanding
the causal relation between individual agent and collective behaviors.
Mathematical analysis of swarm dynamics can address this difficulty to gain
insight into system design. This paper proposes a framework for mathematical
modeling of swarms of microscopic robots that may one day be useful in medical
applications. While such devices do not yet exist, the modeling approach can be
helpful in identifying various design trade-offs for the robots and be a useful
guide for their eventual fabrication. Specifically, we examine microscopic
robots that reside in a fluid, for example, a bloodstream, and are able to
detect and respond to different chemicals. We present the general mathematical
model of a scenario in which robots locate a chemical source. We solve the
scenario in one-dimension and show how results can be used to evaluate certain
design decisions.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot systems
operating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their
behavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in
order to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms
for task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication
between robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a
lack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult
to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic
task allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between
two types of task, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the
absence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the
state of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task
to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as
stochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior.
Specifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the
choice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The
mathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The
model's predictions agree very closely with experimental results from
sensor-based simulations.

 <dc:description>  The 3.2 giga-pixel LSST camera will produce approximately half a petabyte of
archive images every month. These data need to be reduced in under a minute to
produce real-time transient alerts, and then added to the cumulative catalog
for further analysis. The catalog is expected to grow about three hundred
terabytes per year. The data volume, the real-time transient alerting
requirements of the LSST, and its spatio-temporal aspects require innovative
techniques to build an efficient data access system at reasonable cost. As
currently envisioned, the system will rely on a database for catalogs and
metadata. Several database systems are being evaluated to understand how they
perform at these data rates, data volumes, and access patterns. This paper
describes the LSST requirements, the challenges they impose, the data access
philosophy, results to date from evaluating available database technologies
against LSST requirements, and the proposed database architecture to meet the
data challenges.

 <dc:description>  2-dimensional Matching Problem, which requires to find a matching of left- to
right-vertices in a balanced $2n$-vertex bipartite graph, is a well-known
polynomial problem, while various variants, like the 3-dimensional analogoue
(3DM, with triangles on a tripartite graph), or the Hamiltonian Circuit Problem
(HC, a restriction to ``unicyclic'' matchings) are among the main examples of
NP-hard problems, since the first Karp reduction series of 1972. The same holds
for the weighted variants of these problems, the Linear Assignment Problem
being polynomial, and the Numerical 3-Dimensional Matching and Travelling
Salesman Problem being NP-complete.
  In this paper we show that a small modification of the 2-dimensional Matching
and Assignment Problems in which for each $i \leq n/2$ it is required that
either $\pi(2i-1)=2i-1$ or $\pi(2i)=2i$, is a NP-complete problem. The proof is
by linear reduction from SAT (or NAE-SAT), with the size $n$ of the Matching
Problem being four times the number of edges in the factor graph representation
of the boolean problem. As a corollary, in combination with the simple linear
reduction of One-in-Two Matching to 3-Dimensional Matching, we show that SAT
can be linearly reduced to 3DM, while the original Karp reduction was only
cubic.

 <dc:title>On Multistage Successive Refinement for Wyner-Ziv Source Coding with
  Degraded Side Informations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tian, Chao</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We provide a complete characterization of the rate-distortion region for the
multistage successive refinement of the Wyner-Ziv source coding problem with
degraded side informations at the decoder. Necessary and sufficient conditions
for a source to be successively refinable along a distortion vector are
subsequently derived. A source-channel separation theorem is provided when the
descriptions are sent over independent channels for the multistage case.
Furthermore, we introduce the notion of generalized successive refinability
with multiple degraded side informations. This notion captures whether
progressive encoding to satisfy multiple distortion constraints for different
side informations is as good as encoding without progressive requirement.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for generalized successive refinability are
given. It is shown that the following two sources are generalized successively
refinable: (1) the Gaussian source with degraded Gaussian side informations,
(2) the doubly symmetric binary source when the worse side information is a
constant. Thus for both cases, the failure of being successively refinable is
only due to the inherent uncertainty on which side information will occur at
the decoder, but not the progressive encoding requirement.

 <dc:description>  Many classical encoding algorithms of Vector Quantization (VQ) of image
compression that can obtain global optimal solution have computational
complexity O(N). A pure quantum VQ encoding algorithm with probability of
success near 100% has been proposed, that performs operations 45sqrt(N) times
approximately. In this paper, a hybrid quantum VQ encoding algorithm between
classical method and quantum algorithm is presented. The number of its
operations is less than sqrt(N) for most images, and it is more efficient than
the pure quantum algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Let $G_1$ be a cyclic multiplicative group of order $n$. It is known that the
Diffie-Hellman problem is random self-reducible in $G_1$ with respect to a
fixed generator $g$ if $\phi(n)$ is known. That is, given $g, g^x\in G_1$ and
having oracle access to a `Diffie-Hellman Problem' solver with fixed generator
$g$, it is possible to compute $g^{1/x} \in G_1$ in polynomial time (see
theorem 3.2). On the other hand, it is not known if such a reduction exists
when $\phi(n)$ is unknown (see conjuncture 3.1). We exploit this ``gap'' to
construct a cryptosystem based on hidden order groups and present a practical
implementation of a novel cryptographic primitive called an \emph{Oracle Strong
Associative One-Way Function} (O-SAOWF). O-SAOWFs have applications in
multiparty protocols. We demonstrate this by presenting a key agreement
protocol for dynamic ad-hoc groups.

 <dc:title>Novel Reversible Multiplier Architecture Using Reversible TSG Gate</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thapliyal, Himanshu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Srinivas, M. B</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the recent years, reversible logic has emerged as a promising technology
having its applications in low power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotechnology,
and optical computing. The classical set of gates such as AND, OR, and EXOR are
not reversible. Recently a 4 * 4 reversible gate called TSG is proposed. The
most significant aspect of the proposed gate is that it can work singly as a
reversible full adder, that is reversible full adder can now be implemented
with a single gate only. This paper proposes a NXN reversible multiplier using
TSG gate. It is based on two concepts. The partial products can be generated in
parallel with a delay of d using Fredkin gates and thereafter the addition can
be reduced to log2N steps by using reversible parallel adder designed from TSG
gates. Similar multiplier architecture in conventional arithmetic (using
conventional logic) has been reported in existing literature, but the proposed
one in this paper is totally based on reversible logic and reversible cells as
its building block. A 4x4 architecture of the proposed reversible multiplier is
also designed. It is demonstrated that the proposed multiplier architecture
using the TSG gate is much better and optimized, compared to its existing
counterparts in literature; in terms of number of reversible gates and garbage
outputs. Thus, this paper provides the initial threshold to building of more
complex system which can execute more complicated operations using reversible
logic.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An information-spectrum approach is applied to solve the multiterminal source
coding problem for correlated general sources, where sources may be
nonstationary and/or nonergodic, and the distortion measure is arbitrary and
may be nonadditive. A general formula for the rate-distortion region of the
multiterminal source coding problem with the maximum distortion criterion under
fixed-length coding is shown in this correspondence.

 <dc:description>  We present a new, systematic approach for analyzing network topologies. We
first introduce the dK-series of probability distributions specifying all
degree correlations within d-sized subgraphs of a given graph G. Increasing
values of d capture progressively more properties of G at the cost of more
complex representation of the probability distribution. Using this series, we
can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs and construct random
graphs that accurately reproduce virtually all metrics proposed in the
literature. The nature of the dK-series implies that it will also capture any
future metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we construct graphs
for d=0,1,2,3 and demonstrate that these graphs reproduce, with increasing
accuracy, important properties of measured and modeled Internet topologies. We
find that the d=2 case is sufficient for most practical purposes, while d=3
essentially reconstructs the Internet AS- and router-level topologies exactly.
We hope that a systematic method to analyze and synthesize topologies offers a
significant improvement to the set of tools available to network topology and
protocol researchers.

 <dc:title>The complexity of acyclic conjunctive queries revisited</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Durand, Arnaud</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Grandjean, Etienne</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider first-order logic over unary functions and study
the complexity of the evaluation problem for conjunctive queries described by
such kind of formulas. A natural notion of query acyclicity for this language
is introduced and we study the complexity of a large number of variants or
generalizations of acyclic query problems in that context (Boolean or not
Boolean, with or without inequalities, comparisons, etc...). Our main results
show that all those problems are \textit{fixed-parameter linear} i.e. they can
be evaluated in time $f(|Q|).|\textbf{db}|.|Q(\textbf{db})|$ where $|Q|$ is the
size of the query $Q$, $|\textbf{db}|$ the database size, $|Q(\textbf{db})|$ is
the size of the output and $f$ is some function whose value depends on the
specific variant of the query problem (in some cases, $f$ is the identity
function). Our results have two kinds of consequences. First, they can be
easily translated in the relational (i.e., classical) setting. Previously known
bounds for some query problems are improved and new tractable cases are then
exhibited. Among others, as an immediate corollary, we improve a result of
\~\cite{PapadimitriouY-99} by showing that any (relational) acyclic conjunctive
query with inequalities can be evaluated in time
$f(|Q|).|\textbf{db}|.|Q(\textbf{db})|$. A second consequence of our method is
that it provides a very natural descriptive approach to the complexity of
well-known algorithmic problems. A number of examples (such as acyclic subgraph
problems, multidimensional matching, etc...) are considered for which new
insights of their complexity are given.

 <dc:description>  Solomonoff completed the Bayesian framework by providing a rigorous, unique,
formal, and universal choice for the model class and the prior. We discuss in
breadth how and in which sense universal (non-i.i.d.) sequence prediction
solves various (philosophical) problems of traditional Bayesian sequence
prediction. We show that Solomonoff's model possesses many desirable
properties: Fast convergence and strong bounds, and in contrast to most
classical continuous prior densities has no zero p(oste)rior problem, i.e. can
confirm universal hypotheses, is reparametrization and regrouping invariant,
and avoids the old-evidence and updating problem. It even performs well
(actually better) in non-computable environments.

 <dc:title>Complementary Set Matrices Satisfying a Column Correlation Constraint</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Di</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Spasojevic, Predrag</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by the problem of reducing the peak to average power ratio (PAPR)
of transmitted signals, we consider a design of complementary set matrices
whose column sequences satisfy a correlation constraint. The design algorithm
recursively builds a collection of $2^{t+1}$ mutually orthogonal (MO)
complementary set matrices starting from a companion pair of sequences. We
relate correlation properties of column sequences to that of the companion pair
and illustrate how to select an appropriate companion pair to ensure that a
given column correlation constraint is satisfied. For $t=0$, companion pair
properties directly determine matrix column correlation properties. For $t\geq
1$, reducing correlation merits of the companion pair may lead to improved
column correlation properties. However, further decrease of the maximum
out-off-phase aperiodic autocorrelation of column sequences is not possible
once the companion pair correlation merit is less than a threshold determined
by $t$. We also reveal a design of the companion pair which leads to
complementary set matrices with Golay column sequences. Exhaustive search for
companion pairs satisfying a column correlation constraint is infeasible for
medium and long sequences. We instead search for two shorter length sequences
by minimizing a cost function in terms of their autocorrelation and
crosscorrelation merits. Furthermore, an improved cost function which helps in
reducing the maximum out-off-phase column correlation is derived based on the
properties of the companion pair. By exploiting the well-known Welch bound,
sufficient conditions for the existence of companion pairs which satisfy a set
of column correlation constraints are also given.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is well known that perspective alignment plays a major role in the
planning and interpretation of spatial language. In order to understand the
role of perspective alignment and the cognitive processes involved, we have
made precise complete cognitive models of situated embodied agents that
self-organise a communication system for dialoging about the position and
movement of real world objects in their immediate surroundings. We show in a
series of robotic experiments which cognitive mechanisms are necessary and
sufficient to achieve successful spatial language and why and how perspective
alignment can take place, either implicitly or based on explicit marking.

 <dc:description>  We give an efficient randomized algorithm to construct a box representation
of any graph G on n vertices in $1.5 (\Delta + 2) \ln n$ dimensions, where
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree of G. We also show that $\boxi(G) \le (\Delta +
2) \ln n$ for any graph G. Our bound is tight up to a factor of $\ln n$. We
also show that our randomized algorithm can be derandomized to get a polynomial
time deterministic algorithm. Though our general upper bound is in terms of
maximum degree $\Delta$, we show that for almost all graphs on n vertices, its
boxicity is upper bound by $c\cdot(d_{av} + 1) \ln n$ where d_{av} is the
average degree and c is a small constant. Also, we show that for any graph G,
$\boxi(G) \le \sqrt{8 n d_{av} \ln n}$, which is tight up to a factor of $b
\sqrt{\ln n}$ for a constant b.

 <dc:title>Generalized Multiple Access Channels with Confidential Messages</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liang, Yingbin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Poor, H. Vincent</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A discrete memoryless generalized multiple access channel (GMAC) with
confidential messages is studied, where two users attempt to transmit common
information to a destination and each user also has private (confidential)
information intended for the destination. The two users are allowed to receive
channel outputs, and hence may obtain the confidential information sent by each
other from channel outputs they receive. However, each user views the other
user as a wire-tapper, and wishes to keep its confidential information as
secret as possible from the other user. The level of secrecy of the
confidential information is measured by the equivocation rate, i.e., the
entropy rate of the confidential information conditioned on channel outputs at
the wire-tapper. The performance measure of interest for the GMAC with
confidential messages is the rate-equivocation tuple that includes the common
rate, two private rates and two equivocation rates as components. The set that
includes all these achievable rate-equivocation tuples is referred to as the
capacity-equivocation region. The GMAC with one confidential message set is
first studied, where only one user (user 1) has private (confidential)
information for the destination. Inner and outer bounds on the
capacity-equivocation region are derived, and the capacity-equivocation are
established for some classes of channels including the Gaussian GMAC.
Furthermore, the secrecy capacity region is established, which is the set of
all achievable rates with user 2 being perfectly ignorant of confidential
messages of user 1. For the GMAC with two confidential message sets, where both
users have confidential messages for the destination, an inner bound on the
capacity-equivocation region is obtained.

 <dc:description>  Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability
to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing
vast amounts of information. Here we collect data from a popular system and
investigate the statistical properties of tag co-occurrence. We introduce a
stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative
tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are
exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory - or aging of
resources - in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the
system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for
the observed experimental features, with a surprisingly high accuracy. This
points in the direction of a universal behavior of users, who - despite the
complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish
nature of their tagging activity - appear to follow simple activity patterns.

 <dc:title>Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The capacity regions are investigated for two relay broadcast channels
(RBCs), where relay links are incorporated into standard two-user broadcast
channels to support user cooperation. In the first channel, the Partially
Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, only one user in the system can act as a
relay and transmit to the other user through a relay link. An achievable rate
region is derived based on the relay using the decode-and-forward scheme. An
outer bound on the capacity region is derived and is shown to be tighter than
the cut-set bound. For the special case where the Partially Cooperative RBC is
degraded, the achievable rate region is shown to be tight and provides the
capacity region. Gaussian Partially Cooperative RBCs and Partially Cooperative
RBCs with feedback are further studied. In the second channel model being
studied in the paper, the Fully Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, both users
can act as relay nodes and transmit to each other through relay links. This is
a more general model than the Partially Cooperative RBC. All the results for
Partially Cooperative RBCs are correspondingly generalized to the Fully
Cooperative RBCs. It is further shown that the AWGN Fully Cooperative RBC has a
larger achievable rate region than the AWGN Partially Cooperative RBC. The
results illustrate that relaying and user cooperation are powerful techniques
in improving the capacity of broadcast channels.

 <dc:description>  We extend the 0-approximation of sensing actions and incomplete information
in [Son and Baral 2000] to action theories with static causal laws and prove
its soundness with respect to the possible world semantics. We also show that
the conditional planning problem with respect to this approximation is
NP-complete. We then present an answer set programming based conditional
planner, called ASCP, that is capable of generating both conformant plans and
conditional plans in the presence of sensing actions, incomplete information
about the initial state, and static causal laws. We prove the correctness of
our implementation and argue that our planner is sound and complete with
respect to the proposed approximation. Finally, we present experimental results
comparing ASCP to other planners.

 <dc:description>  We consider the Gaussian Multiple Access Wire-Tap Channel (GMAC-WT). In this
scenario, multiple users communicate with an intended receiver in the presence
of an intelligent and informed wire-tapper who receives a degraded version of
the signal at the receiver. We define a suitable security measure for this
multi-access environment. We derive an outer bound for the rate region such
that secrecy to some pre-determined degree can be maintained. We also find,
using Gaussian codebooks, an achievable such secrecy region. Gaussian codewords
are shown to achieve the sum capacity outer bound, and the achievable region
concides with the outer bound for Gaussian codewords, giving the capacity
region when inputs are constrained to be Gaussian. We present numerical results
showing the new rate region and compare it with that of the Gaussian
Multiple-Access Channel (GMAC) with no secrecy constraints.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows
what intelligence is. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider
artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper
we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known
informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and
extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to
produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe
that this measure formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the
broadest reasonable sense.

 <dc:title>Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis and Log-Gabor
  Filters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Perlibakas, Vytautas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article we propose a novel face recognition method based on Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and Log-Gabor filters. The main advantages of the
proposed method are its simple implementation, training, and very high
recognition accuracy. For recognition experiments we used 5151 face images of
1311 persons from different sets of the FERET and AR databases that allow to
analyze how recognition accuracy is affected by the change of facial
expressions, illumination, and aging. Recognition experiments with the FERET
database (containing photographs of 1196 persons) showed that our method can
achieve maximal 97-98% first one recognition rate and 0.3-0.4% Equal Error
Rate. The experiments also showed that the accuracy of our method is less
affected by eye location errors and used image normalization method than of
traditional PCA -based recognition method.

 <dc:title>Strongly Almost Periodic Sequences under Finite Automata Mappings</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The notion of almost periodicity nontrivially generalizes the notion of
periodicity. Strongly almost periodic sequences (=uniformly recurrent infinite
words) first appeared in the field of symbolic dynamics, but then turned out to
be interesting in connection with computer science. The paper studies the class
of eventually strongly almost periodic sequences (i. e., becoming strongly
almost periodic after deleting some prefix). We prove that the property of
eventual strong almost periodicity is preserved under the mappings done by
finite automata and finite transducers. The class of almost periodic sequences
includes the class of eventually strongly almost periodic sequences. We prove
this inclusion to be strict.

 <dc:title>Recognition of expression variant faces using masked log-Gabor features
  and Principal Component Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Perlibakas, Vytautas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article we propose a method for the recognition of faces with
different facial expressions. For recognition we extract feature vectors by
using log-Gabor filters of multiple orientations and scales. Using sliding
window algorithm and variances -based masking these features are extracted at
image regions that are less affected by the changes of facial expressions.
Extracted features are passed to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) -based
recognition method. The results of face recognition experiments using
expression variant faces showed that the proposed method could achieve higher
recognition accuracy than many other methods. For development and testing we
used facial images from the AR and FERET databases. Using facial photographs of
more than one thousand persons from the FERET database the proposed method
achieved 96.6-98.9% first one recognition rate and 0.2-0.6% Equal Error Rate
(EER).

 <dc:description>  We consider the Gaussian Multiple Access Wire-Tap Channel (GMAC-WT). In this
scenario, multiple users communicate with an intended receiver in the presence
of an intelligent and informed wire-tapper who receives a degraded version of
the signal at the receiver. We define suitable security measures for this
multi-access environment. Using codebooks generated randomly according to a
Gaussian distribution, achievable secrecy rate regions are identified using
superposition coding and TDMA coding schemes. An upper bound for the secrecy
sum-rate is derived, and our coding schemes are shown to achieve the sum
capacity. Numerical results showing the new rate region are presented and
compared with the capacity region of the Gaussian Multiple-Access Channel
(GMAC) with no secrecy constraints, quantifying the price paid for secrecy.

 <dc:description>  Efficient algorithms are presented for constructing spanners in geometric
intersection graphs. For a unit ball graph in R^k, a (1+\epsilon)-spanner is
obtained using efficient partitioning of the space into hypercubes and solving
bichromatic closest pair problems. The spanner construction has almost
equivalent complexity to the construction of Euclidean minimum spanning trees.
The results are extended to arbitrary ball graphs with a sub-quadratic running
time.
  For unit ball graphs, the spanners have a small separator decomposition which
can be used to obtain efficient algorithms for approximating proximity problems
like diameter and distance queries. The results on compressed quadtrees,
geometric graph separators, and diameter approximation might be of independent
interest.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we analyze the average queue backlog in a combined input-output
queued switch using a maximal size matching scheduling algorithm. We compare
this average backlog to the average backlog achieved by an optimal switch. We
model the cell arrival process as independent and identically distributed
between time slots and uniformly distributed among input and output ports. For
switches with many input and output ports, the backlog associated with maximal
size matching with speedup 3 is no more than 10/3 times the backlog associated
with an optimal switch. Moreover, this performance ratio rapidly approaches 2
as speedup increases.

 <dc:description>  The Unified Software Development Process (USDP) and UML have been now
generally accepted as the standard methodology and modeling language for
developing Object-Oriented Systems. Although Agent-based Systems introduces new
issues, we consider that USDP and UML can be used in an extended manner for
modeling Agent-based Systems. The paper presents a methodology for designing
agent-based systems and the specific models expressed in an UML-based notation
corresponding to each phase of the software development process. UML was
extended using the provided mechanism: stereotypes. Therefore, this approach
can be managed with any CASE tool supporting UML. A Case Study, the development
of a specific agent-based Student Evaluation System (SAS), is presented.

 <dc:description>  Mobile agents research is clearly aiming towards imposing agent based
development as the next generation of tools for writing software. This paper
comes with its own contribution to this global goal by introducing a novel
unifying framework meant to bring simplicity and interoperability to and among
agent platforms as we know them today. In addition to this, we also introduce a
set of agent behaviors which, although tailored for and from the area of
virtual learning environments, are none the less generic enough to be used for
rapid, simple, useful and reliable agent deployment. The paper also presents an
illustrative case study brought forward to prove the feasibility of our design.

 <dc:description>  E-learning is nowadays one of the most interesting of the &quot;e- &quot; domains
available through the Internet. The main problem to create a Web-based, virtual
environment is to model the traditional domain and to implement the model using
the most suitable technologies. We analyzed the distance learning domain and
investigated the possibility to implement some e-learning services using mobile
agent technologies. This paper presents a model of the Student Assessment
Service (SAS) and an agent-based framework developed to be used for
implementing specific applications. A specific Student Assessment application
that relies on the framework was developed.

 <dc:description>  Internet worms, which spread in computer networks without human mediation,
pose a severe threat to computer systems today. The rate of propagation of
worms has been measured to be extremely high and they can infect a large
fraction of their potential hosts in a short time. We study two different
methods of patch dissemination to combat the spread of worms. We first show
that using a fixed number of patch servers performs woefully inadequately
against Internet worms. We then show that by exploiting the exponential data
dissemination capability of P2P systems, the spread of worms can be halted very
effectively. We compare the two methods by using fluid models to compute two
quantities of interest: the time taken to effectively combat the progress of
the worm and the maximum number of infected hosts. We validate our models using
Internet measurements and simulations.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach for using clickthrough data to learn
ranked retrieval functions for web search results. We observe that users
searching the web often perform a sequence, or chain, of queries with a similar
information need. Using query chains, we generate new types of preference
judgments from search engine logs, thus taking advantage of user intelligence
in reformulating queries. To validate our method we perform a controlled user
study comparing generated preference judgments to explicit relevance judgments.
We also implemented a real-world search engine to test our approach, using a
modified ranking SVM to learn an improved ranking function from preference
data. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in the ranking given by
the search engine. The learned rankings outperform both a static ranking
function, as well as one trained without considering query chains.

 <dc:description>  This paper evaluates the robustness of learning from implicit feedback in web
search. In particular, we create a model of user behavior by drawing upon user
studies in laboratory and real-world settings. The model is used to understand
the effect of user behavior on the performance of a learning algorithm for
ranked retrieval. We explore a wide range of possible user behaviors and find
that learning from implicit feedback can be surprisingly robust. This
complements previous results that demonstrated our algorithm's effectiveness in
a real-world search engine application.

 <dc:description>  Clickthrough data is a particularly inexpensive and plentiful resource to
obtain implicit relevance feedback for improving and personalizing search
engines. However, it is well known that the probability of a user clicking on a
result is strongly biased toward documents presented higher in the result set
irrespective of relevance. We introduce a simple method to modify the
presentation of search results that provably gives relevance judgments that are
unaffected by presentation bias under reasonable assumptions. We validate this
property of the training data in interactive real world experiments. Finally,
we show that using these unbiased relevance judgments learning methods can be
guaranteed to converge to an ideal ranking given sufficient data.

 <dc:title>An Unfolding-Based Semantics for Logic Programming with Aggregates</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The paper presents two equivalent definitions of answer sets for logic
programs with aggregates. These definitions build on the notion of unfolding of
aggregates, and they are aimed at creating methodologies to translate logic
programs with aggregates to normal logic programs or positive programs, whose
answer set semantics can be used to defined the semantics of the original
programs. The first definition provides an alternative view of the semantics
for logic programming with aggregates described by Pelov et al.
  The second definition is similar to the traditional answer set definition for
normal logic programs, in that, given a logic program with aggregates and an
interpretation, the unfolding process produces a positive program. The paper
shows how this definition can be extended to consider aggregates in the head of
the rules.
  The proposed views of logic programming with aggregates are simple and
coincide with the ultimate stable model semantics, and with other semantic
characterizations for large classes of program (e.g., programs with monotone
aggregates and programs that are aggregate-stratified).
  Moreover, it can be directly employed to support an implementation using
available answer set solvers. The paper describes a system, called ASP^A, that
is capable of computing answer sets of programs with arbitrary (e.g.,
recursively defined) aggregates.

 <dc:description>  The problem of verifying multi-threaded execution against the memory
consistency model of a processor is known to be an NP hard problem. However
polynomial time algorithms exist that detect almost all failures in such
execution. These are often used in practice for microprocessor verification. We
present a low complexity and fully parallelized algorithm to check program
execution against the processor consistency model. In addition our algorithm is
general enough to support a number of consistency models without any
degradation in performance. An implementation of this algorithm is currently
used in practice to verify processors in the post silicon stage for multiple
architectures.

 <dc:title>General Discounting versus Average Reward</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hutter, Marcus</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Consider an agent interacting with an environment in cycles. In every
interaction cycle the agent is rewarded for its performance. We compare the
average reward U from cycle 1 to m (average value) with the future discounted
reward V from cycle k to infinity (discounted value). We consider essentially
arbitrary (non-geometric) discount sequences and arbitrary reward sequences
(non-MDP environments). We show that asymptotically U for m-&gt;infinity and V for
k-&gt;infinity are equal, provided both limits exist. Further, if the effective
horizon grows linearly with k or faster, then existence of the limit of U
implies that the limit of V exists. Conversely, if the effective horizon grows
linearly with k or slower, then existence of the limit of V implies that the
limit of U exists.

 <dc:title>Asymptotically Optimal Multiple-access Communication via Distributed
  Rate Splitting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cao, Jian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yeh, Edmund M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the multiple-access communication problem in a distributed
setting for both the additive white Gaussian noise channel and the discrete
memoryless channel. We propose a scheme called Distributed Rate Splitting to
achieve the optimal rates allowed by information theory in a distributed
manner. In this scheme, each real user creates a number of virtual users via a
power/rate splitting mechanism in the M-user Gaussian channel or via a random
switching mechanism in the M-user discrete memoryless channel. At the receiver,
all virtual users are successively decoded. Compared with other multiple-access
techniques, Distributed Rate Splitting can be implemented with lower complexity
and less coordination. Furthermore, in a symmetric setting, we show that the
rate tuple achieved by this scheme converges to the maximum equal rate point
allowed by the information-theoretic bound as the number of virtual users per
real user tends to infinity. When the capacity regions are asymmetric, we show
that a point on the dominant face can be achieved asymptotically. Finally, when
there is an unequal number of virtual users per real user, we show that
differential user rate requirements can be accommodated in a distributed
fashion.

 <dc:description>  Continuation Passing Style (CPS) is one of the most important issues in the
field of functional programming languages, and the quest for a primitive notion
of types for continuation is still open. Starting from the notion of ``test''
proposed by Girard, we develop a notion of test for intuitionistic logic. We
give a complete deductive system for tests and we show that it is good to deal
with ``continuations''. In particular, in the proposed system it is possible to
work with Call by Value and Call by Name translations in a uniform way.

 <dc:title>Linear Shift-Register Synthesis for Multiple Sequences of Varying Length</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schmidt, Georg</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sidorenko, Vladimir R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of finding the shortest linear shift-register capable of
generating t finite length sequences over some field F is considered. A similar
problem was already addressed by Feng and Tzeng. They presented an iterative
algorithm for solving this multi-sequence shift-register synthesis problem,
which can be considered as generalization of the well known Berlekamp-Massey
algorithm. The Feng-Tzeng algorithm works indeed, if all t sequences have the
same length. This paper focuses on multi-sequence shift-register synthesis for
generating sequences of varying length. It is exposed, that the Feng-Tzeng
algorithm does not always give the correct solution in this case. A modified
algorithm is proposed and formally proved, which overcomes this problem.

 <dc:title>Patterns of i.i.d. Sequences and Their Entropy - Part I: General Bounds</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shamir, Gil I.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Tight bounds on the block entropy of patterns of sequences generated by
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sources are derived. A pattern
of a sequence is a sequence of integer indices with each index representing the
order of first occurrence of the respective symbol in the original sequence.
Since a pattern is the result of data processing on the original sequence, its
entropy cannot be larger. Bounds derived here describe the pattern entropy as
function of the original i.i.d. source entropy, the alphabet size, the symbol
probabilities, and their arrangement in the probability space. Matching upper
and lower bounds derived provide a useful tool for very accurate approximations
of pattern block entropies for various distributions, and for assessing the
decrease of the pattern entropy from that of the original i.i.d. sequence.

 <dc:description>  New families of Fisher information and entropy power inequalities for sums of
independent random variables are presented. These inequalities relate the
information in the sum of $n$ independent random variables to the information
contained in sums over subsets of the random variables, for an arbitrary
collection of subsets. As a consequence, a simple proof of the monotonicity of
information in central limit theorems is obtained, both in the setting of
i.i.d. summands as well as in the more general setting of independent summands
with variance-standardized sums.

 <dc:description>  In a recent breakthrough, [Bshouty et al., 2005] obtained the first
passive-learning algorithm for DNFs under the uniform distribution. They showed
that DNFs are learnable in the Random Walk and Noise Sensitivity models. We
extend their results in several directions. We first show that thresholds of
parities, a natural class encompassing DNFs, cannot be learned efficiently in
the Noise Sensitivity model using only statistical queries. In contrast, we
show that a cyclic version of the Random Walk model allows to learn efficiently
polynomially weighted thresholds of parities. We also extend the algorithm of
Bshouty et al. to the case of Unions of Rectangles, a natural generalization of
DNFs to $\{0,...,b-1\}^n$.

 <dc:title>A General Method for Finding Low Error Rates of LDPC Codes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper outlines a three-step procedure for determining the low bit error
rate performance curve of a wide class of LDPC codes of moderate length. The
traditional method to estimate code performance in the higher SNR region is to
use a sum of the contributions of the most dominant error events to the
probability of error. These dominant error events will be both code and decoder
dependent, consisting of low-weight codewords as well as non-codeword events if
ML decoding is not used. For even moderate length codes, it is not feasible to
find all of these dominant error events with a brute force search. The proposed
method provides a convenient way to evaluate very low bit error rate
performance of an LDPC code without requiring knowledge of the complete error
event weight spectrum or resorting to a Monte Carlo simulation. This new method
can be applied to various types of decoding such as the full belief propagation
version of the message passing algorithm or the commonly used min-sum
approximation to belief propagation. The proposed method allows one to
efficiently see error performance at bit error rates that were previously out
of reach of Monte Carlo methods. This result will provide a solid foundation
for the analysis and design of LDPC codes and decoders that are required to
provide a guaranteed very low bit error rate performance at certain SNRs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a unified analytical framework within which power control, rate
allocation, routing, and congestion control for wireless networks can be
optimized in a coherent and integrated manner. We consider a multi-commodity
flow model with an interference-limited physical-layer scheme in which power
control and routing variables are chosen to minimize the sum of convex link
costs reflecting, for instance, queuing delay. Distributed network algorithms
where joint power control and routing are performed on a node-by-node basis are
presented. We show that with appropriately chosen parameters, these algorithms
iteratively converge to the global optimum from any initial point with finite
cost. Next, we study refinements of the algorithms for more accurate link
capacity models, and extend the results to wireless networks where the
physical-layer achievable rate region is given by an arbitrary convex set, and
the link costs are strictly quasiconvex. Finally, we demonstrate that
congestion control can be seamlessly incorporated into our framework, so that
algorithms developed for power control and routing can naturally be extended to
optimize user input rates.

 <dc:description>  Grid computing has emerged as an effective means of facilitating the sharing
of distributed heterogeneous resources, enabling collaboration in large scale
environments. However, the nature of Grid systems, coupled with the
overabundance and fragmentation of information, makes it difficult to monitor
resources, services, and computations in order to plan and make decisions. In
this paper we present Gridscape II, a customisable portal component that can be
used on its own or plugged in to compliment existing Grid portals. Gridscape II
manages the gathering of information from arbitrary, heterogeneous and
distributed sources and presents them together seamlessly within a single
interface. It also leverages the Google Maps API in order to provide a highly
interactive user interface. Gridscape II is simple and easy to use, providing a
solution to those users who do not wish to invest heavily in developing their
own monitoring portal from scratch, and also for those users who want something
that is easy to customise and extend for their specific needs.

 <dc:description>  In the first part of this paper we present a theory of proof nets for full
multiplicative linear logic, including the two units. It naturally extends the
well-known theory of unit-free multiplicative proof nets. A linking is no
longer a set of axiom links but a tree in which the axiom links are subtrees.
These trees will be identified according to an equivalence relation based on a
simple form of graph rewriting. We show the standard results of
sequentialization and strong normalization of cut elimination. In the second
part of the paper we show that the identifications enforced on proofs are such
that the class of two-conclusion proof nets defines the free *-autonomous
category.

 <dc:title>Approximate Discrete Probability Distribution Representation using a
  Multi-Resolution Binary Tree</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bellot, David</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Computing and storing probabilities is a hard problem as soon as one has to
deal with complex distributions over multiple random variables. The problem of
efficient representation of probability distributions is central in term of
computational efficiency in the field of probabilistic reasoning. The main
problem arises when dealing with joint probability distributions over a set of
random variables: they are always represented using huge probability arrays. In
this paper, a new method based on binary-tree representation is introduced in
order to store efficiently very large joint distributions. Our approach
approximates any multidimensional joint distributions using an adaptive
discretization of the space. We make the assumption that the lower is the
probability mass of a particular region of feature space, the larger is the
discretization step. This assumption leads to a very optimized representation
in term of time and memory. The other advantages of our approach are the
ability to refine dynamically the distribution every time it is needed leading
to a more accurate representation of the probability distribution and to an
anytime representation of the distribution.

 <dc:description>  This chapter focuses on the use of Grid technologies to achieve utility
computing. An overview of how Grids can support utility computing is first
presented through the architecture of Utility Grids. Then, utility-based
resource allocation is described in detail at each level of the architecture.
Finally, some industrial solutions for utility computing are discussed.

 <dc:title>SLA-Based Coordinated Superscheduling Scheme and Performance for

 <dc:description>  The Service Level Agreement~(SLA) based grid superscheduling approach
promotes coordinated resource sharing. Superscheduling is facilitated between
administratively and topologically distributed grid sites by grid schedulers
such as Resource brokers. In this work, we present a market-based SLA
coordination mechanism. We based our SLA model on a well known \emph{contract
net protocol}.
  The key advantages of our approach are that it allows:~(i) resource owners to
have finer degree of control over the resource allocation that was previously
not possible through traditional mechanism; and (ii) superschedulers to bid for
SLA contracts in the contract net with focus on completing the job within the
user specified deadline. In this work, we use simulation to show the
effectiveness of our proposed approach.

 <dc:title>A Monadic, Functional Implementation of Real Numbers</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Large scale real number computation is an essential ingredient in several
modern mathematical proofs. Because such lengthy computations cannot be
verified by hand, some mathematicians want to use software proof assistants to
verify the correctness of these proofs. This paper develops a new
implementation of the constructive real numbers and elementary functions for
such proofs by using the monad properties of the completion operation on metric
spaces. Bishop and Bridges's notion of regular sequences is generalized to,
what I call, regular functions which form the completion of any metric space.
Using the monad operations, continuous functions on length spaces (a common
subclass of metric spaces) are created by lifting continuous functions on the
original space. A prototype Haskell implementation has been created. I believe
that this approach yields a real number library that is reasonably efficient
for computation, and still simple enough to easily verify its correctness.

 <dc:title>Ontological Representations of Software Patterns</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper is based on and advocates the trend in software engineering of
extending the use of software patterns as means of structuring solutions to
software development problems (be they motivated by best practice or by company
interests and policies). The paper argues that, on the one hand, this
development requires tools for automatic organisation, retrieval and
explanation of software patterns. On the other hand, that the existence of such
tools itself will facilitate the further development and employment of patterns
in the software development process. The paper analyses existing pattern
representations and concludes that they are inadequate for the kind of
automation intended here. Adopting a standpoint similar to that taken in the
semantic web, the paper proposes that feasible solutions can be built on the
basis of ontological representations.

 <dc:description>  Research interest in Grid computing has grown significantly over the past
five years. Management of distributed resources is one of the key issues in
Grid computing. Central to management of resources is the effectiveness of
resource allocation as it determines the overall utility of the system. The
current approaches to superscheduling in a grid environment are non-coordinated
since application level schedulers or brokers make scheduling decisions
independently of the others in the system. Clearly, this can exacerbate the
load sharing and utilization problems of distributed resources due to
suboptimal schedules that are likely to occur. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a mechanism for coordinated sharing of distributed clusters based on
computational economy. The resulting environment, called
\emph{Grid-Federation}, allows the transparent use of resources from the
federation when local resources are insufficient to meet its users'
requirements. The use of computational economy methodology in coordinating
resource allocation not only facilitates the QoS based scheduling, but also
enhances utility delivered by resources.

 <dc:description>  To bring coherence between Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) and Hyper Text
Transfer Protocol (HTTP), in this paper, we have proposed an enhanced Internet
framework, which incorporates a new markup language and a browser compatible
with both of the access control protocols. This Markup Language and the browser
enables co-existence of both Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and Wireless
Markup Language (WML) contents in a single source file, whereas the browser
incorporates the ability to hold contents compliant with both HTTP and WAP. The
proposed framework also bridges the security gap that is present in the
existing mobile Internet framework.

 <dc:description>  Conventional IP routing protocols are not suitable for multimedia
applications which have very stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) demands and
they require a connection oriented service. For multimedia applications it is
expected that the router should be able to forward the packet according to the
demand of the packet and it is necessary to find a path that satisfies the
specific demands of a particular application. In order to address these issues,
in this paper, we have presented a QoS aware IP routing protocol where a router
stores information about the QoS parameters and routes the packet accordingly.
  Keywords: IP Routing Protocol, Quality of Service (QoS) parameter, QoSIP,

 <dc:description>  With the rapid growth of Information and Communication Technology, Electronic
commerce is now acting as a new means of carrying out business transactions
through electronic means such as Internet environment. To avoid the
complexities associated with the digital cash and electronic cash, consumers
and vendors are looking for credit card payments on the Internet as one
possible time-tested alternative. This gave rise of the on-line payment
processing using a third-party verification; which is not suitable for the
developing countries in most of the cases because of the excessive costs
associated with it for maintenance and establishment of an online third-party
processor. As a remedy of this problem, in this paper, we have proposed a
framework for easy security incorporation in credit card based electronic
payment system without the use of an on-line third- party processor; which
tends to be low cost and effective for the developing countries.

 <dc:description>  Logical formalisms for reasoning about relations between spatial regions play
a fundamental role in geographical information systems, spatial and constraint
databases, and spatial reasoning in AI. In analogy with Halpern and Shoham's
modal logic of time intervals based on the Allen relations, we introduce a
family of modal logics equipped with eight modal operators that are interpreted
by the Egenhofer-Franzosa (or RCC8) relations between regions in topological
spaces such as the real plane. We investigate the expressive power and
computational complexity of logics obtained in this way. It turns out that our
modal logics have the same expressive power as the two-variable fragment of
first-order logic, but are exponentially less succinct. The complexity ranges
from (undecidable and) recursively enumerable to highly undecidable, where the
recursively enumerable logics are obtained by considering substructures of
structures induced by topological spaces. As our undecidability results also
capture logics based on the real line, they improve upon undecidability results
for interval temporal logics by Halpern and Shoham. We also analyze modal
logics based on the five RCC5 relations, with similar results regarding the
expressive power, but weaker results regarding the complexity.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to address the question: Can an artificial neural
network (ANN) model be used as a possible characterization of the power of the
human mind? We will discuss what might be the relationship between such a model
and its natural counterpart. A possible characterization of the different power
capabilities of the mind is suggested in terms of the information contained (in
its computational complexity) or achievable by it. Such characterization takes
advantage of recent results based on natural neural networks (NNN) and the
computational power of arbitrary artificial neural networks (ANN). The possible
acceptance of neural networks as the model of the human mind's operation makes
the aforementioned quite relevant.

 <dc:description>  After a brief introduction to a new chaotic stream cipher Mmohocc which
utilizes the fundamental chaos characteristics of mixing, unpredictability, and
sensitivity to initial conditions, we conducted the randomness statistical
tests against the keystreams generated by the cipher. Two batteries of most
stringent randomness tests, namely the NIST Suite and the Diehard Suite, were
performed. The results showed that the keystreams have successfully passed all
the statistical tests. We conclude that Mmohocc can generate high-quality
pseudorandom numbers from a statistical point of view.

 <dc:title>Efficient Operation of Coded Packet Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lun, Desmond S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A fundamental problem faced in the design of almost all packet networks is
that of efficient operation--of reliably communicating given messages among
nodes at minimum cost in resource usage. We present a solution to the efficient
operation problem for coded packet networks, i.e., packet networks where the
contents of outgoing packets are arbitrary, causal functions of the contents of
received packets. Such networks are in contrast to conventional, routed packet
networks, where outgoing packets are restricted to being copies of received
packets and where reliability is provided by the use of retransmissions.
  This thesis introduces four considerations to coded packet networks: 1.
efficiency, 2. the lack of synchronization in packet networks, 3. the
possibility of broadcast links, and 4. packet loss. We take these
considerations and give a prescription for operation that is novel and general,
yet simple, useful, and extensible.

 <dc:title>Low Complexity Algorithms for Linear Recurrences</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider two kinds of problems: the computation of polynomial and rational
solutions of linear recurrences with coefficients that are polynomials with
integer coefficients; indefinite and definite summation of sequences that are
hypergeometric over the rational numbers. The algorithms for these tasks all
involve as an intermediate quantity an integer $N$ (dispersion or root of an
indicial polynomial) that is potentially exponential in the bit size of their
input. Previous algorithms have a bit complexity that is at least quadratic in
$N$. We revisit them and propose variants that exploit the structure of
solutions and avoid expanding polynomials of degree $N$. We give two
algorithms: a probabilistic one that detects the existence or absence of
nonzero polynomial and rational solutions in $O(\sqrt{N}\log^{2}N)$ bit
operations; a deterministic one that computes a compact representation of the
solution in $O(N\log^{3}N)$ bit operations. Similar speed-ups are obtained in
indefinite and definite hypergeometric summation. We describe the results of an
implementation.

 <dc:description>  A sequential updating scheme (SUS) for belief propagation (BP) decoding of
LDPC codes over Galois fields, $GF(q)$, and correlated Markov sources is
proposed, and compared with the standard parallel updating scheme (PUS). A
thorough experimental study of various transmission settings indicates that the
convergence rate, in iterations, of the BP algorithm (and subsequently its
complexity) for the SUS is about one half of that for the PUS, independent of
the finite field size $q$. Moreover, this 1/2 factor appears regardless of the
correlations of the source and the channel's noise model, while the error
correction performance remains unchanged. These results may imply on the
'universality' of the one half convergence speed-up of SUS decoding.

 <dc:description>  If a smooth, closed, and embedded curve is deformed along its normal vector
field at a rate proportional to its curvature, it shrinks to a circular point.
This curve evolution is called Euclidean curve shortening and the result is
known as the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson Theorem. Motivated by the rendezvous problem
for mobile autonomous robots, we address the problem of creating a polygon
shortening flow. A linear scheme is proposed that exhibits several analogues to
Euclidean curve shortening: The polygon shrinks to an elliptical point, convex
polygons remain convex, and the perimeter of the polygon is monotonically
decreasing.

 <dc:description>  This paper is motivated by a sensor network on a correlated field where
nearby sensors share information, and can thus assist rather than interfere
with one another. A special class of two-user Gaussian interference channels
(IFCs) is considered where one of the two transmitters knows both the messages
to be conveyed to the two receivers (called the IFC with degraded message
sets). Both achievability and converse arguments are provided for this scenario
for a class of discrete memoryless channels with weak interference. For the
case of the Gaussian weak interference channel with degraded message sets,
optimality of Gaussian inputs is also shown, resulting in the capacity region
of this channel.

 <dc:description>  Spartan Spatial Random Fields (SSRFs) are generalized Gibbs random fields,
equipped with a coarse-graining kernel that acts as a low-pass filter for the
fluctuations. SSRFs are defined by means of physically motivated spatial
interactions and a small set of free parameters (interaction couplings). This
paper focuses on the FGC-SSRF model, which is defined on the Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$ by means of interactions proportional to the squares of the
field realizations, as well as their gradient and curvature. The permissibility
criteria of FGC-SSRFs are extended by considering the impact of a
finite-bandwidth kernel. It is proved that the FGC-SSRFs are almost surely
differentiable in the case of finite bandwidth. Asymptotic explicit expressions
for the Spartan covariance function are derived for $d=1$ and $d=3$; both known
and new covariance functions are obtained depending on the value of the
FGC-SSRF shape parameter. Nonlinear dependence of the covariance integral scale
on the FGC-SSRF characteristic length is established, and it is shown that the
relation becomes linear asymptotically. The results presented in this paper are
useful in random field parameter inference, as well as in spatial interpolation
of irregularly-spaced samples.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a propositional encoding for lexicographic path orders
in connection with dependency pairs. This facilitates the application of SAT
solvers for termination analysis of term rewrite systems based on the
dependency pair method. We address two main inter-related issues and encode
them as satisfiability problems of propositional formulas that can be
efficiently handled by SAT solving: (1) the combined search for a lexicographic
path order together with an \emph{argument filtering} to orient a set of
inequalities; and (2) how the choice of the argument filtering influences the
set of inequalities that have to be oriented. We have implemented our
contributions in the termination prover AProVE. Extensive experiments show that
by our encoding and the application of SAT solvers one obtains speedups in
orders of magnitude as well as increased termination proving power.

channel is considered. Closed-form expressions for the mutual information
between the output and the input of this channel when the input magnitude
distribution is discrete and restricted to having two mass points are derived,
and it is subsequently shown how these expressions can be used to obtain
closed-form expressions for the capacity of this channel for signal to noise
ratio (SNR) values of up to approximately 0 dB, and a tight capacity lower
bound for SNR values between 0 dB and 10 dB. The expressions for the channel
capacity and its lower bound are given as functions of a parameter which can be

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of discrete universal filtering, in which the components of a
discrete signal emitted by an unknown source and corrupted by a known DMC are
to be causally estimated, is considered. A family of filters are derived, and
are shown to be universally asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving
the optimum filtering performance when the clean signal is stationary, ergodic,
and satisfies an additional mild positivity condition. Our schemes are
comprised of approximating the noisy signal using a hidden Markov process (HMP)
via maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation, followed by the use of the forward
recursions for HMP state estimation. It is shown that as the data length
increases, and as the number of states in the HMP approximation increases, our
family of filters attain the performance of the optimal distribution-dependent
filter.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of preemptive scheduling n jobs with given release times
on m identical parallel machines. The objective is to minimize the average flow
time. We show that when all jobs have equal processing times then the problem
can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming. Our algorithm can
also be applied to the open-shop problem with release times and unit processing
times. For the general case (when processing times are arbitrary), we show that
the problem is unary NP-hard.

 <dc:title>On the Capacity of Fading MIMO Broadcast Channels with Imperfect

 <dc:description>  A fading broadcast channel is considered where the transmitter employs two
antennas and each of the two receivers employs a single receive antenna. It is
demonstrated that even if the realization of the fading is precisely known to
the receivers, the high signal-to-noise (SNR) throughput is greatly reduced if,
rather than knowing the fading realization \emph{precisely}, the trasmitter
only knows the fading realization \emph{approximately}. The results are general
and are not limited to memoryless Gaussian fading.

 <dc:title>A Locating-First Approach for Scalable Overlay Multicast</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recent proposals in multicast overlay construction have demonstrated the
importance of exploiting underlying network topology. However, these
topology-aware proposals often rely on incremental and periodic refinements to
improve the system performance. These approaches are therefore neither
scalable, as they induce high communication cost due to refinement overhead,
nor efficient because long convergence time is necessary to obtain a stabilized
structure. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable locating algorithm that
gradually directs newcomers to their a set of their closest nodes without
inducing high overhead. On the basis of this locating process, we build a
robust and scalable topology-aware clustered hierarchical overlay scheme,
called LCC. We conducted both simulations and PlanetLab experiments to evaluate
the performance of LCC. Results show that the locating process entails modest
resources in terms of time and bandwidth. Moreover, LCC demonstrates promising
performance to support large scale multicast applications.

is our primary objective in the introduction of classical authentication inside
the three-stage protocol, we also benefit from the inherent advantages of the
chosen classical authentication protocol. We have tried to implement ideas like

 <dc:title>The Generalized Multiple Access Channel with Confidential Messages</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liang, Yingbin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Poor, H. Vincent</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A discrete memoryless generalized multiple access channel (GMAC) with
confidential messages is studied, where two users attempt to transmit common
information to a destination and each user also has private (confidential)
information intended for the destination. This channel generalizes the multiple
access channel (MAC) in that the two users also receive channel outputs. It is
assumed that each user views the other user as a wire-tapper, and wishes to
keep its confidential information as secret as possible from the other user.
The level of secrecy of the confidential information is measured by the
equivocation rate. The performance measure of interest is the rate-equivocation
tuple that includes the common rate, two private rates and two equivocation
rates as components. The set that includes all achievable rate-equivocation
tuples is referred to as the capacity-equivocation region. For the GMAC with
one confidential message set, where only one user (user 1) has private
(confidential) information for the destination, inner and outer bounds on the
capacity-equivocation region are derived. The secrecy capacity region is
established, which is the set of all achievable rates with user 2 being
perfectly ignorant of confidential messages of user 1. Furthermore, the
capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region are established
for the degraded GMAC with one confidential message set. For the GMAC with two
confidential message sets, where both users have confidential messages for the
destination, inner bounds on the capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy
capacity region are obtained.

 <dc:title>Upper Bounding the Performance of Arbitrary Finite LDPC Codes on Binary
  Erasure Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Poor, H. Vincent</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Assuming iterative decoding for binary erasure channels (BECs), a novel
tree-based technique for upper bounding the bit error rates (BERs) of
arbitrary, finite low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is provided and the
resulting bound can be evaluated for all operating erasure probabilities,
including both the waterfall and the error floor regions. This upper bound can
also be viewed as a narrowing search of stopping sets, which is an approach
different from the stopping set enumeration used for lower bounding the error
floor. When combined with optimal leaf-finding modules, this upper bound is
guaranteed to be tight in terms of the asymptotic order. The Boolean framework
proposed herein further admits a composite search for even tighter results. For
comparison, a refinement of the algorithm is capable of exhausting all stopping
sets of size &lt;14 for irregular LDPC codes of length n=500, which requires
approximately 1.67*10^25 trials if a brute force approach is taken. These
experiments indicate that this upper bound can be used both as an analytical
tool and as a deterministic worst-performance (error floor) guarantee, the
latter of which is crucial to optimizing LDPC codes for extremely low BER
applications, e.g., optical/satellite communications.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, random coding error exponents and cutoff rate are studied for
noncoherent Rician fading channels, where neither the receiver nor the
transmitter has channel side information. First, it is assumed that the input
is subject only to an average power constraint. In this case, a lower bound to
the random coding error exponent is considered and the optimal input achieving
this lower bound is shown to have a discrete amplitude and uniform phase. If
the input is subject to both average and peak power constraints, it is proven
that the optimal input achieving the random coding error exponent has again a
discrete nature. Finally, the cutoff rate is analyzed, and the optimality of
the single-mass input amplitude distribution in the low-power regime is
discussed.

 <dc:description>  Traffic analysis in Multi-hop Wireless Networks can expose the structure of
the network allowing attackers to focus their efforts on critical nodes. For
example, jamming the only data sink in a sensor network can cripple the
network. We propose a new communication protocol that is part of the MAC layer,
but resides conceptually between the routing layer and MAC, that is resilient
to traffic analysis. Each node broadcasts the data that it has to transmit
according to a fixed transmission schedule that is independent of the traffic
being generated, making the network immune to time correlation analysis. The
transmission pattern is identical, with the exception of a possible time shift,
at all nodes, removing spatial correlation of transmissions to network
strucutre. Data for all neighbors resides in the same encrypted packet. Each
neighbor then decides which subset of the data in a packet to forward onwards
using a routing protocol whose details are orthogonal to the proposed scheme.
We analyze the basic scheme, exploring the tradeoffs in terms of frequency of
transmission and packet size. We also explore adaptive and time changing
patterns and analyze their performance under a number of representative
scenarios.

 <dc:title>Aligned Virtual Coordinates for Greedy Routing in WSNs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Geographic routing provides relatively good performance at a much lower
overhead than conventional routing protocols such as AODV. However, the
performance of these protocols is impacted by physical voids, and localization
errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate systems (VCS) were proposed as an
alternative approach that is resilient to localization errors and that
naturally routes around physical voids. However, we show that VCS is vulnerable
to different forms of the void problem and the performance of greedy routing on
VCS is worse than that of geographic forwarding. We show that these anomalies
are due to the integral nature of VCS, which causes quantization noise in the
estimate of connectivity and node location. We propose an aligned virtual
coordinate system (AVCS) on which the greedy routing success can be
significantly improved. With our approach, and for the first time, we show that
greedy routing on VCS out-performs that on physical coordinate systems even in
the absence of localization errors. We compare AVCS against some of the most
popular geographical routing protocols both on physical coordinate system and
the virtual coordinate systems and show that AVCS significantly improves
performance over the best known solutions.

 <dc:title>Mathematica: A System of Computer Programs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Starting from the basic level of mathematica here we illustrate how to use a
mathematica notebook and write a program in the notebook. Next, we investigate
elaborately the way of linking of external programs with mathematica, so-called
the mathlink operation. Using this technique we can run very tedious jobs quite
efficiently, and the operations become extremely fast. Sometimes it is quite
desirable to run jobs in background of a computer which can take considerable
amount of time to finish, and this allows us to do work on other tasks, while
keeping the jobs running. The way of running jobs, written in a mathematica
notebook, in background is quite different from the conventional methods i.e.,
the techniques for the programs written in other languages like C, C++, F77,
F90, F95, etc. To illustrate it, in the present article we study how to create
a mathematica batch-file from a mathematica notebook and run it in the
background. Finally, we explore the most significant issue of this article.
Here we describe the basic ideas for parallelizing a mathematica program by
sharing its independent parts into all other remote computers available in the
network. Doing the parallelization, we can perform large computational
operations within a very short period of time, and therefore, the efficiency of
the numerical works can be achieved. Parallel computation supports any version
of mathematica and it also works significantly well even if different versions

 <dc:description>  We describe and analyze sparse graphical code constructions for the problems
of source coding with decoder side information (the Wyner-Ziv problem), and
channel coding with encoder side information (the Gelfand-Pinsker problem). Our
approach relies on a combination of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes and
low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes, and produces sparse constructions
that are simultaneously good as both source and channel codes. In particular,
we prove that under maximum likelihood encoding/decoding, there exist
low-density codes (i.e., with finite degrees) from our constructions that can
saturate both the Wyner-Ziv and Gelfand-Pinsker bounds.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate communication strategies for the multiple
access channel with feedback and correlated sources (MACFCS). The MACFCS models
a wireless sensor network scenario in which sensors distributed throughout an
arbitrary random field collect correlated measurements and transmit them to a
common sink. We derive achievable rate regions for the three-node MACFCS.
First, we study the strategy when source coding and channel coding are
combined, which we term full decoding at sources. Second, we look at several
strategies when source coding and channel coding are separated, which we term
full decoding at destination. From numerical computations on Gaussian channels,
we see that different strategies perform better under certain source
correlations and channel setups.

 <dc:title>The Capacity of the Single Source Multiple Relay Single Destination Mesh

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we derive the capacity of a special class of mesh networks. A
mesh network is defined as a heterogeneous wireless network in which the
transmission among power limited nodes is assisted by powerful relays, which
use the same wireless medium. We find the capacity of the mesh network when
there is one source, one destination, and multiple relays. We call this channel
the single source multiple relay single destination (SSMRSD) mesh network. Our
approach is as follows. We first look at an upper bound on the information
theoretic capacity of these networks in the Gaussian setting. We then show that
the bound is achievable asymptotically using the compress-forward strategy for
the multiple relay channel. Theoretically, the results indicate the value of
cooperation and the utility of carefully deployed relays in wireless ad-hoc and
sensor networks. The capacity characterization quantifies how the relays can be
used to either conserve node energy or to increase transmission rate.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a proof system for Hajek's logic BL based on a relational
hypersequents framework. We prove that the rules of our logical calculus,
called RHBL, are sound and invertible with respect to any valuation of BL into
a suitable algebra, called omega[0,1]. Refining the notion of reduction tree
that arises naturally from RHBL, we obtain a decision algorithm for BL
provability whose running time upper bound is 2^O(n), where n is the number of
connectives of the input formula. Moreover, if a formula is unprovable, we
exploit the constructiveness of a polynomial time algorithm for leaves validity
for providing a procedure to build countermodels in omega[0,1]. Finally, since
the size of the reduction tree branches is O(n^3), we can describe a polynomial
time verification algorithm for BL unprovability.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel differential space-time modulation (DSTM) scheme that is
single-symbol decodable and can provide full transmit diversity. It is the
first known singlesymbol- decodable DSTM scheme not based on Orthogonal STBC
(O-STBC), and it is constructed based on the recently proposed
Minimum-Decoding-Complexity Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code
(MDC-QOSTBC). We derive the code design criteria and present systematic
methodology to find the solution sets. The proposed DSTM scheme can provide
higher code rate than DSTM schemes based on O-STBC. Its decoding complexity is
also considerably lower than DSTM schemes based on Sp(2) and
double-symbol-decodable QOSTBC, with negligible or slight trade-off in decoding
error probability performance.

 <dc:description>  A Lyndon word is a non-empty word strictly smaller in the lexicographic order
than any of its suffixes, except itself and the empty word. In this paper, we
show how Lyndon words can be used in the distributed control of a set of n weak
mobile robots. By weak, we mean that the robots are anonymous, memoryless,
without any common sense of direction, and unable to communicate in an other
way than observation. An efficient and simple deterministic protocol to form a
regular n-gon is presented and proven for n prime.

 <dc:description>  We introduce knowledge flow analysis, a simple and flexible formalism for
checking cryptographic protocols. Knowledge flows provide a uniform language
for expressing the actions of principals, assump- tions about intruders, and
the properties of cryptographic primitives. Our approach enables a generalized
two-phase analysis: we extend the two-phase theory by identifying the necessary
and sufficient proper- ties of a broad class of cryptographic primitives for
which the theory holds. We also contribute a library of standard primitives and
show that they satisfy our criteria.

 <dc:title>Energy Efficiency in Multi-hop CDMA Networks: A Game Theoretic Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Betz, Sharon</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A game-theoretic analysis is used to study the effects of receiver choice on
the energy efficiency of multi-hop networks in which the nodes communicate
using Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA). A Nash
equilibrium of the game in which the network nodes can choose their receivers
as well as their transmit powers to maximize the total number of bits they
transmit per unit of energy is derived. The energy efficiencies resulting from
the use of different linear multiuser receivers in this context are compared,
looking at both the non-cooperative game and the Pareto optimal solution. For
analytical ease, particular attention is paid to asymptotically large networks.
Significant gains in energy efficiency are observed when multiuser receivers,
particularly the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver, are used
instead of conventional matched filter receivers.

 <dc:description>  An alphabetic binary tree formulation applies to problems in which an outcome
needs to be determined via alphabetically ordered search prior to the
termination of some window of opportunity. Rather than finding a decision tree
minimizing $\sum_{i=1}^n w(i) l(i)$, this variant involves minimizing $\log_a
\sum_{i=1}^n w(i) a^{l(i)}$ for a given $a \in (0,1)$. This note introduces a
dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal solution in polynomial
time and space, and shows that methods traditionally used to improve the speed
of optimizations in related problems, such as the Hu-Tucker procedure, fail for
this problem. This note thus also introduces two approximation algorithms which
can find a suboptimal solution in linear time (for one) or $\order(n \log n)$
time (for the other), with associated coding redundancy bounds.

 <dc:description>  The recovery of network structure from experimental data is a basic and
fundamental problem. Unfortunately, experimental data often do not directly
reveal structure due to inherent limitations such as imprecision in timing or
other observation mechanisms. We consider the problem of inferring network
structure in the form of a directed graph from co-occurrence observations. Each
observation arises from a transmission made over the network and indicates
which vertices carry the transmission without explicitly conveying their order
in the path. Without order information, there are an exponential number of
feasible graphs which agree with the observed data equally well. Yet, the basic
physical principles underlying most networks strongly suggest that all feasible
graphs are not equally likely. In particular, vertices that co-occur in many
observations are probably closely connected. Previous approaches to this
problem are based on ad hoc heuristics. We model the experimental observations
as independent realizations of a random walk on the underlying graph, subjected
to a random permutation which accounts for the lack of order information.
Treating the permutations as missing data, we derive an exact
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the random walk
parameters. For long transmission paths the exact E-step may be computationally
intractable, so we also describe an efficient Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm
and derive conditions which ensure convergence of the MCEM algorithm with high
probability. Simulations and experiments with Internet measurements demonstrate
the promise of this approach.

 <dc:description>  Modeling human dynamics responsible for the formation and evolution of the
so-called social networks - structures comprised of individuals or
organizations and indicating connectivities existing in a community - is a
topic recently attracting a significant research interest. It has been claimed
that these dynamics are scale-free in many practically important cases, such as
impersonal and personal communication, auctioning in a market, accessing sites
on the WWW, etc., and that human response times thus conform to the power law.
While a certain amount of progress has recently been achieved in predicting the
general response rate of a human population, existing formal theories of human
behavior can hardly be found satisfactory to accommodate and comprehensively
explain the scaling observed in social networks. In the presented study, a
novel system-theoretic modeling approach is proposed and successfully applied
to determine important characteristics of a communication network and to
analyze consumer behavior on the WWW.

 <dc:description>  Given a set of objects with durations (jobs) that cover a base region, can we
schedule the jobs to maximize the duration the original region remains covered?
We call this problem the sensor cover problem. This problem arises in the
context of covering a region with sensors. For example, suppose you wish to
monitor activity along a fence by sensors placed at various fixed locations.
Each sensor has a range and limited battery life. The problem is to schedule
when to turn on the sensors so that the fence is fully monitored for as long as
possible. This one dimensional problem involves intervals on the real line.
Associating a duration to each yields a set of rectangles in space and time,
each specified by a pair of fixed horizontal endpoints and a height. The
objective is to assign a position to each rectangle to maximize the height at
which the spanning interval is fully covered. We call this one dimensional
problem restricted strip covering. If we replace the covering constraint by a
packing constraint, the problem is identical to dynamic storage allocation, a
scheduling problem that is a restricted case of the strip packing problem. We
show that the restricted strip covering problem is NP-hard and present an O(log
log n)-approximation algorithm. We present better approximations or exact
algorithms for some special cases. For the uniform-duration case of restricted
strip covering we give a polynomial-time, exact algorithm but prove that the
uniform-duration case for higher-dimensional regions is NP-hard. Finally, we
consider regions that are arbitrary sets, and we present an O(log
n)-approximation algorithm.

 <dc:title>A Better Alternative to Piecewise Linear Time Series Segmentation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Time series are difficult to monitor, summarize and predict. Segmentation
organizes time series into few intervals having uniform characteristics
(flatness, linearity, modality, monotonicity and so on). For scalability, we
require fast linear time algorithms. The popular piecewise linear model can
determine where the data goes up or down and at what rate. Unfortunately, when
the data does not follow a linear model, the computation of the local slope
creates overfitting. We propose an adaptive time series model where the
polynomial degree of each interval vary (constant, linear and so on). Given a
number of regressors, the cost of each interval is its polynomial degree:
constant intervals cost 1 regressor, linear intervals cost 2 regressors, and so
on. Our goal is to minimize the Euclidean (l_2) error for a given model
complexity. Experimentally, we investigate the model where intervals can be
either constant or linear. Over synthetic random walks, historical stock market
prices, and electrocardiograms, the adaptive model provides a more accurate
segmentation than the piecewise linear model without increasing the
cross-validation error or the running time, while providing a richer vocabulary
to applications. Implementation issues, such as numerical stability and
real-world performance, are discussed.

 <dc:description>  We consider, as a means of making programming languages more flexible and
powerful, a parsing algorithm in which the parser may freely modify the grammar
while parsing. We are particularly interested in a modification of the
canonical LR(1) parsing algorithm in which, after the reduction of certain
productions, we examine the source sentence seen so far to determine the
grammar to use to continue parsing. A naive modification of the canonical LR(1)
parsing algorithm along these lines cannot be guaranteed to halt; as a result,
we develop a test which examines the grammar as it changes, stopping the parse
if the grammar changes in a way that would invalidate earlier assumptions made
by the parser. With this test in hand, we can develop our parsing algorithm and
prove that it is correct. That being done, we turn to earlier, related work;
the idea of programming languages which can be extended to include new
syntactic constructs has existed almost as long as the idea of high-level
programming languages. Early efforts to construct such a programming language
were hampered by an immature theory of formal languages. More recent efforts to
construct transformative languages relied either on an inefficient chain of
source-to-source translators; or they have a defect, present in our naive
parsing algorithm, in that they cannot be known to halt. The present algorithm
does not have these undesirable properties, and as such, it should prove a
useful foundation for a new kind of programming language.

 <dc:description>  An outer bound to the capacity region of the two-receiver discrete memoryless
broadcast channel is given. The outer bound is tight for all cases where the
capacity region is known. When specialized to the case of no common
information, this outer bound is contained in the Korner-Marton outer bound.
This containment is shown to be strict for the binary skew-symmetric broadcast
channel. Thus, this outer bound is in general tighter than all other known
outer bounds on the discrete memoryless broadcast channel.

 <dc:description>  Fuzzy {\it discrete event systems} (DESs) were proposed recently by Lin and
Ying [19], which may better cope with the real-world problems with fuzziness,
impreciseness, and subjectivity such as those in biomedicine. As a continuation
of [19], in this paper we further develop fuzzy DESs by dealing with
supervisory control of fuzzy DESs. More specifically, (i) we reformulate the
parallel composition of crisp DESs, and then define the parallel composition of
fuzzy DESs that is equivalent to that in [19]; {\it max-product} and {\it
max-min} automata for modeling fuzzy DESs are considered; (ii) we deal with a
number of fundamental problems regarding supervisory control of fuzzy DESs,
particularly demonstrate controllability theorem and nonblocking
controllability theorem of fuzzy DESs, and thus present the conditions for the
existence of supervisors in fuzzy DESs; (iii) we analyze the complexity for
presenting a uniform criterion to test the fuzzy controllability condition of
fuzzy DESs modeled by max-product automata; in particular, we present in detail
a general computing method for checking whether or not the fuzzy
controllability condition holds, if max-min automata are used to model fuzzy
DESs, and by means of this method we can search for all possible fuzzy states
reachable from initial fuzzy state in max-min automata; also, we introduce the
fuzzy $n$-controllability condition for some practical problems; (iv) a number
of examples serving to illustrate the applications of the derived results and
methods are described; some basic properties related to supervisory control of
fuzzy DESs are investigated. To conclude, some related issues are raised for
further consideration.

 <dc:description>  In order to more effectively cope with the real-world problems of vagueness,
impreciseness, and subjectivity, fuzzy discrete event systems (FDESs) were
proposed recently. Notably, FDESs have been applied to biomedical control for
HIV/AIDS treatment planning and sensory information processing for robotic
control. Qiu, Cao and Ying independently developed supervisory control theory
of FDESs. We note that the controllability of events in Qiu's work is fuzzy but
the observability of events is crisp, and, the observability of events in Cao
and Ying's work is also crisp although the controllability is not completely
crisp since the controllable events can be disabled with any degrees. Motivated
by the necessity to consider the situation that the events may be observed or
controlled with some membership degrees, in this paper, we establish the
supervisory control theory of FDESs with partial observations, in which both
the observability and controllability of events are fuzzy instead. We formalize
the notions of fuzzy controllability condition and fuzzy observability
condition. And Controllability and Observability Theorem of FDESs is set up in
a more generic framework. In particular, we present a detailed computing flow
to verify whether the controllability and observability conditions hold. Thus,
this result can decide the existence of supervisors. Also, we use this
computing method to check the existence of supervisors in the Controllability
and Observability Theorem of classical discrete event systems (DESs), which is
a new method and different from classical case. A number of examples are
elaborated on to illustrate the presented results.

{\it fuzzy discrete event systems} (FDESs) were proposed recently, and the
supervisory control theory of FDESs was developed. In view of the importance of
failure diagnosis, in this paper, we present an approach of the failure
diagnosis in the framework of FDESs. More specifically: (1) We formalize the
definition of diagnosability for FDESs, in which the observable set and failure
set of events are {\it fuzzy}, that is, each event has certain degree to be
observable and unobservable, and, also, each event may possess different
possibility of failure occurring. (2) Through the construction of
observability-based diagnosers of FDESs, we investigate its some basic
properties. In particular, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for
diagnosability of FDESs. (3) Some examples serving to illuminate the
applications of the diagnosability of FDESs are described. To conclude, some
related issues are raised for further consideration.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge flow analysis offers a simple and flexible way to find flaws in
security protocols. A protocol is described by a collection of rules
constraining the propagation of knowledge amongst principals. Because this
characterization corresponds closely to informal descriptions of protocols, it
allows a succinct and natural formalization; because it abstracts away message
ordering, and handles communications between principals and applications of
cryptographic primitives uniformly, it is readily represented in a standard
logic. A generic framework in the Alloy modelling language is presented, and
instantiated for two standard protocols, and a new key management scheme.

 <dc:description>  The peer-review process, in its present form, has been repeatedly criticized.
Of the many critiques ranging from publication delays to referee bias, this
paper will focus specifically on the issue of how submitted manuscripts are
distributed to qualified referees. Unqualified referees, without the proper
knowledge of a manuscript's domain, may reject a perfectly valid study or
potentially more damaging, unknowingly accept a faulty or fraudulent result. In
this paper, referee competence is analyzed with respect to referee bid data
collected from the 2005 Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL). The
analysis of the referee bid behavior provides a validation of the intuition
that referees are bidding on conference submissions with regards to the subject
domain of the submission. Unfortunately, this relationship is not strong and
therefore suggests that there exists other factors beyond subject domain that
may be influencing referees to bid for particular submissions.

 <dc:description>  The peer-review process is the most widely accepted certification mechanism
for officially accepting the written results of researchers within the
scientific community. An essential component of peer-review is the
identification of competent referees to review a submitted manuscript. This
article presents an algorithm to automatically determine the most appropriate
reviewers for a manuscript by way of a co-authorship network data structure and
a relative-rank particle-swarm algorithm. This approach is novel in that it is
not limited to a pre-selected set of referees, is computationally efficient,
requires no human-intervention, and, in some instances, can automatically
identify conflict of interest situations. A useful application of this
algorithm would be to open commentary peer-review systems because it provides a
weighting for each referee with respects to their expertise in the domain of a
manuscript. The algorithm is validated using referee bid data from the 2005
Joint Conference on Digital Libraries.

 <dc:title>An Architecture for the Aggregation and Analysis of Scholarly Usage Data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Although recording of usage data is common in scholarly information services,
its exploitation for the creation of value-added services remains limited due
to concerns regarding, among others, user privacy, data validity, and the lack
of accepted standards for the representation, sharing and aggregation of usage
data. This paper presents a technical, standards-based architecture for sharing
usage information, which we have designed and implemented. In this
architecture, OpenURL-compliant linking servers aggregate usage information of
a specific user community as it navigates the distributed information
environment that it has access to. This usage information is made OAI-PMH
harvestable so that usage information exposed by many linking servers can be
aggregated to facilitate the creation of value-added services with a reach
beyond that of a single community or a single information service. This paper
also discusses issues that were encountered when implementing the proposed
approach, and it presents preliminary results obtained from analyzing a usage
data set containing about 3,500,000 requests aggregated by a federation of
linking servers at the California State University system over a 20 month
period.

 <dc:description>  We consider distillation of secret bits from partially secret noisy
correlations P_ABE, shared between two honest parties and an eavesdropper. The
most studied distillation scenario consists of joint operations on a large
number of copies of the distribution (P_ABE)^N, assisted with public
communication. Here we consider distillation with only one copy of the
distribution, and instead of rates, the 'quality' of the distilled secret bits
is optimized, where the 'quality' is quantified by the secret-bit fraction of
the result. The secret-bit fraction of a binary distribution is the proportion
which constitutes a secret bit between Alice and Bob. With local operations and
public communication the maximal extractable secret-bit fraction from a
distribution P_ABE is found, and is denoted by Lambda[P_ABE]. This quantity is
shown to be nonincreasing under local operations and public communication, and
nondecreasing under eavesdropper's local operations: it is a secrecy monotone.
It is shown that if Lambda[P_ABE]&gt;1/2 then P_ABE is distillable, thus providing
a sufficient condition for distillability. A simple expression for
Lambda[P_ABE] is found when the eavesdropper is decoupled, and when the honest
parties' information is binary and the local operations are reversible.
Intriguingly, for general distributions the (optimal) operation requires local
degradation of the data.

 <dc:title>Optimal Distortion-Power Tradeoffs in Gaussian Sensor Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Nan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ulukus, Sennur</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate the optimal performance of dense sensor networks by studying
the joint source-channel coding problem. The overall goal of the sensor network
is to take measurements from an underlying random process, code and transmit
those measurement samples to a collector node in a cooperative multiple access
channel with imperfect feedback, and reconstruct the entire random process at
the collector node. We provide lower and upper bounds for the minimum
achievable expected distortion when the underlying random process is Gaussian.
In the case where the random process satisfies some general conditions, we
evaluate the lower and upper bounds explicitly and show that they are of the
same order for a wide range of sum power constraints. Thus, for these random
processes, under these sum power constraints, we determine the achievability
scheme that is order-optimal, and express the minimum achievable expected
distortion as a function of the sum power constraint.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Precoding with block diagonalization is an attractive scheme for approaching
sum capacity in multiuser multiple input multiple output (MIMO) broadcast
channels. This method requires either global channel state information at every
receiver or an additional training phase, which demands additional system
planning. In this paper we propose a lattice based multi-user precoder that
uses block diagonalization combined with pre-equalization and perturbation for
the multiuser MIMO broadcast channel. An achievable sum rate of the proposed
scheme is derived and used to show that the proposed technique approaches the
achievable sum rate of block diagonalization with water-filling but does not
require the additional information at the receiver. Monte Carlo simulations
with equal power allocation show that the proposed method provides better bit
error rate and diversity performance than block diagonalization with a
zero-forcing receiver. Additionally, the proposed method shows similar
performance to the maximum likelihood receiver but with much lower receiver
complexity.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the systematic use of product feedback information to
support life-cycle design approaches and provides guidelines for developing a
design at both the product and the system levels. Design activities are
surveyed in the light of the product life cycle, and the design information
flow is interpreted from a semiotic perspective. The natural evolution of a
design is considered, the notion of design expectations is introduced, and the
importance of evaluation of these expectations in dynamic environments is
argued. Possible strategies for reconciliation of the expectations and
environmental factors are described. An Internet-enabled technology is proposed
to monitor product functionality, usage, and operational environment and supply
the designer with relevant information. A pilot study of assessing design
expectations of a refrigerator is outlined, and conclusions are drawn.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents results of an ongoing interdisciplinary study to develop
a computational theory of creativity for engineering design. Human design
activities are surveyed, and popular computer-aided design methodologies are
examined. It is argued that semiotics has the potential to merge and unite
various design approaches into one fundamental theory that is naturally
interpretable and so comprehensible in terms of computer use. Reviewing related
work in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science provides a general and
encompassing vision of the creativity phenomenon. Basic notions of algebraic
semiotics are given and explained in terms of design. This is to define a model
of the design creative process, which is seen as a process of semiosis, where
concepts and their attributes represented as signs organized into systems are
evolved, blended, and analyzed, resulting in the development of new concepts.
The model allows us to formally describe and investigate essential properties
of the design process, namely its dynamics and non-determinism inherent in
creative thinking. A stable pattern of creative thought - analogical and
metaphorical reasoning - is specified to demonstrate the expressive power of
the modeling approach; illustrative examples are given. The developed theory is
applied to clarify the nature of emergence in design: it is shown that while
emergent properties of a product may influence its creative value, emergence
can simply be seen as a by-product of the creative process. Concluding remarks
summarize the research, point to some unresolved issues, and outline directions
for future work.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the concept of digital city. First, a functional
analysis of a digital city is made in the light of the modern study of
urbanism; similarities between the virtual and urban constructions are pointed
out. Next, a semiotic perspective on the subject matter is elaborated, and a
terminological basis is introduced to treat a digital city as a self-organizing
meaning-producing system intended to support social or spatial navigation. An
explicit definition of a digital city is formulated. Finally, the proposed
approach is discussed, conclusions are given, and future work is outlined.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we explore two approaches to modeling hypermedia-based
communication. It is argued that the classical conveyor-tube framework is not
applicable to the case of computer- and Internet- mediated communication. We
then present a simple but very general system-theoretic model of the
communication process, propose its mathematical interpretation, and derive
several formulas, which qualitatively and quantitatively accord with data
obtained on-line. The devised theoretical results generalize and correct the
Zipf-Mandelbrot law and can be used in information system design. At the
paper's end, we give some conclusions and draw implications for future work.

 <dc:title>Classification of Ordinal Data</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cardoso, Jaime S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Classification of ordinal data is one of the most important tasks of relation
learning. In this thesis a novel framework for ordered classes is proposed. The
technique reduces the problem of classifying ordered classes to the standard
two-class problem. The introduced method is then mapped into support vector
machines and neural networks. Compared with a well-known approach using
pairwise objects as training samples, the new algorithm has a reduced
complexity and training time. A second novel model, the unimodal model, is also
introduced and a parametric version is mapped into neural networks. Several
case studies are presented to assert the validity of the proposed models.

 <dc:description>  SPARQL is the W3C candidate recommendation query language for RDF. In this
paper we address systematically the formal study of SPARQL, concentrating in
its graph pattern facility. We consider for this study a fragment without
literals and a simple version of filters which encompasses all the main issues
yet is simple to formalize. We provide a compositional semantics, prove there
are normal forms, prove complexity bounds, among others that the evaluation of
SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete, compare our semantics to an alternative
operational semantics, give simple and natural conditions when both semantics
coincide and discuss optimizations procedures.

The method uses the Buchberger algorithm rather than current traditional
methods based on search algorithms. We restrict the analysis to a single

is illustrated with the design of a simple arithmetic and logic unit with two
3-bit operands and two control bits.

 <dc:title>Power-aware scheduling for makespan and flow</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bunde, David P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider offline scheduling algorithms that incorporate speed scaling to
address the bicriteria problem of minimizing energy consumption and a
scheduling metric. For makespan, we give linear-time algorithms to compute all
non-dominated solutions for the general uniprocessor problem and for the
multiprocessor problem when every job requires the same amount of work. We also
show that the multiprocessor problem becomes NP-hard when jobs can require
different amounts of work.
  For total flow, we show that the optimal flow corresponding to a particular
energy budget cannot be exactly computed on a machine supporting arithmetic and
the extraction of roots. This hardness result holds even when scheduling
equal-work jobs on a uniprocessor. We do, however, extend previous work by
Pruhs et al. to give an arbitrarily-good approximation for scheduling
equal-work jobs on a multiprocessor.

 <dc:description>  Computer-assisted reading and analysis of text has various applications in
the humanities and social sciences. The increasing size of many electronic text
archives has the advantage of a more complete analysis but the disadvantage of
taking longer to obtain results. On-Line Analytical Processing is a method used
to store and quickly analyze multidimensional data. By storing text analysis
information in an OLAP system, a user can obtain solutions to inquiries in a
matter of seconds as opposed to minutes, hours, or even days. This analysis is
user-driven allowing various users the freedom to pursue their own direction of
research.

 <dc:title>An Outer Bound for the Multi-Terminal Rate-Distortion Region</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The multi-terminal rate-distortion problem has been studied extensively.
Notably, among these, Tung and Housewright have provided the best known inner
and outer bounds for the rate region under certain distortion constraints. In
this paper, we first propose an outer bound for the rate region, and show that
it is tighter than the outer bound of Tung and Housewright. Our outer bound
involves some $n$-letter Markov chain constraints, which cause computational
difficulties. We utilize a necessary condition for the Markov chain constraints
to obtain another outer bound, which is represented in terms of some
single-letter mutual information expressions evaluated over probability
distributions that satisfy some single-letter conditions.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a thermodynamic (large deviation) formalism for computing error

 <dc:description>  Regularization functionals that lower level set boundary length when used
with L^1 fidelity functionals on signal de-noising on images create artifacts.
These are (i) rounding of corners, (ii) shrinking of radii, (iii) shrinking of
cusps, and (iv) non-smoothing of staircasing. Regularity functionals based upon
total curvature of level set boundaries do not create artifacts (i) and (ii).
An adjusted fidelity term based on the flat norm on the current (a
distributional graph) representing the density of curvature of level sets
boundaries can minimize (iii) by weighting the position of a cusp. A regularity
term to eliminate staircasing can be based upon the mass of the current
representing the graph of an image function or its second derivatives.
Densities on the Grassmann bundle of the Grassmann bundle of the ambient space
of the graph can be used to identify patterns, textures, occlusion and lines.

 <dc:description>  We propose a notion of a stable partition in a coalitional game that is
parametrized by the concept of a defection function. This function assigns to
each partition of the grand coalition a set of different coalition arrangements
for a group of defecting players. The alternatives are compared using their
social welfare. We characterize the stability of a partition for a number of
most natural defection functions and investigate whether and how so defined
stable partitions can be reached from any initial partition by means of simple
transformations. The approach is illustrated by analyzing an example in which a
set of stores seeks an optimal transportation arrangement.

 <dc:title>Efficient Route Tracing from a Single Source</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Friedman, Benoit Donnet Philippe Raoult Timur</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traceroute is a networking tool that allows one to discover the path that
packets take from a source machine, through the network, to a destination
machine. It is widely used as an engineering tool, and also as a scientific
tool, such as for discovery of the network topology at the IP level. In prior
work, authors on this technical report have shown how to improve the efficiency
of route tracing from multiple cooperating monitors. However, it is not unusual
for a route tracing monitor to operate in isolation. Somewhat different
strategies are required for this case, and this report is the first systematic
study of those requirements. Standard traceroute is inefficient when used
repeatedly towards multiple destinations, as it repeatedly probes the same
interfaces close to the source. Others have recognized this inefficiency and
have proposed tracing backwards from the destinations and stopping probing upon
encounter with a previously-seen interface. One of this technical report's
contributions is to quantify for the first time the efficiency of this
approach. Another contribution is to describe the effect of non-responding
destinations on this efficiency. Since a large portion of destination machines
do not reply to probe packets, backwards probing from the destination is often
infeasible. We propose an algorithm to tackle non-responding destinations, and
we find that our algorithm can strongly decrease probing redundancy at the cost
of a small reduction in node and link discovery.

 <dc:description>  This paper revisits the issue of route discovery in dynamic source routing
(DSR) for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and puts forward a proposal of a
lightweight non-optimal route suppression technique based on the observation of
a rarely noted but commonly occurring phenomenon in route discovery. The
technique exploits the observed phenomenon to extract query state information
that permits intermediate nodes to identify and suppress the initiation of
route replies with non-optimal routes, even if the route query is received for
the first time. A detailed evaluation of DSR with non-optimal route suppression
is found to yield significant improvements in both protocol efficiency and
performance.

 <dc:title>On the Role of Estimate-and-Forward with Time-Sharing in Cooperative

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we focus on the general relay channel. We investigate the
application of estimate-and-forward (EAF) to different scenarios. Specifically,
we consider assignments of the auxiliary random variables that always satisfy
the feasibility constraints. We first consider the multiple relay channel and
obtain an achievable rate without decoding at the relays. We demonstrate the
benefits of this result via an explicit discrete memoryless multiple relay
scenario where multi-relay EAF is superior to multi-relay decode-and-forward
(DAF). We then consider the Gaussian relay channel with coded modulation, where
we show that a three-level quantization outperforms the Gaussian quantization
commonly used to evaluate the achievable rates in this scenario. Finally we
consider the cooperative general broadcast scenario with a multi-step
conference. We apply estimate-and-forward to obtain a general multi-step
achievable rate region. We then give an explicit assignment of the auxiliary
random variables, and use this result to obtain an explicit expression for the
single common message broadcast scenario with a two-step conference.

 <dc:title>Capacity Results for Block-Stationary Gaussian Fading Channels with a
  Peak Power Constraint</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Jun</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a peak-power-limited single-antenna block-stationary Gaussian
fading channel where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel
state information, but both know the channel statistics. This model subsumes
most previously studied Gaussian fading models. We first compute the asymptotic
channel capacity in the high SNR regime and show that the behavior of channel
capacity depends critically on the channel model. For the special case where
the fading process is symbol-by-symbol stationary, we also reveal a fundamental
interplay between the codeword length, communication rate, and decoding error
probability. Specifically, we show that the codeword length must scale with SNR
in order to guarantee that the communication rate can grow logarithmically with
SNR with bounded decoding error probability, and we find a necessary condition
for the growth rate of the codeword length. We also derive an expression for
the capacity per unit energy. Furthermore, we show that the capacity per unit
energy is achievable using temporal ON-OFF signaling with optimally allocated
ON symbols, where the optimal ON-symbol allocation scheme may depend on the
peak power constraint.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Algebraic immunity has been proposed as an important property of Boolean
functions. To resist algebraic attack, a Boolean function should possess high
algebraic immunity. It is well known now that the algebraic immunity of an
$n$-variable Boolean function is upper bounded by $\left\lceil {\frac{n}{2}}
\right\rceil $. In this paper, for an odd integer $n$, we present a
construction method which can efficiently generate a Boolean function of $n$
variables with maximum algebraic immunity, and we also show that any such
function can be generated by this method. Moreover, the number of such Boolean
functions is greater than $2^{2^{n-1}}$.

 <dc:description>  The Tutte polynomial of a graph G is a two-variable polynomial T(G;x,y) that
encodes many interesting properties of the graph. We study the complexity of
the following problem, for rationals x and y: take as input a graph G, and
output a value which is a good approximation to T(G;x,y). Jaeger, Vertigan and
Welsh have completely mapped the complexity of exactly computing the Tutte
polynomial. They have shown that this is #P-hard, except along the hyperbola
(x-1)(y-1)=1 and at four special points. We are interested in determining for
which points (x,y) there is a &quot;fully polynomial randomised approximation
scheme&quot; (FPRAS) for T(G;x,y). Under the assumption RP is not equal to NP, we
prove that there is no FPRAS at (x,y) if (x,y) is in one of the half-planes
x&lt;-1 or y&lt;-1 (excluding the easy-to-compute cases mentioned above). Two
exceptions to this result are the half-line x&lt;-1, y=1 (which is still open) and
the portion of the hyperbola (x-1)(y-1)=2 corresponding to y&lt;-1 which we show
to be equivalent in difficulty to approximately counting perfect matchings. We
give further intractability results for (x,y) in the vicinity of the origin. A
corollary of our results is that, under the assumption RP is not equal to NP,
there is no FPRAS at the point (x,y)=(0,1--lambda) when \lambda&gt;2 is a positive
integer. Thus there is no FPRAS for counting nowhere-zero \lambda flows for
\lambda&gt;2. This is an interesting consequence of our work since the
corresponding decision problem is in P for example for \lambda=6.

 <dc:title>General Compact Labeling Schemes for Dynamic Trees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Korman, Amos</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $F$ be a function on pairs of vertices. An {\em $F$- labeling scheme} is
composed of a {\em marker} algorithm for labeling the vertices of a graph with
short labels, coupled with a {\em decoder} algorithm allowing one to compute
$F(u,v)$ of any two vertices $u$ and $v$ directly from their labels. As
applications for labeling schemes concern mainly large and dynamically changing
networks, it is of interest to study {\em distributed dynamic} labeling
schemes. This paper investigates labeling schemes for dynamic trees.
  This paper presents a general method for constructing labeling schemes for
dynamic trees. Our method is based on extending an existing {\em static} tree
labeling scheme to the dynamic setting. This approach fits many natural
functions on trees, such as ancestry relation, routing (in both the adversary
and the designer port models), nearest common ancestor etc.. Our resulting
dynamic schemes incur overheads (over the static scheme) on the label size and
on the communication complexity. Informally, for any function $k(n)$ and any
static $F$-labeling scheme on trees, we present an $F$-labeling scheme on
dynamic trees incurring multiplicative overhead factors
  (over the static scheme) of $O(\log_{k(n)} n)$ on the label size and
$O(k(n)\log_{k(n)} n)$ on the amortized message complexity. In particular, by
setting $k(n)=n^{\epsilon}$ for any $0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1$, we obtain dynamic labeling
schemes with asymptotically optimal label sizes and sublinear amortized message
complexity for all the above mentioned functions.

 <dc:description>  The systems supporting signal and image applications process large amount of
data. That involves an intensive use of the memory which becomes the bottleneck
of systems. Memory limits performances and represents a significant proportion
of total consumption. In the development high level synthesis tool called GAUT
Low Power, we are interested in the synthesis of the memory unit. In this work,
we integrate the data storage and data transfert to constraint the high level
synthesis of the datapath's execution unit.

 <dc:description>  To transcribe speech, automatic speech recognition systems use statistical
methods, particularly hidden Markov model and N-gram models. Although these
techniques perform well and lead to efficient systems, they approach their
maximum possibilities. It seems thus necessary, in order to outperform current
results, to use additional information, especially bound to language. However,
introducing such knowledge must be realized taking into account specificities
of spoken language (hesitations for example) and being robust to possible
misrecognized words. This document presents a state of the art of these
researches, evaluating the impact of the insertion of linguistic information on
the quality of the transcription.

 <dc:title>Tight Bounds for the Min-Max Boundary Decomposition Cost of Weighted

 <dc:description>  Many load balancing problems that arise in scientific computing applications
ask to partition a graph with weights on the vertices and costs on the edges
into a given number of almost equally-weighted parts such that the maximum
boundary cost over all parts is small.
  Here, this partitioning problem is considered for bounded-degree graphs
G=(V,E) with edge costs c: E-&gt;R+ that have a p-separator theorem for some p&gt;1,
i.e., any (arbitrarily weighted) subgraph of G can be separated into two parts
of roughly the same weight by removing a vertex set S such that the edges
incident to S in the subgraph have total cost at most proportional to (SUM_e
c^p_e)^(1/p), where the sum is over all edges e in the subgraph.
  We show for all positive integers k and weights w that the vertices of G can
be partitioned into k parts such that the weight of each part differs from the
average weight by less than MAX{w_v; v in V}, and the boundary edges of each
part have cost at most proportional to (SUM_e c_e^p/k)^(1/p) + MAX_e c_e. The
partition can be computed in time nearly proportional to the time for computing
a separator S of G.
  Our upper bound on the boundary costs is shown to be tight up to a constant
factor for infinitely many instances with a broad range of parameters. Previous
results achieved this bound only if one has c=1, w=1, and one allows parts with
weight exceeding the average by a constant fraction.

 <dc:description>  One vision of future wireless networks is that they will be deeply integrated
and embedded in our lives and will involve the use of personalized mobile
devices. User behavior in such networks is bound to affect the network
performance. It is imperative to study and characterize the fundamental
structure of wireless user behavior in order to model, manage, leverage and
design efficient mobile networks. It is also important to make such study as
realistic as possible, based on extensive measurements collected from existing
deployed wireless networks.
  In this study, using our systematic TRACE approach, we analyze wireless
users' behavioral patterns by extensively mining wireless network logs from two
major university campuses. We represent the data using location preference
vectors, and utilize unsupervised learning (clustering) to classify trends in
user behavior using novel similarity metrics. Matrix decomposition techniques
are used to identify (and differentiate between) major patterns. While our
findings validate intuitive repetitive behavioral trends and user grouping, it
is surprising to find the qualitative commonalities of user behaviors from the
two universities. We discover multi-modal user behavior for more than 60% of
the users, and there are hundreds of distinct groups with unique behavioral
patterns in both campuses. The sizes of the major groups follow a power-law
distribution. Our methods and findings provide an essential step towards
network management and behavior-aware network protocols and applications, to
name a few.

 <dc:description>  A plethora of diverse aspect mechanisms exist today, all of which integrate
concerns into artifacts that exhibit crosscutting structure. What we lack and
need is a characterization of the design space that these aspect mechanisms
inhabit and a model description of their weaving processes. A good design space
representation provides a common framework for understanding and evaluating
existing mechanisms. A well-understood model of the weaving process can guide
the implementor of new aspect mechanisms. It can guide the designer when
mechanisms implementing new kinds of weaving are needed. It can also help teach
aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In this paper we present and evaluate such a
model of the design space for aspect mechanisms and their weaving processes. We
model weaving, at an abstract level, as a concern integration process. We
derive a weaving process model (WPM) top-down, differentiating a reactive from
a nonreactive process. The model provides an in-depth explanation of the key
subpro existing aspect mechanisms.

of simulation systems for manufacturing system design. General requirements on
manufacturing simulators are formulated and a framework to address the
requirements is suggested. Problems of information representation as an
activity underlying simulation are considered. This is to form the necessary
mathematical foundation for manufacturing simulations. The theoretical findings
are explored through a pilot study. A conclusion about the suitability of the
suggested approach to the development of simulation systems for manufacturing
system design is made, and implications for future research are described.

 <dc:description>  In the context of ambient networks where each small device must trust its
neighborhood rather than a fixed network, we propose in this paper a
\textit{trust management framework} inspired by known social patterns and based
on the following statements: each mobile constructs itself a local level of
trust what means that it does not accept recommendation by other peers, and the
only relevant parameter, beyond some special cases discussed later, to evaluate
the level of trust is the number of common trusted mobiles. These trusted
mobiles are considered as entries in a local database called history for each
device and we use identity-based cryptography to ensure strong security:
history must be a non-tansferable object.

 <dc:description>  A number of serious reasons will convince an increasing amount of researchers
to store their relevant material in centers which we will call &quot;language
resource archives&quot;. They combine the duty of taking care of long-term
preservation as well as the task to give access to their material to different
user groups. Access here is meant in the sense that an active interaction with
the data will be made possible to support the integration of new data, new
versions or commentaries of all sort. Modern Language Resource Archives will
have to adhere to a number of basic principles to fulfill all requirements and
they will have to be involved in federations to create joint language resource
domains making it even more simple for the researchers to access the data. This
paper makes an attempt to formulate the essential pillars language resource
archives have to adhere to.

 <dc:description>  We have developed (1) a graph visualization system that allows users to
explore graphs by viewing them as a succession of spanning trees selected
interactively, (2) a radial graph layout algorithm, and (3) an animation
algorithm that generates meaningful visualizations and smooth transitions
between graphs while minimizing edge crossings during transitions and in static
layouts.
  Our system is similar to the radial layout system of Yee et al. (2001), but
differs primarily in that each node is positioned on a coordinate system
centered on its own parent rather than on a single coordinate system for all
nodes. Our system is thus easy to define recursively and lends itself to
parallelization. It also guarantees that layouts have many nice properties,
such as: it guarantees certain edges never cross during an animation.
  We compared the layouts and transitions produced by our algorithms to those
produced by Yee et al. Results from several experiments indicate that our
system produces fewer edge crossings during transitions between graph drawings,
and that the transitions more often involve changes in local scaling rather
than structure.
  These findings suggest the system has promise as an interactive graph
exploration tool in a variety of settings.

 <dc:description>  We present the results of a feasibility study using shared, existing,
network-accessible infrastructure for repository replication. We investigate
how dissemination of repository contents can be ``piggybacked'' on top of
existing email and Usenet traffic. Long-term persistence of the replicated
repository may be achieved thanks to current policies and procedures which
ensure that mail messages and news posts are retrievable for evidentiary and
other legal purposes for many years after the creation date. While the
preservation issues of migration and emulation are not addressed with this
approach, it does provide a simple method of refreshing content with unknown
partners.

 <dc:title>The Consequences of Eliminating NP Solutions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Given a function based on the computation of an NP machine, can one in
general eliminate some solutions? That is, can one in general decrease the
ambiguity? This simple question remains, even after extensive study by many
researchers over many years, mostly unanswered. However, complexity-theoretic
consequences and enabling conditions are known. In this tutorial-style article
we look at some of those, focusing on the most natural framings: reducing the
number of solutions of NP functions, refining the solutions of NP functions,
and subtracting from or otherwise shrinking #P functions. We will see how small
advice strings are important here, but we also will see how increasing advice
size to achieve robustness is central to the proof of a key ambiguity-reduction
result for NP functions.

 <dc:description>  Propagation criterion of degree $l$ and order $k$ ($PC(l)$ of order $k$) and
resiliency of vectorial Boolean functions are important for cryptographic
purpose (see [1, 2, 3,6, 7,8,10,11,16]. Kurosawa, Stoh [8] and Carlet [1] gave
a construction of Boolean functions satisfying $PC(l)$ of order $k$ from binary
linear or nonlinear codes in. In this paper, algebraic-geometric codes over
$GF(2^m)$ are used to modify Carlet and Kurosawa-Satoh's construction for
giving vectorial resilient Boolean functions satisfying $PC(l)$ of order $k$.
The new construction is compared with previously known results.

 <dc:title>On the communication between cells of a cellular automaton on the penta-

 <dc:description>  This contribution belongs to a combinatorial approach to hyperbolic geometry
and it is aimed at possible applications to computer simulations.
  It is based on the splitting method which was introduced by the author and
which is reminded in the second section of the paper. Then we sketchily remind
the application to the classical case of the pentagrid, i.e. the tiling of the
hyperbolic plane which is generated by reflections of the regular rectangular
pentagon in its sides and, recursively, of its images in their sides. From this
application, we derived a system of coordinates to locate the tiles, allowing
an implementation of cellular automata.
  At the software level, cells exchange messages thanks to a new representation
which improves the speed of contacts between cells. In the new setting,
communications are exchanged along actual geodesics and the contribution of the
cellular automaton is also linear in the coordinates of the cells.

 <dc:description>  A point p is 1-well illuminated by a set F of n point lights if p lies in the
interior of the convex hull of F. This concept corresponds to triangle-guarding
or well-covering. In this paper we consider the illumination range of the light
sources as a parameter to be optimized. First, we solve the problem of
minimizing the light sources' illumination range to 1-well illuminate a given
point p. We also compute a minimal set of light sources that 1-well illuminates
p with minimum illumination range. Second, we solve the problem of minimizing
the light sources' illumination range to 1-well illuminate all the points of a
line segment with an O(n^2) algorithm. Finally, we give an O(n^2 log n)
algorithm for preprocessing the data so that one can obtain the illumination
range needed to 1-well illuminate a point of a line segment in O(log n) time.
These results can be applied to solve problems of 1-well illuminating a
trajectory by approaching it to a polygonal path.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the multiple access channel (MAC) with channel state is
analyzed in a scenario where a) the channel state is known non-causally to the
transmitters and b) there is perfect causal feedback from the receiver to the
transmitters. An achievable region and an outer bound are found for a discrete
memoryless MAC that extend existing results, bringing together ideas from the
two separate domains of MAC with state and MAC with feedback. Although this
achievable region does not match the outer bound in general, special cases
where they meet are identified.
  In the case of a Gaussian MAC, a specialized achievable region is found by
using a combination of dirty paper coding and a generalization of the
Schalkwijk-Kailath, Ozarow and Merhav-Weissman schemes, and this region is
found to be capacity achieving. Specifically, it is shown that additive
Gaussian interference that is known non-causally to the transmitter causes no
loss in capacity for the Gaussian MAC with feedback.

 <dc:title>The Size of Optimal Sequence Sets for Synchronous CDMA Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The sum capacity on a symbol-synchronous CDMA system having processing gain
$N$ and supporting $K$ power constrained users is achieved by employing at most
$2N-1$ sequences. Analogously, the minimum received power (energy-per-chip) on
the symbol-synchronous CDMA system supporting $K$ users that demand specified
data rates is attained by employing at most $2N-1$ sequences. If there are $L$
oversized users in the system, at most $2N-L-1$ sequences are needed. $2N-1$ is
the minimum number of sequences needed to guarantee optimal allocation for
single dimensional signaling. $N$ orthogonal sequences are sufficient if a few
users (at most $N-1$) are allowed to signal in multiple dimensions. If there
are no oversized users, these split users need to signal only in two dimensions
each. The above results are shown by proving a converse to a well-known result
of Weyl on the interlacing eigenvalues of the sum of two Hermitian matrices,
one of which is of rank 1. The converse is analogous to Mirsky's converse to
the interlacing eigenvalues theorem for bordering matrices.

 <dc:description>  This paper examines the performance of decision feedback based iterative
channel estimation and multiuser detection in channel coded aperiodic DS-CDMA
systems operating over multipath fading channels. First, explicit expressions
describing the performance of channel estimation and parallel interference
cancellation based multiuser detection are developed. These results are then
combined to characterize the evolution of the performance of a system that
iterates among channel estimation, multiuser detection and channel decoding.
Sufficient conditions for convergence of this system to a unique fixed point
are developed.

 <dc:description>  Given that theoretical analysis and empirical validation is fundamental to
any model, whether conceptual or formal, it is surprising that these two tools
of scientific discovery are so often ignored in the contemporary studies of
communication. In this paper, we pursued the ideas of a) correcting and
expanding the modeling approaches of linguistics, which are otherwise
inapplicable (more precisely, which should not but are widely applied), to the
general case of hypermedia-based communication, and b) developing techniques
for empirical validation of semiotic models, which are nowadays routinely used
to explore (in fact, to conjecture about) internal mechanisms of complex
systems, yet on a purely speculative basis. This study thus offers two
experimentally tested substantive contributions: the formal representation of
communication as the mutually-orienting behavior of coupled autonomous systems,
and the mathematical interpretation of the semiosis of communication, which
together offer a concrete and parsimonious understanding of diverse
communication phenomena.

 <dc:description>  RFID tags are held to become ubiquitous in logistics in the near future, and
item-level tagging will pave the way for Ubiquitous Computing, for example in
application fields like smart homes. Our paper addresses the value and the
production cost of information that can be gathered by observing these tags
over time and different locations. We argue that RFID technology will induce a
thriving market for such information, resulting in easy data access for
analysts to infer business intelligence and individual profiles of unusually
high detail. Understanding these information markets is important for many
reasons: They represent new business opportunities, and market players need to
be aware of their roles in these markets. Policy makers need to confirm that
the market structure will not negatively affect overall welfare. Finally,
though we are not addressing the complex issue of privacy, we are convinced
that market forces will have a significant impact on the effectiveness of
deployed security enhancements to RFID technology. In this paper we take a few
first steps into a relatively new field of economic research and conclude with
a list of research problems that promise deeper insights into the matter.

 <dc:description>  The SL synchronous programming model is a relaxation of the Esterel
synchronous model where the reaction to the absence of a signal within an
instant can only happen at the next instant. In previous work, we have
revisited the SL synchronous programming model. In particular, we have
discussed an alternative design of the model including thread spawning and
recursive definitions, introduced a CPS translation to a tail recursive form,
and proposed a notion of bisimulation equivalence. In the present work, we
extend the tail recursive model with first-order data types obtaining a
non-deterministic synchronous model whose complexity is comparable to the one
of the pi-calculus. We show that our approach to bisimulation equivalence can
cope with this extension and in particular that labelled bisimulation can be
characterised as a contextual bisimulation.

 <dc:description>  Imagination is the critical point in developing of realistic artificial
intelligence (AI) systems. One way to approach imagination would be simulation
of its properties and operations. We developed two models: AI-Brain Network
Hierarchy of Languages and Semantical Holographic Calculus as well as
simulation system ScriptWriter that emulate the process of imagination through
an automatic animation of English texts. The purpose of this paper is to
demonstrate the model and to present ScriptWriter system

 <dc:description>  The ever higher complexity of manufacturing systems, continually shortening
life cycles of products and their increasing variety, as well as the unstable
market situation of the recent years require introducing grater flexibility and
responsiveness to manufacturing processes. From this perspective, one of the
critical manufacturing tasks, which traditionally attract significant attention
in both academia and the industry, but which have no satisfactory universal
solution, is production scheduling. This paper proposes an approach based on
genetics-based machine learning (GBML) to treat the problem of flow shop
scheduling. By the approach, a set of scheduling rules is represented as an
individual of genetic algorithms, and the fitness of the individual is
estimated based on the makespan of the schedule generated by using the
rule-set. A concept of the interactive software environment consisting of a
simulator and a GBML simulation engine is introduced to support human
decision-making during scheduling. A pilot study is underway to evaluate the
performance of the GBML technique in comparison with other methods (such as
Johnson's algorithm and simulated annealing) while completing test examples.

 <dc:description>  Feedback of quantized channel state information (CSI), called limited
feedback, enables transmit beamforming in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
wireless systems with a small amount of overhead. Due to its efficiency,
beamforming with limited feedback has been adopted in several wireless
communication standards. Prior work on limited feedback commonly adopts the
block fading channel model where temporal correlation in wireless channels is
neglected. This paper considers temporally-correlated channels and designs
single-user transmit beamforming with limited feedback. Analytical results
concerning CSI feedback are derived by modeling quantized CSI as a first-order
finite-state Markov chain. These results include the source bit rate generated
by time-varying quantized CSI, the required bit rate for a CSI feedback
channel, and the effect of feedback delay. In particular, based on the theory
of Markov chain convergence rate, feedback delay is proved to reduce the
throughput gain due to CSI feedback at least exponentially. Furthermore, an
algorithm is proposed for CSI feedback compression in time. Combining the
results in this work leads to a new method for designing limited feedback
beamforming as demonstrated by a design example.

 <dc:title>Parallel Evaluation of Mathematica Programs in Remote Computers

 <dc:description>  Mathematica is a powerful application package for doing mathematics and is
used almost in all branches of science. It has widespread applications ranging
from quantum computation, statistical analysis, number theory, zoology,
astronomy, and many more. Mathematica gives a rich set of programming
extensions to its end-user language, and it permits us to write programs in
procedural, functional, or logic (rule-based) style, or a mixture of all three.
For tasks requiring interfaces to the external environment, mathematica
provides mathlink, which allows us to communicate mathematica programs with
external programs written in C, C++, F77, F90, F95, Java, or other languages.
It has also extensive capabilities for editing graphics, equations, text, etc.
  In this article, we explore the basic mechanisms of parallelization of a
mathematica program by sharing different parts of the program into all other
computers available in the network. Doing the parallelization, we can perform
large computational operations within a very short period of time, and
therefore, the efficiency of the numerical works can be achieved. Parallel
computation supports any version of mathematica and it also works as well even
if different versions of mathematica are installed in different computers. The
whole operation can run under any supported operating system like Unix,
Windows, Macintosh, etc. Here we focus our study only for the Unix based
operating system, but this method works as well for all other cases.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new measure of support (the number of occur- rences of a
pattern), in which instances are more important if they occur with a certain
frequency and close after each other in the stream of trans- actions. We will
explain this new consecutive support and discuss how patterns can be found
faster by pruning the search space, for instance using so-called parent support
recalculation. Both consecutiveness and the notion of hypercliques are
incorporated into the Eclat algorithm. Synthetic examples show how interesting
phenomena can now be discov- ered in the datasets. The new measure can be
applied in many areas, ranging from bio-informatics to trade, supermarkets, and
even law en- forcement. E.g., in bio-informatics it is important to find
patterns con- tained in many individuals, where patterns close together in one
chro- mosome are more significant.

the fundamental chaos characteristics. The designs of the major components of
the cipher are given. Its cryptographic properties of period, auto- and
cross-correlations, and the mixture of Markov processes and spatiotemporal
effects are investigated. The cipher is resistant to the related-key-IV
attacks, Time/Memory/Data tradeoff attacks, algebraic attacks, and chosen-text
attacks. The keystreams successfully passed two batteries of statistical tests
and the encryption speed is comparable with RC4.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A generic $(r,m)$-erasure correcting set is a collection of vectors in
$\bF_2^r$ which can be used to generate, for each binary linear code of
codimension $r$, a collection of parity check equations that enables iterative
decoding of all correctable erasure patterns of size at most $m$.
  That is to say, the only stopping sets of size at most $m$ for the generated
parity check equations are the erasure patterns for which there is more than
one manner to fill in theerasures to obtain a codeword.
  We give an explicit construction of generic $(r,m)$-erasure correcting sets
of cardinality $\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} {r-1\choose i}$. Using a random-coding-like
argument, we show that for fixed $m$, the minimum size of a generic
$(r,m)$-erasure correcting set is linear in $r$.
  Keywords: iterative decoding, binary erasure channel, stopping set

 <dc:description>  In Dempster-Shafer belief theory, general beliefs are expressed as belief
mass distribution functions over frames of discernment. In Subjective Logic
beliefs are expressed as belief mass distribution functions over binary frames
of discernment. Belief representations in Subjective Logic, which are called
opinions, also contain a base rate parameter which express the a priori belief
in the absence of evidence. Philosophically, beliefs are quantitative
representations of evidence as perceived by humans or by other intelligent
agents. The basic operators of classical probability calculus, such as addition
and multiplication, can be applied to opinions, thereby making belief calculus
practical. Through the equivalence between opinions and Beta probability
density functions, this also provides a calculus for Beta probability density
functions. This article explains the basic elements of belief calculus.

 <dc:description>  Although good encryption functions are probabilistic, most symbolic models do
not capture this aspect explicitly. A typical solution, recently used to prove
the soundness of such models with respect to computational ones, is to
explicitly represent the dependency of ciphertexts on random coins as labels.
In order to make these label-based models useful, it seems natural to try to
extend the underlying decision procedures and the implementation of existing
tools. In this paper we put forth a more practical alternative based on the
following soundness theorem. We prove that for a large class of security
properties (that includes rather standard formulations for secrecy and
authenticity properties), security of protocols in the simpler model implies
security in the label-based model. Combined with the soundness result of
(\textbf{?}) our theorem enables the translation of security results in
unlabeled symbolic models to computational security.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Resolution of Parametric Systems of Polynomial Equations
  and Inequations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Moroz, Guillaume</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Consider a system of n polynomial equations and r polynomial inequations in n
indeterminates of degree bounded by d with coefficients in a polynomial ring of
s parameters with rational coefficients of bit-size at most $\sigma$. From the
real viewpoint, solving such a system often means describing some
semi-algebraic sets in the parameter space over which the number of real
solutions of the considered parametric system is constant. Following the works
of Lazard and Rouillier, this can be done by the computation of a discriminant
variety. In this report we focus on the case where for a generic specialization
of the parameters the system of equations generates a radical zero-dimensional
ideal, which is usual in the applications. In this case, we provide a
deterministic method computing the minimal discriminant variety reducing the
problem to a problem of elimination. Moreover, we prove that the degree of the
computed minimal discriminant variety is bounded by $D:=(n+r)d^{(n+1)}$ and
that the complexity of our method is $\sigma^{\mathcal{O}(1)}
D^{\mathcal{O}(n+s)}$ bit-operations on a deterministic Turing machine.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the zeta number, natural halting probability and natural
complexity of a Turing machine and we relate them to Chaitin's Omega number,
halting probability, and program-size complexity. A classification of Turing
machines according to their zeta numbers is proposed: divergent, convergent and
tuatara. We prove the existence of universal convergent and tuatara machines.
Various results on (algorithmic) randomness and partial randomness are proved.
For example, we show that the zeta number of a universal tuatara machine is
c.e. and random. A new type of partial randomness, asymptotic randomness, is
introduced. Finally we show that in contrast to classical (algorithmic)
randomness--which cannot be naturally characterised in terms of plain
complexity--asymptotic randomness admits such a characterisation.

 <dc:title>A constructive and unifying framework for zero-bit watermarking</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Furon, Teddy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the watermark detection scenario, also known as zero-bit watermarking, a
watermark, carrying no hidden message, is inserted in content. The watermark
detector checks for the presence of this particular weak signal in content. The
article looks at this problem from a classical detection theory point of view,
but with side information enabled at the embedding side. This means that the
watermark signal is a function of the host content. Our study is twofold. The
first step is to design the best embedding function for a given detection
function, and the best detection function for a given embedding function. This
yields two conditions, which are mixed into one `fundamental' partial
differential equation. It appears that many famous watermarking schemes are
indeed solution to this `fundamental' equation. This study thus gives birth to
a constructive framework unifying solutions, so far perceived as very
different.

 <dc:description>  We analyse the axioms of Euclidean geometry according to standard
object-oriented software development methodology. We find a perfect match: the
main undefined concepts of the axioms translate to object classes. The result
is a suite of C++ classes that efficiently supports the construction of complex
geometric configurations. Although all computations are performed in
floating-point arithmetic, they correctly implement as semi-decision algorithms
the tests for equality of points, a point being on a line or in a plane, a line
being in a plane, parallelness of lines, of a line and a plane, and of planes.
That is, in accordance to the fundamental limitations to computability
requiring that only negative outcomes are given with certainty, while positive
outcomes only imply possibility of these conditions being true.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We survey the average-case complexity of problems in NP.
  We discuss various notions of good-on-average algorithms, and present
completeness results due to Impagliazzo and Levin. Such completeness results
establish the fact that if a certain specific (but somewhat artificial) NP
problem is easy-on-average with respect to the uniform distribution, then all
problems in NP are easy-on-average with respect to all samplable distributions.
Applying the theory to natural distributional problems remain an outstanding
open question. We review some natural distributional problems whose
average-case complexity is of particular interest and that do not yet fit into
this theory.
  A major open question whether the existence of hard-on-average problems in NP
can be based on the P$\neq$NP assumption or on related worst-case assumptions.
We review negative results showing that certain proof techniques cannot prove
such a result. While the relation between worst-case and average-case
complexity for general NP problems remains open, there has been progress in
understanding the relation between different ``degrees'' of average-case
complexity. We discuss some of these ``hardness amplification'' results.

 <dc:description>  Let S = &lt;s_1, s_2, s_3, ..., s_n&gt; be a given vector of n real numbers. The
rank of a real z with respect to S is defined as the number of elements s_i in
S such that s_i is less than or equal to z. We consider the following decision
problem: determine whether the odd-numbered elements s_1, s_3, s_5, ... are
precisely the elements of S whose rank with respect to S is odd. We prove a
bound of Theta(n log n) on the number of operations required to solve this
problem in the algebraic computation tree model.

 <dc:description>  Although it has contributed to remarkable improvements in some specific
areas, attempts to develop a universal design theory are generally
characterized by failure. This paper sketches arguments for a new approach to
engineering design based on Semiotics - the science about signs. The approach
is to combine different design theories over all the product life cycle stages
into one coherent and traceable framework. Besides, it is to bring together the
designer's and user's understandings of the notion of 'good product'. Building
on the insight from natural sciences that complex systems always exhibit a
self-organizing meaning-influential hierarchical dynamics, objective laws
controlling product development are found through an examination of design as a
semiosis process. These laws are then applied to support evolutionary design of
products. An experiment validating some of the theoretical findings is
outlined, and concluding remarks are given.

 <dc:description>  In multi-criteria optimization problems, several objective functions have to
be optimized. Since the different objective functions are usually in conflict
with each other, one cannot consider only one particular solution as the
optimal solution. Instead, the aim is to compute a so-called Pareto curve of
solutions. Since Pareto curves cannot be computed efficiently in general, we
have to be content with approximations to them.
  We design a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for multi-criteria
g-metric STSP that computes (min{1 +g, 2g^2/(2g^2 -2g +1)} + eps)-approximate
Pareto curves for all 1/2&lt;=g&lt;=1. In particular, we obtain a
(2+eps)-approximation for multi-criteria metric STSP. We also present two
randomized approximation algorithms for multi-criteria g-metric STSP that
achieve approximation ratios of (2g^3 +2g^2)/(3g^2 -2g +1) + eps and (1 +g)/(1
+3g -4g^2) + eps, respectively.
  Moreover, we present randomized approximation algorithms for multi-criteria
g-metric ATSP (ratio 1/2 + g^3/(1 -3g^2) + eps) for g &lt; 1/sqrt(3)), STSP with
weights 1 and 2 (ratio 4/3) and ATSP with weights 1 and 2 (ratio 3/2). To do
this, we design randomized approximation schemes for multi-criteria cycle cover
and graph factor problems.

 <dc:title>Enabling user-driven Checkpointing strategies in Reverse-mode Automatic
  Differentiation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hascoet, Laurent</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Araya-Polo, Mauricio</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new functionality of the Automatic Differentiation (AD)
tool Tapenade. Tapenade generates adjoint codes which are widely used for
optimization or inverse problems. Unfortunately, for large applications the
adjoint code demands a great deal of memory, because it needs to store a large
set of intermediates values. To cope with that problem, Tapenade implements a
sub-optimal version of a technique called checkpointing, which is a trade-off
between storage and recomputation. Our long-term goal is to provide an optimal
checkpointing strategy for every code, not yet achieved by any AD tool. Towards
that goal, we first introduce modifications in Tapenade in order to give the
user the choice to select the checkpointing strategy most suitable for their
code. Second, we conduct experiments in real-size scientific codes in order to
gather hints that help us to deduce an optimal checkpointing strategy. Some of
the experimental results show memory savings up to 35% and execution time up to
90%.

the semi-active, active, and non-delay schedule categories. We study dominance
properties of the sets of schedules obtainable with each SGS. We show how the
proposed SGSs can be used within single-pass and multi-pass priority rule based
heuristics. We study several priority rules for the problem and provide a
comparative computational analysis of the different SGSs on sets of instances
taken from the literature. The proposed SGSs significantly improve previously
best-known results on a set of hard benchmark instances.

hire a team and pay as little as possible. Recently, Karlin, Kempe and Tamir
introduced a new definition of {\em frugality ratio} for this setting.
Informally, the frugality ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a
mechanism to perceived fair cost. In this paper, we study this together with
alternative notions of fair cost, and how the resulting frugality ratios relate
to each other for various kinds of set systems.
  We propose a new truthful polynomial-time auction for the vertex cover
problem (where the feasible sets correspond to the vertex covers of a given
graph), based on the {\em local ratio} algorithm of Bar-Yehuda and Even. The
mechanism guarantees to find a winning set whose cost is at most twice the
optimal. In this situation, even though it is NP-hard to find a lowest-cost
feasible set, we show that {\em local optimality} of a solution can be used to
derive frugality bounds that are within a constant factor of best possible. To
prove this result, we use our alternative notions of frugality via a
bootstrapping technique, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Due to the convergence of various mobile access technologies like UMTS, WLAN,
and WiMax the need for a new supporting infrastructure arises. This
infrastructure should be able to support more efficient ways to authenticate
users and devices, potentially enabling novel services based on the security
provided by the infrastructure. In this paper we exhibit some usage scenarios
from the mobile domain integrating trusted computing, which show that trusted
computing offers new paradigms for implementing trust and by this enables new
technical applications and business scenarios. The scenarios show how the
traditional boundaries between technical and authentication domains become
permeable while a high security level is maintained.

 <dc:description>  A concept is proposed to extend authorised translations of documents to

electronic seal, embodied as an XML data structure, which attests to the
correctness of the translation and the authorisation of the translator. The
seal contains a digital signature binding together original and translated

appropriation of the translation. Organisational aspects of possible
implementation variants of electronic authorised translations are discussed and
a realisation as a stand-alone web-service is presented.

 <dc:title>Asynchronous iterative computations with Web information retrieval
  structures: The PageRank case</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  There are several ideas being used today for Web information retrieval, and
specifically in Web search engines. The PageRank algorithm is one of those that
introduce a content-neutral ranking function over Web pages. This ranking is
applied to the set of pages returned by the Google search engine in response to
posting a search query. PageRank is based in part on two simple common sense
concepts: (i)A page is important if many important pages include links to it.
(ii)A page containing many links has reduced impact on the importance of the
pages it links to. In this paper we focus on asynchronous iterative schemes to
compute PageRank over large sets of Web pages. The elimination of the
synchronizing phases is expected to be advantageous on heterogeneous platforms.
The motivation for a possible move to such large scale distributed platforms
lies in the size of matrices representing Web structure. In orders of
magnitude: $10^{10}$ pages with $10^{11}$ nonzero elements and $10^{12}$ bytes
just to store a small percentage of the Web (the already crawled); distributed
memory machines are necessary for such computations. The present research is
part of our general objective, to explore the potential of asynchronous
computational models as an underlying framework for very large scale
computations over the Grid. The area of ``internet algorithmics'' appears to
offer many occasions for computations of unprecedent dimensionality that would
be good candidates for this framework.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of constructing an an optimal-weight tree from the
3*(n choose 4) weighted quartet topologies on n objects, where optimality means
that the summed weight of the embedded quartet topologiesis optimal (so it can
be the case that the optimal tree embeds all quartets as non-optimal
topologies). We present a heuristic for reconstructing the optimal-weight tree,
and a canonical manner to derive the quartet-topology weights from a given
distance matrix. The method repeatedly transforms a bifurcating tree, with all
objects involved as leaves, achieving a monotonic approximation to the exact
single globally optimal tree. This contrasts to other heuristic search methods
from biological phylogeny, like DNAML or quartet puzzling, which, repeatedly,
incrementally construct a solution from a random order of objects, and
subsequently add agreement values.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of constructing an erasure code for storage over a
network when the data sources are distributed. Specifically, we assume that
there are n storage nodes with limited memory and k&lt;n sources generating the
data. We want a data collector, who can appear anywhere in the network, to
query any k storage nodes and be able to retrieve the data. We introduce
Decentralized Erasure Codes, which are linear codes with a specific randomized
structure inspired by network coding on random bipartite graphs. We show that
decentralized erasure codes are optimally sparse, and lead to reduced
communication, storage and computation cost over random linear coding.

 <dc:description>  In Descriptive Complexity, there is a vast amount of literature on decision
problems, and their classes such as \textbf{P, NP, L and NL}. ~ However,
research on the descriptive complexity of optimisation problems has been
limited. Optimisation problems corresponding to the \textbf{NP} class have been
characterised in terms of logic expressions by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis,
Panconesi and Ranjan, Kolaitis and Thakur, Khanna et al, and by Zimand.
Gr\&quot;{a}del characterised the polynomial class \textbf{P} of decision problems.
In this paper, we attempt to characterise the optimisation versions of
\textbf{P} via expressions in second order logic, many of them using universal
Horn formulae with successor relations. The polynomially bound versions of
maximisation (maximization) and minimisation (minimization) problems are
treated first, and then the maximisation problems in the &quot;not necessarily
polynomially bound&quot; class.

 <dc:title>Minimum Pseudo-Weight and Minimum Pseudo-Codewords of LDPC Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Xia, Shu-Tao</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this correspondence, we study the minimum pseudo-weight and minimum
pseudo-codewords of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under linear
programming (LP) decoding. First, we show that the lower bound of Kelly,
Sridhara, Xu and Rosenthal on the pseudo-weight of a pseudo-codeword of an LDPC
code with girth greater than 4 is tight if and only if this pseudo-codeword is
a real multiple of a codeword. Then, we show that the lower bound of Kashyap
and Vardy on the stopping distance of an LDPC code is also a lower bound on the
pseudo-weight of a pseudo-codeword of this LDPC code with girth 4, and this
lower bound is tight if and only if this pseudo-codeword is a real multiple of
a codeword. Using these results we further show that for some LDPC codes, there
are no other minimum pseudo-codewords except the real multiples of minimum
codewords. This means that the LP decoding for these LDPC codes is
asymptotically optimal in the sense that the ratio of the probabilities of
decoding errors of LP decoding and maximum-likelihood decoding approaches to 1
as the signal-to-noise ratio leads to infinity. Finally, some LDPC codes are
listed to illustrate these results.

 <dc:description>  Let $N$ local decision makers in a sensor network communicate with their
neighbors to reach a decision \emph{consensus}. Communication is local, among
neighboring sensors only, through noiseless or noisy links. We study the design
of the network topology that optimizes the rate of convergence of the iterative
decision consensus algorithm. We reformulate the topology design problem as a
spectral graph design problem, namely, maximizing the eigenratio~$\gamma$ of
two eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian~$L$, a matrix that is naturally
associated with the interconnectivity pattern of the network. This
reformulation avoids costly Monte Carlo simulations and leads to the class of
non-bipartite Ramanujan graphs for which we find a lower bound on~$\gamma$. For
Ramanujan topologies and noiseless links, the local probability of error
converges much faster to the overall global probability of error than for
structured graphs, random graphs, or graphs exhibiting small-world
characteristics. With noisy links, we determine the optimal number of
iterations before calling a decision. Finally, we introduce a new class of
random graphs that are easy to construct, can be designed with arbitrary number
of sensors, and whose spectral and convergence properties make them practically
equivalent to Ramanujan topologies.

 <dc:description>  We investigate families of infinite automata for context-sensitive languages.
An infinite automaton is an infinite labeled graph with two sets of initial and
final vertices. Its language is the set of all words labelling a path from an
initial vertex to a final vertex. In 2001, Morvan and Stirling proved that
rational graphs accept the context-sensitive languages between rational sets of
initial and final vertices. This result was later extended to sub-families of
rational graphs defined by more restricted classes of transducers.

  Our contribution is to provide syntactical and self-contained proofs of the
above results, when earlier constructions relied on a non-trivial normal form
of context-sensitive grammars defined by Penttonen in the 1970's. These new
proof techniques enable us to summarize and refine these results by considering
several sub-families defined by restrictions on the type of transducers, the
degree of the graph or the size of the set of initial vertices.

serve as an efficient, robust, and reliable prototypical activation protocol in
sensor networks in responding to various alarm scenarios. We also consider the

further enhance and optimize the speed of the network's response, while keeping
energy consumption at a manageable level.

 <dc:title>Simple Methods For Drawing Rational Surfaces as Four or Six Bezier

 <dc:creator>Gallier, Jean</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we give several simple methods for drawing a whole rational
surface (without base points) as several Bezier patches. The first two methods
apply to surfaces specified by triangular control nets and partition the real
projective plane RP2 into four and six triangles respectively. The third method
applies to surfaces specified by rectangular control nets and partitions the
torus RP1 X RP1 into four rectangular regions. In all cases, the new control
nets are obtained by sign flipping and permutation of indices from the original
control net. The proofs that these formulae are correct involve very little
computations and instead exploit the geometry of the parameter space (RP2 or
RP1 X RP1). We illustrate our method on some classical examples. We also
propose a new method for resolving base points using a simple ``blowing up''
technique involving the computation of ``resolved'' control nets.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to present simple and fast methods for computing
control points for polynomial curves and polynomial surfaces given explicitly
in terms of polynomials (written as sums of monomials). We give recurrence
formulae w.r.t. arbitrary affine frames. As a corollary, it is amusing that we
can also give closed-form expressions in the case of the frame (r, s) for
curves, and the frame ((1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) for surfaces. Our
methods have the same low polynomial (time and space) complexity as the other

 <dc:title>Approximability of Bounded Occurrence Max Ones</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kuivinen, Fredrik</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the approximability of Max Ones when the number of variable
occurrences is bounded by a constant. For conservative constraint languages
(i.e., when the unary relations are included) we give a complete classification
when the number of occurrences is three or more and a partial classification
when the bound is two.
  For the non-conservative case we prove that it is either trivial or
equivalent to the corresponding conservative problem under polynomial-time
many-one reductions.

 <dc:description>  Proving lower bounds remains the most difficult of tasks in computational
complexity theory. In this paper, we show that whereas most natural NP-complete
problems belong to NLIN (linear time on nondeterministic RAMs), some of them,
typically the planar versions of many NP-complete problems are recognized by
nondeterministic RAMs in linear time and sublinear space. The main results of
this paper are the following: as the second author did for NLIN, we give exact
logical characterizations of nondeterministic polynomial time-space complexity
classes; we derive from them a class of problems, which are complete in these
classes, and as a consequence of such a precise result and of some recent
separation theorems using diagonalization, prove time-space lower bounds for
these problems.

 <dc:description>  We consider tromino tilings of $m\times n$ domino-deficient rectangles, where
$3|(mn-2)$ and $m,n\geq0$, and characterize all cases of domino removal that
admit such tilings, thereby settling the open problem posed by J. M. Ash and S.
Golomb in \cite {marshall}. Based on this characterization, we design a
procedure for constructing such a tiling if one exists. We also consider the
problem of counting such tilings and derive the exact formula for the number of
tilings for $2\times(3t+1)$ rectangles, the exact generating function for
$4\times(3t+2)$ rectangles, where $t\geq0$, and an upper bound on the number of
tromino tilings for $m\times n$ domino-deficient rectangles. We also consider
general 2-deficiency in $n\times4$ rectangles, where $n\geq8$, and characterize
all pairs of squares which do not permit a tromino tiling.

 <dc:description>  This article discusses how concepts and methods of complex networks can be
applied to real-time imaging and computer vision. After a brief introduction of
complex networks basic concepts, their use as means to represent and
characterize images, as well as for modeling visual saliency, are briefly
described. The possibility to apply complex networks in order to model and
simulate the performance of parallel and distributed computing systems for
performance of visual methods is also proposed.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of various strategies for
subdividing polynomial triangular surface patches. We give a simple algorithm
performing a regular subdivision in four calls to the standard de Casteljau
algorithm (in its subdivision version). A naive version uses twelve calls. We
also show that any method for obtaining a regular subdivision using the
standard de Casteljau algorithm requires at least 4 calls. Thus, our method is
optimal. We give another subdivision algorithm using only three calls to the de
Casteljau algorithm. Instead of being regular, the subdivision pattern is
diamond-like. Finally, we present a ``spider-like'' subdivision scheme
producing six subtriangles in four calls to the de Casteljau algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Labeled unranked trees are used as a model of XML documents, and logical
languages for them have been studied actively over the past several years. Such
logics have different purposes: some are better suited for extracting data,
some for expressing navigational properties, and some make it easy to relate
complex properties of trees to the existence of tree automata for those
properties. Furthermore, logics differ significantly in their model-checking
properties, their automata models, and their behavior on ordered and unordered
trees. In this paper we present a survey of logics for unranked trees.

 <dc:description>  FLAIM (Framework for Log Anonymization and Information Management) addresses
two important needs not well addressed by current log anonymizers. First, it is
extremely modular and not tied to the specific log being anonymized. Second, it
supports multi-level anonymization, allowing system administrators to make
fine-grained trade-offs between information loss and privacy/security concerns.
In this paper, we examine anonymization solutions to date and note the above
limitations in each. We further describe how FLAIM addresses these problems,
and we describe FLAIM's architecture and features in detail.

 <dc:description>  M.Alekhnovich et al. recently have proposed a model of algorithms, called BT
model, which covers Greedy, Backtrack and Simple Dynamic Programming methods
and can be further divided into fixed, adaptive and fully adaptive three kinds,
and have proved exponential time lower bounds of exact and approximation
algorithms under adaptive BT model for Knapsack problem which are
$\Omega(2^{n/2}/\sqrt n)=\Omega(2^{0.5n}/\sqrt n)$ and
$\Omega((1/\epsilon)^{1/3.17})\approx\Omega((1/\epsilon)^{0.315})$(for
approximation ratio $1-\epsilon$) respectively (M. Alekhovich, A. Borodin, J.
Buresh-Oppenheim, R. Impagliazzo, A. Magen, and T. Pitassi, Toward a Model for
Backtracking and Dynamic Programming, \emph{Proceedings of Twentieth Annual
IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity}, pp308-322, 2005). In this note,
we slightly improved their lower bounds to
$\Omega(2^{(2-\epsilon)n/3}/\sqrt{n})\approx \Omega(2^{0.66n}/\sqrt{n})$ and
$\Omega((1/\epsilon)^{1/2.38})\approx\Omega((1/\epsilon)^{0.420})$, and
proposed as an open question what is the best achievable lower bounds for
knapsack under adaptive BT models.

 <dc:description>  XPath is a simple language for navigating an XML-tree and returning a set of
answer nodes. The focus in this paper is on the complexity of the containment
problem for various fragments of XPath. We restrict attention to the most
common XPath expressions which navigate along the child and/or descendant axis.
In addition to basic expressions using only node tests and simple predicates,
we also consider disjunction and variables (ranging over nodes). Further, we
investigate the containment problem relative to a given DTD. With respect to
variables we study two semantics, (1) the original semantics of XPath, where
the values of variables are given by an outer context, and (2) an existential
semantics introduced by Deutsch and Tannen, in which the values of variables
are existentially quantified. In this framework, we establish an exact
classification of the complexity of the containment problem for many XPath
fragments.

 <dc:title>The Cumulative Rule for Belief Fusion</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Josang, Audun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of combining beliefs in the Dempster-Shafer belief theory has
attracted considerable attention over the last two decades. The classical
Dempster's Rule has often been criticised, and many alternative rules for
belief combination have been proposed in the literature. The consensus operator
for combining beliefs has nice properties and produces more intuitive results
than Dempster's rule, but has the limitation that it can only be applied to
belief distribution functions on binary state spaces. In this paper we present
a generalisation of the consensus operator that can be applied to Dirichlet
belief functions on state spaces of arbitrary size. This rule, called the
cumulative rule of belief combination, can be derived from classical
statistical theory, and corresponds well with human intuition.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents scheduling algorithms for procrastinators, where the
speed that a procrastinator executes a job increases as the due date
approaches. We give optimal off-line scheduling policies for linearly
increasing speed functions. We then explain the computational/numerical issues
involved in implementing this policy. We next explore the online setting,
showing that there exist adversaries that force any online scheduling policy to
miss due dates. This impossibility result motivates the problem of minimizing
the maximum interval stretch of any job; the interval stretch of a job is the
job's flow time divided by the job's due date minus release time. We show that
several common scheduling strategies, including the &quot;hit-the-highest-nail&quot;
strategy beloved by procrastinators, have arbitrarily large maximum interval
stretch. Then we give the &quot;thrashing&quot; scheduling policy and show that it is a
\Theta(1) approximation algorithm for the maximum interval stretch.

and authenticity of the bidirectional data stream and its temporal sequence
which together establish the security context of the communication. Our concept
is conceptually close to the protocols that embody VoIP and provides a high
level of inherent security. It enables signatures over voice as true
declarations of will, in principle between unacquainted speakers. We point to
trusted computing enabled devices as possible trusted signature terminals for
voice communication.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we investigate the use of a probabilistic model for
unsupervised clustering in text collections. Unsupervised clustering has become
a basic module for many intelligent text processing applications, such as
information retrieval, text classification or information extraction. The model
considered in this contribution consists of a mixture of multinomial
distributions over the word counts, each component corresponding to a different
theme. We present and contrast various estimation procedures, which apply both
in supervised and unsupervised contexts. In supervised learning, this work
suggests a criterion for evaluating the posterior odds of new documents which
is more statistically sound than the &quot;naive Bayes&quot; approach. In an unsupervised
context, we propose measures to set up a systematic evaluation framework and
start with examining the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm as the basic
tool for inference. We discuss the importance of initialization and the
influence of other features such as the smoothing strategy or the size of the
vocabulary, thereby illustrating the difficulties incurred by the high
dimensionality of the parameter space. We also propose a heuristic algorithm
based on iterative EM with vocabulary reduction to solve this problem. Using
the fact that the latent variables can be analytically integrated out, we
finally show that Gibbs sampling algorithm is tractable and compares favorably
to the basic expectation maximization approach.

 <dc:title>Is there an Elegant Universal Theory of Prediction?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Legg, Shane</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Solomonoff's inductive learning model is a powerful, universal and highly
elegant theory of sequence prediction. Its critical flaw is that it is
incomputable and thus cannot be used in practice. It is sometimes suggested
that it may still be useful to help guide the development of very general and
powerful theories of prediction which are computable. In this paper it is shown
that although powerful algorithms exist, they are necessarily highly complex.
This alone makes their theoretical analysis problematic, however it is further
shown that beyond a moderate level of complexity the analysis runs into the
deeper problem of Goedel incompleteness. This limits the power of mathematics
to analyse and study prediction algorithms, and indeed intelligent systems in
general.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a downlink scenario in which a single-antenna base station
communicates with K single antenna users, over a time-correlated fading
channel, is considered. It is assumed that channel state information is
perfectly known at each receiver, while the statistical characteristics of the
fading process and the fading gain at the beginning of each frame are known to
the transmitter. By evaluating the random coding error exponent of the
time-correlated fading channel, it is shown that there is an optimal codeword
length which maximizes the throughput. The throughput of the conventional
scheduling that transmits to the user with the maximum signal to noise ratio is
examined using both fixed length codewords and variable length codewords.
Although optimizing the codeword length improves the performance, it is shown
that using the conventional scheduling, the gap between the achievable
throughput and the maximum possible throughput of the system tends to infinity
as K goes to infinity. A simple scheduling that considers both the signal to
noise ratio and the channel time variation is proposed. It is shown that by
using this scheduling, the gap between the achievable throughput and the
maximum throughput of the system approaches zero.

 <dc:description>  We study the equational theory of Parigot's second-order
&amp;lambda;&amp;mu;-calculus in connection with a call-by-name continuation-passing
style (CPS) translation into a fragment of the second-order &amp;lambda;-calculus.
It is observed that the relational parametricity on the target calculus induces
a natural notion of equivalence on the &amp;lambda;&amp;mu;-terms. On the other hand,
the unconstrained relational parametricity on the &amp;lambda;&amp;mu;-calculus turns
out to be inconsistent with this CPS semantics. Following these facts, we
propose to formulate the relational parametricity on the &amp;lambda;&amp;mu;-calculus
in a constrained way, which might be called ``focal parametricity''.

 <dc:title>Comparison of the estimation of the degree of polarization from four or

 <dc:description>  Active polarimetric imagery is a powerful tool for accessing the information
present in a scene. Indeed, the polarimetric images obtained can reveal
polarizing properties of the objects that are not avalaible using conventional
imaging systems. However, when coherent light is used to illuminate the scene,
the images are degraded by speckle noise. The polarization properties of a
scene are characterized by the degree of polarization. In standard polarimetric
imagery system, four intensity images are needed to estimate this degree . If
we assume the uncorrelation of the measurements, this number can be decreased
to two images using the Orthogonal State Contrast Image (OSCI). However, this
approach appears too restrictive in some cases. We thus propose in this paper a
new statistical parametric method to estimate the degree of polarization
assuming correlated measurements with only two intensity images. The estimators
obtained from four images, from the OSCI and from the proposed method, are
compared using simulated polarimetric data degraded by speckle noise.

 <dc:description>  A partially cooperative relay broadcast channel (RBC) is a three-node network
with one source node and two destination nodes (destinations 1 and 2) where
destination 1 can act as a relay to assist destination 2. Inner and outer
bounds on the capacity region of the discrete memoryless partially cooperative
RBC are obtained. When the relay function is disabled, the inner and outer
bounds reduce to new bounds on the capacity region of broadcast channels. Four
classes of RBCs are studied in detail. For the partially cooperative RBC with
degraded message sets, inner and outer bounds are obtained. For the
semideterministic partially cooperative RBC and the orthogonal partially
cooperative RBC, the capacity regions are established. For the parallel
partially cooperative RBC with unmatched degraded subchannels, the capacity
region is established for the case of degraded message sets. The capacity is
also established when the source node has only a private message for
destination 2, i.e., the channel reduces to a parallel relay channel with
unmatched degraded subchannels.

 <dc:description>  Current systems and formalisms for representing incomplete information
generally suffer from at least one of two weaknesses. Either they are not
strong enough for representing results of simple queries, or the handling and
processing of the data, e.g. for query evaluation, is intractable.
  In this paper, we present a decomposition-based approach to addressing this
problem. We introduce world-set decompositions (WSDs), a space-efficient
formalism for representing any finite set of possible worlds over relational
databases. WSDs are therefore a strong representation system for any relational
query language. We study the problem of efficiently evaluating relational
algebra queries on sets of worlds represented by WSDs. We also evaluate our
technique experimentally in a large census data scenario and show that it is
both scalable and efficient.

 <dc:title>A Flexible Bandwidth Reservation Framework for Bulk Data Transfers in

 <dc:creator>Chen, Bin Bin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In grid networks, distributed resources are interconnected by wide area
network to support compute and data-intensive applications, which require
reliable and efficient transfer of gigabits (even terabits) of data. Different
from best-effort traffic in Internet, bulk data transfer in grid requires
bandwidth reservation as a fundamental service. Existing reservation schemes
such as RSVP are designed for real-time traffic specified by reservation rate,
transfer start time but with unknown lifetime. In comparison, bulk data
transfer requests are defined in terms of volume and deadline, which provide
more information, and allow more flexibility in reservation schemes, i.e.,
transfer start time can be flexibly chosen, and reservation for a single
request can be divided into multiple intervals with different reservation
rates. We define a flexible reservation framework using time-rate function
algebra, and identify a series of practical reservation scheme families with
increasing generality and potential performance, namely, FixTime-FixRate,
FixTime-FlexRate, FlexTime-FlexRate, and Multi-Interval. Simple heuristics are
used to select representative scheme from each family for performance
comparison. Simulation results show that the increasing flexibility can
potentially improve system performance, minimizing both blocking probability
and mean flow time. We also discuss the distributed implementation of proposed
framework.

 <dc:title>On Sequence Prediction for Arbitrary Measures</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Suppose we are given two probability measures on the set of one-way infinite
finite-alphabet sequences and consider the question when one of the measures
predicts the other, that is, when conditional probabilities converge (in a
certain sense) when one of the measures is chosen to generate the sequence.
This question may be considered a refinement of the problem of sequence
prediction in its most general formulation: for a given class of probability
measures, does there exist a measure which predicts all of the measures in the
class? To address this problem, we find some conditions on local absolute
continuity which are sufficient for prediction and which generalize several
different notions which are known to be sufficient for prediction. We also
formulate some open questions to outline a direction for finding the conditions
on classes of measures for which prediction is possible.

 <dc:description>  A *dimension extractor* is an algorithm designed to increase the effective
dimension -- i.e., the amount of computational randomness -- of an infinite
binary sequence, in order to turn a &quot;partially random&quot; sequence into a &quot;more
random&quot; sequence. Extractors are exhibited for various effective dimensions,
including constructive, computable, space-bounded, time-bounded, and
finite-state dimension. Using similar techniques, the Kucera-Gacs theorem is
examined from the perspective of decompression, by showing that every infinite
sequence S is Turing reducible to a Martin-Loef random sequence R such that the
asymptotic number of bits of R needed to compute n bits of S, divided by n, is
precisely the constructive dimension of S, which is shown to be the optimal
ratio of query bits to computed bits achievable with Turing reductions. The
extractors and decompressors that are developed lead directly to new
characterizations of some effective dimensions in terms of optimal
decompression by Turing reductions.

 <dc:description>  Lawrence (2001)found computer science articles that were openly accessible
(OA) on the Web were cited more. We replicated this in physics. We tested
1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines
(Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics,
Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts
using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias
= 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16%
(depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually
(correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p &lt; 0.005). Comparing OA and
NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more
citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year.
Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+
citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly
faster than NOA within every citation range (r &gt; .90, N=12, p &lt; .0005) and the
effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p &lt; .005).
Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a
similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even
approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation
advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's
better articles OA). Further research will analyze the effect's timing, causal
components and relation to other variables.

there exists a language which is neither in P, nor NP-complete. This result was
latter generalized by Schoning and several authors to various polynomial-time
complexity classes. We show here that such results also apply to linear-time
reductions on RAMs (resp. Turing machines), and hence allow for separation
results in linear-time classes similar to Ladner's ones for polynomial time.

 <dc:subject>I.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently become a real formal science: the
new millennium brought the first mathematically sound, asymptotically optimal,
universal problem solvers, providing a new, rigorous foundation for the
previously largely heuristic field of General AI and embedded agents. At the
same time there has been rapid progress in practical methods for learning true
sequence-processing programs, as opposed to traditional methods limited to
stationary pattern association. Here we will briefly review some of the new
results, and speculate about future developments, pointing out that the time
intervals between the most notable events in over 40,000 years or 2^9 lifetimes
of human history have sped up exponentially, apparently converging to zero
within the next few decades. Or is this impression just a by-product of the way
humans allocate memory space to past events?

 <dc:title>Lack of Finite Characterizations for the Distance-based Revision</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ben-Naim, Jonathan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Lehmann, Magidor, and Schlechta developed an approach to belief revision
based on distances between any two valuations. Suppose we are given such a
distance D. This defines an operator |D, called a distance operator, which
transforms any two sets of valuations V and W into the set V |D W of all
elements of W that are closest to V. This operator |D defines naturally the
revision of K by A as the set of all formulas satisfied in M(K) |D M(A) (i.e.
those models of A that are closest to the models of K). This constitutes a
distance-based revision operator. Lehmann et al. characterized families of them
using a loop condition of arbitrarily big size. An interesting question is
whether this loop condition can be replaced by a finite one. Extending the
results of Schlechta, we will provide elements of negative answer. In fact, we
will show that for families of distance operators, there is no &quot;normal&quot;
characterization. Approximatively, a normal characterization contains only
finite and universally quantified conditions. These results have an interest of
their own for they help to understand the limits of what is possible in this
area. Now, we are quite confident that this work can be continued to show
similar impossibility results for distance-based revision operators, which
suggests that the big loop condition cannot be simplified.

 <dc:title>The Diversity Order of the Semidefinite Relaxation Detector</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jalden, J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ottersten, B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the detection of binary (antipodal) signals transmitted in a
spatially multiplexed fashion over a fading multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) channel and where the detection is done by means of semidefinite
relaxation (SDR). The SDR detector is an attractive alternative to maximum
likelihood (ML) detection since the complexity is polynomial rather than
exponential. Assuming that the channel matrix is drawn with i.i.d. real valued
Gaussian entries, we study the receiver diversity and prove that the SDR
detector achieves the maximum possible diversity. Thus, the error probability
of the receiver tends to zero at the same rate as the optimal maximum
likelihood (ML) receiver in the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) limit. This
significantly strengthens previous performance guarantees available for the
semidefinite relaxation detector. Additionally, it proves that full diversity
detection is in certain scenarios also possible when using a non-combinatorial
receiver structure.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that the resolution method (for propositional logic) is
complete. However, completeness proofs found in the literature use an argument
by contradiction showing that if a set of clauses is unsatisfiable, then it
must have a resolution refutation. As a consequence, none of these proofs
actually gives an algorithm for producing a resolution refutation from an
unsatisfiable set of clauses. In this note, we give a simple and constructive
proof of the completeness of propositional resolution which consists of an
algorithm together with a proof of its correctness.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a simple universal (that is, distribution--free) steganographic
system in which covertexts with and without hidden texts are statistically
indistinguishable. The stegosystem can be applied to any source generating
i.i.d. covertexts with unknown distribution, and the hidden text is transmitted
exactly, with zero probability of error. Moreover, the proposed steganographic
system has two important properties. First, the rate of transmission of hidden
information approaches the Shannon entropy of the covertext source as the size
of blocks used for hidden text encoding tends to infinity. Second, if the size
of the alphabet of the covertext source and its minentropy tend to infinity
then the number of bits of hidden text per letter of covertext tends to
$\log(n!)/n$ where $n$ is the (fixed) size of blocks used for hidden text
encoding. The proposed stegosystem uses randomization.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents some first results on how to perform uniform random walks
(where every trace has the same probability to occur) in very large models. The
models considered here are described in a succinct way as a set of
communicating reactive modules. The method relies upon techniques for counting
and drawing uniformly at random words in regular languages. Each module is
considered as an automaton defining such a language. It is shown how it is
possible to combine local uniform drawings of traces, and to obtain some global
uniform random sampling, without construction of the global model.

 <dc:description>  Sharir and Welzl introduced an abstract framework for optimization problems,
called LP-type problems or also generalized linear programming problems, which
proved useful in algorithm design. We define a new, and as we believe, simpler
and more natural framework: violator spaces, which constitute a proper
generalization of LP-type problems. We show that Clarkson's randomized
algorithms for low-dimensional linear programming work in the context of
violator spaces. For example, in this way we obtain the fastest known algorithm
for the P-matrix generalized linear complementarity problem with a constant
number of blocks. We also give two new characterizations of LP-type problems:
they are equivalent to acyclic violator spaces, as well as to concrete LP-type
problems (informally, the constraints in a concrete LP-type problem are subsets
of a linearly ordered ground set, and the value of a set of constraints is the
minimum of its intersection).

 <dc:description>  Text-to-speech technology has been broadly used to help people with voice
disabilities to overcome their difficulties. With text-to-speech, a person
types at a keyboard, the text is synthesized, and the sound comes out through
the computer speakers.
  In recent years, Voice over IP (VoIP) applications have become very popular
and have been used by people worldwide. These applications allow people to talk
for free over the Internet and also to make traditional calls through the
Public-Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) at a small fraction of the cost
offered by traditional phone companies.
  We have created a system, called EasyVoice, which integrates speech
synthesizers with VoIP applications. The result allows a person with motor
impairments and voice disabilities to talk with another person located anywhere
in the world. The benefits in this case are much stronger than the ones
obtained by non-disabled people using VoIP applications. People with motor
impairments sometimes can hardly use a regular or mobile phone. Thus, the
advantage is not only the reduction in cost, but more important, the ability to
talk at all.

 <dc:title>NVision-PA: A Tool for Visual Analysis of Command Behavior Based on
  Process Accounting Logs (with a Case Study in HPC Cluster Security)</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the UNIX/Linux environment the kernel can log every command process
created by every user with process accounting. Thus process accounting logs
have many potential uses, particularly the monitoring and forensic
investigation of security events. Previous work successfully leveraged the use
of process accounting logs to identify a difficult to detect and damaging
intrusion against high performance computing (HPC) clusters, masquerade
attacks, where intruders masquerade as legitimate users with purloined
authentication credentials. While masqueraders on HPC clusters were found to be
identifiable with a high accuracy (greater than 90%), this accuracy is still
not high enough for HPC production environments where greater than 99% accuracy
is needed.
  This paper incrementally advances the goal of more accurately identifying
masqueraders on HPC clusters by seeking to identify features within command
sets that distinguish masqueraders. To accomplish this goal, we created
NVision-PA, a software tool that produces text and graphic statistical
summaries describing input processing accounting logs. We report NVision-PA
results describing two different process accounting logs; one from Internet
usage and one from HPC cluster usage. These results identify the distinguishing
features of Internet users (as proxies for masqueraders) posing as clusters
users. This research is both a promising next step toward creating a real-time
masquerade detection sensor for production HPC clusters as well as providing
another tool for system administrators to use for statistically monitoring and
managing legitimate workloads (as indicated by command usage) in HPC
environments.

 <dc:description>  Several recent standards such as IEEE 802.11a/g, IEEE 802.16, and ECMA
Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) for high
data-rate Ultra-Wideband (UWB), employ bit-interleaved convolutionally-coded
multicarrier modulation over quasi-static fading channels. Motivated by the
lack of appropriate error rate analysis techniques for this popular type of
system and channel model, we present two novel analytical methods for bit error
rate (BER) estimation of coded multicarrier systems operating over
frequency-selective quasi-static channels with non-ideal interleaving. In the
first method, the approximate performance of the system is calculated for each
realization of the channel, which is suitable for obtaining the outage BER
performance (a common performance measure for e.g. MB-OFDM systems). The second
method assumes Rayleigh distributed frequency-domain subcarrier channel gains
and knowledge of their correlation matrix, and can be used to directly obtain
the average BER performance. Both methods are applicable to
convolutionally-coded interleaved multicarrier systems employing Quadrature
Amplitude Modulation (QAM), and are also able to account for narrowband
interference (modeled as a sum of tone interferers). To illustrate the
application of the proposed analysis, both methods are used to study the
performance of a tone-interference-impaired MB-OFDM system.

 <dc:description>  The well-known problem of state space explosion in model checking is even
more critical when applying this technique to programming languages, mainly due
to the presence of complex data structures. One recent and promising approach
to deal with this problem is the construction of an abstract and correct
representation of the global program state allowing to match visited states
during program model exploration. In particular, one powerful method to
implement abstract matching is to fill the state vector with a minimal amount
of relevant variables for each program point. In this paper, we combine the
on-the-fly model-checking approach (incremental construction of the program
state space) and the static analysis method called influence analysis
(extraction of significant variables for each program point) in order to
automatically construct an abstract matching function. Firstly, we describe the
problem as an alternation-free value-based mu-calculus formula, whose validity
can be checked on the program model expressed as a labeled transition system
(LTS). Secondly, we translate the analysis into the local resolution of a
parameterised boolean equation system (PBES), whose representation enables a
more efficient construction of the resulting abstract matching function.
Finally, we show how our proposal may be elegantly integrated into CADP, a
generic framework for both the design and analysis of distributed systems and
the development of verification tools.

 <dc:description>  Typechecking consists of statically verifying whether the output of an XML
transformation always conforms to an output type for documents satisfying a
given input type. In this general setting, both the input and output schema as
well as the transformation are part of the input for the problem. However,
scenarios where the input or output schema can be considered to be fixed, are
quite common in practice. In the present work, we investigate the computational
complexity of the typechecking problem in the latter setting.

 <dc:title>A verification algorithm for Declarative Concurrent Programming</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Krivine, Jean</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A verification method for distributed systems based on decoupling forward and
backward behaviour is proposed. This method uses an event structure based
algorithm that, given a CCS process, constructs its causal compression relative
to a choice of observable actions. Verifying the original process equipped with
distributed backtracking on non-observable actions, is equivalent to verifying
its relative compression which in general is much smaller. We call this method
Declarative Concurrent Programming (DCP). DCP technique compares well with
direct bisimulation based methods. Benchmarks for the classic dining
philosophers problem show that causal compression is rather efficient both
time- and space-wise. State of the art verification tools can successfully
handle more than 15 agents, whereas they can handle no more than 5 following
the traditional direct method; an altogether spectacular improvement, since in
this example the specification size is exponential in the number of agents.

 <dc:title>Building a resource for studying translation shifts</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cyrus, Lea</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes an interdisciplinary approach which brings together the
fields of corpus linguistics and translation studies. It presents ongoing work
on the creation of a corpus resource in which translation shifts are explicitly
annotated. Translation shifts denote departures from formal correspondence
between source and target text, i.e. deviations that have occurred during the
translation process. A resource in which such shifts are annotated in a
systematic way will make it possible to study those phenomena that need to be
addressed if machine translation output is to resemble human translation. The
resource described in this paper contains English source texts (parliamentary
proceedings) and their German translations. The shift annotation is based on
predicate-argument structures and proceeds in two steps: first, predicates and
their arguments are annotated monolingually in a straightforward manner. Then,
the corresponding English and German predicates and arguments are aligned with
each other. Whenever a shift - mainly grammatical or semantic -has occurred,
the alignment is tagged accordingly.

 <dc:description>  We describe a variation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm for
aligning two point sets under a set of transformations. Our algorithm is
superior to previous algorithms because (1) in determining the optimal
alignment, it identifies and discards likely outliers in a statistically robust
manner, and (2) it is guaranteed to converge to a locally optimal solution. To
this end, we formalize a new distance measure, fractional root mean squared
distance (frmsd), which incorporates the fraction of inliers into the distance
function. We lay out a specific implementation, but our framework can easily
incorporate most techniques and heuristics from modern registration algorithms.
We experimentally validate our algorithm against previous techniques on 2 and 3
dimensional data exposed to a variety of outlier types.

 <dc:title>Fairness in Multiuser Systems with Polymatroid Capacity Region</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Maddah-Ali, Mohammad A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mobasher, Amin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Khandani, Amir Kayvan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For a wide class of multi-user systems, a subset of capacity region which
includes the corner points and the sum-capacity facet has a special structure
known as polymatroid. Multiaccess channels with fixed input distributions and
multiple-antenna broadcast channels are examples of such systems. Any interior
point of the sum-capacity facet can be achieved by time-sharing among corner
points or by an alternative method known as rate-splitting. The main purpose of
this paper is to find a point on the sum-capacity facet which satisfies a
notion of fairness among active users. This problem is addressed in two cases:
(i) where the complexity of achieving interior points is not feasible, and (ii)
where the complexity of achieving interior points is feasible. For the first
case, the corner point for which the minimum rate of the active users is
maximized (max-min corner point) is desired for signaling. A simple greedy
algorithm is introduced to find the optimum max-min corner point. For the
second case, the polymatroid properties are exploited to locate a rate-vector
on the sum-capacity facet which is optimally fair in the sense that the minimum
rate among all users is maximized (max-min rate). In the case that the rate of
some users can not increase further (attain the max-min value), the algorithm
recursively maximizes the minimum rate among the rest of the users. It is shown
that the problems of deriving the time-sharing coefficients or rate-spitting
scheme can be solved by decomposing the problem to some lower-dimensional
subproblems. In addition, a fast algorithm to compute the time-sharing
coefficients to attain a general point on the sum-capacity facet is proposed.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Mathematical Software</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper provides a bound on the number of numeric operations (fixed or
floating point) that can safely be performed before accuracy is lost. This work
has important implications for control systems with safety-critical software,
as these systems are now running fast enough and long enough for their errors
to impact on their functionality. Furthermore, worst-case analysis would
blindly advise the replacement of existing systems that have been successfully
running for years. We present here a set of formal theorems validated by the
PVS proof assistant. These theorems will allow code analyzing tools to produce
formal certificates of accurate behavior. For example, FAA regulations for
aircraft require that the probability of an error be below $10^{-9}$ for a 10
hour flight.

 <dc:description>  A new deterministic floating-point arithmetic called precision arithmetic is
developed to track precision for arithmetic calculations. It uses a novel
rounding scheme to avoid excessive rounding error propagation of conventional
floating-point arithmetic. Unlike interval arithmetic, its uncertainty tracking
is based on statistics and the central limit theorem, with a much tighter
bounding range. Its stable rounding error distribution is approximated by a
truncated normal distribution. Generic standards and systematic methods for
validating uncertainty-bearing arithmetics are discussed. The precision
arithmetic is found to be better than interval arithmetic in both
uncertainty-tracking and uncertainty-bounding for normal usages.
  The precision arithmetic is available publicly at

viewpoint of the information-spectrum (IS) methods, which has been first
exploited in information theory, and also demonstrate a new basic formula for
the large deviation rate function in general, which is a pair of the lower and

 <dc:description>  The continuous improvement in TQM is considered as the core value by which
organisation could maintain a competitive edge. Several techniques and tools
are known to support this core value but most of the time these techniques are
informal and without modelling the interdependence between the core value and
tools. Thus, technique formalisation is one of TQM challenges for increasing
efficiency of quality process implementation. In that way, the paper proposes
and experiments an advanced quality modelling approach based on meta-modelling
the &quot;process approach&quot; as advocated by the standard ISO9000:2000. This
meta-model allows formalising the interdependence between technique, tools and
core value

 <dc:title>Self-orthogonality of $q$-ary Images of $q^m$-ary Codes and Quantum Code

 <dc:creator>Thangaraj, Andrew</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A code over GF$(q^m)$ can be imaged or expanded into a code over GF$(q)$
using a basis for the extension field over the base field. The properties of
such an image depend on the original code and the basis chosen for imaging.
Problems relating the properties of a code and its image with respect to a
basis have been of great interest in the field of coding theory. In this work,
a generalized version of the problem of self-orthogonality of the $q$-ary image
of a $q^m$-ary code has been considered. Given an inner product (more
generally, a biadditive form), necessary and sufficient conditions have been
derived for a code over a field extension and an expansion basis so that an
image of that code is self-orthogonal. The conditions require that the original
code be self-orthogonal with respect to several related biadditive forms
whenever certain power sums of the dual basis elements do not vanish. Numerous
interesting corollaries have been derived by specializing the general
conditions. An interesting result for the canonical or regular inner product in
fields of characteristic two is that only self-orthogonal codes result in
self-orthogonal images. Another result is that image of a code is
self-orthogonal for all bases if and only if trace of the code is
self-orthogonal, except for the case of binary images of 4-ary codes. The
conditions are particularly simple to state and apply for cyclic codes. To
illustrate a possible application, new quantum error-correcting codes have been
constructed with larger minimum distance than previously known.

Cognitive Impairment, those diagnosed with Macular Degeneration, and a
high-functioning population. The outcomes of the project included human
information processing-centered design guidelines for the memex interface, a
low-fidelity prototype, and an annotated bibliography for human information
processing, usability and design literature relating to the memex and the
populations we explored.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, enterprises are confronted to growing needs for traceability,
product genealogy and product life cycle management. To meet those needs, the
enterprise and applications in the enterprise environment have to manage flows
of information that relate to flows of material and that are managed in shop
floor level. Nevertheless, throughout product lifecycle coordination needs to
be established between reality in the physical world (physical view) and the
virtual world handled by manufacturing information systems (informational
view). This paper presents the &quot;Holon&quot; modelling concept as a means for the
synchronisation of both physical view and informational views. Afterwards, we
show how the concept of holon can play a major role in ensuring
interoperability in the enterprise context.

 <dc:description>  Let (X,d_X) be an n-point metric space. We show that there exists a
distribution D over non-contractive embeddings into trees f:X--&gt;T such that for
every x in X, the expectation with respect to D of the maximum over y in X of
the ratio d_T(f(x),f(y)) / d_X(x,y) is at most C (log n)^2, where C is a
universal constant. Conversely we show that the above quadratic dependence on
log n cannot be improved in general. Such embeddings, which we call maximum
gradient embeddings, yield a framework for the design of approximation
algorithms for a wide range of clustering problems with monotone costs,
including fault-tolerant versions of k-median and facility location.

 <dc:description>  Peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks such as BitTorrent and Avalanche are
increasingly used for disseminating potentially large files from a server to
many end users via the Internet. The key idea is to divide the file into many
equally-sized parts and then let users download each part (or, for network
coding based systems such as Avalanche, linear combinations of the parts)
either from the server or from another user who has already downloaded it.
However, their performance evaluation has typically been limited to comparing
one system relative to another and typically been realized by means of
simulation and measurements. In contrast, we provide an analytic performance
analysis that is based on a new uplink-sharing version of the well-known
broadcasting problem. Assuming equal upload capacities, we show that the
minimal time to disseminate the file is the same as for the simultaneous
send/receive version of the broadcasting problem. For general upload
capacities, we provide a mixed integer linear program (MILP) solution and a
complementary fluid limit solution. We thus provide a lower bound which can be
used as a performance benchmark for any P2P file dissemination system. We also
investigate the performance of a decentralized strategy, providing evidence
that the performance of necessarily decentralized P2P file dissemination
systems should be close to this bound and therefore that it is useful in
practice.

 <dc:title>Models simulation and interoperability using MDA and HLA</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Haouzi, Hind El</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the manufacturing context, there have been numerous efforts to use
modeling and simulation tools and techniques to improve manufacturing
efficiency over the last four decades. While an increasing number of
manufacturing system decisions are being made based on the use of models, their
use is still sporadic in many manufacturing environments. Our paper advocates
for an approach combining MDA (model driven architecture) and HLA (High Level
Architecture), the IEEE standard for modeling and simulation, in order to
overcome the deficiencies of current simulation methods at the level of
interoperability and reuse.

 <dc:description>  In the last few years, lot of work has been done in order to ensure
enterprise applications interoperability; however, proposed solutions focus
mainly on enterprise processes. Indeed, throughout product lifecycle
coordination needs to be established between reality in the physical world
(physical view) and the virtual world handled by manufacturing information
systems (informational view). This paper presents a holonic approach that
enables synchronisation of both physical and informational views. A model
driven approach for interoperability is proposed to ensure interoperability of
holon based models with other applications in the enterprise.

 <dc:title>A common framework for aspect mining based on crosscutting concern sorts</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The increasing number of aspect mining techniques proposed in literature
calls for a methodological way of comparing and combining them in order to
assess, and improve on, their quality. This paper addresses this situation by
proposing a common framework based on crosscutting concern sorts which allows
for consistent assessment, comparison and combination of aspect mining
techniques. The framework identifies a set of requirements that ensure
homogeneity in formulating the mining goals, presenting the results and
assessing their quality.
  We demonstrate feasibility of the approach by retrofitting an existing aspect
mining technique to the framework, and by using it to design and implement two
new mining techniques. We apply the three techniques to a known aspect mining
benchmark and show how they can be consistently assessed and combined to
increase the quality of the results. The techniques and combinations are
implemented in FINT, our publicly available free aspect mining tool.

 <dc:title>Hidden Markov Process: A New Representation, Entropy Rate and Estimation
  Entropy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rezaeian, Mohammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a pair of correlated processes {Z_n} and {S_n} (two sided), where
the former is observable and the later is hidden. The uncertainty in the
estimation of Z_n upon its finite past history is H(Z_n|Z_0^{n-1}), and for
estimation of S_n upon this observation is H(S_n|Z_0^{n-1}), which are both
sequences of n. The limits of these sequences (and their existence) are of
practical and theoretical interest. The first limit, if exists, is the entropy
rate. We call the second limit the estimation entropy. An example of a process
jointly correlated to another one is the hidden Markov process. It is the
memoryless observation of the Markov state process where state transitions are
independent of past observations. We consider a new representation of hidden
Markov process using iterated function system. In this representation the state
transitions are deterministically related to the process. This representation
provides a unified framework for the analysis of the two limiting entropies for
this process, resulting in integral expressions for the limits. This analysis
shows that under mild conditions the limits exist and provides a simple method
for calculating the elements of the corresponding sequences.

 <dc:title>Evaluating Variable Length Markov Chain Models for Analysis of User Web

 <dc:description>  Markov models have been widely used to represent and analyse user web
navigation data. In previous work we have proposed a method to dynamically
extend the order of a Markov chain model and a complimentary method for
assessing the predictive power of such a variable length Markov chain. Herein,
we review these two methods and propose a novel method for measuring the
ability of a variable length Markov model to summarise user web navigation
sessions up to a given length. While the summarisation ability of a model is
important to enable the identification of user navigation patterns, the ability
to make predictions is important in order to foresee the next link choice of a
user after following a given trail so as, for example, to personalise a web
site. We present an extensive experimental evaluation providing strong evidence
that prediction accuracy increases linearly with summarisation ability.

 <dc:title>New Algorithms for Regular Expression Matching</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bille, Philip</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we revisit the classical regular expression matching problem,
namely, given a regular expression $R$ and a string $Q$, decide if $Q$ matches
one of the strings specified by $R$. Let $m$ and $n$ be the length of $R$ and
$Q$, respectively. On a standard unit-cost RAM with word length $w \geq \log
n$, we show that the problem can be solved in $O(m)$ space with the following
running times: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  O(n\frac{m \log w}{w} + m \log w) &amp; \text{if $m &gt; w$} \\
  O(n\log m + m\log m) &amp; \text{if $\sqrt{w} &lt; m \leq w$} \\
  O(\min(n+ m^2, n\log m + m\log m)) &amp; \text{if $m \leq \sqrt{w}$.} \end{cases}
\end{equation*} This improves the best known time bound among algorithms using
$O(m)$ space. Whenever $w \geq \log^2 n$ it improves all known time bounds
regardless of how much space is used.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a method to adapt a general parser (Link Parser) to
sublanguages, focusing on the parsing of texts in biology. Our main proposal is
the use of terminology (identication and analysis of terms) in order to reduce
the complexity of the text to be parsed. Several other strategies are explored
and finally combined among which text normalization, lexicon and
morpho-guessing module extensions and grammar rules adaptation. We compare the
parsing results before and after these adaptations.

 <dc:description>  We study the adaptation of Link Grammar Parser to the biomedical sublanguage
with a focus on domain terms not found in a general parser lexicon. Using two
biomedical corpora, we implement and evaluate three approaches to addressing
unknown words: automatic lexicon expansion, the use of morphological clues, and
disambiguation using a part-of-speech tagger. We evaluate each approach
separately for its effect on parsing performance and consider combinations of
these approaches. In addition to a 45% increase in parsing efficiency, we find
that the best approach, incorporating information from a domain part-of-speech
tagger, offers a statistically signicant 10% relative decrease in error. The
adapted parser is available under an open-source license at

 <dc:description>  A symmetric version of the well-known SPM model for sandpiles is introduced.
We prove that the new model has fixed point dynamics. Although there might be
several fixed points, a precise description of the fixed points is given.
Moreover, we provide a simple closed formula for counting the number of fixed
points originated by initial conditions made of a single column of grains.

 <dc:title>Performance of Orthogonal Beamforming for SDMA with Limited Feedback</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  On the multi-antenna broadcast channel, the spatial degrees of freedom
support simultaneous transmission to multiple users. The optimal multiuser
transmission, known as dirty paper coding, is not directly realizable.
Moreover, close-to-optimal solutions such as Tomlinson-Harashima precoding are
sensitive to CSI inaccuracy. This paper considers a more practical design
called per user unitary and rate control (PU2RC), which has been proposed for
emerging cellular standards. PU2RC supports multiuser simultaneous
transmission, enables limited feedback, and is capable of exploiting multiuser
diversity. Its key feature is an orthogonal beamforming (or precoding)
constraint, where each user selects a beamformer (or precoder) from a codebook
of multiple orthonormal bases. In this paper, the asymptotic throughput scaling
laws for PU2RC with a large user pool are derived for different regimes of the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the multiuser-interference-limited regime, the
throughput of PU2RC is shown to scale logarithmically with the number of users.
In the normal SNR and noise-limited regimes, the throughput is found to scale
double logarithmically with the number of users and also linearly with the
number of antennas at the base station. In addition, numerical results show
that PU2RC achieves higher throughput and is more robust against CSI
quantization errors than the popular alternative of zero-forcing beamforming if
the number of users is sufficiently large.

 <dc:description>  Given some of the recent advances in Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based
Peer-To-Peer (P2P) systems we ask the following questions: Are there
applications where unstructured queries are still necessary (i.e., the
underlying queries do not efficiently map onto any structured framework), and
are there unstructured P2P systems that can deliver the high bandwidth and
computing performance necessary to support such applications. Toward this end,
we consider an image search application which supports queries based on image
similarity metrics, such as color histogram intersection, and discuss why in
this setting, standard DHT approaches are not directly applicable. We then
study the feasibility of implementing such an image search system on two
different unstructured P2P systems: power-law topology with percolation search,
and an optimized super-node topology using structured broadcasts. We examine
the average and maximum values for node bandwidth, storage and processing
requirements in the percolation and super-node models, and show that current
high-end computers and high-speed links have sufficient resources to enable
deployments of large-scale complex image search systems.

 <dc:title>Weighted hierarchical alignment of directed acyclic graph</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Falconer, Sean M.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In some applications of matching, the structural or hierarchical properties
of the two graphs being aligned must be maintained. The hierarchical properties
are induced by the direction of the edges in the two directed graphs. These
structural relationships defined by the hierarchy in the graphs act as a
constraint on the alignment. In this paper, we formalize the above problem as
the weighted alignment between two directed acyclic graphs. We prove that this
problem is NP-complete, show several upper bounds for approximating the
solution, and finally introduce polynomial time algorithms for sub-classes of
directed acyclic graphs.

 <dc:description>  We present a consistent system for referring crosscutting functionality,
relating crosscutting concerns to specific implementation idioms, and
formalizing their underlying relations through queries. The system is based on
generic crosscutting concerns that we organize and describe in a catalog.
  We have designed and implemented a tool support for querying source code for
instances of the proposed generic concerns and organizing them in composite
concern models. The composite concern model adds a new dimension to the
dominant decomposition of the system for describing and making explicit source
code relations specific to crosscutting concerns implementations.
  We use the proposed approach to describe crosscutting concerns in design
patterns and apply the tool to an opensource system (JHotDraw).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a deeper analysis than has previously been carried
out of a selective attention problem, and the evolution of continuous-time
recurrent neural networks to solve it. We show that the task has a rich
structure, and agents must solve a variety of subproblems to perform well. We
consider the relationship between the complexity of an agent and the ease with
which it can evolve behavior that generalizes well across subproblems, and
demonstrate a shaping protocol that improves generalization.

 <dc:description>  We make three different types of contributions to cost-sharing: First, we
identify several new classes of combinatorial cost functions that admit
incentive-compatible mechanisms achieving both a constant-factor approximation
of budget-balance and a polylogarithmic approximation of the social cost
formulation of efficiency. Second, we prove a new, optimal lower bound on the
approximate efficiency of every budget-balanced Moulin mechanism for Steiner
tree or SSRoB cost functions. This lower bound exposes a latent approximation
hierarchy among different cost-sharing problems. Third, we show that weakening
the definition of incentive-compatibility to strategyproofness can permit
exponentially more efficient approximately budget-balanced mechanisms, in
particular for set cover cost-sharing problems.

 <dc:description>  The lifting scheme of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is now quite well
established as an efficient technique for image compression, and has been
incorporated into the JPEG2000 standards. However, the potential of the lifting
scheme has not been exploited in the context of correlationbased processing,
such as encountered in radar applications. This paper presents a complete and
consistent framework for the application of DWT for correlation of complex
signals. In particular, lifting scheme factorization of biorthogonal
filterbanks is carried out in dual analysis basis spaces for multiresolution
correlation of complex radar signals in the DWT domain only. A causal
formulation of lifting for orthogonal filterbank is also developed. The
resulting parallel algorithms and consequent saving of computational effort are
briefly dealt with.

 <dc:title>Coding for Parallel Channels: Gallager Bounds for Binary Linear Codes
  with Applications to Repeat-Accumulate Codes and Variations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sason, I.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Goldenberg, I.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is focused on the performance analysis of binary linear block
codes (or ensembles) whose transmission takes place over independent and
memoryless parallel channels. New upper bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML)
decoding error probability are derived. These bounds are applied to various
ensembles of turbo-like codes, focusing especially on repeat-accumulate codes
and their recent variations which possess low encoding and decoding complexity
and exhibit remarkable performance under iterative decoding. The framework of
the second version of the Duman and Salehi (DS2) bounds is generalized to the
case of parallel channels, along with the derivation of their optimized tilting
measures. The connection between the generalized DS2 and the 1961 Gallager
bounds, addressed by Divsalar and by Sason and Shamai for a single channel, is
explored in the case of an arbitrary number of independent parallel channels.
The generalization of the DS2 bound for parallel channels enables to re-derive
specific bounds which were originally derived by Liu et al. as special cases of
the Gallager bound. In the asymptotic case where we let the block length tend
to infinity, the new bounds are used to obtain improved inner bounds on the
attainable channel regions under ML decoding. The tightness of the new bounds
for independent parallel channels is exemplified for structured ensembles of
turbo-like codes. The improved bounds with their optimized tilting measures
show, irrespectively of the block length of the codes, an improvement over the
union bound and other previously reported bounds for independent parallel
channels; this improvement is especially pronounced for moderate to large block
lengths.

 <dc:description>  The performance of maximum-likelihood (ML) decoded binary linear block codes

are valid for any memoryless, binary-input and output-symmetric communication
channel, and their effectiveness is exemplified for various ensembles of

of binary linear block codes further tightens the resulting upper bounds.

 <dc:description>  The performance of maximum-likelihood (ML) decoded binary linear block codes
over the AWGN channel is addressed via the tangential-sphere bound (TSB) and
two of its recent improved versions. The paper is focused on the derivation of
the error exponents of these bounds. Although it was exemplified that some
recent improvements of the TSB tighten this bound for finite-length codes, it
is demonstrated in this paper that their error exponents coincide. For an
arbitrary ensemble of binary linear block codes, the common value of these
error exponents is explicitly expressed in terms of the asymptotic growth rate
of the average distance spectrum.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new family of Belief Conditioning Rules (BCRs) for
belief revision. These rules are not directly related with the fusion of
several sources of evidence but with the revision of a belief assignment
available at a given time according to the new truth (i.e. conditioning
constraint) one has about the space of solutions of the problem.

 <dc:description>  Understanding a software system at source-code level requires understanding
the different concerns that it addresses, which in turn requires a way to
identify these concerns in the source code. Whereas some concerns are
explicitly represented by program entities (like classes, methods and
variables) and thus are easy to identify, crosscutting concerns are not
captured by a single program entity but are scattered over many program
entities and are tangled with the other concerns. Because of their crosscutting
nature, such crosscutting concerns are difficult to identify, and reduce the
understandability of the system as a whole.
  In this paper, we report on a combined experiment in which we try to identify
crosscutting concerns in the JHotDraw framework automatically. We first apply
three independently developed aspect mining techniques to JHotDraw and evaluate
and compare their results. Based on this analysis, we present three interesting
combinations of these three techniques, and show how these combinations provide
a more complete coverage of the detected concerns as compared to the original
techniques individually. Our results are a first step towards improving the
understandability of a system that contains crosscutting concerns, and can be
used as a basis for refactoring the identified crosscutting concerns into
aspects.

 <dc:description>  In 1960s V.Geodakian proposed a theory that explains sexes as a mechanism for
evolutionary adaptation of the species to changing environmental conditions. In
2001 V.Iskrin refined and augmented the concepts of Geodakian and gave a new
and interesting explanation to several phenomena which involve sex, and sex
ratio, including the war-years phenomena. He also introduced a new concept of
the &quot;catastrophic sex ratio.&quot; This note is an attempt to digest technical
aspects of the new ideas by Iskrin.

 <dc:description>  A plane graph is l-facially k-colourable if its vertices can be coloured with
k colours such that any two distinct vertices on a facial segment of length at
most l are coloured differently. We prove that every plane graph is 3-facially
11-colourable. As a consequence, we derive that every 2-connected plane graph
with maximum face-size at most 7 is cyclically 11-colourable. These two bounds
are for one off from those that are proposed by the (3l+1)-Conjecture and the
Cyclic Conjecture.

 <dc:description>  The paper studies different variants of almost periodicity notion. We
introduce the class of eventually strongly almost periodic sequences where some
suffix is strongly almost periodic (=uniformly recurrent). The class of almost
periodic sequences includes the class of eventually strongly almost periodic
sequences, and we prove this inclusion to be strict. We prove that the class of
eventually strongly almost periodic sequences is closed under finite automata
mappings and finite transducers. Moreover, an effective form of this result is
presented. Finally we consider some algorithmic questions concerning almost
periodicity.

 <dc:title>ITs, a structure sensitive information theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sattath, Samuel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Broadly speaking Information theory (IT) assumes no structure of the
underlying states. But what about contexts where states do have a clear
structure - how should IT cope with such situations? And if such coping is at
all possible then - how should structure be expressed so that it can be coped
with? A possible answer to these questions is presented here. Noting that IT
can cope well with a structure expressed as an accurate clustering (by shifting
to the implied reduced alphabet), a generalization is suggested in which
structure is expressed as a measure on reduced alphabets. Given such structure
an extension of IT is presented where the reduced alphabets are treated
simultaneously. This structure-sensitive IT, called ITs, extends traditional IT
in the sense that: a)there are structure-sensitive analogs to the notions of
traditional IT and b)translating a theorem in IT by replacing its notions with
their structure-sensitive counterparts, yields a (provable) theorem of ITs.
Seemingly paradoxically, ITs extends IT but it's completely within the
framework of IT. The richness of the suggested structures is demonstrated by
two disparate families studied in more detail: the family of hierarchical
structures and the family of linear structures. The formal findings extend the
scope of cases to which a rigorous application of IT can be applied (with
implications on quantization, for example). The implications on the foundations
of IT are that the assumption regarding no underlying structure of states is
not mandatory and that there is a framework for expressing such underlying
structure.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports on the INRIA group's approach to XML mining while
participating in the INEX XML Mining track 2005. We use a flexible
representation of XML documents that allows taking into account the structure
only or both the structure and content. Our approach consists of representing
XML documents by a set of their sub-paths, defined according to some criteria
(length, root beginning, leaf ending). By considering those sub-paths as words,
we can use standard methods for vocabulary reduction, and simple clustering
methods such as K-means that scale well. We actually use an implementation of
the clustering algorithm known as &quot;dynamic clouds&quot; that can work with distinct
groups of independent variables put in separate variables. This is useful in
our model since embedded sub-paths are not independent: we split potentially
dependant paths into separate variables, resulting in each of them containing
independant paths. Experiments with the INEX collections show good results for
the structure-only collections, but our approach could not scale well for large
structure-and-content collections.

 <dc:description>  We present here a formal foundation for an iterative and incremental approach
to constructing and evaluating preference queries. Our main focus is on query
modification: a query transformation approach which works by revising the
preference relation in the query. We provide a detailed analysis of the cases
where the order-theoretic properties of the preference relation are preserved
by the revision. We consider a number of different revision operators: union,
prioritized and Pareto composition. We also formulate algebraic laws that
enable incremental evaluation of preference queries. Finally, we consider two
variations of the basic framework: finite restrictions of preference relations
and weak-order extensions of strict partial order preference relations.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating the total probability of all symbols
that appear with a given frequency in a string of i.i.d. random variables with
unknown distribution. We focus on the regime in which the block length is large
yet no symbol appears frequently in the string. This is accomplished by
allowing the distribution to change with the block length. Under a natural
convergence assumption on the sequence of underlying distributions, we show
that the total probabilities converge to a deterministic limit, which we
characterize. We then show that the Good-Turing total probability estimator is
strongly consistent.

 <dc:description>  Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a well known method for information
retrieval. It has also been applied as a model of cognitive processing and
word-meaning acquisition. This dual importance of LSA derives from its capacity
to modulate the meaning of words by contexts, dealing successfully with
polysemy and synonymy. The underlying reasons that make the method work are not
clear enough. We propose that the method works because it detects an underlying
block structure (the blocks corresponding to topics) in the term by document
matrix. In real cases this block structure is hidden because of perturbations.
We propose that the correct explanation for LSA must be searched in the
structure of singular vectors rather than in the profile of singular values.
Using Perron-Frobenius theory we show that the presence of disjoint blocks of
documents is marked by sign-homogeneous entries in the vectors corresponding to
the documents of one block and zeros elsewhere. In the case of nearly disjoint
blocks, perturbation theory shows that if the perturbations are small the zeros
in the leading vectors are replaced by small numbers (pseudo-zeros). Since the
singular values of each block might be very different in magnitude, their order
does not mirror the order of blocks. When the norms of the blocks are similar,
LSA works fine, but we propose that when the topics have different sizes, the
usual procedure of selecting the first k singular triplets (k being the number
of blocks) should be replaced by a method that selects the perturbed Perron
vectors for each block.

 <dc:description>  Arithmetic constraints on integer intervals are supported in many constraint
programming systems. We study here a number of approaches to implement
constraint propagation for these constraints. To describe them we introduce
integer interval arithmetic. Each approach is explained using appropriate proof
rules that reduce the variable domains. We compare these approaches using a set
of benchmarks. For the most promising approach we provide results that
characterize the effect of constraint propagation. This is a full version of
our earlier paper, cs.PL/0403016.

 <dc:description>  The paper deals with orthogonal space-time block coded MC-CDMA systems in
outdoor realistic downlink scenarios with up to two transmit and receive
antennas. Assuming no channel state information at the transmitter, we compare
several linear single-user detection and spreading schemes, with or without
channel coding, achieving a spectral efficiency of 1-2 bits/s/Hz. The different
results obtained demonstrate that spatial diversity significantly improves the
performance of MC-CDMA systems, and allows different chip-mapping without
notably decreasing performance. Moreover, the global system exhibits a good
trade-off between complexity at mobile stations and performance. Then,
Alamouti's STBC MC-CDMA schemes derive full benefit from the frequency and
spatial diversities and can be considered as a very realistic and promising
candidate for the air interface downlink of the 4/sup th/ generation mobile
radio systems.

 <dc:description>  In 1965, Feynman wrote of using a lattice containing one dimension of space
and one dimension of time to derive aspects of quantum mechanics. Instead of
summing the behavior of all possible paths as he did, this paper will consider
the motion of single particles within this discrete Space-Time lattice,
sometimes called Feynman's Checkerboard. This empirical approach yielded
several predicted emergent properties for a discrete Space-Time lattice, one of
which is novel and testable.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces an objective function that seeks to minimise the
average total number of bits required to encode the joint state of all of the
layers of a Markov source. This type of encoder may be applied to the problem
of optimising the bottom-up (recognition model) and top-down (generative model)
connections in a multilayer neural network, and it unifies several previous
results on the optimisation of multilayer neural networks.

 <dc:title>Iterative Decoding Performance Bounds for LDPC Codes on Noisy Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hsu, Chun-Hao</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Anastasopoulos, Achilleas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The asymptotic iterative decoding performances of low-density parity-check
(LDPC) codes using min-sum (MS) and sum-product (SP) decoding algorithms on
memoryless binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS) channels are analyzed in this
paper. For MS decoding, the analysis is done by upper bounding the bit error
probability of the root bit of a tree code by the sequence error probability of
a subcode of the tree code assuming the transmission of the all-zero codeword.
The result is a recursive upper bound on the bit error probability after each
iteration. For SP decoding, we derive a recursively determined lower bound on
the bit error probability after each iteration. This recursive lower bound
recovers the density evolution equation of LDPC codes on the binary erasure
channel (BEC) with inequalities satisfied with equalities. A significant
implication of this result is that the performance of LDPC codes under SP
decoding on the BEC is an upper bound of the performance on all MBIOS channels
with the same uncoded bit error probability. All results hold for the more
general multi-edge type LDPC codes.

 <dc:description>  We consider Slepian-Wolf code design based on LDPC (low-density parity-check)
coset codes for memoryless source-side information pairs. A density evolution
formula, equipped with a concentration theorem, is derived for Slepian- Wolf
coding based on LDPC coset codes. As a consequence, an intimate connection
between Slepian-Wolf coding and channel coding is established. Specifically we
show that, under density evolution, design of binary LDPC coset codes for
Slepian-Wolf coding of an arbitrary memoryless source-side information pair
reduces to design of binary LDPC codes for binary-input output-symmetric
channels without loss of optimality. With this connection, many classic results
in channel coding can be easily translated into the Slepian-Wolf setting.

 <dc:description>  We show for an arbitrary $\ell_p$ norm that the property that a random
geometric graph $\mathcal G(n,r)$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle exhibits a sharp
threshold at $r=r(n)=\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\alpha_p n}}$, where $\alpha_p$ is the
area of the unit disk in the $\ell_p$ norm. The proof is constructive and
yields a linear time algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian cycle of $\RG$ a.a.s.,
provided $r=r(n)\ge\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{(\alpha_p -\epsilon)n}}$ for some fixed
$\epsilon &gt; 0$.

 <dc:title>Results on Parity-Check Matrices with Optimal Stopping and/or Dead-End

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The performance of iterative decoding techniques for linear block codes
correcting erasures depends very much on the sizes of the stopping sets
associated with the underlying Tanner graph, or, equivalently, the parity-check
matrix representing the code. In this paper, we introduce the notion of
dead-end sets to explicitly demonstrate this dependency. The choice of the
parity-check matrix entails a trade-off between performance and complexity. We
give bounds on the complexity of iterative decoders achieving optimal
performance in terms of the sizes of the underlying parity-check matrices.
Further, we fully characterize codes for which the optimal stopping set
enumerator equals the weight enumerator.

 <dc:description>  Small-world networks, which combine randomized and structured elements, are
seen as prevalent in nature. Several random graph models have been given for
small-world networks, with one of the most fruitful, introduced by Jon
Kleinberg, showing in which type of graphs it is possible to route, or
navigate, between vertices with very little knowledge of the graph itself.
Kleinberg's model is static, with random edges added to a fixed grid. In this
paper we introduce, analyze and test a randomized algorithm which successively
rewires a graph with every application. The resulting process gives a model for
the evolution of small-world networks with properties similar to those studied
by Kleinberg.

 <dc:description>  We consider algorithms for load balancing on unreliable machines. The
objective is to optimize the two criteria of minimizing the makespan and
minimizing job reassignments in response to machine failures. We assume that
the set of jobs is known in advance but that the pattern of machine failures is
unpredictable. Motivated by the requirements of BGP routing, we consider
path-independent algorithms, with the property that the job assignment is
completely determined by the subset of available machines and not the previous
history of the assignments. We examine first the question of performance
measurement of path-independent load-balancing algorithms, giving the measure
of makespan and the normalized measure of reassignments cost. We then describe
two classes of algorithms for optimizing these measures against an oblivious
adversary for identical machines. The first, based on independent random
assignments, gives expected reassignment costs within a factor of 2 of optimal
and gives a makespan within a factor of O(log m/log log m) of optimal with high
probability, for unknown job sizes. The second, in which jobs are first grouped
into bins and at most one bin is assigned to each machine, gives
constant-factor ratios on both reassignment cost and makespan, for known job
sizes. Several open problems are discussed.

communications) is the conversion of &quot;soft-bit&quot; messages to Gaussian messages.
By this method, the performance of a Kalman equalizer is improved, both for
uncoded and coded transmission.

 <dc:description>  Radio networks (RN) are distributed systems (\textit{ad hoc networks})
consisting in $n \ge 2$ radio stations. Assuming the number $n$ unknown, two
distinct models of RN without collision detection (\textit{no-CD}) are
addressed: the model with \textit{weak no-CD} RN and the one with
\textit{strong no-CD} RN. We design and analyze two distributed leader election
protocols, each one running in each of the above two (no-CD RN) models,
respectively. Both randomized protocols are shown to elect a leader within
$\BO(\log{(n)})$ expected time, with no station being awake for more than
$\BO(\log{\log{(n)}})$ time slots (such algorithms are said to be
\textit{energy-efficient}). Therefore, a new class of efficient algorithms is
set up that matchthe $\Omega(\log{(n)})$ time lower-bound established by
Kushilevitz and Mansour.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We model the development of the linear complexity of multisequences by a
stochastic infinite state machine, the Battery-Discharge-Model, BDM. The states
s in S of the BDM have asymptotic probabilities or mass Pr(s)=1/(P(q,M)
q^K(s)), where K(s) in N_0 is the class of the state s, and P(q,M)=\sum_(K
in\N0) P_M(K)q^(-K)=\prod_(i=1..M) q^i/(q^i-1) is the generating function of
the number of partitions into at most M parts. We have (for each timestep
modulo M+1) just P_M(K) states of class K \.
  We obtain a closed formula for the asymptotic probability for the linear
complexity deviation d(n) := L(n)-\lceil n\cdot M/(M+1)\rceil with
Pr(d)=O(q^(-|d|(M+1))), for M in N, for d in Z. The precise formula is given in
the text. It has been verified numerically for M=1..8, and is conjectured to
hold for all M in N.
  From the asymptotic growth (proven for all M in N), we infer the Law of the
Logarithm for the linear complexity deviation, -liminf_{n\to\infty} d_a(n) /
log n = 1 /((M+1)log q) = limsup_{n\to\infty} d_a(n) / log n, which immediately
yields L_a(n)/n \to M/(M+1) with measure one, for all M in N, a result recently
shown already by Niederreiter and Wang. Keywords: Linear complexity, linear
complexity deviation, multisequence, Battery Discharge Model, isometry.

 <dc:description>  Itai and Rodeh showed that, on the average, the communication of a leader
election algorithm takes no more than $LN$ bits, where $L \simeq 2.441716$ and
$N$ denotes the size of the ring. We give a precise asymptotic analysis of the
average number of rounds M(n) required by the algorithm, proving for example
that $\dis M(\infty) := \lim\_{n\to \infty} M(n) = 2.441715879...$, where $n$
is the number of starting candidates in the election. Accurate asymptotic
expressions of the second moment $M^{(2)}(n)$ of the discrete random variable
at hand, its probability distribution, and the generalization to all moments
are given. Corresponding asymptotic expansions $(n\to \infty)$ are provided for
sufficiently large $j$, where $j$ counts the number of rounds. Our numerical
results show that all computations perfectly fit the observed values. Finally,
we investigate the generalization to probability $t/n$, where $t$ is a non
negative real parameter. The real function $\dis M(\infty,t) := \lim\_{n\to
\infty} M(n,t)$ is shown to admit \textit{one unique minimum} $M(\infty,t^{*})$
on the real segment $(0,2)$. Furthermore, the variations of $M(\infty,t)$ on
thewhole real line are also studied in detail.

 <dc:description>  We prove that every triconnected planar graph is definable by a first order
sentence that uses at most 15 variables and has quantifier depth at most
$11\log_2 n+43$. As a consequence, a canonic form of such graphs is computable
in $AC^1$ by the 14-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm. This provides
another way to show that the planar graph isomorphism is solvable in $AC^1$.

 <dc:title>Quasi-Optimal Leader Election Algorithms in Radio Networks with

 <dc:description>  A radio network (RN) is a distributed system consisting of $n$ radio
stations. We design and analyze two distributed leader election protocols in RN
where the number $n$ of radio stations is unknown. The first algorithm runs
under the assumption of {\it limited collision detection}, while the second
assumes that {\it no collision detection} is available. By ``limited collision
detection'', we mean that if exactly one station sends (broadcasts) a message,
then all stations (including the transmitter) that are listening at this moment
receive the sent message. By contrast, the second no-collision-detection
algorithm assumes that a station cannot simultaneously send and listen signals.
Moreover, both protocols allow the stations to keep asleep as long as possible,
thus minimizing their awake time slots (such algorithms are called {\it
energy-efficient}). Both randomized protocols in RN areshown to elect a leader
in $O(\log{(n)})$ expected time, with no station being awake for more than
$O(\log{\log{(n)}})$ time slots. Therefore, a new class of efficient algorithms
is set up that match the $\Omega(\log{(n)})$ time lower-bound established by
Kushilevitz and Mansour.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we resolve an open problem regarding resettable zero knowledge
in the bare public-key (BPK for short) model: Does there exist constant round
resettable zero knowledge argument with concurrent soundness for $\mathcal{NP}$
in BPK model without assuming \emph{sub-exponential hardness}? We give a
positive answer to this question by presenting such a protocol for any language
in $\mathcal{NP}$ in the bare public-key model assuming only
collision-resistant hash functions against \emph{polynomial-time} adversaries.

 <dc:description>  Density matrices of graphs are combinatorial laplacians normalized to have
trace one (Braunstein \emph{et al.} \emph{Phys. Rev. A,} \textbf{73}:1, 012320
(2006)). If the vertices of a graph are arranged as an array, then its density
matrix carries a block structure with respect to which properties such as
separability can be considered. We prove that the so-called degree-criterion,
which was conjectured to be necessary and sufficient for separability of
density matrices of graphs, is equivalent to the PPT-criterion. As such it is
not sufficient for testing the separability of density matrices of graphs (we
provide an explicit example). Nonetheless, we prove the sufficiency when one of
the array dimensions has length two (for an alternative proof see Wu,
\emph{Phys. Lett. A}\textbf{351} (2006), no. 1-2, 18--22).
  Finally we derive a rational upper bound on the concurrence of density
matrices of graphs and show that this bound is exact for graphs on four
vertices.

 <dc:description>  The failure diagnosis for {\it discrete event systems} (DESs) has been given
considerable attention in recent years. Both on-line and off-line diagnostics
in the framework of DESs was first considered by Lin Feng in 1994, and
particularly an algorithm for diagnosability of DESs was presented. Motivated
by some existing problems to be overcome in previous work, in this paper, we
investigate the minimal cost algorithm for diagnosability of DESs.
  More specifically: (i) we give a generic method for judging a system's
off-line diagnosability, and the complexity of this algorithm is
polynomial-time; (ii) and in particular, we present an algorithm of how to
search for the minimal set in all observable event sets, whereas the previous
algorithm may find {\it non-minimal} one.

 <dc:title>Retouched Bloom Filters: Allowing Networked Applications to Flexibly
  Trade Off False Positives Against False Negatives</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Where distributed agents must share voluminous set membership information,
Bloom filters provide a compact, though lossy, way for them to do so. Numerous
recent networking papers have examined the trade-offs between the bandwidth
consumed by the transmission of Bloom filters, and the error rate, which takes
the form of false positives, and which rises the more the filters are
compressed. In this paper, we introduce the retouched Bloom filter (RBF), an
extension that makes the Bloom filter more flexible by permitting the removal
of selected false positives at the expense of generating random false
negatives. We analytically show that RBFs created through a random process
maintain an overall error rate, expressed as a combination of the false
positive rate and the false negative rate, that is equal to the false positive
rate of the corresponding Bloom filters. We further provide some simple
heuristics and improved algorithms that decrease the false positive rate more
than than the corresponding increase in the false negative rate, when creating
RBFs. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of an RBF over a Bloom filter in a
distributed network topology measurement application, where information about
large stop sets must be shared among route tracing monitors.

 <dc:title>Set-Theoretic Preliminaries for Computer Scientists</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>van Emden, M. H.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The basics of set theory are usually copied, directly or indirectly, by
computer scientists from introductions to mathematical texts. Often
mathematicians are content with special cases when the general case is of no
mathematical interest. But sometimes what is of no mathematical interest is of
great practical interest in computer science. For example, non-binary relations
in mathematics tend to have numerical indexes and tend to be unsorted. In the
theory and practice of relational databases both these simplifications are
unwarranted. In response to this situation we present here an alternative to
the ``set-theoretic preliminaries'' usually found in computer science texts.
This paper separates binary relations from the kind of relations that are
needed in relational databases. Its treatment of functions supports both
computer science in general and the kind of relations needed in databases. As a
sample application this paper shows how the mathematical theory of relations
naturally leads to the relational data model and how the operations on
relations are by themselves already a powerful vehicle for queries.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the development of the PALS system, an implementation of
Prolog capable of efficiently exploiting or-parallelism on distributed-memory
platforms--specifically Beowulf clusters. PALS makes use of a novel technique,
called incremental stack-splitting. The technique proposed builds on the
stack-splitting approach, previously described by the authors and
experimentally validated on shared-memory systems, which in turn is an
evolution of the stack-copying method used in a variety of parallel logic and
constraint systems--e.g., MUSE, YAP, and Penny. The PALS system is the first
distributed or-parallel implementation of Prolog based on the stack-splitting
method ever realized. The results presented confirm the superiority of this
method as a simple yet effective technique to transition from shared-memory to
distributed-memory systems. PALS extends stack-splitting by combining it with
incremental copying; the paper provides a description of the implementation of
PALS, including details of how distributed scheduling is handled. We also
investigate methodologies to effectively support order-sensitive predicates
(e.g., side-effects) in the context of the stack-splitting scheme. Experimental
results obtained from running PALS on both Shared Memory and Beowulf systems
are presented and analyzed.

 <dc:description>  The aim of the paper is to introduce general techniques in order to optimize
the parallel execution time of sorting on a distributed architectures with
processors of various speeds. Such an application requires a partitioning step.
For uniformly related processors (processors speeds are related by a constant
factor), we develop a constant time technique for mastering processor load and
execution time in an heterogeneous environment and also a technique to deal
with unknown cost functions. For non uniformly related processors, we use a
technique based on dynamic programming. Most of the time, the solutions are in
O(p) (p is the number of processors), independent of the problem size n.
Consequently, there is a small overhead regarding the problem we deal with but
it is inherently limited by the knowing of time complexity of the portion of
code following the partitioning.

 <dc:title>Towards a classical proof of exponential lower bound for 2-probe smooth
  codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jain, Rahul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let C: {0,1}^n -&gt; {0,1}^m be a code encoding an n-bit string into an m-bit
string. Such a code is called a (q, c, e) smooth code if there exists a
decoding algorithm which while decoding any bit of the input, makes at most q
probes on the code word and the probability that it looks at any location is at
most c/m. The error made by the decoding algorithm is at most e. Smooth codes
were introduced by Katz and Trevisan in connection with Locally decodable
codes.
  For 2-probe smooth codes Kerenedis and de Wolf have shown exponential in n
lower bound on m in case c and e are constants. Their lower bound proof went
through quantum arguments and interestingly there is no completely classical
argument as yet for the same (albeit completely classical !) statement.
  We do not match the bounds shown by Kerenedis and de Wolf but however show
the following. Let C: {0,1}^n -&gt; {0,1}^m be a (2,c,e) smooth code and if e &lt;=
c^2/8n^2, then m &gt;= 2^(n/320c^2 - 1)$. We hope that the arguments and
techniques used in this paper extend (or are helpful in making similar other
arguments), to match the bounds shown using quantum arguments. More so,
hopefully they extend to show bounds for codes with greater number of probes
where quantum arguments unfortunately do not yield good bounds (even for
3-probe codes).

 <dc:description>  An approach by which to analyze the performance of the code division multiple
access (CDMA) scheme, which is a core technology used in modern wireless
communication systems, is provided. The approach characterizes the objective
system by the eigenvalue spectrum of a cross-correlation matrix composed of
signature sequences used in CDMA communication, which enables us to handle a
wider class of CDMA systems beyond the basic model reported by Tanaka. The
utility of the novel scheme is shown by analyzing a system in which the
generation of signature sequences is designed for enhancing the orthogonality.

 <dc:description>  Currently many different modeling languages are used for workflow definitions
in BPM systems. Authors of this paper analyze the two most popular graphical
languages, with highest possibility of wide practical usage - UML Activity
diagrams (AD) and Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). The necessary in
practice workflow aspects are briefly discussed, and on this basis a natural AD
profile is proposed, which covers all of them. A functionally equivalent BPMN
subset is also selected. The semantics of both languages in the context of
process execution (namely, mapping to BPEL) is also analyzed in the paper. By
analyzing AD and BPMN metamodels, authors conclude that an exact transformation
from AD to BPMN is not trivial even for the selected subset, though these
languages are considered to be similar. Authors show how this transformation
could be defined in the MOLA transformation language.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study online multidimensional bin packing problem when all
items are hypercubes.
  Based on the techniques in one dimensional bin packing algorithm Super
Harmonic by Seiden, we give a framework for online hypercube packing problem
and obtain new upper bounds of asymptotic competitive ratios.
  For square packing, we get an upper bound of 2.1439, which is better than
2.24437.
  For cube packing, we also give a new upper bound 2.6852 which is better than
2.9421 by Epstein and van Stee.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we establish a general algorithmic framework between bin
packing and strip packing, with which we achieve the same asymptotic bounds by
applying bin packing algorithms to strip packing. More precisely we obtain the
following results: (1) Any offline bin packing algorithm can be applied to
strip packing maintaining the same asymptotic worst-case ratio. Thus using FFD
(MFFD) as a subroutine, we get a practical (simple and fast) algorithm for
strip packing with an upper bound 11/9 (71/60). A simple AFPTAS for strip
packing immediately follows. (2) A class of Harmonic-based algorithms for bin
packing can be applied to online strip packing maintaining the same asymptotic
competitive ratio. It implies online strip packing admits an upper bound of
1.58889 on the asymptotic competitive ratio, which is very close to the lower
bound 1.5401 and significantly improves the previously best bound of 1.6910 and
affirmatively answers an open question posed by Csirik et. al.

 <dc:title>PAC Classification based on PAC Estimates of Label Class Distributions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Palmer, Nick</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Goldberg, Paul W.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A standard approach in pattern classification is to estimate the
distributions of the label classes, and then to apply the Bayes classifier to
the estimates of the distributions in order to classify unlabeled examples. As
one might expect, the better our estimates of the label class distributions,
the better the resulting classifier will be. In this paper we make this
observation precise by identifying risk bounds of a classifier in terms of the
quality of the estimates of the label class distributions. We show how PAC
learnability relates to estimates of the distributions that have a PAC
guarantee on their $L_1$ distance from the true distribution, and we bound the
increase in negative log likelihood risk in terms of PAC bounds on the
KL-divergence. We give an inefficient but general-purpose smoothing method for
converting an estimated distribution that is good under the $L_1$ metric into a
distribution that is good under the KL-divergence.

 <dc:description>  We present the problem of &quot;Reject Inference&quot; for credit acceptance. Because
of the current legal framework (Basel II), credit institutions need to
industrialize their processes for credit acceptance, including Reject
Inference. We present here a methodology to compare various techniques of
Reject Inference and show that it is necessary, in the absence of real
theoretical results, to be able to produce and compare models adapted to
available data (selection of &quot;best&quot; model conditionnaly on data). We describe
some simulations run on a small data set to illustrate the approach and some
strategies for choosing the control group, which is the only valid approach to
Reject Inference.

 <dc:description>  Last years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of component platforms,
not only in classical application servers, but also more and more in the domain
of Embedded Systems. The OSGi(tm) platform is one of these platforms dedicated
to lightweight execution environments, and one of the most prominent. However,
new platforms also imply new security flaws, and a lack of both knowledge and
tools for protecting the exposed systems. This technical report aims at
fostering the understanding of security mechanisms in component deployment. It
focuses on securing the deployment of components. It presents the cryptographic
mechanisms necessary for signing OSGi(tm) bundles, as well as the detailed
process of bundle signature and validation. We also present the SFelix
platform, which is a secure extension to Felix OSGi(tm) framework
implementation. It includes our implementation of the bundle signature process,
as specified by OSGi(tm) Release 4 Security Layer. Moreover, a tool for signing
and publishing bundles, SFelix JarSigner, has been developed to conveniently
integrate bundle signature in the bundle deployment process.

 <dc:description>  We describe a system that lets a designer interactively draw patterns of
strokes in the picture plane, then guide the synthesis of similar patterns over
new picture regions. Synthesis is based on an initial user-assisted analysis
phase in which the system recognizes distinct types of strokes (hatching and
stippling) and organizes them according to perceptual grouping criteria. The
synthesized strokes are produced by combining properties (eg. length,
orientation, parallelism, proximity) of the stroke groups extracted from the
input examples. We illustrate our technique with a drawing application that
allows the control of attributes and scale-dependent reproduction of the
synthesized patterns.

 <dc:description>  Diagrammatic, analogical or iconic representations are often contrasted with
linguistic or logical representations, in which the shape of the symbols is
arbitrary. The aim of this paper is to make a case for the usefulness of
diagrams in inferential knowledge representation systems. Although commonly
used, diagrams have for a long time suffered from the reputation of being only
a heuristic tool or a mere support for intuition. The first part of this paper
is an historical background paying tribute to the logicians, psychologists and
computer scientists who put an end to this formal prejudice against diagrams.
The second part is a discussion of their characteristics as opposed to those of
linguistic forms. The last part is aimed at reviving the interest for
heterogeneous representation systems including both linguistic and diagrammatic
representations.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to propose a method for tagging named entities (NE),
using natural language processing techniques. Beyond their literal meaning,
named entities are frequently subject to metonymy. We show the limits of
current NE type hierarchies and detail a new proposal aiming at dynamically
capturing the semantics of entities in context. This model can analyze complex
linguistic phenomena like metonymy, which are known to be difficult for natural
language processing but crucial for most applications. We present an
implementation and some test using the French ESTER corpus and give significant
results.

 <dc:description>  Questions related to the evolution of language have recently known an
impressive increase of interest (Briscoe, 2002). This short paper aims at
questioning the scientific status of these models and their relations to
attested data. We show that one cannot directly model non-linguistic factors
(exogenous factors) even if they play a crucial role in language evolution. We
then examine the relation between linguistic models and attested language data,
as well as their contribution to cognitive linguistics.

 <dc:description>  Considerable thought has been devoted to an adequate definition of the class
of infinite, random binary sequences (the sort of sequence that almost
certainly arises from flipping a fair coin indefinitely). The first
mathematical exploration of this problem was due to R. Von Mises, and based on
his concept of a &quot;selection function.&quot; A decisive objection to Von Mises' idea
was formulated in a theorem offered by Jean Ville in 1939. It shows that some
sequences admitted by Von Mises as &quot;random&quot; in fact manifest a certain kind of
systematicity. Ville's proof is challenging, and an alternative approach has
appeared only in condensed form. We attempt to provide an expanded version of
the latter, alternative argument.

clique trees. Next we define a symmetric binary relation between the set of

non-uniqueness of clique trees.

 <dc:description>  The formalizations of periods of time inside a linear model of Time are
usually based on the notion of intervals, that may contain or may not their
endpoints. This is not enought when the periods are written in terms of coarse
granularities with respect to the event taken into account. For instance, how
to express the inter-war period in terms of a {\em years} interval? This paper
presents a new type of intervals, neither open, nor closed or open-closed and
the extension of operations on intervals of this new type, in order to reduce
the gap between the discourse related to temporal relationship and its
translation into a discretized model of Time.

 <dc:description>  We study the sizes of connected components according to their excesses during
a random graph process built with $n$ vertices. The considered model is the
continuous one defined in Janson 2000. An ${\ell}$-component is a connected
component with ${\ell}$ edges more than vertices. $\ell$ is also called the
\textit{excess} of such component. As our main result, we show that when $\ell$
and ${n \over \ell}$ are both large, the expected number of vertices that ever
belong to an $\ell$-component is about ${12}^{1/3} {\ell}^{1/3} n^{2/3}$. We
also obtain limit theorems for the number of creations of $\ell$-components.

 <dc:title>Craig's Interpolation Theorem formalised and mechanised in Isabelle/HOL</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ridge, Tom</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We formalise and mechanise a construtive, proof theoretic proof of Craig's
Interpolation Theorem in Isabelle/HOL. We give all the definitions and lemma
statements both formally and informally. We also transcribe informally the
formal proofs. We detail the main features of our mechanisation, such as the
formalisation of binding for first order formulae. We also give some
applications of Craig's Interpolation Theorem.

 <dc:description>  Denote by an $\ell$-component a connected $b$-uniform hypergraph with $k$
edges and $k(b-1) - \ell$ vertices. We prove that the expected number of
creations of $\ell$-component during a random hypergraph process tends to 1 as
$\ell$ and $b$ tend to $\infty$ with the total number of vertices $n$ such that
$\ell = o(\sqrt[3]{\frac{n}{b}})$. Under the same conditions, we also show that
the expected number of vertices that ever belong to an $\ell$-component is
approximately $12^{1/3} (b-1)^{1/3} \ell^{1/3} n^{2/3}$. As an immediate
consequence, it follows that with high probability the largest $\ell$-component
during the process is of size $O((b-1)^{1/3} \ell^{1/3} n^{2/3})$. Our results
give insight about the size of giant components inside the phase transition of
random hypergraphs.

 <dc:title>On Some Peculiarities of Dynamic Switch between Component
  Implementations in an Autonomic Computing System</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Behavior of the delta algorithm of autonomic switch between two component
implementations is considered on several examples of a client-server systems
involving, in particular, periodic change of intensities of requests for the
component. It is shown that in the cases of some specific combinations of
elementary requests costs, the number of clients in the system, the number of
requests per unit of time, and the cost of switch between the implementations,
the algorithm may reveal behavior that is rather far from the desired. A
sufficient criterion of a success of the algorithm is proposed based on the
analysis of the accumulated implementations costs difference as a function of
time. Suggestions are pointed out of practical evaluation of the algorithm
functioning regarding the observations made in this paper.

 <dc:description>  We investigate whether one can determine from the transcripts of U.S.
Congressional floor debates whether the speeches represent support of or
opposition to proposed legislation. To address this problem, we exploit the
fact that these speeches occur as part of a discussion; this allows us to use
sources of information regarding relationships between discourse segments, such
as whether a given utterance indicates agreement with the opinion expressed by
another. We find that the incorporation of such information yields substantial
improvements over classifying speeches in isolation.

 <dc:title>Prioritizing Software Inspection Results using Static Profiling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Boogerd, Cathal</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Moonen, Leon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Static software checking tools are useful as an additional automated software
inspection step that can easily be integrated in the development cycle and
assist in creating secure, reliable and high quality code. However, an often
quoted disadvantage of these tools is that they generate an overly large number
of warnings, including many false positives due to the approximate analysis
techniques. This information overload effectively limits their usefulness.
  In this paper we present ELAN, a technique that helps the user prioritize the
information generated by a software inspection tool, based on a demand-driven
computation of the likelihood that execution reaches the locations for which
warnings are reported. This analysis is orthogonal to other prioritization
techniques known from literature, such as severity levels and statistical
analysis to reduce false positives. We evaluate feasibility of our technique
using a number of case studies and assess the quality of our predictions by
comparing them to actual values obtained by dynamic profiling.

 <dc:title>How to Find Good Finite-Length Codes: From Art Towards Science</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We explain how to optimize finite-length LDPC codes for transmission over the
binary erasure channel. Our approach relies on an analytic approximation of the
erasure probability. This is in turn based on a finite-length scaling result to
model large scale erasures and a union bound involving minimal stopping sets to
take into account small error events. We show that the performances of
optimized ensembles as observed in simulations are well described by our
approximation. Although we only address the case of transmission over the
binary erasure channel, our method should be applicable to a more general
setting.

 <dc:title>Decomposable Theories</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Djelloul, Khalil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present in this paper a general algorithm for solving first-order formulas
in particular theories called &quot;decomposable theories&quot;. First of all, using
special quantifiers, we give a formal characterization of decomposable theories
and show some of their properties. Then, we present a general algorithm for
solving first-order formulas in any decomposable theory &quot;T&quot;. The algorithm is
given in the form of five rewriting rules. It transforms a first-order formula
&quot;P&quot;, which can possibly contain free variables, into a conjunction &quot;Q&quot; of
solved formulas easily transformable into a Boolean combination of
existentially quantified conjunctions of atomic formulas. In particular, if &quot;P&quot;
has no free variables then &quot;Q&quot; is either the formula &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. The
correctness of our algorithm proves the completeness of the decomposable
theories.
  Finally, we show that the theory &quot;Tr&quot; of finite or infinite trees is a
decomposable theory and give some benchmarks realized by an implementation of
our algorithm, solving formulas on two-partner games in &quot;Tr&quot; with more than 160
nested alternated quantifiers.

 <dc:description>  What is the value of a scientist and its impact upon the scientific thinking?
How can we measure the prestige of a journal or of a conference? The evaluation
of the scientific work of a scientist and the estimation of the quality of a
journal or conference has long attracted significant interest, due to the
benefits from obtaining an unbiased and fair criterion. Although it appears to
be simple, defining a quality metric is not an easy task. To overcome the
disadvantages of the present metrics used for ranking scientists and journals,
J.E. Hirsch proposed a pioneering metric, the now famous h-index. In this
article, we demonstrate several inefficiencies of this index and develop a pair
of generalizations and effective variants of it to deal with scientist ranking
and with publication forum ranking. The new citation indices are able to
disclose trendsetters in scientific research, as well as researchers that
constantly shape their field with their influential work, no matter how old
they are. We exhibit the effectiveness and the benefits of the new indices to
unfold the full potential of the h-index, with extensive experimental results
obtained from DBLP, a widely known on-line digital library.

 <dc:title>Competing with stationary prediction strategies</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce the class of stationary prediction strategies and
construct a prediction algorithm that asymptotically performs as well as the
best continuous stationary strategy. We make mild compactness assumptions but
no stochastic assumptions about the environment. In particular, no assumption
of stationarity is made about the environment, and the stationarity of the
considered strategies only means that they do not depend explicitly on time; we
argue that it is natural to consider only stationary strategies even for highly
non-stationary environments.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we illustrate an algorithm for the computation of the weight
distribution of CRC codes. The recursive structure of CRC codes will give us an
iterative way to compute the weight distribution of their dual codes starting
from just some ``representative'' words. Thanks to MacWilliams Theorem, the
computation of the weight distribution of dual codes can be easily brought back
to that of CRC codes. This algorithm is a good alternative to the standard
algorithm that involves listing every word of the code.

 <dc:description>  A 1-dimensional generalization of the well known Logistic Map is proposed.
The proposed family of maps is referred to as the B-Exponential Map. The
dynamics of this map are analyzed and found to have interesting properties. In
particular, the B-Exponential Map exhibits robust chaos for all real values of
the parameter B &gt;= e^(-4). We then propose a pseudo-random number generator
based on the B-Exponential Map by chaotically hopping between different
trajectories for different values of B. We call this BEACH (B-Exponential
All-Chaotic Map Hopping) pseudo-random number generator. BEACH successfully
passes stringent statistical randomness tests such as ENT, NIST and Diehard. An
implementation of BEACH is also outlined.

 <dc:description>  The presented work proposes a novel approach to model the citation rate. The
paper begins with a brief introduction into informetrics studies and highlights
drawbacks of the contemporary approaches to modeling the citation process as a
product of social interactions. An alternative modeling framework based on
results obtained in cognitive psychology is then introduced and applied in an
experiment to investigate properties of the citation process, as they are
revealed by a large collection of citation statistics. Major research findings
are discussed, and a summary is given.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents our evaluation of using a Tablet-PC to provide
peer-review comments in the first year Computer Science course. Our exploration
consisted of an evaluation of how students write comments on other students'
assignments using three different methods: pen and paper, a Tablet-PC, and a
desktop computer. Our ultimate goal is to explore the effect that interface
style (Tablet vs. Desktop) has on the quality and quantity of the comments
provided.

 <dc:title>Counting good truth assignments of random k-SAT formulae</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a deterministic approximation algorithm to compute logarithm of
the number of `good' truth assignments for a random k-satisfiability (k-SAT)
formula in polynomial time (by `good' we mean that violate a small fraction of
clauses). The relative error is bounded above by an arbitrarily small constant
epsilon with high probability as long as the clause density (ratio of clauses
to variables) alpha&lt;alpha_{u}(k) = 2k^{-1}\log k(1+o(1)). The algorithm is
based on computation of marginal distribution via belief propagation and use of
an interpolation procedure. This scheme substitutes the traditional one based
on approximation of marginal probabilities via MCMC, in conjunction with
self-reduction, which is not easy to extend to the present problem.
  We derive 2k^{-1}\log k (1+o(1)) as threshold for uniqueness of the Gibbs
distribution on satisfying assignment of random infinite tree k-SAT formulae to
establish our results, which is of interest in its own right.

 <dc:description>  Two product array codes are used to construct the (24, 12, 8) binary Golay
code through the direct sum operation. This construction provides a systematic
way to find proper (8, 4, 4) linear block component codes for generating the
Golay code, and it generates and extends previously existing methods that use a
similar construction framework. The code constructed is simple to decode.

 <dc:title>On entropy for mixtures of discrete and continuous variables</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with support $S$ and $f : S \to
S^\prime$ be a bijection. Then it is well-known that the entropy of $X$ is the
same as the entropy of $f(X)$. This entropy preservation property has been
well-utilized to establish non-trivial properties of discrete stochastic
processes, e.g. queuing process \cite{prg03}. Entropy as well as entropy
preservation is well-defined only in the context of purely discrete or
continuous random variables. However for a mixture of discrete and continuous
random variables, which arise in many interesting situations, the notions of
entropy and entropy preservation have not been well understood.
  In this paper, we extend the notion of entropy in a natural manner for a
mixed-pair random variable, a pair of random variables with one discrete and
the other continuous. Our extensions are consistent with the existing
definitions of entropy in the sense that there exist natural injections from
discrete or continuous random variables into mixed-pair random variables such
that their entropy remains the same. This extension of entropy allows us to
obtain sufficient conditions for entropy preservation in mixtures of discrete
and continuous random variables under bijections.
  The extended definition of entropy leads to an entropy rate for continuous
time Markov chains. As an application, we recover a known probabilistic result
related to Poisson process. We strongly believe that the frame-work developed
in this paper can be useful in establishing probabilistic properties of complex
processes, such as load balancing systems, queuing network, caching algorithms.

 <dc:title>Capacity of Cooperative Fusion in the Presence of Byzantine Sensors</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kosut, Oliver</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tong, Lang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of cooperative fusion in the presence of Byzantine sensors is
considered. An information theoretic formulation is used to characterize the
Shannon capacity of sensor fusion. It is shown that when less than half of the
sensors are Byzantine, the effect of Byzantine attack can be entirely
mitigated, and the fusion capacity is identical to that when all sensors are
honest. But when at least half of the sensors are Byzantine, they can
completely defeat the sensor fusion so that no information can be transmitted
reliably. A capacity achieving transmit-then-verify strategy is proposed for
the case that less than half of the sensors are Byzantine, and its error
probability and coding rate is analyzed by using a Markov decision process
modeling of the transmission protocol.

 <dc:title>Fault-Tolerant Real-Time Streaming with FEC thanks to Capillary

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Erasure resilient FEC codes in off-line packetized streaming rely on time
diversity. This requires unrestricted buffering time at the receiver. In
real-time streaming the playback buffering time must be very short. Path
diversity is an orthogonal strategy. However, the large number of long paths
increases the number of underlying links and consecutively the overall link
failure rate. This may increase the overall requirement in redundant FEC
packets for combating the link failures. We introduce the Redundancy Overall
Requirement (ROR) metric, a routing coefficient specifying the total number of
FEC packets required for compensation of all underlying link failures. We
present a capillary routing algorithm for constructing layer by layer steadily
diversifying multi-path routing patterns. By measuring the ROR coefficients of
a dozen of routing layers on hundreds of network samples, we show that the
number of required FEC packets decreases substantially when the path diversity
is increased by the capillary routing construction algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Recently, lattice-reduction-aided detectors have been proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to give performance with full
diversity like maximum likelihood receiver, and yet with complexity similar to
linear receivers. However, these lattice-reduction-aided detectors are based on
the traditional LLL reduction algorithm that was originally introduced for
reducing real lattice bases, in spite of the fact that the channel matrices are
inherently complex-valued. In this paper, we introduce the complex LLL
algorithm for direct application to reduce the basis of a complex lattice which
is naturally defined by a complex-valued channel matrix. We prove that complex
LLL reduction-aided detection can also achieve full diversity. Our analysis
reveals that the new complex LLL algorithm can achieve a reduction in
complexity of nearly 50% over the traditional LLL algorithm, and this is
confirmed by simulation. It is noteworthy that the complex LLL algorithm
aforementioned has nearly the same bit-error-rate performance as the
traditional LLL algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The length-based approach is a heuristic for solving randomly generated
equations in groups which possess a reasonably behaved length function. We
describe several improvements of the previously suggested length-based
algorithms, that make them applicable to Thompson's group with significant
success rates. In particular, this shows that the Shpilrain-Ushakov public key
cryptosystem based on Thompson's group is insecure, and suggests that no
practical public key cryptosystem based on this group can be secure.

 <dc:description>  We introduce and use k-shell decomposition to investigate the topology of the
Internet at the AS level. Our analysis separates the Internet into three
sub-components: (a) a nucleus which is a small (~100 nodes) very well connected
globally distributed subgraph; (b) a fractal sub-component that is able to
connect the bulk of the Internet without congesting the nucleus, with self
similar properties and critical exponents; and (c) dendrite-like structures,
usually isolated nodes that are connected to the rest of the network through
the nucleus only. This unique decomposition is robust, and provides insight
into the underlying structure of the Internet and its functional consequences.
Our approach is general and useful also when studying other complex networks.

stratification is the main purpose of this work. A special experimental solar
module for hot water was build and equipped with sufficient measure apparatus.
The main concept of investigation is to optimise the stratified regime of
thermal accumulation and constructive parameters of heat exchange equipment
(heat serpentine in tank). Accumulation and heat exchange processes were
investigated by theoretical end experimental means. Special mathematical model
was composed to simulate the energy transfer in stratified tank. Computer
program was developed to solve mathematical equations for thermal accumulation
and energy exchange. Extensive numerical and experimental tests were carried
out. A good correspondence between theoretical and experimental data was
arrived. Keywords: Mathematical modelling, accumulation

 <dc:description>  Knowing the norms of a domain is crucial, but there exist no repository of
norms. We propose a method to extract them from texts: texts generally do not
describe a norm, but rather how a state-of-affairs differs from it. Answers
concerning the cause of the state-of-affairs described often reveal the
implicit norm. We apply this idea to the domain of driving, and validate it by
designing algorithms that identify, in a text, the &quot;basic&quot; norms to which it
refers implicitly.

 <dc:title>Using Pseudo-Stochastic Rational Languages in Probabilistic Grammatical
  Inference</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In probabilistic grammatical inference, a usual goal is to infer a good
approximation of an unknown distribution P called a stochastic language. The
estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as
probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models
based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA
are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic
languages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical
representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable,
it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES,
introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is
not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA
that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use
these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader
class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages.
The aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of
pseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for
example that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have
carried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical
inference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI. They show that DEES outperforms
them in most cases.

 <dc:title>Representing Knowledge about Norms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kayser, Daniel</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Norms are essential to extend inference: inferences based on norms are far
richer than those based on logical implications. In the recent decades, much
effort has been devoted to reason on a domain, once its norms are represented.
How to extract and express those norms has received far less attention.
Extraction is difficult: as the readers are supposed to know them, the norms of
a domain are seldom made explicit. For one thing, extracting norms requires a
language to represent them, and this is the topic of this paper. We apply this
language to represent norms in the domain of driving, and show that it is
adequate to reason on the causes of accidents, as described by car-crash
reports.

 <dc:description>  In the context of human action recognition in video sequences, a temporal
belief filter is presented. It allows to cope with human action disparity and
low quality videos. The whole system of action recognition is based on the
Transferable Belief Model (TBM) proposed by P. Smets. The TBM allows to
explicitly model the doubt between actions. Furthermore, the TBM emphasizes the
conflict which is exploited for action recognition. The filtering performance
is assessed on real video sequences acquired by a moving camera and under
several unknown view angles.

 <dc:description>  Superregular matrices are a class of lower triangular Toeplitz matrices that
arise in the context of constructing convolutional codes having a maximum
distance profile. These matrices are characterized by the property that no
submatrix has a zero determinant unless it is trivially zero due to the lower
triangular structure. In this paper, we discuss how superregular matrices may
be used to construct codes having a maximum distance profile. We also introduce
group actions that preserve the superregularity property and present an upper
bound on the minimum size a finite field must have in order that a superregular
matrix of a given size can exist over that field.

 <dc:description>  This article investigates Kak neural networks, which can be instantaneously
trained, for complex and quaternion inputs. The performance of the basic
algorithm has been analyzed and shown how it provides a plausible model of
human perception and understanding of images. The motivation for studying
quaternion inputs is their use in representing spatial rotations that find
applications in computer graphics, robotics, global navigation, computer vision
and the spatial orientation of instruments. The problem of efficient mapping of
data in quaternion neural networks is examined. Some problems that need to be
addressed before quaternion neural networks find applications are identified.

 <dc:title>Representing graphs as the intersection of axis-parallel cubes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A unit cube in $k$ dimensional space (or \emph{$k$-cube} in short) is defined
as the Cartesian product $R_1\times R_2\times...\times R_k$ where $R_i$(for
$1\leq i\leq k$) is a closed interval of the form $[a_i,a_i+1]$ on the real
line. A $k$-cube representation of a graph $G$ is a mapping of the vertices of
$G$ to $k$-cubes such that two vertices in $G$ are adjacent if and only if
their corresponding $k$-cubes have a non-empty intersection. The
\emph{cubicity} of $G$, denoted as $\cubi(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$
has a $k$-cube representation. Roberts \cite{Roberts} showed that for any graph
$G$ on $n$ vertices, $\cubi(G)\leq 2n/3$. Many NP-complete graph problems have
polynomial time deterministic algorithms or have good approximation ratios in
graphs of low cubicity. In most of these algorithms, computing a low
dimensional cube representation of the given graph is usually the first step.
  We present an efficient algorithm to compute the $k$-cube representation of
$G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ in $O(\Delta \ln b)$ dimensions where $b$ is
the bandwidth of $G$. Bandwidth of $G$ is at most $n$ and can be much lower.
The algorithm takes as input a bandwidth ordering of the vertices in $G$.
Though computing the bandwidth ordering of vertices for a graph is NP-hard,
there are heuristics that perform very well in practice. Even theoretically,
there is an $O(\log^4 n)$ approximation algorithm for computing the bandwidth
ordering of a graph using which our algorithm can produce a $k$-cube
representation of any given graph in $k=O(\Delta(\ln b + \ln\ln n))$
dimensions. Both the bounds on cubicity are shown to be tight upto a factor of
$O(\log\log n)$.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we derive Gallager's random coding error exponent for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, assuming no channel-state
information (CSI) at the transmitter and perfect CSI at the receiver. This
measure gives insight into a fundamental tradeoff between the communication
reliability and information rate of MIMO channels, enabling to determine the
required codeword length to achieve a prescribed error probability at a given
rate below the channel capacity. We quantify the effects of the number of
antennas, channel coherence time, and spatial fading correlation on the MIMO
exponent. In addition, general formulae for the ergodic capacity and the cutoff
rate in the presence of spatial correlation are deduced from the exponent
expressions. These formulae are applicable to arbitrary structures of transmit
and receive correlation, encompassing all the previously known results as
special cases of our expressions.

 <dc:title>Logical settings for concept learning from incomplete examples in First

 <dc:creator>Ventos, V&#xe9;ronique</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate here concept learning from incomplete examples. Our first
purpose is to discuss to what extent logical learning settings have to be
modified in order to cope with data incompleteness. More precisely we are
interested in extending the learning from interpretations setting introduced by
L. De Raedt that extends to relational representations the classical
propositional (or attribute-value) concept learning from examples framework. We
are inspired here by ideas presented by H. Hirsh in a work extending the
Version space inductive paradigm to incomplete data. H. Hirsh proposes to
slightly modify the notion of solution when dealing with incomplete examples: a
solution has to be a hypothesis compatible with all pieces of information
concerning the examples. We identify two main classes of incompleteness. First,
uncertainty deals with our state of knowledge concerning an example. Second,
generalization (or abstraction) deals with what part of the description of the
example is sufficient for the learning purpose. These two main sources of
incompleteness can be mixed up when only part of the useful information is
known. We discuss a general learning setting, referred to as &quot;learning from
possibilities&quot; that formalizes these ideas, then we present a more specific
learning setting, referred to as &quot;assumption-based learning&quot; that cope with
examples which uncertainty can be reduced when considering contextual
information outside of the proper description of the examples. Assumption-based
learning is illustrated on a recent work concerning the prediction of a
consensus secondary structure common to a set of RNA sequences.

 <dc:description>  In the widely used 802.11 standard, the so called performance anomaly is a
well known issue. Several works have tried to solve this problem by introducing
mechanisms such as packet fragmentation, backoff adaptation, or packet
aggregation during a fixed time interval. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach solving the performance anomaly problem by packet aggregation using a
dynamic time interval, which depends on the busy time of the wireless medium.
Our solution differs from other proposition in the literature because of this
dynamic time interval, which allows increasing fairness, reactivity, and in
some cases efficiency. In this article, we emphasize the performance evaluation
of our proposal.

first steps toward extending the quick randomized decoding tools of RM(1) into
the realm of quadratic binary and, equivalently, Z_4 codes. Our main
algorithmic result is an extension of the RM(1) techniques from Goldreich-Levin
and Kushilevitz-Mansour algorithms to the Hankel code, a code between RM(1) and
RM(2). That is, given signal s of length N, we find a list that is a superset
of all Hankel codewords phi with dot product to s at least (1/sqrt(k)) times
the norm of s, in time polynomial in k and log(N). We also give a new and
simple formulation of a known Kerdock code as a subcode of the Hankel code. As
a corollary, we can list-decode Kerdock, too. Also, we get a quick algorithm
for finding a sparse Kerdock approximation. That is, for k small compared with
1/sqrt{N} and for epsilon &gt; 0, we find, in time polynomial in (k
log(N)/epsilon), a k-Kerdock-term approximation s~ to s with Euclidean error at
most the factor (1+epsilon+O(k^2/sqrt{N})) times that of the best such
approximation.

 <dc:title>Degrees of Freedom Region for the MIMO X Channel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jafar, Syed A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shamai, Shlomo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We provide achievability as well as converse results for the degrees of
freedom region of a MIMO $X$ channel, i.e., a system with two transmitters, two
receivers, each equipped with multiple antennas, where independent messages
need to be conveyed over fixed channels from each transmitter to each receiver.
With M=1 antennas at each node, we find that the total (sum rate) degrees of
freedom are bounded above and below as $1 \leq\eta_X^\star \leq {4/3}$. If
$M&gt;1$ and channel matrices are non-degenerate then the precise degrees of
freedom $\eta_X^\star = {4/3}M$. Simple zero forcing without dirty paper
encoding or successive decoding, suffices to achieve the ${4/3}M$ degrees of
freedom. With equal number of antennas at all nodes, we explore the increase in
degrees of freedom when some of the messages are made available to a
transmitter or receiver in the manner of cognitive radio. With a cognitive
transmitter we show that the number of degrees of freedom $\eta = {3/2}M$ (for
$M&gt;1$) on the MIMO $X$ channel. The same degrees of freedom are obtained on the
MIMO $X$ channel with a cognitive receiver as well. In contrast to the $X$
channel result, we show that for the MIMO \emph{interference} channel, the
degrees of freedom are not increased even if both the transmitter and the
receiver of one user know the other user's message. However, the interference
channel can achieve the full $2M$ degrees of freedom if \emph{each} user has
either a cognitive transmitter or a cognitive receiver. Lastly, if the channels
vary with time/frequency then the $X$ channel with single antennas $(M=1)$ at
all nodes has exactly 4/3 degrees of freedom with no shared messages and
exactly 3/2 degrees of freedom with a cognitive transmitter or a cognitive
receiver.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the 3D strip packing problem in which we are given a
list of 3-dimensional boxes and required to pack all of them into a
3-dimensional strip with length 1 and width 1 and unlimited height to minimize
the height used. Our results are below: i) we give an approximation algorithm
with asymptotic worst-case ratio 1.69103, which improves the previous best
bound of $2+\epsilon$ by Jansen and Solis-Oba of SODA 2006; ii) we also present
an asymptotic PTAS for the case in which all items have {\em square} bases.

 <dc:title>Deriving Escape Analysis by Abstract Interpretation: Proofs of results</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Escape analysis of object-oriented languages approximates the set of objects
which do not escape from a given context. If we take a method as context, the
non-escaping objects can be allocated on its activation stack; if we take a
thread, Java synchronisation locks on such objects are not needed. In this
paper, we formalise a basic escape domain e as an abstract interpretation of
concrete states, which we then refine into an abstract domain er which is more
concrete than e and, hence, leads to a more precise escape analysis than e. We
provide optimality results for both e and er, in the form of Galois insertions
from the concrete to the abstract domains and of optimal abstract operations.
The Galois insertion property is obtained by restricting the abstract domains
to those elements which do not contain garbage, by using an abstract garbage
collector. Our implementation of er is hence an implementation of a formally
correct escape analyser, able to detect the stack allocatable creation points
of Java (bytecode) applications.
  This report contains the proofs of results of a paper with the same title and
authors and to be published in the Journal &quot;Higher-Order Symbolic Computation&quot;.

 <dc:title>Multiaccess Channels with State Known to Some Encoders and Independent
  Messages</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kotagiri, Shiva Prasad</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Laneman, J. Nicholas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a state-dependent multiaccess channel (MAC) with state
non-causally known to some encoders. We derive an inner bound for the capacity
region in the general discrete memoryless case and specialize to a binary
noiseless case. In the case of maximum entropy channel state, we obtain the
capacity region for binary noiseless MAC with one informed encoder by deriving
a non-trivial outer bound for this case. For a Gaussian state-dependent MAC
with one encoder being informed of the channel state, we present an inner bound
by applying a slightly generalized dirty paper coding (GDPC) at the informed
encoder that allows for partial state cancellation, and a trivial outer bound
by providing channel state to the decoder also. The uninformed encoders benefit
from the state cancellation in terms of achievable rates, however, appears that
GDPC cannot completely eliminate the effect of the channel state on the
achievable rate region, in contrast to the case of all encoders being informed.
In the case of infinite state variance, we analyze how the uninformed encoder
benefits from the informed encoder's actions using the inner bound and also
provide a non-trivial outer bound for this case which is better than the
trivial outer bound.

 <dc:description>  Ideas by Statistical Mechanics (ISM) is a generic program to model evolution
and propagation of ideas/patterns throughout populations subjected to
endogenous and exogenous interactions. The program is based on the author's
work in Statistical Mechanics of Neocortical Interactions (SMNI), and uses the
author's Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) code for optimizations of training
sets, as well as for importance-sampling to apply the author's copula financial
risk-management codes, Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD), for assessments of
risk and uncertainty. This product can be used for decision support for
projects ranging from diplomatic, information, military, and economic (DIME)
factors of propagation/evolution of ideas, to commercial sales, trading
indicators across sectors of financial markets, advertising and political
campaigns, etc. A statistical mechanical model of neocortical interactions,
developed by the author and tested successfully in describing short-term memory
and EEG indicators, is the proposed model. Parameters with a given subset of
macrocolumns will be fit using ASA to patterns representing ideas. Parameters
of external and inter-regional interactions will be determined that promote or
inhibit the spread of these ideas. Tools of financial risk management,
developed by the author to process correlated multivariate systems with
differing non-Gaussian distributions using modern copula analysis,
importance-sampled using ASA, will enable bona fide correlations and
uncertainties of success and failure to be calculated. Marginal distributions
will be evolved to determine their expected duration and stability using
algorithms developed by the author, i.e., PATHTREE and PATHINT codes.

 <dc:description>  The linear complexity of a periodic sequence over $GF(p^m)$ plays an
important role in cryptography and communication [12]. In this correspondence,
we prove a result which reduces the computation of the linear complexity and
minimal connection polynomial of a period $un$ sequence over $GF(p^m)$ to the
computation of the linear complexities and minimal connection polynomials of
$u$ period $n$ sequences. The conditions $u|p^m-1$ and
  $\gcd(n,p^m-1)=1$ are required for the result to hold. Some applications of
this reduction in fast algorithms to determine the linear complexities and
minimal connection polynomials of sequences over $GF(p^m)$ are presented.

 <dc:description>  We present a randomized algorithm that, on input a symmetric, weakly
diagonally dominant n-by-n matrix A with m nonzero entries and an n-vector b,
produces a y such that $\norm{y - \pinv{A} b}_{A} \leq \epsilon \norm{\pinv{A}
b}_{A}$ in expected time $O (m \log^{c}n \log (1/\epsilon)),$ for some constant
c. By applying this algorithm inside the inverse power method, we compute
approximate Fiedler vectors in a similar amount of time. The algorithm applies
subgraph preconditioners in a recursive fashion. These preconditioners improve
upon the subgraph preconditioners first introduced by Vaidya (1990).
  For any symmetric, weakly diagonally-dominant matrix A with non-positive
off-diagonal entries and $k \geq 1$, we construct in time $O (m \log^{c} n)$ a
preconditioner B of A with at most $2 (n - 1) + O ((m/k) \log^{39} n)$ nonzero
off-diagonal entries such that the finite generalized condition number
$\kappa_{f} (A,B)$ is at most k, for some other constant c.
  In the special case when the nonzero structure of the matrix is planar the
corresponding linear system solver runs in expected time $ O (n \log^{2} n + n
\log n \ \log \log n \ \log (1/\epsilon))$.
  We hope that our introduction of algorithms of low asymptotic complexity will
lead to the development of algorithms that are also fast in practice.

 <dc:title>The Complexity of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction: Collapsibility,
  Sink Algebras, and the Three-Element Case</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Hubie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The constraint satisfaction probem (CSP) is a well-acknowledged framework in
which many combinatorial search problems can be naturally formulated. The CSP
may be viewed as the problem of deciding the truth of a logical sentence
consisting of a conjunction of constraints, in front of which all variables are
existentially quantified. The quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP)
is the generalization of the CSP where universal quantification is permitted in
addition to existential quantification. The general intractability of these
problems has motivated research studying the complexity of these problems under
a restricted constraint language, which is a set of relations that can be used
to express constraints.
  This paper introduces collapsibility, a technique for deriving positive
complexity results on the QCSP. In particular, this technique allows one to
show that, for a particular constraint language, the QCSP reduces to the CSP.
We show that collapsibility applies to three known tractable cases of the QCSP
that were originally studied using disparate proof techniques in different
decades: Quantified 2-SAT (Aspvall, Plass, and Tarjan 1979), Quantified
Horn-SAT (Karpinski, Kleine B\&quot;{u}ning, and Schmitt 1987), and Quantified
Affine-SAT (Creignou, Khanna, and Sudan 2001). This reconciles and reveals
common structure among these cases, which are describable by constraint
languages over a two-element domain. In addition to unifying these known
tractable cases, we study constraint languages over domains of larger size.

 <dc:description>  Maximum rank distance codes denoted MRD-codes are the equivalent in rank
metric of MDS-codes. Given any integer $q$ power of a prime and any integer $n$
there is a family of MRD-codes of length $n$ over $\FF{q^n}$ having
polynomial-time decoding algorithms. These codes can be seen as the analogs of
Reed-Solomon codes (hereafter denoted RS-codes) for rank metric. In this paper
their subspace subcodes are characterized. It is shown that hey are equivalent
to MRD-codes constructed in the same way but with smaller parameters. A
specific polynomial-time decoding algorithm is designed. Moreover, it is shown
that the direct sum of subspace subcodes is equivalent to the direct product of
MRD-codes with smaller parameters. This implies that the decoding procedure can
correct errors of higher rank than the error-correcting capability. Finally it
is shown that, for given parameters, subfield subcodes are completely
characterized by elements of the general linear group ${GL}_n(\FF{q})$ of
non-singular $q$-ary matrices of size $n$.

 <dc:description>  We present a theory of boosting probabilistic classifiers. We place ourselves
in the situation of a user who only provides a stopping parameter and a
probabilistic weak learner/classifier and compare three types of boosting
algorithms: probabilistic Adaboost, decision tree, and tree of trees of ... of
trees, which we call matryoshka. &quot;Nested tree,&quot; &quot;embedded tree&quot; and &quot;recursive
tree&quot; are also appropriate names for this algorithm, which is one of our
contributions. Our other contribution is the theoretical analysis of the
algorithms, in which we give training error bounds. This analysis suggests that
the matryoshka leverages probabilistic weak classifiers more efficiently than
simple decision trees.

 <dc:description>  Source data for computer network security analysis takes different forms
(alerts, incidents, logs) and each source may be voluminous. Due to the
challenge this presents for data management, this has often lead to security
stovepipe operations which focus primarily on a small number of data sources
for analysis with little or no automated correlation between data sources
(although correlation may be done manually). We seek to address this systemic
problem.
  In previous work we developed a unified correlated logging system (UCLog)
that automatically processes alerts from different devices. We take this work
one step further by presenting the architecture and applications of UCLog+
which adds the new capability to correlate between alerts and incidents and raw
data located on remote logs. UCLog+ can be used for forensic analysis including
queries and report generation but more importantly it can be used for
near-real-time situational awareness of attack patterns in progress. The
system, implemented with open source tools, can also be a repository for secure
information sharing by different organizations.

 <dc:title>Improving convergence of Belief Propagation decoding</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check codes by the Belief Propagation (BP)
algorithm is revisited. We check the iterative algorithm for its convergence to
a codeword (termination), we run Monte Carlo simulations to find the
probability distribution function of the termination time, n_it. Tested on an
example [155, 64, 20] code, this termination curve shows a maximum and an
extended algebraic tail at the highest values of n_it. Aiming to reduce the
tail of the termination curve we consider a family of iterative algorithms
modifying the standard BP by means of a simple relaxation. The relaxation
parameter controls the convergence of the modified BP algorithm to a minimum of
the Bethe free energy. The improvement is experimentally demonstrated for
Additive-White-Gaussian-Noise channel in some range of the signal-to-noise
ratios. We also discuss the trade-off between the relaxation parameter of the
improved iterative scheme and the number of iterations.

 <dc:description>  We consider drawings of trees in which all edges incident to leaves can be
extended to infinite rays without crossing, partitioning the plane into
infinite convex polygons. Among all such drawings we seek the one maximizing
the angular resolution of the drawing. We find linear time algorithms for
solving this problem, both for plane trees and for trees without a fixed
embedding. In any such drawing, the edge lengths may be set independently of
the angles, without crossing; we describe multiple strategies for setting these
lengths.

 <dc:description>  By the sometimes so-called MAIN THEOREM of Recursive Analysis, every
computable real function is necessarily continuous. Weihrauch and Zheng
(TCS'2000), Brattka (MLQ'2005), and Ziegler (ToCS'2006) have considered
different relaxed notions of computability to cover also discontinuous
functions. The present work compares and unifies these approaches. This is
based on the concept of the JUMP of a representation: both a TTE-counterpart to
the well known recursion-theoretic jump on Kleene's Arithmetical Hierarchy of
hypercomputation: and a formalization of revising computation in the sense of
Shoenfield.
  We also consider Markov and Banach/Mazur oracle-computation of discontinuous
fu nctions and characterize the computational power of Type-2 nondeterminism to
coincide with the first level of the Analytical Hierarchy.

 <dc:description>  Because of constraints imposed by the market, embedded software in consumer
electronics is almost inevitably shipped with faults and the goal is just to
reduce the inherent unreliability to an acceptable level before a product has
to be released. Automatic fault diagnosis is a valuable tool to capture
software faults without extra effort spent on testing. Apart from a debugging
aid at design and integration time, fault diagnosis can help analyzing problems
during operation, which allows for more accurate system recovery. In this paper
we discuss perspectives and limitations for applying a particular fault
diagnosis technique, namely the analysis of program spectra, in the area of
embedded software in consumer electronics devices. We illustrate these by our
first experience with a test case from industry.

 <dc:description>  Many popular search engines run an auction to determine the placement of
advertisements next to search results. Current auctions at Google and Yahoo!
let advertisers specify a single amount as their bid in the auction. This bid
is interpreted as the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay per click
on its ad. When search queries arrive, the bids are used to rank the ads
linearly on the search result page. The advertisers pay for each user who
clicks on their ad, and the amount charged depends on the bids of all the
advertisers participating in the auction. In order to be effective, advertisers
seek to be as high on the list as their budget permits, subject to the market.
  We study the problem of ranking ads and associated pricing mechanisms when
the advertisers not only specify a bid, but additionally express their
preference for positions in the list of ads. In particular, we study &quot;prefix
position auctions&quot; where advertiser $i$ can specify that she is interested only
in the top $b_i$ positions.
  We present a simple allocation and pricing mechanism that generalizes the
desirable properties of current auctions that do not have position constraints.
In addition, we show that our auction has an &quot;envy-free&quot; or &quot;symmetric&quot; Nash
equilibrium with the same outcome in allocation and pricing as the well-known
truthful Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction. Furthermore, we show that this
equilibrium is the best such equilibrium for the advertisers in terms of the
profit made by each advertiser. We also discuss other position-based auctions.

 <dc:description>  We present an unsupervised learning algorithm that mines large text corpora
for patterns that express implicit semantic relations. For a given input word
pair X:Y with some unspecified semantic relations, the corresponding output
list of patterns &lt;P1,...,Pm&gt; is ranked according to how well each pattern Pi
expresses the relations between X and Y. For example, given X=ostrich and
Y=bird, the two highest ranking output patterns are &quot;X is the largest Y&quot; and &quot;Y
such as the X&quot;. The output patterns are intended to be useful for finding
further pairs with the same relations, to support the construction of lexicons,
ontologies, and semantic networks. The patterns are sorted by pertinence, where
the pertinence of a pattern Pi for a word pair X:Y is the expected relational
similarity between the given pair and typical pairs for Pi. The algorithm is
empirically evaluated on two tasks, solving multiple-choice SAT word analogy
questions and classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs. On both
tasks, the algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results, performing
significantly better than several alternative pattern ranking algorithms, based
on tf-idf.

 <dc:description>  Portal technology can significantly improve the entire corporate information
infrastructure. The approach proposed is based on rigorous and consistent
(meta)data model and provides for efficient and accurate front-end integration
of heterogeneous corporate applications including enterprise resource planning
(ERP) systems, multimedia data warehouses and proprietary content databases.
The methodology proposed embraces entire software lifecycle; it is illustrated
by an enterprise-level Intranet portal implementation.

 <dc:description>  Enterprise content management is an urgent issue of current scientific and
practical activities in software design and implementation. However, papers
known as yet give insufficient coverage of theoretical background of the
software in question. The paper gives an attempt of building a state-based
model of content management. In accordance with the theoretical principles
outlined, a content management information system (CMIS) has been implemented
in a large international oil-and-gas group of companies.

 <dc:description>  Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems enjoy an increasingly wide
coverage. However, no truly integrate solution has been proposed as yet. ERP
classification is given. Recent trends in commercial systems are analyzed on
the basis of human resources (HR) management software. An innovative &quot;straight

integrated event-driven enterprise solution is suggested. Implementation
results are presented.

 <dc:description>  Human resources management software is having a wide audience at present.
However, no truly integrate solution has been proposed yet to improve the
systems concerned. Approaches to extra data collection for appraisal
decision-making are considered on the concept modeling theoretical basis.
Current technologies in state-of-the-art HR management software are compared.
Design and implementation aspects for a Web-wired truly integrated secure and
scalable event-driven enterprise system are described. Benchmark results are
presented. Field perspectives are discussed.

 <dc:title>Tardos fingerprinting is better than we thought</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We review the fingerprinting scheme by Tardos and show that it has a much
better performance than suggested by the proofs in Tardos' original paper. In
particular, the length of the codewords can be significantly reduced.
  First we generalize the proofs of the false positive and false negative error
probabilities with the following modifications: (1) we replace Tardos'
hard-coded numbers by variables and (2) we allow for independently chosen false
positive and false negative error rates. It turns out that all the
collusion-resistance properties can still be proven when the code length is
reduced by a factor of more than 2.
  Second, we study the statistical properties of the fingerprinting scheme, in
particular the average and variance of the accusations. We identify which
colluder strategy forces the content owner to employ the longest code. Using a
gaussian approximation for the probability density functions of the
accusations, we show that the required false negative and false positive error
rate can be achieved with codes that are a factor 2 shorter than required for
rigid proofs.
  Combining the results of these two approaches, we show that the Tardos scheme
can be used with a code length approximately 5 times shorter than in the
original construction.

 <dc:description>  We consider codes over the alphabet Q={0,1,..,q-1}intended for the control of
unidirectional errors of level l. That is, the transmission channel is such
that the received word cannot contain both a component larger than the
transmitted one and a component smaller than the transmitted one. Moreover, the
absolute value of the difference between a transmitted component and its
received version is at most l.
  We introduce and study q-ary codes capable of correcting all unidirectional
errors of level l. Lower and upper bounds for the maximal size of those codes
are presented.
  We also study codes for this aim that are defined by a single equation on the
codeword coordinates(similar to the Varshamov-Tenengolts codes for correcting
binary asymmetric errors). We finally consider the problem of detecting all
unidirectional errors of level l.

 <dc:description>  It has been argued that a central objective of nanotechnology is to make
products inexpensively, and that self-replication is an effective approach to
very low-cost manufacturing. The research presented here is intended to be a
step towards this vision. We describe a computational simulation of nanoscale
machines floating in a virtual liquid. The machines can bond together to form
strands (chains) that self-replicate and self-assemble into user-specified
meshes. There are four types of machines and the sequence of machine types in a
strand determines the shape of the mesh they will build. A strand may be in an
unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight, or in a folded state, in which
the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By choosing the sequence of
machine types in a strand, the user can specify a variety of polygonal shapes.
A simulation typically begins with an initial unfolded seed strand in a soup of
unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates by bonding with free machines in
the soup. The child strands fold into the encoded polygonal shape, and then the
polygons drift together and bond to form a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety
of polygonal meshes can be manufactured in the simulation, by simply changing
the sequence of machine types in the seed.

 <dc:title>Leading strategies in competitive on-line prediction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vovk, Vladimir</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We start from a simple asymptotic result for the problem of on-line
regression with the quadratic loss function: the class of continuous
limited-memory prediction strategies admits a &quot;leading prediction strategy&quot;,
which not only asymptotically performs at least as well as any continuous
limited-memory strategy but also satisfies the property that the excess loss of
any continuous limited-memory strategy is determined by how closely it imitates
the leading strategy. More specifically, for any class of prediction strategies
constituting a reproducing kernel Hilbert space we construct a leading
strategy, in the sense that the loss of any prediction strategy whose norm is
not too large is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy.
This result is extended to the loss functions given by Bregman divergences and
by strictly proper scoring rules.

 <dc:description>  We show that the number of $k$-matching in a given undirected graph
  $G$ is equal to the number of perfect matching of the corresponding graph
  $G_k$ on an even number of vertices divided by a suitable factor.
  If $G$ is bipartite then one can construct a bipartite $G_k$.
  For bipartite graphs this result implies that the number of $k$-matching has
a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. The above results are extended to
permanents and hafnians of corresponding matrices.

 <dc:title>Multicasting with selective delivery: A SafetyNet for vertical handoffs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In future mobility support will require handling roaming in heterogeneous
access networks. In order to enable seamless roaming it is necessary to
minimize the impact of the vertical handoffs. Localized mobility management
schemes such as FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 do not provide sufficient handoff
performance, since they have been designed for horizontal handoffs. In this
paper, we propose the SafetyNet protocol, which allows a Mobile Node to perform
seamless vertical handoffs. Further, we propose a handoff timing algorithm
which allows a Mobile Node to delay or even completely avoid upward vertical
handoffs. We implement the SafetyNet protocol and compare its performance with
the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 protocol in our wireless test bed and
analyze the results. The experimental results indicate that the proposed
SafetyNet protocol can provide an improvement of up to 95% for TCP performance
in vertical handoffs, when compared with FMIPv6 and an improvement of 64% over
FMIPv6 with bicasting. We use numerical analysis of the protocol to show that
its signaling and data transmission overhead is comparable to Fast Mobile IPv6
and significantly smaller than that of FMIPv6 with bicasting.

 <dc:description>  In this report, a novel approach to intelligence and learning is introduced,
this approach is based on what we call 'perception logic'. Based on this logic,
a computing mechanism and automata are introduced. Multi-resolution analysis of
perceptual information is given, in which learning is accomplished in at most
O(log(N))epochs, where N is the number of samples, and the convergence is
guarnteed. This approach combines the favors of computational modeles in the
sense that they are structured and mathematically well-defined, and the
adaptivity of soft computing approaches, in addition to the continuity and
real-time response of dynamical systems.

 <dc:title>Parallel repetition: simplifications and the no-signaling case</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Holenstein, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Consider a game where a refereed a referee chooses (x,y) according to a
publicly known distribution P_XY, sends x to Alice, and y to Bob. Without
communicating with each other, Alice responds with a value &quot;a&quot; and Bob responds
with a value &quot;b&quot;. Alice and Bob jointly win if a publicly known predicate
Q(x,y,a,b) holds.
  Let such a game be given and assume that the maximum probability that Alice
and Bob can win is v&lt;1. Raz (SIAM J. Comput. 27, 1998) shows that if the game
is repeated n times in parallel, then the probability that Alice and Bob win
all games simultaneously is at most v'^(n/log(s)), where s is the maximal
number of possible responses from Alice and Bob in the initial game, and v' is
a constant depending only on v.
  In this work, we simplify Raz's proof in various ways and thus shorten it
significantly. Further we study the case where Alice and Bob are not restricted
to local computations and can use any strategy which does not imply
communication among them.

 <dc:description>  Universal features in stock markets and their derivative markets are studied
by means of probability distributions in internal rates of return on buy and
sell transaction pairs. Unlike the stylized facts in log normalized returns,
the probability distributions for such single asset encounters encorporate the
time factor by means of the internal rate of return defined as the continuous
compound interest. Resulting stylized facts are shown in the probability
distributions derived from the daily series of TOPIX, S &amp; P 500 and FTSE 100
index close values. The application of the above analysis to minute-tick data
of NIKKEI 225 and its futures market, respectively, reveals an interesting
diffference in the behavior of the two probability distributions, in case a
threshold on the minimal duration of the long position is imposed. It is
therefore suggested that the probability distributions of the internal rates of
return could be used for causality mining between the underlying and derivative
stock markets. The highly specific discrete spectrum, which results from noise
trader strategies as opposed to the smooth distributions observed for
fundamentalist strategies in single encounter transactions may be also useful
in deducing the type of investment strategy from trading revenues of small
portfolio investors.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider and analyze the behavior of two combinational rules
for temporal (sequential) attribute data fusion for target type estimation. Our
comparative analysis is based on Dempster's fusion rule proposed in
Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) and on the Proportional Conflict Redistribution
rule no. 5 (PCR5) recently proposed in Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT). We
show through very simple scenario and Monte-Carlo simulation, how PCR5 allows a
very efficient Target Type Tracking and reduces drastically the latency delay
for correct Target Type decision with respect to Demspter's rule. For cases
presenting some short Target Type switches, Demspter's rule is proved to be
unable to detect the switches and thus to track correctly the Target Type
changes. The approach proposed here is totally new, efficient and promising to
be incorporated in real-time Generalized Data Association - Multi Target
Tracking systems (GDA-MTT) and provides an important result on the behavior of
PCR5 with respect to Dempster's rule. The MatLab source code is provided in

 <dc:description>  Logics for security protocol analysis require the formalization of an
adversary model that specifies the capabilities of adversaries. A common model
is the Dolev-Yao model, which considers only adversaries that can compose and
replay messages, and decipher them with known keys. The Dolev-Yao model is a
useful abstraction, but it suffers from some drawbacks: it cannot handle the
adversary knowing protocol-specific information, and it cannot handle
probabilistic notions, such as the adversary attempting to guess the keys. We
show how we can analyze security protocols under different adversary models by
using a logic with a notion of algorithmic knowledge. Roughly speaking,
adversaries are assumed to use algorithms to compute their knowledge; adversary
capabilities are captured by suitable restrictions on the algorithms used. We
show how we can model the standard Dolev-Yao adversary in this setting, and how
we can capture more general capabilities including protocol-specific knowledge
and guesses.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces the notion of qualitative belief assignment to model
beliefs of human experts expressed in natural language (with linguistic
labels). We show how qualitative beliefs can be efficiently combined using an
extension of Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) of plausible and paradoxical
quantitative reasoning to qualitative reasoning. We propose a new arithmetic on
linguistic labels which allows a direct extension of classical DSm fusion rule
or DSm Hybrid rules. An approximate qualitative PCR5 rule is also proposed
jointly with a Qualitative Average Operator. We also show how crisp or interval
mappings can be used to deal indirectly with linguistic labels. A very simple
example is provided to illustrate our qualitative fusion rules.

 <dc:description>  The management and combination of uncertain, imprecise, fuzzy and even
paradoxical or high conflicting sources of information has always been, and
still remains today, of primal importance for the development of reliable
modern information systems involving artificial reasoning. In this
introduction, we present a survey of our recent theory of plausible and
paradoxical reasoning, known as Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) in the
literature, developed for dealing with imprecise, uncertain and paradoxical
sources of information. We focus our presentation here rather on the
foundations of DSmT, and on the two important new rules of combination, than on
browsing specific applications of DSmT available in literature. Several simple
examples are given throughout the presentation to show the efficiency and the
generality of this new approach.

 <dc:description>  During early 1980s, the so-called `escape time' method, developed to display
the Julia sets for complex dynamical systems, was exported to quaternions in
order to draw analogous pictures in this wider numerical field. Despite of the
fine results in the complex plane, where all topological configurations of
Julia sets have been successfully displayed, the `escape time' method fails to
render properly the non-filled-in variety of quaternionic Julia sets. So their
digital visualisation remained an open problem for several years. Both the
solution for extending this old method to non-filled-in quaternionic Julia sets
and its implementation into a program are explained here.

 <dc:title>Separating the articles of authors with the same name</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  I describe a method to separate the articles of different authors with the
same name. It is based on a distance between any two publications, defined in
terms of the probability that they would have as many coincidences if they were
drawn at random from all published documents. Articles with a given author name
are then clustered according to their distance, so that all articles in a
cluster belong very likely to the same author. The method has proven very
useful in generating groups of papers that are then selected manually. This
simplifies considerably citation analysis when the author publication lists are
not available.

 <dc:description>  Field theory is an area in physics with a deceptively compact notation.
Although general purpose computer algebra systems, built around generic
list-based data structures, can be used to represent and manipulate
field-theory expressions, this often leads to cumbersome input formats,
unexpected side-effects, or the need for a lot of special-purpose code. This
makes a direct translation of problems from paper to computer and back
needlessly time-consuming and error-prone. A prototype computer algebra system
is presented which features TeX-like input, graph data structures, lists with
Young-tableaux symmetries and a multiple-inheritance property system. The
usefulness of this approach is illustrated with a number of explicit
field-theory problems.

 <dc:title>A Graph-based Framework for Transmission of Correlated Sources over

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the communication problem that involves
transmission of correlated sources over broadcast channels. We consider a
graph-based framework for this information transmission problem. The system
involves a source coding module and a channel coding module. In the source
coding module, the sources are efficiently mapped into a nearly semi-regular
bipartite graph, and in the channel coding module, the edges of this graph are
reliably transmitted over a broadcast channel. We consider nearly semi-regular
bipartite graphs as discrete interface between source coding and channel coding
in this multiterminal setting. We provide an information-theoretic
characterization of (1) the rate of exponential growth (as a function of the
number of channel uses) of the size of the bipartite graphs whose edges can be
reliably transmitted over a broadcast channel and (2) the rate of exponential
growth (as a function of the number of source samples) of the size of the
bipartite graphs which can reliably represent a pair of correlated sources to
be transmitted over a broadcast channel.

 <dc:description>  Given a probability distribution P, what is the minimum amount of bits needed
to store a value x sampled according to P, such that x can later be recovered
(except with some small probability)? Or, what is the maximum amount of uniform
randomness that can be extracted from x? Answering these and similar
information-theoretic questions typically boils down to computing so-called
smooth entropies. In this paper, we derive explicit and almost tight bounds on
the smooth entropies of n-fold product distributions.

 <dc:description>  This paper proves that in Size Theory the comparison of multidimensional size
functions can be reduced to the 1-dimensional case by a suitable change of
variables. Indeed, we show that a foliation in half-planes can be given, such
that the restriction of a multidimensional size function to each of these
half-planes turns out to be a classical size function in two scalar variables.
This leads to the definition of a new distance between multidimensional size
functions, and to the proof of their stability with respect to that distance.

worse than gaussion ones. Stimulation results strengthen out theory. Robust in

 <dc:title>The Many Faces of Rationalizability</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Apt, Krzysztof R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The rationalizability concept was introduced in \cite{Ber84} and
  \cite{Pea84} to assess what can be inferred by rational players in a
non-cooperative game in the presence of common knowledge. However, this notion
can be defined in a number of ways that differ in seemingly unimportant minor
details. We shed light on these differences, explain their impact, and clarify
for which games these definitions coincide. Then we apply the same analysis to
explain the differences and similarities between various ways the iterated
elimination of strictly dominated strategies was defined in the literature.
This allows us to clarify the results of \cite{DS02} and \cite{CLL05} and
improve upon them. We also consider the extension of these results to strict
dominance by a mixed strategy. Our approach is based on a general study of the
operators on complete lattices. We allow transfinite iterations of the
considered operators and clarify the need for them. The advantage of such a
general approach is that a number of results, including order independence for
some of the notions of rationalizability and strict dominance, come for free.

 <dc:description>  We study routing for massively dense wireless networks, i.e., wireless
networks that contain so many nodes that, in addition to their usual
microscopic description, a novel macroscopic description becomes possible. The
macroscopic description is not detailed, but nevertheless contains enough
information to permit a meaningful study and performance optimization of the
network. Within this context, we continue and significantly expand previous
work on the analogy between optimal routing and the propagation of light
according to the laws of Geometrical Optics. Firstly, we pose the analogy in a
more general framework than previously, notably showing how the eikonal
equation, which is the central equation of Geometrical Optics, also appears in
the networking context. Secondly, we develop a methodology for calculating the
cost function, which is the function describing the network at the macroscopic
level. We apply this methodology for two important types of networks: bandwidth
limited and energy limited.

 <dc:title>Pull-Based Data Broadcast with Dependencies: Be Fair to Users, not to

 <dc:description>  Broadcasting is known to be an efficient means of disseminating data in
wireless communication environments (such as Satellite, mobile phone
networks,...). It has been recently observed that the average service time of
broadcast systems can be considerably improved by taking into consideration
existing correlations between requests. We study a pull-based data broadcast
system where users request possibly overlapping sets of items; a request is
served when all its requested items are downloaded. We aim at minimizing the
average user perceived latency, i.e. the average flow time of the requests. We
first show that any algorithm that ignores the dependencies can yield arbitrary
bad performances with respect to the optimum even if it is given arbitrary
extra resources. We then design a $(4+\epsilon)$-speed
$O(1+1/\epsilon^2)$-competitive algorithm for this setting that consists in 1)
splitting evenly the bandwidth among each requested set and in 2) broadcasting
arbitrarily the items still missing in each set into the bandwidth the set has
received. Our algorithm presents several interesting features: it is simple to
implement, non-clairvoyant, fair to users so that no user may starve for a long
period of time, and guarantees good performances in presence of correlations
between user requests (without any change in the broadcast protocol). We also
present a $ (4+\epsilon)$-speed $O(1+1/\epsilon^3)$-competitive algorithm which
broadcasts at most one item at any given time and preempts each item broadcast
at most once on average. As a side result of our analysis, we design a
competitive algorithm for a particular setting of non-clairvoyant job
scheduling with dependencies, which might be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Constraint propagation algorithms implement logical inference. For
efficiency, it is essential to control whether and in what order basic
inference steps are taken. We provide a high-level framework that clearly
differentiates between information needed for controlling propagation versus
that needed for the logical semantics of complex constraints composed from
primitive ones. We argue for the appropriateness of our controlled propagation
framework by showing that it captures the underlying principles of manually
designed propagation algorithms, such as literal watching for unit clause
propagation and the lexicographic ordering constraint. We provide an
implementation and benchmark results that demonstrate the practicality and
efficiency of our framework.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Associative Commutative Distributive Term Rewriting (ACDTR), a
rewriting language for rewriting logical formulae. ACDTR extends AC term
rewriting by adding distribution of conjunction over other operators.
Conjunction is vital for expressive term rewriting systems since it allows us
to require that multiple conditions hold for a term rewriting rule to be used.
ACDTR uses the notion of a &quot;conjunctive context&quot;, which is the conjunction of
constraints that must hold in the context of a term, to enable the programmer
to write very expressive and targeted rewriting rules. ACDTR can be seen as a
general logic programming language that extends Constraint Handling Rules and
AC term rewriting. In this paper we define the semantics of ACDTR and describe
our prototype implementation.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a constraint-based framework for studying infinite qualitative
simulations concerned with contingencies such as time, space, shape, size,
abstracted into a finite set of qualitative relations. To define the
simulations, we combine constraints that formalize the background knowledge
concerned with qualitative reasoning with appropriate inter-state constraints
that are formulated using linear temporal logic. We implemented this approach
in a constraint programming system by drawing on ideas from bounded model
checking. The resulting system allows us to test and modify the problem
specifications in a straightforward way and to combine various knowledge
aspects.

 <dc:title>Relation Variables in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brand, Sebastian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study an alternative to the prevailing approach to modelling qualitative
spatial reasoning (QSR) problems as constraint satisfaction problems. In the
standard approach, a relation between objects is a constraint whereas in the
alternative approach it is a variable. The relation-variable approach greatly
simplifies integration and implementation of QSR. To substantiate this point,
we discuss several QSR algorithms from the literature which in the
relation-variable approach reduce to the customary constraint propagation
algorithm enforcing generalised arc-consistency.

 <dc:title>Quasi-friendly sup-interpretations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Marion, Jean-Yves</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a previous paper, the sup-interpretation method was proposed as a new tool
to control memory resources of first order functional programs with pattern
matching by static analysis. Basically, a sup-interpretation provides an upper
bound on the size of function outputs. In this former work, a criterion, which
can be applied to terminating as well as non-terminating programs, was
developed in order to bound polynomially the stack frame size. In this paper,
we suggest a new criterion which captures more algorithms computing values
polynomially bounded in the size of the inputs. Since this work is related to
quasi-interpretations, we compare the two notions obtaining two main features.
The first one is that, given a program, we have heuristics for finding a
sup-interpretation when we consider polynomials of bounded degree. The other
one consists in the characterizations of the set of function computable in
polynomial time and in polynomial space.

 <dc:description>  The independence numbers of powers of graphs have been long studied, under
several definitions of graph products, and in particular, under the strong
graph product. We show that the series of independence numbers in strong powers
of a fixed graph can exhibit a complex structure, implying that the Shannon
Capacity of a graph cannot be approximated (up to a sub-polynomial factor of
the number of vertices) by any arbitrarily large, yet fixed, prefix of the
series. This is true even if this prefix shows a significant increase of the
independence number at a given power, after which it stabilizes for a while.

 <dc:description>  McLean's notion of Selective Interleaving Functions (SIFs) is perhaps the
best-known attempt to construct a framework for expressing various security
properties. We examine the expressive power of SIFs carefully. We show that
SIFs cannot capture nondeducibility on strategies (NOS). We also prove that the
set of security properties expressed with SIFs is not closed under conjunction,
from which it follows that separability is strictly stronger than double
generalized noninterference. However, we show that if we generalize the notion
of SIF in a natural way, then NOS is expressible, and the set of security
properties expressible by generalized SIFs is closed under conjunction.

 <dc:title>Optimal resource allocation for OFDM multiuser channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a unifying framework for orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) multiuser resource allocation is presented. The isolated
seeming problems of maximizing a weighted sum of rates for a given power budget
$\bar{P}$ and minimizing sum power for given rate requirements
$\mathbf{\bar{R}}$ can be interpreted jointly in this framework. To this end we
embed the problems in a higher dimensional space. Based on these results, we
subsequently consider the combined problem of maximizing a weighted sum of
rates under given rate requirements $\mathbf{\bar{R}}$ and a fixed power budget
$\bar{P}$. This new problem is challenging, since the additional constraints do
not allow to use the hitherto existing approaches. Interestingly, the optimal
decoding orders turn out to be the ordering of the Lagrangian factors in all
problems.

it is not secure against known/chosen-plaintext attack and chosen-ciphertext

to part of the key and the plaintext, a ciphertext-only differential attack,
divide-and-conquer (DAC) attack on part of the key. We also discuss the role of
BSS in Lin et al.'s efforts towards cryptographically secure ciphers.

 <dc:description>  We study optimal user-network association in an integrated 802.11 WLAN and
3G-UMTS hybrid cell. Assuming saturated resource allocation on the downlink of
WLAN and UMTS networks and a single QoS class of mobiles arriving at an average
location in the hybrid cell, we formulate the problem with two different
approaches: Global and Individual optimality. The Globally optimal association
is formulated as an SMDP (Semi Markov Decision Process) connection routing
decision problem where rewards comprise a financial gain component and an
aggregate network throughput component. The corresponding Dynamic Programming
equations are solved using Value Iteration method and a stationary optimal
policy with neither convex nor concave type switching curve structure is
obtained. Threshold type and symmetric switching curves are observed for the
analogous homogenous network cases. The Individual optimality is studied under
a non-cooperative dynamic game framework with expected service time of a mobile
as the decision cost criteria. It is shown that individual optimality in a
WLAN-UMTS hybrid cell, results in a threshold policy curve of descending
staircase form with increasing Poisson arrival rate of mobiles.

 <dc:description>  In 3G UMTS, two main transport channels have been provided for downlink data
transmission: a common FACH channel and a dedicated DCH channel. The
performance of TCP in UMTS depends much on the channel switching policy used.
In this paper, we propose and analyze three new basic threshold-based channel
switching policies for UMTS that we name as QS (Queue Size), FS (Flow Size) and
QSFS (QS &amp; FS combined) policy. These policies significantly improve over a
modified threshold policy in [1] by about 17% in response time metrics. We
further propose and evaluate a new improved switching policy that we call
FS-DCH (at-least flow-size threshold on DCH) policy. This policy is biased
towards short TCP flows of few packets and is thus a cross-layer policy that
improves the performance of TCP by giving priority to the initial few packets
of a flow on the fast DCH channel. Extensive simulation results confirm this
improvement for the case when number of TCP connections is low.

 <dc:title>Guessing Facets: Polytope Structure and Improved LP Decoder</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dimakis, Alexandros G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wainwright, Martin J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new approach for decoding binary linear codes by solving a linear program
(LP) over a relaxed codeword polytope was recently proposed by Feldman et al.
In this paper we investigate the structure of the polytope used in the LP
relaxation decoding. We begin by showing that for expander codes, every
fractional pseudocodeword always has at least a constant fraction of
non-integral bits. We then prove that for expander codes, the active set of any
fractional pseudocodeword is smaller by a constant fraction than the active set
of any codeword. We exploit this fact to devise a decoding algorithm that
provably outperforms the LP decoder for finite blocklengths. It proceeds by
guessing facets of the polytope, and resolving the linear program on these
facets. While the LP decoder succeeds only if the ML codeword has the highest
likelihood over all pseudocodewords, we prove that for expander codes the
proposed algorithm succeeds even with a constant number of pseudocodewords of
higher likelihood. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is only a
constant factor larger than that of the LP decoder.

 <dc:description>  Quasi-interpretations are a technique to guarantee complexity bounds on
first-order functional programs: with termination orderings they give in
particular a sufficient condition for a program to be executable in polynomial
time, called here the P-criterion. We study properties of the programs
satisfying the P-criterion, in order to better understand its intensional
expressive power. Given a program on binary lists, its blind abstraction is the
nondeterministic program obtained by replacing lists by their lengths (natural
numbers). A program is blindly polynomial if its blind abstraction terminates
in polynomial time. We show that all programs satisfying a variant of the
P-criterion are in fact blindly polynomial. Then we give two extensions of the
P-criterion: one by relaxing the termination ordering condition, and the other
one (the bounded value property) giving a necessary and sufficient condition
for a program to be polynomial time executable, with memoisation.

 <dc:title>Secure Positioning of Mobile Terminals with Simplex Radio Communication</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fujii, Mikio</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the rapid spread of various mobile terminals in our society, the
importance of secure positioning is growing for wireless networks in
adversarial settings. Recently, several authors have proposed a secure
positioning mechanism of mobile terminals which is based on the geometric
property of wireless node placement, and on the postulate of modern physics
that a propagation speed of information never exceeds the velocity of light. In
particular, they utilize the measurements of the round-trip time of radio
signal propagation and bidirectional communication for variants of the
challenge-and-response. In this paper, we propose a novel means to construct
the above mechanism by use of unidirectional communication instead of
bidirectional communication. Our proposal is based on the assumption that a
mobile terminal incorporates a high-precision inner clock in a tamper-resistant
protected area. In positioning, the mobile terminal uses its inner clock and
the time and location information broadcasted by radio from trusted stations.
Our proposal has a major advantage in protecting the location privacy of mobile
terminal users, because the mobile terminal need not provide any information to
the trusted stations through positioning procedures. Besides, our proposal is
free from the positioning error due to claimant's processing-time fluctuations
in the challenge-and-response, and is well-suited for mobile terminals in the
open air, or on the move at high speed, in terms of practical usage. We analyze
the security, the functionality, and the feasibility of our proposal in
comparison to previous proposals.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two new approaches to prove termination of rewrite
systems with the Knuth-Bendix order efficiently. The constraints for the weight
function and for the precedence are encoded in (pseudo-)propositional logic and
the resulting formula is tested for satisfiability. Any satisfying assignment
represents a weight function and a precedence such that the induced
Knuth-Bendix order orients the rules of the encoded rewrite system from left to
right.

 <dc:title>A Study on Learnability for Rigid Lambek Grammars</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bonato, Roberto</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present basic notions of Gold's &quot;learnability in the limit&quot; paradigm,
first presented in 1967, a formalization of the cognitive process by which a
native speaker gets to grasp the underlying grammar of his/her own native
language by being exposed to well formed sentences generated by that grammar.
Then we present Lambek grammars, a formalism issued from categorial grammars
which, although not as expressive as needed for a full formalization of natural
languages, is particularly suited to easily implement a natural interface
between syntax and semantics. In the last part of this work, we present a
learnability result for Rigid Lambek grammars from structured examples.

 <dc:description>  Technical security is only part of E-Commerce security operations; human
usability and security perception play major and sometimes dominating factors.
For instance, slick websites with impressive security icons but no real
technical security are often perceived by users to be trustworthy (and thus
more profitable) than plain vanilla websites that use powerful encryption for
transmission and server protection. We study one important type of E-Commerce
transaction website, E-Tax Filing, that is exposed to large populations. We
assess a large number of international (5), Federal (USA), and state E-Tax
filing websites (38) for both technical security protection and human
perception of security. As a result of this assessment, we identify security
best practices across these E-Tax Filing websites and recommend additional
security techniques that have not been found in current use by E-Tax Filing
websites.

 <dc:description>  We propose a type-based resource usage analysis for the &amp;#960;-calculus
extended with resource creation/access primitives. The goal of the resource
usage analysis is to statically check that a program accesses resources such as
files and memory in a valid manner. Our type system is an extension of previous
behavioral type systems for the &amp;#960;-calculus, and can guarantee the safety
property that no invalid access is performed, as well as the property that
necessary accesses (such as the close operation for a file) are eventually
performed unless the program diverges. A sound type inference algorithm for the
type system is also developed to free the programmer from the burden of writing
complex type annotations. Based on the algorithm, we have implemented a
prototype resource usage analyzer for the &amp;#960;-calculus. To the authors'
knowledge, ours is the first type-based resource usage analysis that deals with
an expressive concurrent language like the pi-calculus.

 <dc:title>Reversal Complexity Revisited</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We study a generalized version of reversal bounded Turing machines where,
apart from several tapes on which the number of head reversals is bounded by
r(n), there are several further tapes on which head reversals remain
unrestricted, but size is bounded by s(n). Recently, such machines were
introduced as a formalization of a computation model that restricts random
access to external memory and internal memory space. Here, each of the tapes
with a restriction on the head reversals corresponds to an external memory
device, and the tapes of restricted size model internal memory. We use
ST(r(n),s(n),O(1)) to denote the class of all problems that can be solved by
deterministic Turing machines that comply to the above resource bounds.
Similarly, NST and RST, respectively, are used for the corresponding
nondeterministic and randomized classes.
  While previous papers focused on lower bounds for particular problems,
including sorting, the set equality problem, and several query evaluation
problems, the present paper addresses the relations between the (R,N)ST-classes
and classical complexity classes and investigates the structural complexity of
the (R,N)ST-classes. Our main results are (1) a trade-off between internal
memory space and external memory head reversals, (2) correspondences between
the (R,N)ST-classes and ``classical'' time-bounded, space-bounded,
reversal-bounded, and circuit complexity classes, and (3) hierarchies of
(R)ST-classes in terms of increasing numbers of head reversals on external
memory tapes.

 <dc:title>Cascade hash tables: a series of multilevel double hashing schemes with

 <dc:creator>Li, Shaohua</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the author proposes a series of multilevel double hashing
schemes called cascade hash tables. They use several levels of hash tables. In
each table, we use the common double hashing scheme. Higher level hash tables
work as fail-safes of lower level hash tables. By this strategy, it could
effectively reduce collisions in hash insertion. Thus it gains a constant worst
case lookup time with a relatively high load factor(70%-85%) in random
experiments. Different parameters of cascade hash tables are tested.

 <dc:title>Morphisms of Coloured Petri Nets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wehler, Joachim</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>D.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce the concept of a morphism between coloured nets. Our definition
generalizes Petris definition for ordinary nets. A morphism of coloured nets
maps the topological space of the underlying undirected net as well as the
kernel and cokernel of the incidence map. The kernel are flows along the
transition-bordered fibres of the morphism, the cokernel are classes of
markings of the place-bordered fibres. The attachment of bindings, colours,
flows and marking classes to a subnet is formalized by using concepts from
sheaf theory. A coloured net is a sheaf-cosheaf pair over a Petri space and a
morphism between coloured nets is a morphism between such pairs. Coloured nets
and their morphisms form a category. We prove the existence of a product in the
subcategory of sort-respecting morphisms. After introducing markings our
concepts generalize to coloured Petri nets.

 <dc:description>  This paper brings together two lines of research: implicit characterization
of complexity classes by Linear Logic (LL) on the one hand, and computation
over an arbitrary ring in the Blum-Shub-Smale (BSS) model on the other. Given a
fixed ring structure K we define an extension of Terui's light affine
lambda-calculus typed in LAL (Light Affine Logic) with a basic type for K. We
show that this calculus captures the polynomial time function class FP(K):
every typed term can be evaluated in polynomial time and conversely every
polynomial time BSS machine over K can be simulated in this calculus.

 <dc:description>  This article describes our strategy for deploying self-forming ad hoc
networks based on the Internet Protocol version 6 and evaluates the dynamics of
this proposal. Among others, we suggest a technique called adaptive routing
that provides secure intelligent routing capabilities to computer communication
networks. This technique uses the flow label, supports hybrid metrics, network
load sharing, and is not restricted to evaluation of performance on first hop
routers when making routing decisions. Selective anycasting is an extension to
the anycast addressing model that supports exclusion of members of groups that
perform poorly or inappropriately on a per-host basis. Distributed name lookup
is suggested for integrating self-forming and global networks where they
coexist. At last, we pose an address hierarchy to support unmanaged discovery
of services in unknown networks.

 <dc:title>An Improved Sphere-Packing Bound for Finite-Length Codes on Symmetric
  Memoryless Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wiechman, Gil</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sason, Igal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper derives an improved sphere-packing (ISP) bound for finite-length
codes whose transmission takes place over symmetric memoryless channels. We
first review classical results, i.e., the 1959 sphere-packing (SP59) bound of
Shannon for the Gaussian channel, and the 1967 sphere-packing (SP67) bound of
Shannon et al. for discrete memoryless channels. A recent improvement on the
SP67 bound, as suggested by Valembois and Fossorier, is also discussed. These
concepts are used for the derivation of a new lower bound on the decoding error
probability (referred to as the ISP bound) which is uniformly tighter than the
SP67 bound and its recent improved version. The ISP bound is applicable to
symmetric memoryless channels, and some of its applications are exemplified.
Its tightness is studied by comparing it with bounds on the ML decoding error
probability, and computer simulations of iteratively decoded turbo-like codes.
The paper also presents a technique which performs the entire calculation of
the SP59 bound in the logarithmic domain, thus facilitating the exact
calculation of this bound for moderate to large block lengths without the need
for the asymptotic approximations provided by Shannon.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of serving multicast flows in a crossbar switch. We
show that linear network coding across packets of a flow can sustain traffic
patterns that cannot be served if network coding were not allowed. Thus,
network coding leads to a larger rate region in a multicast crossbar switch. We
demonstrate a traffic pattern which requires a switch speedup if coding is not
allowed, whereas, with coding the speedup requirement is eliminated completely.
In addition to throughput benefits, coding simplifies the characterization of
the rate region. We give a graph-theoretic characterization of the rate region
with fanout splitting and intra-flow coding, in terms of the stable set
polytope of the 'enhanced conflict graph' of the traffic pattern. Such a
formulation is not known in the case of fanout splitting without coding. We
show that computing the offline schedule (i.e. using prior knowledge of the
flow arrival rates) can be reduced to certain graph coloring problems. Finally,
we propose online algorithms (i.e. using only the current queue occupancy
information) for multicast scheduling based on our graph-theoretic formulation.
In particular, we show that a maximum weighted stable set algorithm stabilizes
the queues for all rates within the rate region.

 <dc:description>  The goal of this research is to introduce an easy and versatile way to
provide and use Grid resources without the need of any OS installation or
middleware configuration. At the same time we provide an excellent training
tool for newer Grid users and people that want to experiment, without enforcing
any installation. We have been testing it thoroughly under different
circumstances with firm success.

 <dc:description>  Grid computing has made substantial advances during the last decade. Grid
middleware such as Globus has contributed greatly in making this possible.
There are, however, significant barriers to the adoption of Grid computing in
other fields, most notably day-to-day user computing environments. We will
demonstrate in this paper that this is primarily due to the limitations of the
existing Grid middleware which does not take into account the needs of everyday
scientific and business users. In this paper we will formally advocate a Grid
Operating System and propose an architecture to migrate Grid computing into a
Grid operating system which we believe would help remove most of the technical
barriers to the adoption of Grid computing and make it relevant to the
day-to-day user. We believe this proposed transition to a Grid operating system
will drive more pervasive Grid computing research and application development
and deployment in future.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an overview of the MammoGrid project and some of its
achievements. In terms of the global grid project, and European research in
particular, the project has successfully demonstrated the capacity of a
grid-based system to support effective collaboration between physicians,
including handling and querying image databases, as well as using grid
services, such as image standardization and Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) of
suspect or indicative features. In terms of scientific results, in radiology,
there have been significant epidemiological findings in the assessment of
breast density as a risk factor, but the results for CADe are less clear-cut.
Finally, the foundations of a technology transfer process to establish a
working MammoGrid plus system in Spain through the company Maat GKnowledge and
the collaboration of CIEMAT and hospitals in Extremadura.

 <dc:description>  Results from the research and development of a Data Intensive and Network
Aware (DIANA) scheduling engine, to be used primarily for data intensive
sciences such as physics analysis, are described. In Grid analyses, tasks can
involve thousands of computing, data handling, and network resources. The
central problem in the scheduling of these resources is the coordinated
management of computation and data at multiple locations and not just data
replication or movement. However, this can prove to be a rather costly
operation and efficient sing can be a challenge if compute and data resources
are mapped without considering network costs. We have implemented an adaptive
algorithm within the so-called DIANA Scheduler which takes into account data
location and size, network performance and computation capability in order to
enable efficient global scheduling. DIANA is a performance-aware and
economy-guided Meta Scheduler. It iteratively allocates each job to the site
that is most likely to produce the best performance as well as optimizing the
global queue for any remaining jobs. Therefore it is equally suitable whether a
single job is being submitted or bulk scheduling is being performed. Results
indicate that considerable performance improvements can be gained by adopting
the DIANA scheduling approach.

 <dc:description>  In agglomerative hierarchical clustering, pair-group methods suffer from a
problem of non-uniqueness when two or more distances between different clusters
coincide during the amalgamation process. The traditional approach for solving
this drawback has been to take any arbitrary criterion in order to break ties
between distances, which results in different hierarchical classifications
depending on the criterion followed. In this article we propose a
variable-group algorithm that consists in grouping more than two clusters at
the same time when ties occur. We give a tree representation for the results of
the algorithm, which we call a multidendrogram, as well as a generalization of
the Lance and Williams' formula which enables the implementation of the
algorithm in a recursive way.

 <dc:description>  Dense sub-graphs of sparse graphs (communities), which appear in most
real-world complex networks, play an important role in many contexts. Most
existing community detection algorithms produce a hierarchical structure of
community and seek a partition into communities that optimizes a given quality
function. We propose new methods to improve the results of any of these
algorithms. First we show how to optimize a general class of additive quality
functions (containing the modularity, the performance, and a new similarity
based quality function we propose) over a larger set of partitions than the
classical methods. Moreover, we define new multi-scale quality functions which
make it possible to detect the different scales at which meaningful community
structures appear, while classical approaches find only one partition.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by the classical theory of modules over a monoid, we give a first
account of the natural notion of module over a monad. The associated notion of
morphism of left modules (&quot;Linear&quot; natural transformations) captures an
important property of compatibility with substitution, in the heterogeneous
case where &quot;terms&quot; and variables therein could be of different types as well as
in the homogeneous case. In this paper, we present basic constructions of
modules and we show examples concerning in particular abstract syntax and

 <dc:description>  Biomedical signals are stored in many different data formats. Most formats
have been developed for a specific purpose of a specialized community for ECG
research, EEG analysis, sleep research, etc. So far none of the existing
formats can be considered a general purpose data format for biomedical signals.
In order to solve this problem and to unify the various needs of the various
biomedical signal processing fields, the so-called &quot;General Data Format for
biomedical signals&quot; (GDF) is developed. This GDF format is fully described and
specified. Software for reading and writing GDF data is implemented in
Octave/Matlab and C/C++ and provided through BioSig - an free and open source
software library for biomedical signal processing. BioSig privides also
converters from various data formats to GDF, and a viewing and scoring
software.

 <dc:title>Renormalization group approach to the P versus NP question</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper argues that the ideas underlying the renormalization group
technique used to characterize phase transitions in condensed matter systems
could be useful for distinguishing computational complexity classes. The paper
presents a renormalization group transformation that maps an arbitrary Boolean
function of $N$ Boolean variables to one of $N-1$ variables. When this
transformation is applied repeatedly, the behavior of the resulting sequence of
functions is different for a generic Boolean function than for Boolean
functions that can be written as a polynomial of degree $\xi$ with $\xi \ll N$
as well as for functions that depend on composite variables such as the
arithmetic sum of the inputs. Being able to demonstrate that functions are
non-generic is of interest because it suggests an avenue for constructing an
algorithm capable of demonstrating that a given Boolean function cannot be
computed using resources that are bounded by a polynomial of $N$.

 <dc:description>  How much can randomness help computation? Motivated by this general question
and by volume computation, one of the few instances where randomness provably
helps, we analyze a notion of dispersion and connect it to asymptotic convex
geometry. We obtain a nearly quadratic lower bound on the complexity of
randomized volume algorithms for convex bodies in R^n (the current best
algorithm has complexity roughly n^4, conjectured to be n^3). Our main tools,
dispersion of random determinants and dispersion of the length of a random
point from a convex body, are of independent interest and applicable more
generally; in particular, the latter is closely related to the variance
hypothesis from convex geometry. This geometric dispersion also leads to lower
bounds for matrix problems and property testing.

 <dc:title>MDS Ideal Secret Sharing Scheme from AG-codes on Elliptic Curves</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Hao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For a secret sharing scheme, two parameters $d_{min}$ and $d_{cheat}$ are
defined in [12] and [13]. These two parameters measure the error-correcting
capability and the secret-recovering capability of the secret sharing scheme
against cheaters. Some general properties of the parameters have been studied
in [12,[9] and [13]. The MDS secret-sharing scheme was defined in [12] and it
is proved that MDS perfect secret sharing scheme can be constructed for any
monotone access structure. The famous Shamir $(k,n)$ threshold secret sharing
scheme is the MDS with $d_{min}=d_{cheat}=n-k+1$. In [3] we proposed the linear
secret sharing scheme from algebraic-geometric codes. In this paper the linear
secret sharing scheme from AG-codes on elliptic curves is studied and it is
shown that many of them are MDS linear secret sharing scheme.

 <dc:description>  Electoral control refers to attempts by an election's organizer (&quot;the chair&quot;)
to influence the outcome by adding/deleting/partitioning voters or candidates.
The groundbreaking work of Bartholdi, Tovey, and Trick [BTT92] on
(constructive) control proposes computational complexity as a means of
resisting control attempts: Look for election systems where the chair's task in
seeking control is itself computationally infeasible.
  We introduce and study a method of combining two or more candidate-anonymous
election schemes in such a way that the combined scheme possesses all the
resistances to control (i.e., all the NP-hardnesses of control) possessed by
any of its constituents: It combines their strengths. From this and new
resistance constructions, we prove for the first time that there exists an
election scheme that is resistant to all twenty standard types of electoral
control.

 <dc:description>  We present an analytically tractable model of Internet evolution at the level
of Autonomous Systems (ASs). We call our model the multiclass preferential
attachment (MPA) model. As its name suggests, it is based on preferential
attachment. All of its parameters are measurable from available Internet
topology data. Given the estimated values of these parameters, our analytic
results predict a definitive set of statistics characterizing the AS topology
structure. These statistics are not part of the model formulation. The MPA
model thus closes the &quot;measure-model-validate-predict&quot; loop, and provides
further evidence that preferential attachment is a driving force behind
Internet evolution.

 <dc:description>  We give an axiomatisation of strong bisimilarity on a small fragment of CCS
that does not feature the sum operator. This axiomatisation is then used to
derive congruence of strong bisimilarity in the finite pi-calculus in absence
of sum. To our knowledge, this is the only nontrivial subcalculus of the
pi-calculus that includes the full output prefix and for which strong
bisimilarity is a congruence.

 <dc:title>Duality and Capacity Region of AF Relay MAC and BC</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jafar, Syed A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gomadam, Krishna S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider multi-hop multiple access (MAC) and broadcast channels (BC) where
communication takes place with the assistance of relays that amplify and
forward (AF) their received signals. For a two hop parallel AF relay MAC,
assuming a sum power constraint across all relays we characterize optimal relay
amplification factors and the resulting capacity regions. We find that the
parallel AF relay MAC with total transmit power of the two users $P_1+P_2=P$
and total relay power $P_R$ is the dual of the parallel AF relay BC where the
MAC source nodes become the BC destination nodes, the MAC destination node
becomes the BC source node, the dual BC source transmit power is $P_R$ and the
total transmit power of the AF relays is $P$. The duality means that the
capacity region of the AF relay MAC with a sum power constraint $P$ on the
transmitters is the same as that of the dual BC. The duality relationship is
found to be useful in characterizing the capacity region of the AF relay BC as
the union of MAC capacity regions. The duality extends to distributed relays
with multiple antennas and more than 2 hops as well.

 <dc:description>  A theoretical memory with limited processing power and internal connectivity
at each element is proposed. This memory carries out parallel processing within
itself to solve generic array problems. The applicability of this in-memory
finest-grain massive SIMD approach is studied in some details. For an array of
N items, it reduces the total instruction cycle count of universal operations
such as insertion/deletion and match finding to ~ 1, local operations such as
filtering and template matching to ~ local operation size, and global
operations such as sum, finding global limit and sorting to ~\sqroot{N}
instruction cycles. It eliminates most streaming activities for data processing
purpose on the system bus. Yet it remains general-purposed, easy to use, pin
compatible with conventional memory, and practical for implementation.

languages, modeltheoretic preservation theorems, and algebraic logic; various
connections of each with computer science are taken up.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a generic C++ design to perform efficient and exact geometric
computations using lazy evaluations. Exact geometric computations are critical
for the robustness of geometric algorithms. Their efficiency is also critical
for most applications, hence the need for delaying the exact computations at
run time until they are actually needed. Our approach is generic and extensible
in the sense that it is possible to make it a library which users can extend to
their own geometric objects or primitives. It involves techniques such as
generic functor adaptors, dynamic polymorphism, reference counting for the
management of directed acyclic graphs and exception handling for detecting
cases where exact computations are needed. It also relies on multiple precision
arithmetic as well as interval arithmetic. We apply our approach to the whole
geometric kernel of CGAL.

 <dc:description>  The notion of differentiation index for DAE systems of arbitrary order with
generic second members is discussed by means of the study of the behavior of
the ranks of certain Jacobian associated sub-matrices. As a by-product, we
obtain upper bounds for the regularity of the Hilbert-Kolchin function and the
order of the ideal associated to the DAE systems under consideration, not
depending on characteristic sets. Some quantitative and algorithmic results
concerning differential transcendence bases and induced equivalent explicit ODE
systems are also established.

 <dc:description>  We study arithmetical and combinatorial properties of $\beta$-integers for
$\beta$ being the root of the equation $x^2=mx-n, m,n \in \mathbb N, m \geq
n+2\geq 3$. We determine with the accuracy of $\pm 1$ the maximal number of
$\beta$-fractional positions, which may arise as a result of addition of two
$\beta$-integers. For the infinite word $u_\beta$ coding distances between
consecutive $\beta$-integers, we determine precisely also the balance. The word
$u_\beta$ is the fixed point of the morphism $A \to A^{m-1}B$ and $B\to
A^{m-n-1}B$. In the case $n=1$ the corresponding infinite word $u_\beta$ is
sturmian and therefore 1-balanced. On the simplest non-sturmian example with
$n\geq 2$, we illustrate how closely the balance and arithmetical properties of
$\beta$-integers are related.

 <dc:description>  We present the first semi-streaming algorithms to determine k-connectivity of
an undirected graph with k being any constant. The semi-streaming model for
graph algorithms was introduced by Muthukrishnan in 2003 and turns out to be
useful when dealing with massive graphs streamed in from an external storage
device.
  Our two semi-streaming algorithms each compute a sparse subgraph of an input
graph G and can use this subgraph in a postprocessing step to decide
k-connectivity of G. To this end the first algorithm reads the input stream
only once and uses time O(k^2*n) to process each input edge. The second
algorithm reads the input k+1 times and needs time O(k+alpha(n)) per input
edge. Using its constructed subgraph the second algorithm can also generate all
l-separators of the input graph for all l&lt;k.

 <dc:description>  The stateless, low overhead and distributed nature of the Geographic routing
protocols attract a lot of research attentions recently. Since the geographic
routing would face void problems, leading to complementary routing such as
perimeter routing which degrades the performance of geographic routing, most
research works are focus on optimizing this complementary part of geographic
routing to improve it. The greedy forwarding part of geographic routing
provides an optimal routing performance in terms of path stretch. If the
geographic routing could adapt the greedy forwarding more, its performance
would be enhanced much more than to optimize the complementary routing such as
perimeter routings. Our work is the first time to do so. The aligned physical
coordinate is used to do the greedy forwarding routing decision which would
lead more greedy forwarding. We evaluate our design to most geographic routing
protocols, showing it helps much and maintain the stateless nature of
geographic routing.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of real-time data dissemination in wireless sensor
networks, in which data are associated with deadlines and it is desired for
data to reach the sink(s) by their deadlines. To this end, existing real-time
data dissemination work have developed packet scheduling schemes that
prioritize packets according to their deadlines. In this paper, we first
demonstrate that not only the scheduling discipline but also the routing
protocol has a significant impact on the success of real-time sensor data
dissemination. We show that the shortest path routing using the minimum number
of hops leads to considerably better performance than Geographical Forwarding,
which has often been used in existing real-time data dissemination work. We
also observe that packet prioritization by itself is not enough for real-time
data dissemination, since many high priority packets may simultaneously contend
for network resources, deteriorating the network performance. Instead,
real-time packets could be judiciously delayed to avoid severe contention as
long as their deadlines can be met. Based on this observation, we propose a
Just-in-Time Scheduling (JiTS) algorithm for scheduling data transmissions to
alleviate the shortcomings of the existing solutions. We explore several
policies for non-uniformly delaying data at different intermediate nodes to
account for the higher expected contention as the packet gets closer to the
sink(s). By an extensive simulation study, we demonstrate that JiTS can
significantly improve the deadline miss ratio and packet drop ratio compared to
existing approaches in various situations. Notably, JiTS improves the
performance requiring neither lower layer support nor synchronization among the
sensor nodes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider capacity of discrete-time channels with feedback for the general
case where the feedback is a time-invariant deterministic function of the
output samples. Under the assumption that the channel states take values in a
finite alphabet, we find an achievable rate and an upper bound on the capacity.
We further show that when the channel is indecomposable, and has no intersymbol
interference (ISI), its capacity is given by the limit of the maximum of the
(normalized) directed information between the input $X^N$ and the output $Y^N$,
i.e. $C = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \max I(X^N \to Y^N)$, where the
maximization is taken over the causal conditioning probability
$Q(x^N||z^{N-1})$ defined in this paper. The capacity result is used to show
that the source-channel separation theorem holds for time-invariant determinist
feedback. We also show that if the state of the channel is known both at the
encoder and the decoder then feedback does not increase capacity.

 <dc:title>Broadcast Cooperation Strategies for Two Colocated Users</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work considers the problem of communication from a single transmitter,
over a network with colocated users, through an independent block Rayleigh
fading channel. The colocation nature of the users allows cooperation, which
increases the overall achievable rate, from the transmitter to the destined
user. The transmitter is ignorant of the fading coefficients, while receivers
have access to perfect channel state information (CSI). This gives rise to the
multi-layer broadcast approach used by the transmitter. The broadcast approach
allows, in our network setting, to improve the cooperation between the
colocated users. That is due to the nature of broadcasting, where the better
the channel quality, the more layers that can be decoded. The cooperation
between the users is performed over an additive white Gaussian channels (AWGN),
with a relaying power constraint, and unlimited bandwidth. Three commonly used
cooperation techniques are studied: amplify-forward (AF), compress-forward
(CF), and decode-forward (DF). These methods are extended using the broadcast
approach, for the case of relaxed decoding delay constraint. For this case a
separated processing of the layers, which includes multi-session cooperation is
shown to be beneficial. Further, closed form expressions for infinitely many AF
sessions and recursive expressions for the more complex CF are given. Numerical
results for the various cooperation strategies demonstrate the efficiency of
multi-session cooperation.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the Linear Minimum Variance recursive state estimation
for the linear discrete time dynamic system with random state transition and
measurement matrices, i.e., random parameter matrices Kalman filtering. It is
shown that such system can be converted to a linear dynamic system with
deterministic parameter matrices but state-dependent process and measurement
noises. It is proved that under mild conditions, the recursive state estimation
of this system is still of the form of a modified Kalman filtering. More
importantly, this result can be applied to Kalman filtering with intermittent
and partial observations as well as randomly variant dynamic systems.

 <dc:title>From Invariants to Canonization in Parallel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Koebler, Johannes</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A function $f$ of a graph is called a complete graph invariant if the
isomorphism of graphs $G$ and $H$ is equivalent to the equality $f(G)=f(H)$.
If, in addition, $f(G)$ is a graph isomorphic to $G$, then $f$ is called a
canonical form for graphs. Gurevich proves that graphs have a polynomial-time
computable canonical form exactly when they have a polynomial-time computable
complete invariant. We extend this equivalence to the polylogarithmic-time
model of parallel computation for classes of graphs with bounded rigidity index
and for classes of graphs with small separators. In particular, our results
apply to three representative classes of graphs embeddable into a fixed
surface, namely, to 5-connected graphs, to 3-connected graphs admitting a
polyhedral embedding, and 3-connected graphs admitting a large-edge-width
embedding. Another application covers graphs with bounded treewidth. Since in
the latter case an NC complete-invariant algorithm is known, we conclude that
graphs of bounded treewidth have a canonical form (and even a canonical
labeling) computable in NC.

 <dc:description>  Media-processing applications, such as signal processing, 2D and 3D graphics
rendering, and image compression, are the dominant workloads in many embedded
systems today. The real-time constraints of those media applications have
taxing demands on today's processor performances with low cost, low power and
reduced design delay. To satisfy those challenges, a fast and efficient
strategy consists in upgrading a low cost general purpose processor core. This
approach is based on the personalization of a general RISC processor core
according the target multimedia application requirements. Thus, if the extra
cost is justified, the general purpose processor GPP core can be enforced with
instruction level coprocessors, coarse grain dedicated hardware, ad hoc
memories or new GPP cores. In this way the final design solution is tailored to
the application requirements. The proposed approach is based on three main
steps: the first one is the analysis of the targeted application using
efficient metrics. The second step is the selection of the appropriate
architecture template according to the first step results and recommendations.
The third step is the architecture generation. This approach is experimented
using various image and video algorithms showing its feasibility.

 <dc:title>Oblivious-Transfer Amplification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wullschleger, J&#xfc;rg</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Oblivious transfer is a primitive of paramount importance in cryptography or,
more precisely, two- and multi-party computation due to its universality.
Unfortunately, oblivious transfer cannot be achieved in an unconditionally
secure way for both parties from scratch. Therefore, it is a natural question
what information-theoretic primitives or computational assumptions oblivious
transfer can be based on.
  The results in our thesis are threefold. First, we present a protocol that
implements oblivious transfer from a weakened oblivious transfer called
universal oblivious transfer, where one of the two players may get additional
information. Our reduction is about twice as efficient as previous results.
  Weak oblivious transfer is an even weaker form of oblivious transfer, where
both players may obtain additional information about the other player's input,
and where the output can contain errors. We give a new, weaker definition of
weak oblivious transfer, as well as new reductions with a more detailed
analysis.
  Finally, we carry over our results to the computational setting and show how
a weak oblivious transfer that is sometimes incorrect and only mildly secure
against computationally bounded adversaries can be strengthened.

 <dc:description>  Existing models of Multi-Hop Wireless Networks (MHWNs) assume that
interference estimators of link quality such as observed busy time predict the
capacity of the links. We show that these estimators do not capture the
intricate interactions that occur at the scheduling level, which have a large
impact on effective link capacity under contention based MAC protocols. We
observe that scheduling problems arise only among those interfering sources
whose concurrent transmissions cannot be prevented by the MAC protocol's
collision management mechanisms; other interfering sources can arbitrate the
medium and coexist successfully. Based on this observation, we propose a
methodology for rating links and show that it achieves high correlation with
observed behavior in simulation. We then use this rating as part of a
branch-and-bound framework based on a linear programming formulation for
traffic engineering in static MHWNs and show that it achieves considerable
improvement in performance relative to interference based models.

 <dc:description>  We develop a Genetic Programming-based methodology that enables discovery of
novel functional forms for classical inter-atomic force-fields, used in
molecular dynamics simulations. Unlike previous efforts in the field, that fit
only the parameters to the fixed functional forms, we instead use a novel
algorithm to search the space of many possible functional forms. While a
follow-on practical procedure will use experimental and {\it ab inito} data to
find an optimal functional form for a forcefield, we first validate the
approach using a manufactured solution. This validation has the advantage of a
well-defined metric of success. We manufactured a training set of atomic
coordinate data with an associated set of global energies using the well-known
Lennard-Jones inter-atomic potential. We performed an automatic functional form
fitting procedure starting with a population of random functions, using a
genetic programming functional formulation, and a parallel tempering
Metropolis-based optimization algorithm. Our massively-parallel method
independently discovered the Lennard-Jones function after searching for several
hours on 100 processors and covering a miniscule portion of the configuration
space. We find that the method is suitable for unsupervised discovery of
functional forms for inter-atomic potentials/force-fields. We also find that
our parallel tempering Metropolis-based approach significantly improves the
optimization convergence time, and takes good advantage of the parallel cluster
architecture.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a new method for recovering m-sparse signals that is
simultaneously uniform and quick. We present a reconstruction algorithm whose
run time, O(m log^2(m) log^2(d)), is sublinear in the length d of the signal.
The reconstruction error is within a logarithmic factor (in m) of the optimal
m-term approximation error in l_1. In particular, the algorithm recovers
m-sparse signals perfectly and noisy signals are recovered with polylogarithmic
distortion. Our algorithm makes O(m log^2 (d)) measurements, which is within a
logarithmic factor of optimal. We also present a small-space implementation of
the algorithm. These sketching techniques and the corresponding reconstruction
algorithms provide an algorithmic dimension reduction in the l_1 norm. In
particular, vectors of support m in dimension d can be linearly embedded into
O(m log^2 d) dimensions with polylogarithmic distortion. We can reconstruct a
vector from its low-dimensional sketch in time O(m log^2(m) log^2(d)).
Furthermore, this reconstruction is stable and robust under small
perturbations.

 <dc:description>  From the motivation of algebraic attacks to stream and block
ciphers([1,2,7,13,14,15]), the concept of {\em algebraic immunity} (AI) was
introduced in [21] and studied in [3,5,10,11,17,18,19,20,21]. High algebraic
immunity is a necessary condition for resisting algebraic attacks. In this
paper, we give some lower bounds on algebraic immunity of Boolean functions.
The results are applied to give lower bounds on AI of symmetric Boolean
functions and rotation symmetric Boolean functions. Some balanced rotation
symmetric Boolean functions with their AI near the maximum possible value
$\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil$ are constructed.

 <dc:description>  We study the complexity of influencing elections through bribery: How
computationally complex is it for an external actor to determine whether by a
certain amount of bribing voters a specified candidate can be made the
election's winner? We study this problem for election systems as varied as
scoring protocols and Dodgson voting, and in a variety of settings regarding
homogeneous-vs.-nonhomogeneous electorate bribability,
bounded-size-vs.-arbitrary-sized candidate sets, weighted-vs.-unweighted
voters, and succinct-vs.-nonsuccinct input specification. We obtain both
polynomial-time bribery algorithms and proofs of the intractability of bribery,
and indeed our results show that the complexity of bribery is extremely
sensitive to the setting. For example, we find settings in which bribery is
NP-complete but manipulation (by voters) is in P, and we find settings in which
bribing weighted voters is NP-complete but bribing voters with individual bribe
thresholds is in P. For the broad class of elections (including plurality,
Borda, k-approval, and veto) known as scoring protocols, we prove a dichotomy
result for bribery of weighted voters: We find a simple-to-evaluate condition
that classifies every case as either NP-complete or in P.

 <dc:title>Competition and Request Routing Policies in Content Delivery Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The role of competition and monetary benefits in the design of Content
Delivery Networks (CDNs) is largely an unexplored area. In this paper, we
investigate the effect of competition among the competitive web based CDNs and
show that little difference in their performance may cause significant
financial gain/loss. It turns out that the economy of scale effect is very
significant for the success of a CDN in a competitive market. So CDN peering
might be a good idea. Since performance and conforming to the service level
agreement (SLA) with content providers is very important, we then focus on
designing CDN from this perspective. We provide an asymptotically optimal
static request routing policy for a CDN under a model where a CDN company
guarantees a certain level of user latency to the content providers in the SLA.

 <dc:description>  Spontaneous multi-party interaction - conversation among groups of three or
more participants - is part of daily life. While automated modeling of such
interactions has received increased attention in ubiquitous computing research,
there is little applied research on the organization of this highly dynamic and
spontaneous sociable interaction within small groups. We report here on an
applied conversation analytic study of small-group sociable talk, emphasizing
structural and temporal aspects that can inform computational models. In
particular, we examine the mechanics of multiple simultaneous conversational
floors - how participants initiate a new floor amidst an on-going floor, and
how they subsequently show their affiliation with one floor over another. We
also discuss the implications of these findings for the design of &quot;smart&quot;
multi-party applications.

 <dc:description>  We consider the model of population protocols introduced by Angluin et al.,
in which anonymous finite-state agents stably compute a predicate of the
multiset of their inputs via two-way interactions in the all-pairs family of
communication networks. We prove that all predicates stably computable in this
model (and certain generalizations of it) are semilinear, answering a central
open question about the power of the model. Removing the assumption of two-way
interaction, we also consider several variants of the model in which agents
communicate by anonymous message-passing where the recipient of each message is
chosen by an adversary and the sender is not identified to the recipient. These
one-way models are distinguished by whether messages are delivered immediately
or after a delay, whether a sender can record that it has sent a message, and
whether a recipient can queue incoming messages, refusing to accept new
messages until it has had a chance to send out messages of its own. We
characterize the classes of predicates stably computable in each of these
one-way models using natural subclasses of the semilinear predicates.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of transmission of a sequence of real data produced
by a Nyquist sampled band-limited analog source over a band-limited analog
channel, which introduces an additive white Gaussian noise. An analog coding
scheme is described, which can achieve a mean-squared error distortion
proportional to $(1+SNR)^{-B}$ for a bandwidth expansion factor of $B/R$, where
$0 &lt; R &lt; 1$ is the rate of individual component binary codes used in the
construction and $B \geq 1$ is an integer. Thus, over a wide range of SNR
values, the proposed code performs much better than any single previously known
analog coding system.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating the probability of error in
multi-hypothesis testing when MAP criterion is used. This probability, which is
also known as the Bayes risk is an important measure in many communication and
information theory problems. In general, the exact Bayes risk can be difficult
to obtain. Many upper and lower bounds are known in literature. One such upper
bound is the equivocation bound due to R\'enyi which is of great philosophical
interest because it connects the Bayes risk to conditional entropy. Here we
give a simple derivation for an improved equivocation bound.
  We then give some typical examples of problems where these bounds can be of
use. We first consider a binary hypothesis testing problem for which the exact
Bayes risk is difficult to derive. In such problems bounds are of interest.
Furthermore using the bounds on Bayes risk derived in the paper and a random
coding argument, we prove a lower bound on equivocation valid for most random
codes over memoryless channels.

 <dc:description>  The structure of the Internet at the Autonomous System (AS) level has been
studied by both the Physics and Computer Science communities. We extend this
work to include features of the core and the periphery, taking a radial
perspective on AS network structure. New methods for plotting AS data are
described, and they are used to analyze data sets that have been extended to
contain edges missing from earlier collections. In particular, the average
distance from one vertex to the rest of the network is used as the baseline
metric for investigating radial structure. Common vertex-specific quantities
are plotted against this metric to reveal distinctive characteristics of
central and peripheral vertices. Two data sets are analyzed using these
measures as well as two common generative models (Barabasi-Albert and Inet). We
find a clear distinction between the highly connected core and a sparse
periphery. We also find that the periphery has a more complex structure than
that predicted by degree distribution or the two generative models.

 <dc:title>Wireless ad-hoc networks: Strategies and Scaling laws for the fixed SNR
  regime</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Aeron, Shuchin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Saligrama, Venkatesh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper deals with throughput scaling laws for random ad-hoc wireless
networks in a rich scattering environment. We develop schemes to optimize the
ratio, $\rho(n)$ of achievable network sum capacity to the sum of the
point-to-point capacities of source-destinations pairs operating in isolation.
For fixed SNR networks, i.e., where the worst case SNR over the
source-destination pairs is fixed independent of $n$, we show that
collaborative strategies yield a scaling law of $\rho(n) = {\cal
O}(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}})$ in contrast to multi-hop strategies which yield a
scaling law of $\rho(n) = {\cal O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$. While, networks where
worst case SNR goes to zero, do not preclude the possibility of collaboration,
multi-hop strategies achieve optimal throughput. The plausible reason is that
the gains due to collaboration cannot offset the effect of vanishing receive
SNR. This suggests that for fixed SNR networks, a network designer should look
for network protocols that exploit collaboration. The fact that most current
networks operate in a fixed SNR interference limited environment provides
further motivation for considering this regime.

 <dc:description>  We propose an algorithm based on Newton's method and subdivision for finding
all zeros of a polynomial system in a bounded region of the plane. This
algorithm can be used to find the intersections between a line and a surface,
which has applications in graphics and computer-aided geometric design. The
algorithm can operate on polynomials represented in any basis that satisfies a
few conditions. The power basis, the Bernstein basis, and the first-kind
Chebyshev basis are among those compatible with the algorithm. The main novelty
of our algorithm is an analysis showing that its running is bounded only in
terms of the condition number of the polynomial's zeros and a constant
depending on the polynomial basis.

 <dc:description>  We describe two efficient on-line algorithms to simplify weighted graphs by
eliminating degree-two vertices. Our algorithms are on-line in that they react
to updates on the data, keeping the simplification up-to-date. The supported
updates are insertions of vertices and edges; hence, our algorithms are
partially dynamic. We provide both analytical and empirical evaluations of the
efficiency of our approaches. Specifically, we prove an O(log n) upper bound on
the amortized time complexity of our maintenance algorithms, with n the number
of insertions.

 <dc:title>Self-Stabilizing Byzantine Pulse Synchronization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The ``Pulse Synchronization'' problem can be loosely described as targeting
to invoke a recurring distributed event as simultaneously as possible at the
different nodes and with a frequency that is as regular as possible. This
target becomes surprisingly subtle and difficult to achieve when facing both
transient and permanent failures. In this paper we present an algorithm for
pulse synchronization that self-stabilizes while at the same time tolerating a
permanent presence of Byzantine faults. The Byzantine nodes might incessantly
try to de-synchronize the correct nodes. Transient failures might throw the
system into an arbitrary state in which correct nodes have no common notion
what-so-ever, such as time or round numbers, and can thus not infer anything
from their own local states upon the state of other correct nodes. The
presented algorithm grants nodes the ability to infer that eventually all
correct nodes will invoke their pulses within a very short time interval of
each other and will do so regularly.
  Pulse synchronization has previously been shown to be a powerful tool for
designing general self-stabilizing Byzantine algorithms and is hitherto the
only method that provides for the general design of efficient practical
protocols in the confluence of these two fault models. The difficulty, in
general, to design any algorithm in this fault model may be indicated by the
remarkably few algorithms resilient to both fault models. The few published
self-stabilizing Byzantine algorithms are typically complicated and sometimes
converge from an arbitrary initial state only after exponential or super
exponential time.

 <dc:description>  We introduce LCL covers of closed n-dimensional manifolds by n-dimensional
disks and study their properties. We show that any LCL cover of an
n-dimensional sphere can be converted to the minimal LCL cover, which consists
of 2n+2 disks. We prove that an LCL collection of n-disks is a cover of a
continuous n-sphere if and only if the intersection graph of this collection is
a digital n-sphere. Using a link between LCL covers of closed continuous
n-manifolds and digital n-manifolds, we find conditions where a continuous
closed three-dimensional manifold is the three-dimensional sphere. We discuss a
connection between the classification problems for closed continuous
three-dimensional manifolds and digital three-manifolds.

 <dc:title>On Universality in Real Computation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Models of computation operating over the real numbers and computing a larger
class of functions compared to the class of general recursive functions
invariably introduce a non-finite element of infinite information encoded in an
arbitrary non-computable number or non-recursive function. In this paper we
show that Turing universality is only possible at every Turing degree but not
over all, in that sense universality at the first level is elegantly well
defined while universality at higher degrees is at least ambiguous. We propose
a concept of universal relativity and universal jump between levels in the
arithmetical and analytical hierarchy.

 <dc:description>  Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic probability are defined only up to an
additive resp. multiplicative constant, since their actual values depend on the
choice of the universal reference computer. In this paper, we analyze a natural
approach to eliminate this machine-dependence.
  Our method is to assign algorithmic probabilities to the different computers
themselves, based on the idea that &quot;unnatural&quot; computers should be hard to
emulate. Therefore, we study the Markov process of universal computers randomly
emulating each other. The corresponding stationary distribution, if it existed,
would give a natural and machine-independent probability measure on the
computers, and also on the binary strings.
  Unfortunately, we show that no stationary distribution exists on the set of
all computers; thus, this method cannot eliminate machine-dependence. Moreover,
we show that the reason for failure has a clear and interesting physical
interpretation, suggesting that every other conceivable attempt to get rid of
those additive constants must fail in principle, too.
  However, we show that restricting to some subclass of computers might help to
get rid of some amount of machine-dependence in some situations, and the
resulting stationary computer and string probabilities have beautiful
properties.

 <dc:description>  Clock synchronization is a very fundamental task in distributed system. It
thus makes sense to require an underlying clock synchronization mechanism to be
highly fault-tolerant. A self-stabilizing algorithm seeks to attain
synchronization once lost; a Byzantine algorithm assumes synchronization is
never lost and focuses on containing the influence of the permanent presence of
faulty nodes. There are efficient self-stabilizing solutions for clock
synchronization as well as efficient solutions that are resilient to Byzantine
faults. In contrast, to the best of our knowledge there is no practical
solution that is self-stabilizing while tolerating the permanent presence of
Byzantine nodes. We present the first linear-time self-stabilizing Byzantine
clock synchronization algorithm. Our deterministic clock synchronization
algorithm is based on the observation that all clock synchronization algorithms
require events for exchanging clock values and re-synchronizing the clocks to
within safe bounds. These events usually need to happen synchronously at the
different nodes. In classic Byzantine algorithms this is fulfilled or aided by
having the clocks initially close to each other and thus the actual clock
values can be used for synchronizing the events. This implies that clock values
cannot differ arbitrarily, which necessarily renders these solutions to be
non-stabilizing. Our scheme suggests using an underlying distributed pulse
synchronization module that is uncorrelated to the clock values.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we provide an analytical study of the theory of multi-valued
and fuzzy cellular automata where the fuzziness appears as the result of the
application of an underlying multi-valued or continuous logic as opposed to
standard logic as used conventionally. Using the disjunctive normal form of any
one of the 255 ECA's so defined, we modify the underlying logic structure and
redefine the ECA within the framework of this new logic. The idea here is to
show that the evolution of space-time diagrams of ECA's under even a
probabilistic logic can exhibit non-chaotic behavior. This is looked at
specifically for Probabilistic Rule 110, in contrast with Boolean Rule 110
which is known to be capable of universal computation.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a robust and transparent scheme of watermarking that
exploits the human visual systems' sensitivity to frequency, along with local
image characteristics obtained from the spatial domain. The underlying idea is
generating a visual mask based on the visual systems' perception of image
content. This mask is used to embed a decimal sequence while keeping its
amplitude below the distortion sensitivity of the image pixel. We consider
texture, luminance, corner and the edge information in the image to generate a
mask that makes the addition of the watermark imperceptible to the human eye.

 <dc:description>  In answer set programming (ASP), a problem at hand is solved by (i) writing a
logic program whose answer sets correspond to the solutions of the problem, and
by (ii) computing the answer sets of the program using an answer set solver as
a search engine. Typically, a programmer creates a series of gradually
improving logic programs for a particular problem when optimizing program
length and execution time on a particular solver. This leads the programmer to
a meta-level problem of ensuring that the programs are equivalent, i.e., they
give rise to the same answer sets. To ease answer set programming at
methodological level, we propose a translation-based method for verifying the
equivalence of logic programs. The basic idea is to translate logic programs P
and Q under consideration into a single logic program EQT(P,Q) whose answer
sets (if such exist) yield counter-examples to the equivalence of P and Q. The
method is developed here in a slightly more general setting by taking the
visibility of atoms properly into account when comparing answer sets. The
translation-based approach presented in the paper has been implemented as a
translator called lpeq that enables the verification of weak equivalence within
the smodels system using the same search engine as for the search of models.
Our experiments with lpeq and smodels suggest that establishing the equivalence
of logic programs in this way is in certain cases much faster than naive
cross-checking of answer sets.

 <dc:title>Similarity of Semantic Relations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  There are at least two kinds of similarity. Relational similarity is
correspondence between relations, in contrast with attributional similarity,
which is correspondence between attributes. When two words have a high degree
of attributional similarity, we call them synonyms. When two pairs of words
have a high degree of relational similarity, we say that their relations are
analogous. For example, the word pair mason:stone is analogous to the pair
carpenter:wood. This paper introduces Latent Relational Analysis (LRA), a
method for measuring relational similarity. LRA has potential applications in
many areas, including information extraction, word sense disambiguation, and
information retrieval. Recently the Vector Space Model (VSM) of information
retrieval has been adapted to measuring relational similarity, achieving a
score of 47% on a collection of 374 college-level multiple-choice word analogy
questions. In the VSM approach, the relation between a pair of words is
characterized by a vector of frequencies of predefined patterns in a large
corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three ways: (1) the patterns are
derived automatically from the corpus, (2) the Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) automatically generated
synonyms are used to explore variations of the word pairs. LRA achieves 56% on
the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent to the average human score
of 57%. On the related problem of classifying semantic relations, LRA achieves
similar gains over the VSM.

 <dc:title>Minimum Cost Homomorphisms to Semicomplete Bipartite Digraphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For digraphs $D$ and $H$, a mapping $f: V(D)\dom V(H)$ is a homomorphism of
$D$ to $H$ if $uv\in A(D)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in A(H).$ If, moreover, each
vertex $u \in V(D)$ is associated with costs $c_i(u), i \in V(H)$, then the
cost of the homomorphism $f$ is $\sum_{u\in V(D)}c_{f(u)}(u)$. For each fixed
digraph $H$, we have the {\em minimum cost homomorphism problem for} $H$. The
problem is to decide, for an input graph $D$ with costs $c_i(u),$ $u \in V(D),
i\in V(H)$, whether there exists a homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ and, if one
exists, to find one of minimum cost. Minimum cost homomorphism problems
encompass (or are related to) many well studied optimization problems. We
describe a dichotomy of the minimum cost homomorphism problem for semicomplete
multipartite digraphs $H$. This solves an open problem from an earlier paper.
To obtain the dichotomy of this paper, we introduce and study a new notion, a
$k$-Min-Max ordering of digraphs.

 <dc:description>  The application of decentralized reputation systems is a promising approach
to ensure cooperation and fairness, as well as to address random failures and
malicious attacks in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. However, they are potentially
vulnerable to liars. With our work, we provide a first step to analyzing
robustness of a reputation system based on a deviation test. Using a mean-field
approach to our stochastic process model, we show that liars have no impact
unless their number exceeds a certain threshold (phase transition). We give
precise formulae for the critical values and thus provide guidelines for an
optimal choice of parameters.

provability operator generalizes to programs with monotone constraint atoms,
but the generalization involves nondeterminism. Our main results demonstrate
that our formalism is a common generalization of (1) normal logic programming
with its semantics of models, supported models and stable models, (2) logic
programming with weight atoms (lparse programs) with the semantics of stable
models, as defined by Niemela, Simons and Soininen, and (3) of disjunctive
logic programming with the possible-model semantics of Sakama and Inoue.

 <dc:description>  Despite significant progress in the theory and practice of program analysis,
analysing properties of heap data has not reached the same level of maturity as
the analysis of static and stack data. The spatial and temporal structure of
stack and static data is well understood while that of heap data seems
arbitrary and is unbounded. We devise bounded representations which summarize
properties of the heap data. This summarization is based on the structure of
the program which manipulates the heap. The resulting summary representations
are certain kinds of graphs called access graphs. The boundedness of these
representations and the monotonicity of the operations to manipulate them make
it possible to compute them through data flow analysis.
  An important application which benefits from heap reference analysis is
garbage collection, where currently liveness is conservatively approximated by
reachability from program variables. As a consequence, current garbage
collectors leave a lot of garbage uncollected, a fact which has been confirmed
by several empirical studies. We propose the first ever end-to-end static
analysis to distinguish live objects from reachable objects. We use this
information to make dead objects unreachable by modifying the program. This
application is interesting because it requires discovering data flow
information representing complex semantics. In particular, we discover four
properties of heap data: liveness, aliasing, availability, and anticipability.
Together, they cover all combinations of directions of analysis (i.e. forward
and backward) and confluence of information (i.e. union and intersection). Our
analysis can also be used for plugging memory leaks in C/C++ languages.

 <dc:description>  With the feature of multi-master bus access, nondestructive contention-based
arbitration and flexible configuration, Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is
applied into the control system of Wire Harness Assembly Machine (WHAM). To
accomplish desired goal, the specific features of the CAN bus is analyzed by
compared with other field buses and the functional performances in the CAN bus
system of WHAM is discussed. Then the application layer planning of CAN bus for
dynamic priority is presented. The critical issue for the use of CAN bus system
in WHAM is the data transfer rate between different nodes. So processing
efficient model is introduced to assist analyzing data transfer procedure.
Through the model, it is convenient to verify the real time feature of the CAN

 <dc:title>Lp Computable Functions and Fourier Series</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Moser, Philippe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies how well computable functions can be approximated by their
Fourier series. To this end, we equip the space of Lp-computable functions
(computable Lebesgue integrable functions) with a size notion, by introducing
Lp-computable Baire categories.
  We show that Lp-computable Baire categories satisfy the following three basic
properties. Singleton sets {f} (where f is Lp-computable) are meager, suitable
infinite unions of meager sets are meager, and the whole space of Lp-computable
functions is not meager. We give an alternative characterization of meager sets
via Banach Mazur games.
  We study the convergence of Fourier series for Lp-computable functions and
show that whereas for every p&gt;1, the Fourier series of every Lp-computable
function f converges to f in the Lp norm, the set of L1-computable functions
whose Fourier series does not diverge almost everywhere is meager.

 <dc:description>  We describe a new wavelet transform, for use on hierarchies or binary rooted
trees. The theoretical framework of this approach to data analysis is
described. Case studies are used to further exemplify this approach. A first
set of application studies deals with data array smoothing, or filtering. A
second set of application studies relates to hierarchical tree condensation.
Finally, a third study explores the wavelet decomposition, and the
reproducibility of data sets such as text, including a new perspective on the
generation or computability of such data objects.

 <dc:title>Spherical Indexing for Neighborhood Queries</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brodu, Nicolas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This is an algorithm for finding neighbors when the objects can freely move
and have no predefined position. The query consists in finding neighbors for a
center location and a given radius. Space is discretized in cubic cells. This
algorithm introduces a direct spherical indexing that gives the list of all
cells making up the query sphere, for any radius and any center location. It
can additionally take in account both cyclic and non-cyclic regions of
interest. Finding only the K nearest neighbors naturally benefits from the
spherical indexing by minimally running through the sphere from center to edge,
and reducing the maximum distance when K neighbors have been found.

 <dc:title>Realistic Boundary Conditions for Ad Hoc Network Node Mobility Models
  and a New Approach to the Random Waypoint Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hohensee, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>C.2.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we examine the cause of the border effect observed in many
mobility models used to construct simulations of ad hoc networking protocol
performance. We specify conditions under which a node mobility model must
produce spatial mobile node distribution functions that obey the diffusion
equation. In particular demonstrate that these conditions are satisfied by the
random direction (RD) model. We show that it is possible to construct mobility
models that attain uniform steady-state distributions without resorting to
reflection or ``wrapping'' of nodes at the border of a test region. Finally, we
show that the random waypoint (RWP) model may be reproduced by the application
of a ``volume rule'' to an RD model. This volume rule violates the assumptions
that lead to the diffusion equation. We suggest a generalization of the RWP
model that can provide more uniform mobile node distributions.

 <dc:title>Calculating modules in contextual logic program refinement</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Colvin, Robert</dc:creator>

 <dc:creator>Strooper, Paul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The refinement calculus for logic programs is a framework for deriving logic
programs from specifications. It is based on a wide-spectrum language that can
express both specifications and code, and a refinement relation that models the
notion of correct implementation. In this paper we extend and generalise
earlier work on contextual refinement. Contextual refinement simplifies the
refinement process by abstractly capturing the context of a subcomponent of a
program, which typically includes information about the values of the free
variables. This paper also extends and generalises module refinement. A module
is a collection of procedures that operate on a common data type; module
refinement between a specification module A and an implementation module C
allows calls to the procedures of A to be systematically replaced with calls to
the corresponding procedures of C. Based on the conditions for module
refinement, we present a method for calculating an implementation module from a
specification module. Both contextual and module refinement within the
refinement calculus have been generalised from earlier work and the results are
presented in a unified framework.

 <dc:title>An Architectural Style for Ajax</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mesbah, Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>van Deursen, Arie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new breed of web application, dubbed AJAX, is emerging in response to a
limited degree of interactivity in large-grain stateless Web interactions. At
the heart of this new approach lies a single page interaction model that
facilitates rich interactivity. We have studied and experimented with several
AJAX frameworks trying to understand their architectural properties. In this
paper, we summarize three of these frameworks and examine their properties and
introduce the SPIAR architectural style. We describe the guiding software
engineering principles and the constraints chosen to induce the desired
properties. The style emphasizes user interface component development, and
intermediary delta-communication between client/server components, to improve
user interactivity and ease of development. In addition, we use the concepts
and principles to discuss various open issues in AJAX frameworks and
application development.

 <dc:description>  During the last decade there has been a huge interest in Grid technologies,
and numerous Grid projects have been initiated with various visions of the
Grid. While all these visions have the same goal of resource sharing, they
differ in the functionality that a Grid supports, the grid characterisation,
programming environments, etc. In this paper we present a new Grid system
dedicated to deal with data issues, called DGET (Data Grid Environment and
Tools). DGET is characterized by its peer-to-peer communication system and
entity-based architecture, therefore, taking advantage of the main
functionality of both systems; P2P and Grid. DGET is currently under
development and a prototype implementing the main components is in its first
phase of testing. In this paper we limit our description to the system
architectural features and to the main differences with other systems.

 <dc:description>  Grid environments have recently been developed with low stretch and overheads
that increase with the logarithm of the number of nodes in the system. Getting
and sending data to/from a large numbers of nodes is gaining importance due to
an increasing number of independent data providers and the heterogeneity of the
network/Grid. One of the key challenges is to achieve a balance between low
bandwidth consumption and good reliability. In this paper we present an
implementation of a reliable multicast protocol over a fault tolerant MPI:
MPICHV2. It can provide one way to solve the problem of transferring large
chunks of data between applications running on a grid with limited network
links. We first show that we can achieve similar performance as the MPICH-P4
implementation by using multicast with data compression in a cluster. Next, we
provide a theoretical cluster organization and GRID network architecture to
harness the performance provided by using multicast. Finally, we present the
conclusion and future work.

 <dc:description>  Grid computing has enabled pooling a very large number of heterogeneous
resource administered by different security domains. Applications are
dynamically deployed on the resources available at the time. Dynamic nature of
the resources and applications requirements makes needs the grid middleware to
support the ability of migrating a running application to a different resource.
Especially, Grid applications are typically long running and thus stoping them
and starting them from scratch is not a feasible option. This paper presents an
overview of migration support in a java based grid middleware called DGET.
Migration support in DGET includes multi-threaded migration and asynchronous
migration as well.

 <dc:title>Code Annealing and the Suppressing Effect of the Cyclically Lifted LDPC
  Code Ensemble</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Chih-Chun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Code annealing, a new method of designing good codes of short block length,
is proposed, which is then concatenated with cyclic lifting to create finite
codes of low frame error rate (FER) error floors without performance outliers.
The stopping set analysis is performed on the cyclically lifted code ensemble
assuming uniformly random lifting sequences, and the suppressing effect/weight
of the cyclic lifting is identified for the first time, based on which the
ensemble FER error floor can be analytically determined and a scaling law is
derived. Both the first-order and high-order suppressing effects are discussed
and quantified by different methods including the explicit expression, an
algorithmic upper bound, and an algebraic lower bound.
  The mismatch between the suppressing weight and the stopping distances
explains the dramatic performance discrepancy among different cyclically lifted
codes when the underlying base codes have degree 2 variable nodes or not. For
the former case, a degree augmentation method is further introduced to mitigate
this metric mismatch, and a systematic method of constructing irregular codes
of low FER error floors is presented. Both regular and irregular codes of very
low FER error floors are reported, for which the improvement factor ranges from
10^6-10^4 when compared to the classic graph-based code ensembles.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we proposed a hierarchical P2P network based on a dynamic
partitioning on a 1-D space. This hierarchy is created and maintained
dynamically and provides a gridmiddleware (like DGET) a P2P basic functionality
for resource discovery and load-balancing.This network architecture is called
TreeP (Tree based P2P network architecture) and is based on atessellation of a
1-D space. We show that this topology exploits in an efficient way
theheterogeneity feature of the network while limiting the overhead introduced
by the overlaymaintenance. Experimental results show that this topology is

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We apply two variations of the principle of Minimum Cross Entropy (the
Kullback information measure) to fit parameterized probability density models
to observed data densities. For an array beamforming problem with P incident
narrowband point sources, N &gt; P sensors, and colored noise, both approaches
yield eigenvector fitting methods similar to that of the MUSIC algorithm[1].
Furthermore, the corresponding cross-entropies are related to the MDL model
order selection criterion[2].

 <dc:title>The Tree Inclusion Problem: In Linear Space and Faster</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bille, Philip</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Goertz, Inge Li</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given two rooted, ordered, and labeled trees $P$ and $T$ the tree inclusion
problem is to determine if $P$ can be obtained from $T$ by deleting nodes in
$T$. This problem has recently been recognized as an important query primitive
in XML databases. Kilpel\&quot;ainen and Mannila [\emph{SIAM J. Comput. 1995}]
presented the first polynomial time algorithm using quadratic time and space.
Since then several improved results have been obtained for special cases when
$P$ and $T$ have a small number of leaves or small depth. However, in the worst
case these algorithms still use quadratic time and space. Let $n_S$, $l_S$, and
$d_S$ denote the number of nodes, the number of leaves, and the %maximum depth
of a tree $S \in \{P, T\}$. In this paper we show that the tree inclusion
problem can be solved in space $O(n_T)$ and time: O(\min(l_Pn_T, l_Pl_T\log
\log n_T + n_T, \frac{n_Pn_T}{\log n_T} + n_{T}\log n_{T})). This improves or
matches the best known time complexities while using only linear space instead
of quadratic. This is particularly important in practical applications, such as
XML databases, where the space is likely to be a bottleneck.

 <dc:title>Decidability of Type-checking in the Calculus of Algebraic Constructions
  with Size Annotations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blanqui, Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Since Val Tannen's pioneer work on the combination of simply-typed
lambda-calculus and first-order rewriting (LICS'88), many authors have
contributed to this subject by extending it to richer typed lambda-calculi and
rewriting paradigms, culminating in calculi like the Calculus of Algebraic
Constructions. These works provide theoretical foundations for type-theoretic
proof assistants where functions and predicates are defined by oriented
higher-order equations. This kind of definitions subsumes induction-based
definitions, is easier to write and provides more automation. On the other
hand, checking that user-defined rewrite rules are strongly normalizing and
confluent, and preserve the decidability of type-checking when combined with
beta-reduction, is more difficult. Most termination criteria rely on the term
structure. In a previous work, we extended to dependent types and higher-order
rewriting, the notion of ``sized types'' studied by several authors in the
simpler framework of ML-like languages, and proved that it preserves strong
normalization. The main contribution of the present paper is twofold. First, we
prove that, in the Calculus of Algebraic Constructions with size annotations,
the problems of type inference and type-checking are decidable, provided that
the sets of constraints generated by size annotations are satisfiable and admit
most general solutions. Second, we prove the later properties for a size
algebra rich enough for capturing usual induction-based definitions and much
more.

 <dc:title>A Robust Solution Procedure for Hyperelastic Solids with Large Boundary

 <dc:description>  Compressible Mooney-Rivlin theory has been used to model hyperelastic solids,
such as rubber and porous polymers, and more recently for the modeling of soft
tissues for biomedical tissues, undergoing large elastic deformations. We
propose a solution procedure for Lagrangian finite element discretization of a
static nonlinear compressible Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic solid. We consider the
case in which the boundary condition is a large prescribed deformation, so that
mesh tangling becomes an obstacle for straightforward algorithms. Our solution
procedure involves a largely geometric procedure to untangle the mesh: solution
of a sequence of linear systems to obtain initial guesses for interior nodal
positions for which no element is inverted. After the mesh is untangled, we
take Newton iterations to converge to a mechanical equilibrium. The Newton
iterations are safeguarded by a line search similar to one used in
optimization. Our computational results indicate that the algorithm is up to 70
times faster than a straightforward Newton continuation procedure and is also
more robust (i.e., able to tolerate much larger deformations). For a few
extremely large deformations, the deformed mesh could only be computed through
the use of an expensive Newton continuation method while using a tight
convergence tolerance and taking very small steps.

 <dc:description>  The confluence of untyped lambda-calculus with unconditional rewriting has
already been studied in various directions. In this paper, we investigate the
confluence of lambda-calculus with conditional rewriting and provide general
results in two directions. First, when conditional rules are algebraic. This
extends results of Muller and Dougherty for unconditional rewriting. Two cases
are considered, whether beta-reduction is allowed or not in the evaluation of
conditions. Moreover, Dougherty's result is improved from the assumption of
strongly normalizing beta-reduction to weakly normalizing beta-reduction. We
also provide examples showing that outside these conditions, modularity of
confluence is difficult to achieve. Second, we go beyond the algebraic
framework and get new confluence results using an extended notion of
orthogonality that takes advantage of the conditional part of rewrite rules.

 <dc:title>In Quest of Image Semantics: Are We Looking for It Under the Right

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the last years we witness a dramatic growth of research focused on
semantic image understanding. Indeed, without understanding image content
successful accomplishment of any image-processing task is simply incredible. Up
to the recent times, the ultimate need for such understanding has been met by
the knowledge that a domain expert or a vision system supervisor have
contributed to every image-processing application. The advent of the Internet
has drastically changed this situation. Internet sources of visual information
are diffused and dispersed over the whole Web, so the duty of information
content discovery and evaluation must be relegated now to an image
understanding agent (a machine or a computer program) capable to perform image
content assessment at a remote image location. Development of Content Based
Image Retrieval (CBIR) techniques was a right move in a right direction,
launched about ten years ago. Unfortunately, very little progress has been made
since then. The reason for this can be seen in a rank of long lasting
misconceptions that CBIR designers are continuing to adhere to. I hope, my
arguments will help them to change their minds.

 <dc:description>  As a generalization of cyclic codes, quasi-cyclic (QC) codes contain many
good linear codes. But quasi-cyclic codes studied so far are mainly limited to
one generator (1-generator) QC codes. In this correspondence, 2-generator and
3-generator QC codes are studied, and many good, new QC codes are constructed
from simplex codes. Some new binary QC codes or related codes, that improve the
bounds on maximum minimum distance for binary linear codes are constructed.
They are 5-generator QC [93, 17, 34] and [254, 23, 102] codes, and related [96,
17, 36], [256, 23, 104] codes.

 <dc:description>  An approach to the classification problem of machine learning, based on
building local classification rules, is developed. The local rules are
considered as projections of the global classification rules to the event we
want to classify. A massive global optimization algorithm is used for
optimization of quality criterion. The algorithm, which has polynomial
complexity in typical case, is used to find all high--quality local rules. The
other distinctive feature of the algorithm is the integration of attributes
levels selection (for ordered attributes) with rules searching and original
conflicting rules resolution strategy. The algorithm is practical; it was
tested on a number of data sets from UCI repository, and a comparison with the
other predicting techniques is presented.

 <dc:title>On the freeze quantifier in Constraint LTL: decidability and complexity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Constraint LTL, a generalisation of LTL over Presburger constraints, is often
used as a formal language to specify the behavior of operational models with
constraints. The freeze quantifier can be part of the language, as in some
real-time logics, but this variable-binding mechanism is quite general and
ubiquitous in many logical languages (first-order temporal logics, hybrid
logics, logics for sequence diagrams, navigation logics, logics with
lambda-abstraction etc.). We show that Constraint LTL over the simple domain
(N,=) augmented with the freeze quantifier is undecidable which is a surprising
result in view of the poor language for constraints (only equality tests). Many
versions of freeze-free Constraint LTL are decidable over domains with
qualitative predicates and our undecidability result actually establishes
Sigma_1^1-completeness. On the positive side, we provide complexity results
when the domain is finite (EXPSPACE-completeness) or when the formulae are flat
in a sense introduced in the paper. Our undecidability results are sharp (i.e.
with restrictions on the number of variables) and all our complexity
characterisations ensure completeness with respect to some complexity class
(mainly PSPACE and EXPSPACE).

 <dc:description>  For a graph G with real weights assigned to the vertices (edges), the MAX
H-SUBGRAPH problem is to find an H-subgraph of G with maximum total weight, if
one exists. The all-pairs MAX H-SUBGRAPH problem is to find for every pair of
vertices u,v, a maximum H-subgraph containing both u and v, if one exists. Our
main results are new strongly polynomial algorithms for the all-pairs MAX
H-SUBGRAPH problem for vertex weighted graphs. We also give improved algorithms
for the MAX-H SUBGRAPH problem for edge weighted graphs, and various related
problems, including computing the first k most significant bits of the distance
product of two matrices. Some of our algorithms are based, in part, on fast
matrix multiplication.

 <dc:title>An effective edge--directed frequency filter for removal of aliasing in
  upsampled images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rataj, Artur</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.4.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Raster images can have a range of various distortions connected to their
raster structure. Upsampling them might in effect substantially yield the
raster structure of the original image, known as aliasing. The upsampling
itself may introduce aliasing into the upsampled image as well. The presented
method attempts to remove the aliasing using frequency filters based on the
discrete fast Fourier transform, and applied directionally in certain regions
placed along the edges in the image.
  As opposed to some anisotropic smoothing methods, the presented algorithm
aims to selectively reduce only the aliasing, preserving the sharpness of image
details.
  The method can be used as a post--processing filter along with various
upsampling algorithms. It was experimentally shown that the method can improve
the visual quality of the upsampled images.

 <dc:title>Scheduling for Stable and Reliable Communication over Multiaccess
  Channels and Degraded Broadcast Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sayee, K. C. V. Kalyanarama Sesha</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Information-theoretic arguments focus on modeling the reliability of
information transmission, assuming availability of infinite data at sources,
thus ignoring randomness in message generation times at the respective sources.
However, in information transport networks, not only is reliable transmission
important, but also stability, i.e., finiteness of mean delay incurred by
messages from the time of generation to the time of successful reception.
Usually, delay analysis is done separately using queueing-theoretic arguments,
whereas reliable information transmission is studied using information theory.
In this thesis, we investigate these two important aspects of data
communication jointly by suitably combining models from these two fields. In
particular, we model scheduled communication of messages, that arrive in a
random process, (i) over multiaccess channels, with either independent decoding
or joint decoding, and (ii) over degraded broadcast channels. The scheduling
policies proposed permit up to a certain maximum number of messages for
simultaneous transmission.
  In the first part of the thesis, we develop a multi-class discrete-time
processor-sharing queueing model, and then investigate the stability of this
queue. In particular, we model the queue by a discrete-time Markov chain
defined on a countable state space, and then establish (i) a sufficient
condition for $c$-regularity of the chain, and hence positive recurrence and
finiteness of stationary mean of the function $c$ of the state, and (ii) a
sufficient condition for transience of the chain. These stability results form
the basis for the conclusions drawn in the thesis.

 <dc:title>Baire Categories on Small Complexity Classes and Meager-Comeager Laws</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Moser, Philippe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce two resource-bounded Baire category notions on small complexity
classes such as P, SUBEXP, and PSPACE and on probabilistic classes such as BPP,
which differ on how the corresponding finite extension strategies are computed.
We give an alternative characterization of small sets via resource-bounded
Banach-Mazur games.
  As an application of the first notion, we show that for almost every language
A (i.e. all except a meager class) computable in subexponential time,
P(A)=BPP(A). We also show that almost all languages in PSPACE do not have small
nonuniform complexity.
  We then switch to the second Baire category notion (called
locally-computable), and show that the class SPARSE is meager in P. We show
that in contrast to the resource-bounded measure case, meager-comeager laws can
be obtained for many standard complexity classes, relative to
locally-computable Baire category on BPP and PSPACE.
  Another topic where locally-computable Baire categories differ from
resource-bounded measure is regarding weak-completeness: we show that there is
no weak-completeness notion in P based on locally-computable Baire categories,
i.e. every P-weakly-complete set is complete for P. We also prove that the
class of complete sets for P under Turing-logspace reductions is meager in P,
if P is not equal to DSPACE(log n), and that the same holds unconditionally for
quasi-poly time.
  Finally we observe that locally-computable Baire categories are incomparable
with all existing resource-bounded measure notions on small complexity classes,
which might explain why those two settings seem to differ so fundamentally.

 <dc:title>Combining typing and size constraints for checking the termination of

 <dc:creator>Blanqui, Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Riba, Colin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a previous work, the first author extended to higher-order rewriting and
dependent types the use of size annotations in types, a termination proof
technique called type or size based termination and initially developed for
ML-like programs. Here, we go one step further by considering conditional
rewriting and explicit quantifications and constraints on size annotations.
This allows to describe more precisely how the size of the output of a function
depends on the size of its inputs. Hence, we can check the termination of more
functions. We first give a general type-checking algorithm based on constraint
solving. Then, we give a termination criterion with constraints in Presburger
arithmetic. To our knowledge, this is the first termination criterion for
higher-order conditional rewriting taking into account the conditions in
termination.

 <dc:title>A simple stability condition for RED using TCP mean-field modeling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reynier, Julien</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Congestion on the Internet is an old problem but still a subject of intensive
research. The TCP protocol with its AIMD (Additive Increase and Multiplicative
Decrease) behavior hides very challenging problems; one of them is to
understand the interaction between a large number of users with delayed
feedback. This article will focus on two modeling issues of TCP which appeared
to be important to tackle concrete scenarios when implementing the model
proposed in [Baccelli McDonald Reynier 02] firstly the modeling of the maximum
TCP window size: this maximum can be reached quickly in many practical cases;
secondly the delay structure: the usual Little-like formula behaves really
poorly when queuing delays are variable, and may change dramatically the
evolution of the predicted queue size, which makes it useless to study
drop-tail or RED (Random Early Detection) mechanisms. Within proposed TCP
modeling improvements, we are enabled to look at a concrete example where RED
should be used in FIFO routers instead of letting the default drop-tail happen.
We study mathematically fixed points of the window size distribution and local
stability of RED. An interesting case is when RED operates at the limit when
the congestion starts, it avoids unwanted loss of bandwidth and delay
variations.

science such as verification, specification, program analysis. They become also
essential for databases with the development of standards such as XML. In this
paper, we define new classes of non deterministic tree automata, namely
residual finite tree automata (RFTA). In the bottom-up case, we obtain a new
characterization of regular tree languages. In the top-down case, we obtain a
subclass of regular tree languages which contains the class of languages
recognized by deterministic top-down tree automata. RFTA also come with the
property of existence of canonical non deterministic tree automata.

 <dc:description>  The pervasiveness of wireless communication recently gave mobile ad hoc
networks (MANET) a significant researchers' attention, due to its innate
capabilities of instant communication in many time and mission critical
applications. However, its natural advantages of networking in civilian and
military environments make them vulnerable to security threats. Support for an
anonymity in MANET is an orthogonal to security critical challenge we faced in
this paper. We propose a new anonymous authentication protocol for mobile ad
hoc networks enhanced with a distributed reputation system. The main its
objective is to provide mechanisms concealing a real identity of communicating
nodes with an ability of resist to known attacks. The distributed reputation
system is incorporated for a trust management and malicious behavior detection
in the network. The end-to-end anonymous authentication is conducted in
three-pass handshake based on an asymmetric and symmetric key cryptography.
After successfully finished authentication phase secure and multiple anonymous
data channels are established. The anonymity is guarantied by randomly chosen
pseudonyms owned by a user. Nodes of the network are publicly identified and
are independent of users' pseudonyms. In this paper we presented an example of
the protocol implementation.

 <dc:title>On some winning strategies for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma or Mr.

 <dc:creator>Slany, Wolfgang</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We submitted two kinds of strategies to the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD)
competitions organized by Graham Kendall, Paul Darwen and Xin Yao in 2004 and
2005. Our strategies performed exceedingly well in both years. One type is an
intelligent and optimistic enhanced version of the well known TitForTat
strategy which we named OmegaTitForTat. It recognizes common behaviour patterns
and detects and recovers from repairable mutual defect deadlock situations,
otherwise behaving much like TitForTat. The second type consists of a set of
strategies working together as a team. These group strategies have one
distinguished individual Godfather strategy that plays OmegaTitForTat against
non-members while heavily profiting from the behaviour of the other members of
his group, the Hitman. The Hitman willingly let themselves being abused by
their Godfather while themselves lowering the scores of all other players as
much as possible, thus further maximizing the performance of their Godfather in
relation to other participants. The study of collusion in the simplified
framework of the iterated prisoner's dilemma allows us to draw parallels to
many common aspects of reality both in Nature as well as Human Society, and
therefore further extends the scope of the iterated prisoner's dilemma as a
metaphor for the study of cooperative behaviour in a new and natural direction.
We further provide evidence that it will be unavoidable that such group
strategies will dominate all future iterated prisoner's dilemma competitions as
they can be stealthy camouflaged as non-group strategies with arbitrary
subtlety. Moreover, we show that the general problem of recognizing stealth
colluding strategies is undecidable in the theoretical sense.

 <dc:title>Bilayer Low-Density Parity-Check Codes for Decode-and-Forward in Relay
  Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes an efficient implementation of binning for the relay
channel using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We devise bilayer LDPC
codes to approach the theoretically promised rate of the decode-and-forward
relaying strategy by incorporating relay-generated information bits in
specially designed bilayer graphical code structures. While conventional LDPC
codes are sensitively tuned to operate efficiently at a certain channel
parameter, the proposed bilayer LDPC codes are capable of working at two
different channel parameters and two different rates: that at the relay and at
the destination. To analyze the performance of bilayer LDPC codes, bilayer
density evolution is devised as an extension of the standard density evolution
algorithm. Based on bilayer density evolution, a design methodology is
developed for the bilayer codes in which the degree distribution is iteratively
improved using linear programming. Further, in order to approach the
theoretical decode-and-forward rate for a wide range of channel parameters,
this paper proposes two different forms bilayer codes, the bilayer-expurgated
and bilayer-lengthened codes. It is demonstrated that a properly designed
bilayer LDPC code can achieve an asymptotic infinite-length threshold within
0.24 dB gap to the Shannon limits of two different channels simultaneously for
a wide range of channel parameters. By practical code construction,
finite-length bilayer codes are shown to be able to approach within a 0.6 dB
gap to the theoretical decode-and-forward rate of the relay channel at a block
length of $10^5$ and a bit-error probability (BER) of $10^{-4}$. Finally, it is
demonstrated that a generalized version of the proposed bilayer code
construction is applicable to relay networks with multiple relays.

 <dc:title>Improving Term Extraction with Terminological Resources</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Aubin, Sophie</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Studies of different term extractors on a corpus of the biomedical domain
revealed decreasing performances when applied to highly technical texts. The
difficulty or impossibility of customising them to new domains is an additional
limitation. In this paper, we propose to use external terminologies to
influence generic linguistic data in order to augment the quality of the
extraction. The tool we implemented exploits testified terms at different steps
of the process: chunking, parsing and extraction of term candidates.
Experiments reported here show that, using this method, more term candidates
can be acquired with a higher level of reliability. We further describe the
extraction process involving endogenous disambiguation implemented in the term
extractor YaTeA.

 <dc:description>  We survey algorithms for computing isogenies between elliptic curves defined
over a field of characteristic either 0 or a large prime. We introduce a new
algorithm that computes an isogeny of degree $\ell$ ($\ell$ different from the
characteristic) in time quasi-linear with respect to $\ell$. This is based in
particular on fast algorithms for power series expansion of the Weierstrass
$\wp$-function and related functions.

 <dc:subject>F.3.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In (hyper)coherence semantics, proofs/terms are cliques in (hyper)graphs.
Intuitively, vertices represent results of computations and the edge relation
witnesses the ability of being assembled into a same piece of data or a same
(strongly) stable function, at arrow types. In (hyper)coherence semantics, the
argument of a (strongly) stable functional is always a (strongly) stable
function. As a consequence, comparatively to the relational semantics, where
there is no edge relation, some vertices are missing. Recovering these vertices
is essential for the purpose of reconstructing proofs/terms from their
interpretations. It shall also be useful for the comparison with other
semantics, like game semantics. In [BE01], Bucciarelli and Ehrhard introduced a
so called non uniform coherence space semantics where no vertex is missing. By
constructing the co-free exponential we set a new version of this last
semantics, together with non uniform versions of hypercoherences and
multicoherences, a new semantics where an edge is a finite multiset. Thanks to
the co-free construction, these non uniform semantics are deterministic in the
sense that the intersection of a clique and of an anti-clique contains at most
one vertex, a result of interaction, and extensionally collapse onto the
corresponding uniform semantics.

 <dc:title>Novel Reversible TSG Gate and Its Application for Designing Components

 <dc:creator>Thapliyal, Himanshu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Srinivas, M. B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, reversible logic has emerged as a promising computing
paradigm having application in low power CMOS, quantum computing,
nanotechnology, and optical computing. The classical set of gates such as AND,
OR, and EXOR are not reversible. This paper utilizes a new 4 * 4 reversible
gate called TSG gate to build the components of a primitive reversible/quantum
ALU. The most significant aspect of the TSG gate is that it can work singly as
a reversible full adder, that is reversible full adder can now be implemented
with a single gate only. A Novel reversible 4:2 compressor is also designed
from the TSG gate which is later used to design a novel 8x8 reversible Wallace
tree multiplier. It is proved that the adder, 4:2 compressor and multiplier
architectures designed using the TSG gate are better than their counterparts
available in literature, in terms of number of reversible gates and garbage
outputs. This is perhaps, the first attempt to design a reversible 4:2
compressor and a reversible Wallace tree multiplier as far as existing
literature and our knowledge is concerned. Thus, this paper provides an initial
threshold to build more complex systems which can execute complicated
operations using reversible logic.

 <dc:title>Rarest First and Choke Algorithms Are Enough</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The performance of peer-to-peer file replication comes from its piece and
peer selection strategies. Two such strategies have been introduced by the
BitTorrent protocol: the rarest first and choke algorithms. Whereas it is
commonly admitted that BitTorrent performs well, recent studies have proposed
the replacement of the rarest first and choke algorithms in order to improve
efficiency and fairness. In this paper, we use results from real experiments to
advocate that the replacement of the rarest first and choke algorithms cannot
be justified in the context of peer-to-peer file replication in the Internet.
We instrumented a BitTorrent client and ran experiments on real torrents with
different characteristics. Our experimental evaluation is peer oriented,
instead of tracker oriented, which allows us to get detailed information on all
exchanged messages and protocol events. We go beyond the mere observation of
the good efficiency of both algorithms. We show that the rarest first algorithm
guarantees close to ideal diversity of the pieces among peers. In particular,
on our experiments, replacing the rarest first algorithm with source or network
coding solutions cannot be justified. We also show that the choke algorithm in
its latest version fosters reciprocation and is robust to free riders. In
particular, the choke algorithm is fair and its replacement with a bit level
tit-for-tat solution is not appropriate. Finally, we identify new areas of
improvements for efficient peer-to-peer file replication protocols.

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of Content Delivery Networks (CDN) reveals that existing
content networks are owned and operated by individual companies. As a
consequence, closed delivery networks are evolved which do not cooperate with
other CDNs and in practice, islands of CDNs are formed. Moreover, the logical
separation between contents and services in this context results in two content
networking domains. But present trends in content networks and content
networking capabilities give rise to the interest in interconnecting content
networks. Finding ways for distinct content networks to coordinate and
cooperate with other content networks is necessary for better overall service.
In addition to that, meeting the QoS requirements of users according to the
negotiated Service Level Agreements between the user and the content network is
a burning issue in this perspective. In this article, we present an open,
scalable and Service-Oriented Architecture based system to assist the creation
of open Content and Service Delivery Networks (CSDN) that scale and support
sharing of resources with other CSDNs.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the hardware implementation of RSA encryption/decryption
algorithm using the algorithms of Ancient Indian Vedic Mathematics that have
been modified to improve performance. The recently proposed hierarchical
overlay multiplier architecture is used in the RSA circuitry for multiplication
operation. The most significant aspect of the paper is the development of a
division architecture based on Straight Division algorithm of Ancient Indian
Vedic Mathematics and embedding it in RSA encryption/decryption circuitry for
improved efficiency. The coding is done in Verilog HDL and the FPGA synthesis
is done using Xilinx Spartan library. The results show that RSA circuitry
implemented using Vedic division and multiplication is efficient in terms of
area/speed compared to its implementation using conventional multiplication and
division architectures

 <dc:title>Space Division Multiple Access with a Sum Feedback Rate Constraint</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  On a multi-antenna broadcast channel, simultaneous transmission to multiple
users by joint beamforming and scheduling is capable of achieving high
throughput, which grows double logarithmically with the number of users. The
sum rate for channel state information (CSI) feedback, however, increases
linearly with the number of users, reducing the effective uplink capacity. To
address this problem, a novel space division multiple access (SDMA) design is
proposed, where the sum feedback rate is upper-bounded by a constant. This
design consists of algorithms for CSI quantization, threshold based CSI
feedback, and joint beamforming and scheduling. The key feature of the proposed
approach is the use of feedback thresholds to select feedback users with large
channel gains and small CSI quantization errors such that the sum feedback rate
constraint is satisfied. Despite this constraint, the proposed SDMA design is
shown to achieve a sum capacity growth rate close to the optimal one. Moreover,
the feedback overflow probability for this design is found to decrease
exponentially with the difference between the allowable and the average sum
feedback rates. Numerical results show that the proposed SDMA design is capable
of attaining higher sum capacities than existing ones, even though the sum
feedback rate is bounded.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the {\it Bipartite Multi-cut} problem. This is a generalization
of the {\it st-Min-cut} problem, is similar to the {\it Multi-cut} problem
(except for more stringent requirements) and also turns out to be an immediate
generalization of the {\it Min UnCut} problem. We prove that this problem is
{\bf NP}-hard and then present LP and SDP based approximation algorithms. While
the LP algorithm is based on the Garg-Vazirani-Yannakakis algorithm for {\it
Multi-cut}, the SDP algorithm uses the {\it Structure Theorem} of $\ell_2^2$

 <dc:description>  We present the \crprecis structure, that is a general-purpose, deterministic
and sub-linear data structure for summarizing \emph{update} data streams. The
\crprecis structure yields the \emph{first deterministic sub-linear space/time
algorithms for update streams} for answering a variety of fundamental stream
queries, such as, (a) point queries, (b) range queries, (c) finding approximate
frequent items, (d) finding approximate quantiles, (e) finding approximate
hierarchical heavy hitters, (f) estimating inner-products, (g) near-optimal
$B$-bucket histograms, etc..

 <dc:description>  Graph drawing research traditionally focuses on producing geometric
embeddings of graphs satisfying various aesthetic constraints. After the
geometric embedding is specified, there is an additional step that is often
overlooked or ignored: assigning display colors to the graph's vertices. We
study the additional aesthetic criterion of assigning distinct colors to
vertices of a geometric graph so that the colors assigned to adjacent vertices
are as different from one another as possible. We formulate this as a problem
involving perceptual metrics in color space and we develop algorithms for
solving this problem by embedding the graph in color space. We also present an
application of this work to a distributed load-balancing visualization problem.

 <dc:description>  Social decision support systems are able to aggregate the local perspectives
of a diverse group of individuals into a global social decision. This paper
presents a multi-relational network ontology and grammar-based particle swarm
algorithm capable of aggregating the decisions of millions of individuals. This
framework supports a diverse problem space and a broad range of vote
aggregation algorithms. These algorithms account for individual expertise and
representation across different domains of the group problem space. Individuals
are able to pose and categorize problems, generate potential solutions, choose
trusted representatives, and vote for particular solutions. Ultimately, via a
social decision making algorithm, the system aggregates all the individual
votes into a single collective decision.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problems of secret sharing and multiparty computation,
assuming that agents prefer to get the secret (resp., function value) to not
getting it, and secondarily, prefer that as few as possible of the other agents
get it. We show that, under these assumptions, neither secret sharing nor
multiparty function computation is possible using a mechanism that has a fixed
running time. However, we show that both are possible using randomized
mechanisms with constant expected running time.

 <dc:description>  IEEE 754r is the ongoing revision to the IEEE 754 floating point standard and
a major enhancement to the standard is the addition of decimal format. Firstly,
this paper proposes novel two transistor AND and OR gates. The proposed AND
gate has no power supply, thus it can be referred as the Powerless AND gate.
Similarly, the proposed two transistor OR gate has no ground and can be
referred as Groundless OR. Secondly for IEEE 754r format, two novel BCD adders
called carry skip and carry look-ahead BCD adders are also proposed in this
paper. In order to design the carry look-ahead BCD adder, a novel 4 bit carry
look-ahead adder called NCLA is proposed which forms the basic building block
of the proposed carry look-ahead BCD adder. Finally, the proposed two
transistors AND and OR gates are used to provide the optimized small area low
power high throughput circuitries of the proposed BCD adders.

 <dc:description>  The notion of computability closure has been introduced for proving the
termination of the combination of higher-order rewriting and beta-reduction. It
is also used for strengthening the higher-order recursive path ordering. In the
present paper, we study in more details the relations between the computability
closure and the (higher-order) recursive path ordering. We show that the
first-order recursive path ordering is equal to an ordering naturally defined
from the computability closure. In the higher-order case, we get an ordering
containing the higher-order recursive path ordering whose well-foundedness
relies on the correctness of the computability closure. This provides a simple
way to extend the higher-order recursive path ordering to richer type systems.

 <dc:title>On Performance of Event-to-Sink Transport in Transmit-Only Sensor

 <dc:description>  We consider a hybrid wireless sensor network with regular and transmit-only
sensors. The transmit-only sensors do not have receiver circuit, hence are
cheaper and less energy consuming, but their transmissions cannot be
coordinated. Regular sensors, also called cluster-heads, are responsible for
receiving information from transmit-only sensors and forwarding it to sinks.
The main goal of such a hybrid network is to reduce the cost of deployment
while achieving some performance constraints (minimum coverage, sensing rate,
etc). In this paper we are interested in the communication between
transmit-only sensors and cluster-heads. We develop a detailed analytical model
of the physical and MAC layer using tools from queuing theory and stochastic
geometry. (The MAC model, that we call Erlang's loss model with interference,
might be of independent interest as adequate for any non-slotted; i.e.,
unsynchronized, wireless communication channel.) We give an explicit formula
for the frequency of successful packet reception by a cluster-head, given
sensors' locations. We further define packet admission policies at a
cluster-head, and we calculate the optimal policies for different performance
criteria. Finally we show that the proposed hybrid network, using the optimal
policies, can achieve substantial cost savings as compared to conventional
architectures.

 <dc:description>  Termination is a major question in both logic and computer science. In logic,
termination is at the heart of proof theory where it is usually called strong
normalization (of cut elimination). In computer science, termination has always
been an important issue for showing programs correct. In the early days of
logic, strong normalization was usually shown by assigning ordinals to
expressions in such a way that eliminating a cut would yield an expression with
a smaller ordinal. In the early days of verification, computer scientists used
similar ideas, interpreting the arguments of a program call by a natural
number, such as their size. Showing the size of the arguments to decrease for
each recursive call gives a termination proof of the program, which is however
rather weak since it can only yield quite small ordinals. In the sixties, Tait
invented a new method for showing cut elimination of natural deduction, based
on a predicate over the set of terms, such that the membership of an expression
to the predicate implied the strong normalization property for that expression.
The predicate being defined by induction on types, or even as a fixpoint, this
method could yield much larger ordinals. Later generalized by Girard under the
name of reducibility or computability candidates, it showed very effective in
proving the strong normalization property of typed lambda-calculi...

 <dc:description>  Denotational semantics can be based on algebras with additional structure
(order, metric, etc.) which makes it possible to interpret recursive
specifications. It was the idea of Elgot to base denotational semantics on
iterative theories instead, i.e., theories in which abstract recursive
specifications are required to have unique solutions. Later Bloom and Esik
studied iteration theories and iteration algebras in which a specified solution
has to obey certain axioms. We propose so-called Elgot algebras as a convenient
structure for semantics in the present paper. An Elgot algebra is an algebra
with a specified solution for every system of flat recursive equations. That
specification satisfies two simple and well motivated axioms: functoriality
(stating that solutions are stable under renaming of recursion variables) and
compositionality (stating how to perform simultaneous recursion). These two
axioms stem canonically from Elgot's iterative theories: We prove that the
category of Elgot algebras is the Eilenberg-Moore category of the monad given
by a free iterative theory.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the construction and transformation of
two-dimensional persistent graphs. Persistence is a generalization to directed
graphs of the undirected notion of rigidity. In the context of moving
autonomous agent formations, persistence characterizes the efficacy of a
directed structure of unilateral distances constraints seeking to preserve a
formation shape. Analogously to the powerful results about Henneberg sequences
in minimal rigidity theory, we propose different types of directed graph
operations allowing one to sequentially build any minimally persistent graph
(i.e. persistent graph with a minimal number of edges for a given number of
vertices), each intermediate graph being also minimally persistent. We also
consider the more generic problem of obtaining one minimally persistent graph
from another, which corresponds to the on-line reorganization of an autonomous
agent formation. We prove that we can obtain any minimally persistent formation
from any other one by a sequence of elementary local operations such that
minimal persistence is preserved throughout the reorganization process.

of independent processes, the individual divergence rate of each process, and
their power spectral densities. All divergences are between a process and a
Gaussian process with same second order statistics, and are assumed to be
finite. A new proof of the Shannon entropy-power inequality EPI, based on the

Gaussian channels with large signal-to-noise ratio, is also shown.

 <dc:description>  The paper concerns the understanding of plurals in the framework of
Artificial Intelligence and emphasizes the role of time. The construction of
collection(s) and their evolution across time is often crucial and has to be
accounted for. The paper contrasts a &quot;de dicto&quot; collection where the collection
can be considered as persisting over these situations even if its members
change with a &quot;de re&quot; collection whose composition does not vary through time.
It expresses different criteria of choice between the two interpretations (de
re and de dicto) depending on the context of enunciation.

 <dc:title>Metric entropy in competitive on-line prediction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vovk, Vladimir</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Competitive on-line prediction (also known as universal prediction of
individual sequences) is a strand of learning theory avoiding making any
stochastic assumptions about the way the observations are generated. The
predictor's goal is to compete with a benchmark class of prediction rules,
which is often a proper Banach function space. Metric entropy provides a
unifying framework for competitive on-line prediction: the numerous known upper
bounds on the metric entropy of various compact sets in function spaces readily
imply bounds on the performance of on-line prediction strategies. This paper
discusses strengths and limitations of the direct approach to competitive
on-line prediction via metric entropy, including comparisons to other
approaches.

 <dc:description>  It is proved in this work that exhaustively determining bad patterns in
arbitrary, finite low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, including stopping
sets for binary erasure channels (BECs) and trapping sets (also known as
near-codewords) for general memoryless symmetric channels, is an NP-complete
problem, and efficient algorithms are provided for codes of practical short
lengths n~=500. By exploiting the sparse connectivity of LDPC codes, the
stopping sets of size &lt;=13 and the trapping sets of size &lt;=11 can be
efficiently exhaustively determined for the first time, and the resulting
exhaustive list is of great importance for code analysis and finite code
optimization. The featured tree-based narrowing search distinguishes this
algorithm from existing ones for which inexhaustive methods are employed. One
important byproduct is a pair of upper bounds on the bit-error rate (BER) &amp;
frame-error rate (FER) iterative decoding performance of arbitrary codes over
BECs that can be evaluated for any value of the erasure probability, including
both the waterfall and the error floor regions. The tightness of these upper
bounds and the exhaustion capability of the proposed algorithm are proved when
combining an optimal leaf-finding module with the tree-based search. These
upper bounds also provide a worst-case-performance guarantee which is crucial
to optimizing LDPC codes for extremely low error rate applications, e.g.,
optical/satellite communications. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted
that include both randomly and algebraically constructed LDPC codes, the
results of which demonstrate the superior efficiency of the exhaustion
algorithm and its significant value for finite length code optimization.

 <dc:description>  Coverage and connectivity issues of three-dimensional (3D) networks are
addressed in [2], but that work assumes that a node can be placed at any
arbitrary location. In this work, we drop that assumption and rather assume
that nodes are uniformly and densely deployed in a 3D space. We want to devise
a mechanism that keeps some nodes active and puts other nodes into sleep so
that the number of active nodes at a time is minimized (and thus network life
time is maximized), while maintaining full coverage and connectivity. One
simple way to do that is to partition the 3D space into cells, and only one
node in each cell remains active at a time. Our results show that the number of
active nodes can be minimized if the shape of each cell is a truncated
octahedron. It requires the sensing range to be at least 0.542326 times the
transmission radius. This value is 0.5, 0.53452 and 0.5 for cube, hexagonal
prism, and rhombic dodecahedron, respectively. However, at a time the number of
active nodes for cube, hexagonal prism and rhombic dodecahedron model is
respectively 2.372239, 1.82615 and 1.49468 times of that of truncated
octahedron model. So clearly truncated octahedron model has the highest network
lifetime. We also provide a distributed topology control algorithm that can be
used by each sensor node to determine its cell id using a constant number of
local arithmetic operations provided that the sensor node knows its location.
We also validate our results by simulation.

 <dc:title>On the logical definability of certain graph and poset languages</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weil, Pascal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show that it is equivalent, for certain sets of finite graphs, to be
definable in CMS (counting monadic second-order logic, a natural extension of
monadic second-order logic), and to be recognizable in an algebraic framework
induced by the notion of modular decomposition of a finite graph. More
precisely, we consider the set $F\_\infty$ of composition operations on graphs
which occur in the modular decomposition of finite graphs. If $F$ is a subset
of $F\_{\infty}$, we say that a graph is an $\calF$-graph if it can be
decomposed using only operations in $F$. A set of $F$-graphs is recognizable if
it is a union of classes in a finite-index equivalence relation which is
preserved by the operations in $F$. We show that if $F$ is finite and its
elements enjoy only a limited amount of commutativity -- a property which we
call weak rigidity, then recognizability is equivalent to CMS-definability.
This requirement is weak enough to be satisfied whenever all $F$-graphs are
posets, that is, transitive dags. In particular, our result generalizes Kuske's
recent result on series-parallel poset languages.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of scanning and prediction (&quot;scandiction&quot;, for
short) of multidimensional data arrays. This problem arises in several aspects
of image and video processing, such as predictive coding, for example, where an
image is compressed by coding the error sequence resulting from scandicting it.
Thus, it is natural to ask what is the optimal method to scan and predict a
given image, what is the resulting minimum prediction loss, and whether there
exist specific scandiction schemes which are universal in some sense.
  Specifically, we investigate the following problems: First, modeling the data
array as a random field, we wish to examine whether there exists a scandiction
scheme which is independent of the field's distribution, yet asymptotically
achieves the same performance as if this distribution was known. This question
is answered in the affirmative for the set of all spatially stationary random
fields and under mild conditions on the loss function. We then discuss the
scenario where a non-optimal scanning order is used, yet accompanied by an
optimal predictor, and derive bounds on the excess loss compared to optimal
scanning and prediction.
  This paper is the first part of a two-part paper on sequential decision
making for multi-dimensional data. It deals with clean, noiseless data arrays.
The second part deals with noisy data arrays, namely, with the case where the
decision maker observes only a noisy version of the data, yet it is judged with
respect to the original, clean data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the problem of closed-form spectral evaluation of
CPM. We show that the multi-h CPM signal can be conveniently generated by a PTI
SM. The output is governed by a Markov chain with the unusual peculiarity of
being cyclostationary and reducible; this holds also in the single-h context.
Judicious reinterpretation of the result leads to a formalization through a
stationary and irreducible Markov chain, whose spectral evaluation is known in
closed-form from the literature. Two are the major outcomes of this paper.
First, unlike the literature, we obtain a PSD in true closed-form. Second, we
give novel insights into the CPM format.

 <dc:description>  We present an exploratory tool that extracts person names from multilingual
news collections, matches name variants referring to the same person, and
infers relationships between people based on the co-occurrence of their names
in related news. A novel feature is the matching of name variants across
languages and writing systems, including names written with the Greek, Cyrillic
and Arabic writing system. Due to our highly multilingual setting, we use an
internal standard representation for name representation and matching, instead
of adopting the traditional bilingual approach to transliteration. This work is
part of the news analysis system NewsExplorer that clusters an average of
25,000 news articles per day to detect related news within the same and across
different languages.

 <dc:title>Undecidability of the unification and admissibility problems for modal

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We show that the unification problem `is there a substitution instance of a
given formula that is provable in a given logic?' is undecidable for basic
modal logics K and K4 extended with the universal modality. It follows that the
admissibility problem for inference rules is undecidable for these logics as
well. These are the first examples of standard decidable modal logics for which
the unification and admissibility problems are undecidable. We also prove
undecidability of the unification and admissibility problems for K and K4 with
at least two modal operators and nominals (instead of the universal modality),
thereby showing that these problems are undecidable for basic hybrid logics.
Recently, unification has been introduced as an important reasoning service for
description logics. The undecidability proof for K with nominals can be used to
show the undecidability of unification for boolean description logics with
nominals (such as ALCO and SHIQO). The undecidability proof for K with the
universal modality can be used to show that the unification problem relative to
role boxes is undecidable for Boolean description logic with transitive roles,
inverse roles, and role hierarchies (such as SHI and SHIQ).

 <dc:description>  High data-rate Distributed Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (DOSTBCs) which
achieve the single-symbol decodability and full diversity order are proposed in
this paper. An upper bound of the data-rate of the DOSTBC is derived and it is
approximately twice larger than that of the conventional repetition-based
cooperative strategy. In order to facilitate the systematic constructions of
the DOSTBCs achieving the upper bound of the data-rate, some special DOSTBCs,
which have diagonal noise covariance matrices at the destination terminal, are
investigated. These codes are referred to as the row-monomial DOSTBCs. An upper
bound of the data-rate of the row-monomial DOSTBC is derived and it is equal to
or slightly smaller than that of the DOSTBC. Lastly, the systematic
construction methods of the row-monomial DOSTBCs achieving the upper bound of
the data-rate are presented.

 <dc:title>Coding for Additive White Noise Channels with Feedback Corrupted by
  Uniform Quantization or Bounded Noise</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Martins, Nuno C</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Weissman, Tsachy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present simple coding strategies, which are variants of the
Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme, for communicating reliably over additive white noise
channels in the presence of corrupted feedback. More specifically, we consider
a framework comprising an additive white forward channel and a backward link
which is used for feedback. We consider two types of corruption mechanisms in
the backward link. The first is quantization noise, i.e., the encoder receives
the quantized values of the past outputs of the forward channel. The
quantization is uniform, memoryless and time invariant (that is,
symbol-by-symbol scalar quantization), with bounded quantization error. The
second corruption mechanism is an arbitrarily distributed additive bounded
noise in the backward link. Here we allow symbol-by-symbol encoding at the
input to the backward channel. We propose simple explicit schemes that
guarantee positive information rate, in bits per channel use, with positive
error exponent. If the forward channel is additive white Gaussian then our
schemes achieve capacity, in the limit of diminishing amplitude of the noise
components at the backward link, while guaranteeing that the probability of
error converges to zero as a doubly exponential function of the block length.
Furthermore, if the forward channel is additive white Gaussian and the backward
link consists of an additive bounded noise channel, with signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) constrained symbol-by-symbol encoding, then our schemes are also
capacity-achieving in the limit of high SNR.

 <dc:description>  We consider a type of zero-knowledge protocols that are of interest for their
practical applications within networks like the Internet: efficient
zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge that remain secure against concurrent
man-in-the-middle attacks. In an effort to reduce the setup assumptions
required for efficient zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge that remain secure
against concurrent man-in-the-middle attacks, we consider a model, which we
call the Authenticated Public-Key (APK) model. The APK model seems to
significantly reduce the setup assumptions made by the CRS model (as no trusted
party or honest execution of a centralized algorithm are required), and can be
seen as a slightly stronger variation of the Bare Public-Key (BPK) model from
\cite{CGGM,MR}, and a weaker variation of the registered public-key model used
in \cite{BCNP}. We then define and study man-in-the-middle attacks in the APK
model. Our main result is a constant-round concurrent non-malleable
zero-knowledge argument of knowledge for any polynomial-time relation
(associated to a language in $\mathcal{NP}$), under the (minimal) assumption of
the existence of a one-way function family. Furthermore,We show time-efficient
instantiations of our protocol based on known number-theoretic assumptions. We
also note a negative result with respect to further reducing the setup
assumptions of our protocol to those in the (unauthenticated) BPK model, by
showing that concurrently non-malleable zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge
in the BPK model are only possible for trivial languages.

 <dc:description>  We present a new, unique and freely available parallel corpus containing
European Union (EU) documents of mostly legal nature. It is available in all 20
official EUanguages, with additional documents being available in the languages
of the EU candidate countries. The corpus consists of almost 8,000 documents
per language, with an average size of nearly 9 million words per language.
Pair-wise paragraph alignment information produced by two different aligners
(Vanilla and HunAlign) is available for all 190+ language pair combinations.
Most texts have been manually classified according to the EUROVOC subject
domains so that the collection can also be used to train and test multi-label
classification algorithms and keyword-assignment software. The corpus is
encoded in XML, according to the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines. Due to
the large number of parallel texts in many languages, the JRC-Acquis is
particularly suitable to carry out all types of cross-language research, as
well as to test and benchmark text analysis software across different languages
(for instance for alignment, sentence splitting and term extraction).

 <dc:description>  Automatic annotation of documents with controlled vocabulary terms
(descriptors) from a conceptual thesaurus is not only useful for document
indexing and retrieval. The mapping of texts onto the same thesaurus
furthermore allows to establish links between similar documents. This is also a
substantial requirement of the Semantic Web. This paper presents an almost
language-independent system that maps documents written in different languages
onto the same multilingual conceptual thesaurus, EUROVOC. Conceptual thesauri
differ from Natural Language Thesauri in that they consist of relatively small
controlled lists of words or phrases with a rather abstract meaning. To
automatically identify which thesaurus descriptors describe the contents of a
document best, we developed a statistical, associative system that is trained
on texts that have previously been indexed manually. In addition to describing
the large number of empirically optimised parameters of the fully functional
application, we present the performance of the software according to a human
evaluation by professional indexers.

 <dc:description>  Texts and their translations are a rich linguistic resource that can be used
to train and test statistics-based Machine Translation systems and many other
applications. In this paper, we present a working system that can identify
translations and other very similar documents among a large number of
candidates, by representing the document contents with a vector of thesaurus
terms from a multilingual thesaurus, and by then measuring the semantic
similarity between the vectors. Tests on different text types have shown that
the system can detect translations with over 96% precision in a large search
space of 820 documents or more. The system was tuned to ignore
language-specific similarities and to give similar documents in a second
language the same similarity score as equivalent documents in the same
language. The application can also be used to detect cross-lingual document
plagiarism.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a language-independent approach to controlled vocabulary
keyword assignment using the EUROVOC thesaurus. Due to the multilingual nature
of EUROVOC, the keywords for a document written in one language can be
displayed in all eleven official European Union languages. The mapping of
documents written in different languages to the same multilingual thesaurus
furthermore allows cross-language document comparison. The assignment of the
controlled vocabulary thesaurus descriptors is achieved by applying a
statistical method that uses a collection of manually indexed documents to
identify, for each thesaurus descriptor, a large number of lemmas that are
statistically associated to the descriptor. These associated words are then
used during the assignment procedure to identify a ranked list of those EUROVOC
terms that are most likely to be good keywords for a given document. The paper
also describes the challenges of this task and discusses the achieved results
of the fully functional prototype.

 <dc:description>  Nominal logic is an extension of first-order logic which provides a simple
foundation for formalizing and reasoning about abstract syntax modulo
consistent renaming of bound names (that is, alpha-equivalence). This article
investigates logic programming based on nominal logic. We describe some typical
nominal logic programs, and develop the model-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and
operational semantics of such programs. Besides being of interest for ensuring
the correct behavior of implementations, these results provide a rigorous
foundation for techniques for analysis and reasoning about nominal logic
programs, as we illustrate via examples.

 <dc:description>  In a highly multilingual and multicultural environment such as in the
European Commission with soon over twenty official languages, there is an
urgent need for text analysis tools that use minimal linguistic knowledge so
that they can be adapted to many languages without much human effort. We are
presenting two such Information Extraction tools that have already been adapted
to various Western and Eastern European languages: one for the recognition of
date expressions in text, and one for the detection of geographical place names
and the visualisation of the results in geographical maps. An evaluation of the
performance has produced very satisfying results.

 <dc:description>  We are proposing a simple, but efficient basic approach for a number of
multilingual and cross-lingual language technology applications that are not
limited to the usual two or three languages, but that can be applied with
relatively little effort to larger sets of languages. The approach consists of
using existing multilingual linguistic resources such as thesauri,
nomenclatures and gazetteers, as well as exploiting the existence of additional
more or less language-independent text items such as dates, currency
expressions, numbers, names and cognates. Mapping texts onto the multilingual
resources and identifying word token links between texts in different languages
are basic ingredients for applications such as cross-lingual document
similarity calculation, multilingual clustering and categorisation,
cross-lingual document retrieval, and tools to provide cross-lingual
information access.

 <dc:description>  We are presenting a method to recognise geographical references in free text.
Our tool must work on various languages with a minimum of language-dependent
resources, except a gazetteer. The main difficulty is to disambiguate these
place names by distinguishing places from persons and by selecting the most
likely place out of a list of homographic place names world-wide. The system
uses a number of language-independent clues and heuristics to disambiguate
place name homographs. The final aim is to index texts with the countries and
cities they mention and to automatically visualise this information on
geographical maps using various tools.

an in-house Named Entity Recognition tool, applied on clusters of an average of

 <dc:description>  We are presenting a set of multilingual text analysis tools that can help
analysts in any field to explore large document collections quickly in order to
determine whether the documents contain information of interest, and to find
the relevant text passages. The automatic tool, which currently exists as a
fully functional prototype, is expected to be particularly useful when users
repeatedly have to sieve through large collections of documents such as those
downloaded automatically from the internet. The proposed system takes a whole
document collection as input. It first carries out some automatic analysis
tasks (named entity recognition, geo-coding, clustering, term extraction),
annotates the texts with the generated meta-information and stores the
meta-information in a database. The system then generates a zoomable and
hyperlinked geographic map enhanced with information on entities and terms
found. When the system is used on a regular basis, it builds up a historical
database that contains information on which names have been mentioned together
with which other names or places, and users can query this database to retrieve
information extracted in the past.

 <dc:title>The heterogeneity of inter-contact time distributions: its importance

 <dc:description>  Prior work on routing in delay tolerant networks (DTNs) has commonly made the
assumption that each pair of nodes shares the same inter-contact time
distribution as every other pair. The main argument in this paper is that
researchers should also be looking at heterogeneous inter-contact time
distributions. We demonstrate the presence of such heterogeneity in the
often-used Dartmouth Wi-Fi data set. We also show that DTN routing can benefit
from knowing these distributions. We first introduce a new stochastic model
focusing on the inter-contact time distributions between all pairs of nodes,
which we validate on real connectivity patterns. We then analytically derive
the mean delivery time for a bundle of information traversing the network for
simple single copy routing schemes. The purpose is to examine the theoretic
impact of heterogeneous inter-contact time distributions. Finally, we show that
we can exploit this user diversity to improve routing performance.

 <dc:description>  Most wireless terrestrial networks are designed based on the assumption that
the nodes are deployed on a two-dimensional (2D) plane. However, this 2D
assumption is not valid in underwater, atmospheric, or space communications. In
fact, recent interest in underwater acoustic ad hoc and sensor networks hints
at the need to understand how to design networks in 3D. Unfortunately, the
design of 3D networks is surprisingly more difficult than the design of 2D
networks. For example, proofs of Kelvin's conjecture and Kepler's conjecture
required centuries of research to achieve breakthroughs, whereas their 2D
counterparts are trivial to solve. In this paper, we consider the coverage and
connectivity issues of 3D networks, where the goal is to find a node placement
strategy with 100% sensing coverage of a 3D space, while minimizing the number
of nodes required for surveillance. Our results indicate that the use of the
Voronoi tessellation of 3D space to create truncated octahedral cells results
in the best strategy. In this truncated octahedron placement strategy, the
transmission range must be at least 1.7889 times the sensing range in order to
maintain connectivity among nodes. If the transmission range is between 1.4142
and 1.7889 times the sensing range, then a hexagonal prism placement strategy
or a rhombic dodecahedron placement strategy should be used. Although the
required number of nodes in the hexagonal prism and the rhombic dodecahedron
placement strategies is the same, this number is 43.25% higher than the number
of nodes required by the truncated octahedron placement strategy. We verify by
simulation that our placement strategies indeed guarantee ubiquitous coverage.
We believe that our approach and our results presented in this paper could be
used for extending the processes of 2D network design to 3D networks.

 <dc:description>  Leveraging the prevailing interest in computer games among college students,
both for entertainment and as a possible career path, is a major reason for the
increasing prevalence of computer game design courses in computer science
curricula. Because implementing a computer game requires strong programming
skills, game design courses are most often restricted to more advanced computer
science students. This paper reports on a ready-made game design and
experimentation framework, implemented in Java, that makes game programming
more widely accessible. This framework, called Labyrinth, enables students at
all programming skill levels to participate in computer game design. We
describe the architecture of the framework, and discuss programming projects
suitable for a wide variety of computer science courses, from capstone to
non-major.

 <dc:description>  Canonical correlation analysis is a technique to extract common features from
a pair of multivariate data. In complex situations, however, it does not
extract useful features because of its linearity. On the other hand, kernel
method used in support vector machine is an efficient approach to improve such
a linear method. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of applying
kernel method to canonical correlation analysis.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Boolean satisfiability problems are an important benchmark for questions
about complexity, algorithms, heuristics and threshold phenomena. Recent work
on heuristics, and the satisfiability threshold has centered around the
structure and connectivity of the solution space. Motivated by this work, we
study structural and connectivity-related properties of the space of solutions
of Boolean satisfiability problems and establish various dichotomies in
Schaefer's framework.
  On the structural side, we obtain dichotomies for the kinds of subgraphs of
the hypercube that can be induced by the solutions of Boolean formulas, as well
as for the diameter of the connected components of the solution space. On the
computational side, we establish dichotomy theorems for the complexity of the
connectivity and st-connectivity questions for the graph of solutions of
Boolean formulas. Our results assert that the intractable side of the
computational dichotomies is PSPACE-complete, while the tractable side - which
includes but is not limited to all problems with polynomial time algorithms for
satisfiability - is in P for the st-connectivity question, and in coNP for the
connectivity question. The diameter of components can be exponential for the
PSPACE-complete cases, whereas in all other cases it is linear; thus, small
diameter and tractability of the connectivity problems are remarkably aligned.
The crux of our results is an expressibility theorem showing that in the
tractable cases, the subgraphs induced by the solution space possess certain
good structural properties, whereas in the intractable cases, the subgraphs can
be arbitrary.

 <dc:description>  A ubiquitous computing environment consists of many resources that need to be
identified by users and applications. Users and developers require some way to
identify resources by human readable names. In addition, ubiquitous computing
environments impose additional requirements such as the ability to work well
with ad hoc situations and the provision of names that depend on context.
  The Non-anchored Unified Naming (NUN) system was designed to satisfy these
requirements. It is based on relative naming among resources and provides the
ability to name arbitrary types of resources. By having resources themselves
take part in naming, resources are able to able contribute their specialized
knowledge into the name resolution process, making context-dependent mapping of
names to resources possible. The ease of which new resource types can be added
makes it simple to incorporate new types of contextual information within
names.
  In this paper, we describe the naming system and evaluate its use.

 <dc:title>Asymptotic Spectral Distribution of Crosscorrelation Matrix in
  Asynchronous CDMA</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hwang, Chien-Hwa</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Asymptotic spectral distribution (ASD) of the crosscorrelation matrix is
investigated for a random spreading short/long-code asynchronous direct
sequence-code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. The discrete-time
decision statistics are obtained as the output samples of a bank of symbol
matched filters of all users. The crosscorrelation matrix is studied when the
number of symbols transmitted by each user tends to infinity. Two levels of
asynchronism are considered. One is symbol-asynchronous but chip-synchronous,
and the other is chip-asynchronous. The existence of a nonrandom ASD is proved
by moment convergence theorem, where the focus is on the derivation of
asymptotic eigenvalue moments (AEM) of the crosscorrelation matrix. A
combinatorics approach based on noncrossing partition of set partition theory
is adopted for AEM computation. The spectral efficiency and the minimum
mean-square-error (MMSE) achievable by a linear receiver of asynchronous CDMA
are plotted by AEM using a numerical method.

 <dc:title>On Intentional Attacks and Protections in Complex Communication Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Being motivated by recent developments in the theory of complex networks, we
examine the robustness of communication networks under intentional attack that
takes down network nodes in a decreasing order of their nodal degrees. In this
paper, we study two different effects that have been largely missed in the
existing results: (i) some communication networks, like Internet, are too large
for anyone to have global information of their topologies, which makes the
accurate intentional attack practically impossible; and (ii) most attacks in
communication networks are propagated from one node to its neighborhood
node(s), utilizing local network-topology information only. We show that
incomplete global information has different impacts to the intentional attack
in different circumstances, while local information-based attacks can be
actually highly efficient. Such insights would be helpful for the future
developments of efficient network attack/protection schemes.

 <dc:title>A Continuum Theory for Unstructured Mesh Generation in Two Dimensions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bunin, Guy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A continuum description of unstructured meshes in two dimensions, both for
planar and curved surface domains, is proposed. The meshes described are those
which, in the limit of an increasingly finer mesh (smaller cells), and away
from irregular vertices, have ideally-shaped cells (squares or equilateral
triangles), and can therefore be completely described by two local properties:
local cell size and local edge directions. The connection between the two
properties is derived by defining a Riemannian manifold whose geodesics trace
the edges of the mesh. A function $\phi$, proportional to the logarithm of the
cell size, is shown to obey the Poisson equation, with localized charges
corresponding to irregular vertices. The problem of finding a suitable manifold
for a given domain is thus shown to exactly reduce to an Inverse Poisson
problem on $\phi$, of finding a distribution of localized charges adhering to
the conditions derived for boundary alignment. Possible applications to mesh
generation are discussed.

 <dc:description>  We construct fast algorithms for evaluating transforms associated with
families of functions which satisfy recurrence relations. These include
algorithms both for computing the coefficients in linear combinations of the
functions, given the values of these linear combinations at certain points,
and, vice versa, for evaluating such linear combinations at those points, given
the coefficients in the linear combinations; such procedures are also known as
analysis and synthesis of series of certain special functions. The algorithms
of the present paper are efficient in the sense that their computational costs
are proportional to n (ln n) (ln(1/epsilon))^3, where n is the amount of input
and output data, and epsilon is the precision of computations. Stated somewhat
more precisely, we find a positive real number C such that, for any positive
integer n &gt; 10, the algorithms require at most C n (ln n) (ln(1/epsilon))^3
floating-point operations and words of memory to evaluate at n appropriately
chosen points any linear combination of n special functions, given the
coefficients in the linear combination, where epsilon is the precision of
computations.

 <dc:description>  The paper describes a new image processing for a non-photorealistic
rendering. The algorithm is based on a random generation of gray tones and
competing statistical requirements. The gray tone value of each pixel in the
starting image is replaced selecting among randomly generated tone values,
according to the statistics of nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor
pixels. Two competing conditions for replacing the tone values - one position
on the local mean value the other on the local variance - produce a peculiar
pattern on the image. This pattern has a labyrinthine tiling aspect. For
certain subjects, the pattern enhances the look of the image.

 <dc:title>About the Capacity of Flat and Self-Organized Ad Hoc and Hybrid Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Ad hoc networking specific challenges foster a strong research effort on
efficient protocols design. Routing protocols based on a self-organized
structure have been studied principally for the robustness and the scalability
they provide. On the other hand, self-organization schemes may decrease the
network capacity since they concentrate the traffic on privileged links. This
paper presents four models for evaluating the capacity of a routing schemes on
802.11 like networks. Our approach consists in modeling the radio resource
sharing principles of 802.11 like MAC protocols as a set of linear constraints.
We have implemented two models of fairness. The first one assumes that nodes
have a fair access to the channel, while the second one assumes that on the
radio links. We then develop a pessimistic and an optimistic scenarii of
spatial re-utilization of the medium, yielding a lower bound and an upper bound
on the network capacity for each fairness case. Our models are independent of
the routing protocols and provide therefore a relevant framework for their
comparison. We apply our models to a comparative analysis of the well-known
shortest path base flat routing protocol OLSR against two main self-organized
structure approaches, VSR, and Wu &amp; Li's protocols. This study concludes on the
relevance of self-organized approaches from the network capacity point of view.

of gear generation. A model of tooth flanks is an envelope curve of a family of
envelopes that originate from the rolling motion of a solid tool model in
relation to a solid model of the cylindrical gear. The surface stereometry and
topography of the tooth flanks, hobbed and chiselled by Fellows method, are
compared to their numerical models. Metrological measurements of the real gears
were carried out using a coordinated measuring machine and a two - and a
three-dimensional profilometer. A computer simulation of the gear generation
was performed in the Mechanical Desktop environment.

 <dc:title>Deriving the Normalized Min-Sum Algorithm from Cooperative Optimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Xiaofei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The normalized min-sum algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance at
decoding LDPC codes. However, it is a critical question to understand the
mathematical principle underlying the algorithm. Traditionally, people thought
that the normalized min-sum algorithm is a good approximation to the
sum-product algorithm, the best known algorithm for decoding LDPC codes and
Turbo codes. This paper offers an alternative approach to understand the
normalized min-sum algorithm. The algorithm is derived directly from
cooperative optimization, a newly discovered general method for
global/combinatorial optimization. This approach provides us another
theoretical basis for the algorithm and offers new insights on its power and
limitation. It also gives us a general framework for designing new decoding
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a fast min-sum algorithm for decoding LDPC codes
over GF(q). Our algorithm is different from the one presented by David Declercq
and Marc Fossorier in ISIT 05 only at the way of speeding up the horizontal
scan in the min-sum algorithm. The Declercq and Fossorier's algorithm speeds up
the computation by reducing the number of configurations, while our algorithm
uses the dynamic programming instead. Compared with the configuration reduction
algorithm, the dynamic programming one is simpler at the design stage because
it has less parameters to tune. Furthermore, it does not have the performance
degradation problem caused by the configuration reduction because it searches
the whole configuration space efficiently through dynamic programming. Both
algorithms have the same level of complexity and use simple operations which
are suitable for hardware implementations.

 <dc:title>Single-Scan Min-Sum Algorithms for Fast Decoding of LDPC Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Xiaofei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many implementations for decoding LDPC codes are based on the
(normalized/offset) min-sum algorithm due to its satisfactory performance and
simplicity in operations. Usually, each iteration of the min-sum algorithm
contains two scans, the horizontal scan and the vertical scan. This paper
presents a single-scan version of the min-sum algorithm to speed up the
decoding process. It can also reduce memory usage or wiring because it only
needs the addressing from check nodes to variable nodes while the original
min-sum algorithm requires that addressing plus the addressing from variable
nodes to check nodes. To cut down memory usage or wiring further, another
version of the single-scan min-sum algorithm is presented where the messages of
the algorithm are represented by single bit values instead of using fixed point
ones. The software implementation has shown that the single-scan min-sum
algorithm is more than twice as fast as the original min-sum algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Conjugacy is not the only possible primitive for designing braid-based
protocols. To illustrate this principle, we describe a Fiat--Shamir-style
authentication protocol that be can be implemented using any binary operation
that satisfies the left self-distributive law. Conjugation is an example of
such an operation, but there are other examples, in particular the shifted
conjugation on Artin's braid group B\_oo, and the finite Laver tables. In both
cases, the underlying structures have a high combinatorial complexity, and they
lead to difficult problems.

relationships for imperative programs. We describe its semantic domains,
general purpose operations over abstract computational states (term evaluation
and identification, semantic completion, widening operator, etc.) and semantic
transformers corresponding to program constructs. We summarize our experiences
from the last few years concerning this analysis and give attention to
applications of analysis of automatically generated code. Among other
illustrating examples, we consider a program for which the analysis diverges
without a widening operator and results of analyzing residual programs produced
by some automatic partial evaluator. An example of analysis of a program
generated by this evaluator is given.

 <dc:title>PAC Learning Mixtures of Axis-Aligned Gaussians with No Separation

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose and analyze a new vantage point for the learning of mixtures of
Gaussians: namely, the PAC-style model of learning probability distributions
introduced by Kearns et al. Here the task is to construct a hypothesis mixture
of Gaussians that is statistically indistinguishable from the actual mixture
generating the data; specifically, the KL-divergence should be at most epsilon.
  In this scenario, we give a poly(n/epsilon)-time algorithm that learns the
class of mixtures of any constant number of axis-aligned Gaussians in
n-dimensional Euclidean space. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about the
separation between the means of the Gaussians, nor does it have any dependence
on the minimum mixing weight. This is in contrast to learning results known in
the ``clustering'' model, where such assumptions are unavoidable.
  Our algorithm relies on the method of moments, and a subalgorithm developed
in previous work by the authors (FOCS 2005) for a discrete mixture-learning

 <dc:title>An Improved Sphere-Packing Bound Targeting Codes of Short to Moderate
  Block Lengths and Applications</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper derives an improved sphere-packing (ISP) bound targeting codes of
short to moderate block lengths. We first review the 1967 sphere-packing (SP67)
bound for discrete memoryless channels, and a recent improvement by Valembois
and Fossorier. These concepts are used for the derivation of a new lower bound
on the decoding error probability (referred to as the ISP bound) which is
uniformly tighter than the SP67 bound and its recent improved version. Under a
mild condition, the ISP bound is applicable to general memoryless channels, and
some of its applications are exemplified. Its tightness is studied by comparing
it with bounds on the ML decoding error probability. It is exemplified that the
ISP bound suggests an interesting alternative to the 1959 sphere-packing (SP59)
bound of Shannon for the Gaussian channel, especially for digital modulations
of high spectral efficiency.

 <dc:title>Free Choice Petri Nets without frozen tokens and Bipolar Synchronization
  Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wehler, Joachim</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>D.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bipolar synchronization systems (BP-systems) constitute a class of coloured
Petri nets, well suited for modeling the control flow of discrete, dynamical
systems. Every BP-system has an underlying ordinary Petri net, which is a
T-system. Moreover, it has a second ordinary net attached, which is a
free-choice system. We prove that a BP-system is live and safe if the T-system
and the free-choice system are live and safe and if the free-choice system has
no frozen tokens. This result is the converse of a theorem of Genrich and
Thiagarajan and proves an elder conjecture. The proof compares the different
Petri nets by Petri net morphisms and makes use of the classical theory of
free-choice systems

 <dc:description>  This paper examines information-theoretic questions regarding the difficulty
of compressing data versus the difficulty of decompressing data and the role
that information loss plays in this interaction. Finite-state compression and
decompression are shown to be of equivalent difficulty, even when the
decompressors are allowed to be lossy.
  Inspired by Kolmogorov complexity, this paper defines the optimal
*decompression *ratio achievable on an infinite sequence by finite-state
decompressors (that is, finite-state transducers outputting the sequence in
question). It is shown that the optimal compression ratio achievable on a
sequence S by any *information lossless* finite state compressor, known as the
finite-state dimension of S, is equal to the optimal decompression ratio
achievable on S by any finite-state decompressor. This result implies a new
decompression characterization of finite-state dimension in terms of lossy
finite-state transducers.

 <dc:title>Traveing Salesperson Problems for a double integrator</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose some novel path planning strategies for a double
integrator with bounded velocity and bounded control inputs. First, we study
the following version of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): given a set
of points in $\real^d$, find the fastest tour over the point set for a double
integrator. We first give asymptotic bounds on the time taken to complete such
a tour in the worst-case. Then, we study a stochastic version of the TSP for
double integrator where the points are randomly sampled from a uniform
distribution in a compact environment in $\real^2$ and $\real^3$. We propose
novel algorithms that perform within a constant factor of the optimal strategy
with high probability. Lastly, we study a dynamic TSP: given a stochastic
process that generates targets, is there a policy which guarantees that the
number of unvisited targets does not diverge over time? If such stable policies
exist, what is the minimum wait for a target? We propose novel stabilizing
receding-horizon algorithms whose performances are within a constant factor
from the optimum with high probability, in $\real^2$ as well as $\real^3$. We
also argue that these algorithms give identical performances for a particular
nonholonomic vehicle, Dubins vehicle.

 <dc:title>Reducing the Makespan in Hierarchical Reliable Multicast Tree</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Byun, Sang-Seon</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yoo, Chuck</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In hierarchical reliable multicast environment, makespan is the time that is
required to fully and successfully transmit a packet from the sender to all
receivers. Low makespan is vital for achieving high throughput with a TCP-like
window based sending scheme. In hierarchical reliable multicast methods, the
number of repair servers and their locations influence the makespan. In this
paper we propose a new method to decide the locations of repair servers that
can reduce the makespan in hierarchical reliable multicast networks. Our method
has a formulation based on mixed integer programming to analyze the makespan
minimization problem. A notable aspect of the formulation is that heterogeneous
links and packet losses are taken into account in the formulation. Three
different heuristics are presented to find the locations of repair servers in
reasonable time in the formulation. Through simulations, three heuristics are
carefully analyzed and compared on networks with different sizes. We also
evaluate our proposals on PGM (Pragmatic General Multicast) reliable multicast
protocol using ns-2 simulation. The results show that the our best heuristic is
close to the lower bound by a factor of 2.3 in terms of makespan and by a
factor of 5.5 in terms of the number of repair servers.

 <dc:title>Coding for Parallel Channels: Gallager Bounds and Applications to

 <dc:creator>Sason, Igal</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Goldenberg, Idan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is focused on the performance analysis of binary linear block
codes (or ensembles) whose transmission takes place over independent and
memoryless parallel channels. New upper bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML)
decoding error probability are derived. The framework of the second version of
the Duman and Salehi (DS2) bounds is generalized to the case of parallel
channels, along with the derivation of optimized tilting measures. The
connection between the generalized DS2 and the 1961 Gallager bounds, known
previously for a single channel, is revisited for the case of parallel
channels. The new bounds are used to obtain improved inner bounds on the
attainable channel regions under ML decoding. These improved bounds are applied
to ensembles of turbo-like codes, focusing on repeat-accumulate codes and their
recent variations.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we are interested in the application to video segmentation of
the discrete shape optimization problem involving the shape weighted perimeter
and an additional term depending on a parameter. Based on recent works and in
particular the one of Darbon and Sigelle, we justify the equivalence of the
shape optimization problem and a weighted total variation regularization. For
solving this problem, we adapt the projection algorithm proposed recently for
solving the basic TV regularization problem. Another solution to the shape
optimization investigated here is the graph cut technique. Both methods have
the advantage to lead to a global minimum. Since we can distinguish moving
objects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow
vectors, we choose the optical flow norm as initial data. In order to have the
contour as close as possible to an edge in the image, we use a classical edge
detector function as the weight of the weighted total variation. This model has
been used in one of our former works. We also apply the same methods to a video
segmentation model used by Jehan-Besson, Barlaud and Aubert. In this case, only
standard perimeter is incorporated in the shape functional. We also propose
another way for finding moving objects by using an a contrario detection of
objects on the image obtained by solving the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi Total Variation
regularization problem.We can notice the segmentation can be associated to a
level set in the former methods.

 <dc:description>  For large clause-to-variable ratio, typical K-SAT instances drawn from the
uniform distribution have no solution. We argue, based on statistical mechanics
calculations using the replica and cavity methods, that rare satisfiable
instances from the uniform distribution are very similar to typical instances
drawn from the so-called planted distribution, where instances are chosen
uniformly between the ones that admit a given solution. It then follows, from a
recent article by Feige, Mossel and Vilenchik, that these rare instances can be
easily recognized (in O(log N) time and with probability close to 1) by a
simple message-passing algorithm.

 <dc:title>Using groups for investigating rewrite systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe several technical tools that prove to be efficient for
investigating the rewrite systems associated with a family of algebraic laws,
and might be useful for more general rewrite systems. These tools consist in
introducing a monoid of partial operators, listing the monoid relations
expressing the possible local confluence of the rewrite system, then
introducing the group presented by these relations, and finally replacing the
initial rewrite system with a internal process entirely sitting in the latter
group. When the approach can be completed, one typically obtains a practical
method for constructing algebras satisfying prescribed laws and for solving the
associated word problem.

 <dc:description>  A cycle cover of a graph is a set of cycles such that every vertex is part of
exactly one cycle. An L-cycle cover is a cycle cover in which the length of
every cycle is in the set L.
  We investigate how well L-cycle covers of minimum weight can be approximated.
For undirected graphs, we devise a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that
achieves a constant approximation ratio for all sets L. On the other hand, we
prove that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor of 2-eps for
certain sets L.
  For directed graphs, we present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm
that achieves an approximation ratio of O(n), where $n$ is the number of
vertices. This is asymptotically optimal: We show that the problem cannot be
approximated within a factor of o(n).
  To contrast the results for cycle covers of minimum weight, we show that the
problem of computing L-cycle covers of maximum weight can, at least in
principle, be approximated arbitrarily well.

 <dc:description>  One of the main challenges in the verification of software systems is the
analysis of unbounded data structures with dynamic memory allocation, such as
linked data structures and arrays. We describe Bohne, a new analysis for
verifying data structures. Bohne verifies data structure operations and shows
that 1) the operations preserve data structure invariants and 2) the operations
satisfy their specifications expressed in terms of changes to the set of
objects stored in the data structure. During the analysis, Bohne infers loop
invariants in the form of disjunctions of universally quantified Boolean
combinations of formulas. To synthesize loop invariants of this form, Bohne
uses a combination of decision procedures for Monadic Second-Order Logic over
trees, SMT-LIB decision procedures (currently CVC Lite), and an automated
reasoner within the Isabelle interactive theorem prover. This architecture
shows that synthesized loop invariants can serve as a useful communication
mechanism between different decision procedures. Using Bohne, we have verified
operations on data structures such as linked lists with iterators and back
pointers, trees with and without parent pointers, two-level skip lists, array
data structures, and sorted lists. We have deployed Bohne in the Hob and Jahob
data structure analysis systems, enabling us to combine Bohne with analyses of
data structure clients and apply it in the context of larger programs. This
report describes the Bohne algorithm as well as techniques that Bohne uses to
reduce the ammount of annotations and the running time of the analysis.

 <dc:description>  The Maximum Differential Backlog (MDB) control policy of Tassiulas and
Ephremides has been shown to adaptively maximize the stable throughput of
multi-hop wireless networks with random traffic arrivals and queueing. The
practical implementation of the MDB policy in wireless networks with mutually
interfering links, however, requires the development of distributed
optimization algorithms. Within the context of CDMA-based multi-hop wireless
networks, we develop a set of node-based scaled gradient projection power
control algorithms which solves the MDB optimization problem in a distributed
manner using low communication overhead. As these algorithms require time to
converge to a neighborhood of the optimum, the optimal rates determined by the
MDB policy can only be found iteratively over time. For this, we show that the
iterative MDB policy with convergence time remains throughput optimal.

 <dc:description>  We construct a three parameter deformation of the Hopf algebra
$\mathbf{LDIAG}$. This new algebra is a true Hopf deformation which reduces to
$\mathbf{LDIAG}$ on one hand and to $\mathbf{MQSym}$ on the other, relating
$\mathbf{LDIAG}$ to other Hopf algebras of interest in contemporary physics.
Further, its product law reproduces that of the algebra of polyzeta functions.

 <dc:description>  Generalized majority-minority (GMM) operations are introduced as a common
generalization of near unanimity operations and Mal'tsev operations on finite

where all constraint relations are invariant under a (fixed) GMM operation, is
solvable in polynomial time. This constitutes one of the largest tractable
cases of the CSP.

 <dc:title>The recognizability of sets of graphs is a robust property</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Once the set of finite graphs is equipped with an algebra structure (arising
from the definition of operations that generalize the concatenation of words),
one can define the notion of a recognizable set of graphs in terms of finite
congruences. Applications to the construction of efficient algorithms and to
the theory of context-free sets of graphs follow naturally. The class of
recognizable sets depends on the signature of graph operations. We consider
three signatures related respectively to Hyperedge Replacement (HR)
context-free graph grammars, to Vertex Replacement (VR) context-free graph
grammars, and to modular decompositions of graphs. We compare the corresponding
classes of recognizable sets. We show that they are robust in the sense that
many variants of each signature (where in particular operations are defined by
quantifier-free formulas, a quite flexible framework) yield the same notions of
recognizability. We prove that for graphs without large complete bipartite
subgraphs, HR-recognizability and VR-recognizability coincide. The same
combinatorial condition equates HR-context-free and VR-context-free sets of
graphs. Inasmuch as possible, results are formulated in the more general
framework of relational structures.

consider binary domains and employ a three-valued characterization of domains
with sensing actions to define the regression function. We prove the soundness

of progression. More specifically, we show that (i) a plan obtained through
regression for a planning problem is indeed a progression solution of that
planning problem, and that (ii) for each plan found through progression, using
regression one obtains that plan or an equivalent one.

 <dc:title>Algebraic recognizability of regular tree languages</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new algebraic framework to discuss and classify recognizable
tree languages, and to characterize interesting classes of such languages. Our
algebraic tool, called preclones, encompasses the classical notion of syntactic
Sigma-algebra or minimal tree automaton, but adds new expressivity to it. The
main result in this paper is a variety theorem \`{a} la Eilenberg, but we also
discuss important examples of logically defined classes of recognizable tree
languages, whose characterization and decidability was established in recent
papers (by Benedikt and S\'{e}goufin, and by Bojanczyk and Walukiewicz) and can
be naturally formulated in terms of pseudovarieties of preclones. Finally, this
paper constitutes the foundation for another paper by the same authors, where
first-order definable tree languages receive an algebraic characterization.

Leroux, the system of partial-differential equations is completed by a trivial
equation for the bathymetry. By applying a change of variable, the system is
given a celerity-speed formulation, and linearized. As a result, an approximate
Riemann solver preserving the positivity of the celerity can be constructed,
permitting wetting and drying flow simulations to be performed. Finally, the

 <dc:description>  Complex networks, modeled as large graphs, received much attention during
these last years. However, data on such networks is only available through
intricate measurement procedures. Until recently, most studies assumed that
these procedures eventually lead to samples large enough to be representative
of the whole, at least concerning some key properties. This has crucial impact
on network modeling and simulation, which rely on these properties.
  Recent contributions proved that this approach may be misleading, but no
solution has been proposed. We provide here the first practical way to
distinguish between cases where it is indeed misleading, and cases where the
observed properties may be trusted. It consists in studying how the properties
of interest evolve when the sample grows, and in particular whether they reach
a steady state or not.
  In order to illustrate this method and to demonstrate its relevance, we apply
it to data-sets on complex network measurements that are representative of the
ones commonly used. The obtained results show that the method fulfills its
goals very well. We moreover identify some properties which seem easier to
evaluate in practice, thus opening interesting perspectives.

 <dc:description>  Finding, counting and/or listing triangles (three vertices with three edges)
in large graphs are natural fundamental problems, which received recently much
attention because of their importance in complex network analysis. We provide
here a detailed state of the art on these problems, in a unified way. We note
that, until now, authors paid surprisingly little attention to space
complexity, despite its both fundamental and practical interest. We give the
space complexities of known algorithms and discuss their implications. Then we
propose improvements of a known algorithm, as well as a new algorithm, which
are time optimal for triangle listing and beats previous algorithms concerning
space complexity. They have the additional advantage of performing better on
power-law graphs, which we also study. We finally show with an experimental
study that these two algorithms perform very well in practice, allowing to
handle cases that were previously out of reach.

 <dc:description>  Rule-based policy and contract systems have rarely been studied in terms of
their software engineering properties. This is a serious omission, because in
rule-based policy or contract representation languages rules are being used as
a declarative programming language to formalize real-world decision logic and
create IS production systems upon. This paper adopts an SE methodology from
extreme programming, namely test driven development, and discusses how it can
be adapted to verification, validation and integrity testing (V&amp;V&amp;I) of policy
and contract specifications. Since, the test-driven approach focuses on the
behavioral aspects and the drawn conclusions instead of the structure of the
rule base and the causes of faults, it is independent of the complexity of the
rule language and the system under test and thus much easier to use and
understand for the rule engineer and the user.

 <dc:description>  Automated management and monitoring of service contracts like Service Level
Agreements (SLAs) or higher-level policies is vital for efficient and reliable
distributed service-oriented architectures (SOA) with high quality of ser-vice
(QoS) levels. IT service provider need to manage, execute and maintain
thousands of SLAs for different customers and different types of services,
which needs new levels of flexibility and automation not available with the
current technol-ogy. I propose a novel rule-based knowledge representation (KR)
for SLA rules and a respective rule-based service level management (RBSLM)
framework. My rule-based approach based on logic programming provides several
advantages including automated rule chaining allowing for compact knowledge
representation and high levels of automation as well as flexibility to adapt to
rapidly changing business requirements. Therewith, I address an urgent need
service-oriented busi-nesses do have nowadays which is to dynamically change
their business and contractual logic in order to adapt to rapidly changing
business environments and to overcome the restricting nature of slow change
cycles.

 <dc:title>Approximating Rate-Distortion Graphs of Individual Data: Experiments in

 <dc:description>  Classical rate-distortion theory requires knowledge of an elusive source
distribution. Instead, we analyze rate-distortion properties of individual
objects using the recently developed algorithmic rate-distortion theory. The
latter is based on the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. To apply
the theory we approximate the Kolmogorov complexity by standard data
compression techniques, and perform a number of experiments with lossy
compression and denoising of objects from different domains. We also introduce
a natural generalization to lossy compression with side information. To
maintain full generality we need to address a difficult searching problem.
While our solutions are therefore not time efficient, we do observe good
denoising and compression performance.

 <dc:title>Multi-Antenna Cooperative Wireless Systems: A Diversity-Multiplexing
  Tradeoff Perspective</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yuksel, Melda</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Erkip, Elza</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a general multiple antenna network with multiple sources,
multiple destinations and multiple relays in terms of the
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). We examine several subcases of this most
general problem taking into account the processing capability of the relays
(half-duplex or full-duplex), and the network geometry (clustered or
non-clustered). We first study the multiple antenna relay channel with a
full-duplex relay to understand the effect of increased degrees of freedom in
the direct link. We find DMT upper bounds and investigate the achievable
performance of decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward (CF)
protocols. Our results suggest that while DF is DMT optimal when all terminals
have one antenna each, it may not maintain its good performance when the
degrees of freedom in the direct link is increased, whereas CF continues to
perform optimally. We also study the multiple antenna relay channel with a
half-duplex relay. We show that the half-duplex DMT behavior can significantly
be different from the full-duplex case. We find that CF is DMT optimal for
half-duplex relaying as well, and is the first protocol known to achieve the
half-duplex relay DMT. We next study the multiple-access relay channel (MARC)
DMT. Finally, we investigate a system with a single source-destination pair and
multiple relays, each node with a single antenna, and show that even under the
idealistic assumption of full-duplex relays and a clustered network, this
virtual multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system can never fully mimic a real
MIMO DMT. For cooperative systems with multiple sources and multiple
destinations the same limitation remains to be in effect.

 <dc:title>Optimal Design of Multiple Description Lattice Vector Quantizers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Xiang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Xiaolin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the design of multiple description lattice vector quantizers (MDLVQ),
index assignment plays a critical role. In addition, one also needs to choose
the Voronoi cell size of the central lattice v, the sublattice index N, and the
number of side descriptions K to minimize the expected MDLVQ distortion, given
the total entropy rate of all side descriptions Rt and description loss
probability p. In this paper we propose a linear-time MDLVQ index assignment
algorithm for any K &gt;= 2 balanced descriptions in any dimensions, based on a
new construction of so-called K-fraction lattice. The algorithm is greedy in
nature but is proven to be asymptotically (N -&gt; infinity) optimal for any K &gt;=
2 balanced descriptions in any dimensions, given Rt and p. The result is
stronger when K = 2: the optimality holds for finite N as well, under some mild
conditions. For K &gt; 2, a local adjustment algorithm is developed to augment the
greedy index assignment, and conjectured to be optimal for finite N.
  Our algorithmic study also leads to better understanding of v, N and K in
optimal MDLVQ design. For K = 2 we derive, for the first time, a
non-asymptotical closed form expression of the expected distortion of optimal
MDLVQ in p, Rt, N. For K &gt; 2, we tighten the current asymptotic formula of the
expected distortion, relating the optimal values of N and K to p and Rt more
precisely.

circle by a fixed angle of a. From the proof of Tony van Ravenstein, we propose
a detailed proof of the Steinhaus conjecture whose result is the following: the
N points partition the circle into gaps of at most three different lengths. We

 <dc:title>Problem Evolution: A new approach to problem solving systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gordon, Goren</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Einziger-Lowicz, Uri</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a novel tool to evaluate problem solving systems.
Instead of using a system to solve a problem, we suggest using the problem to
evaluate the system. By finding a numerical representation of a problem's
complexity, one can implement genetic algorithm to search for the most complex
problem the given system can solve. This allows a comparison between different
systems that solve the same set of problems. In this paper we implement this
approach on pattern recognition neural networks to try and find the most
complex pattern a given configuration can solve. The complexity of the pattern
is calculated using linguistic complexity. The results demonstrate the power of
the problem evolution approach in ranking different neural network
configurations according to their pattern recognition abilities. Future
research and implementations of this technique are also discussed.

 <dc:description>  Are the e-prints (electronic preprints) from the arXiv repository being used
instead of the journal articles? In this paper we show that the e-prints have
not undermined the usage of journal papers in the astrophysics community. As
soon as the journal article is published, the astronomical community prefers to
read the journal article and the use of e-prints through the NASA Astrophysics
Data System drops to zero. This suggests that the majority of astronomers have
access to institutional subscriptions and that they choose to read the journal
article when given the choice. Within the NASA Astrophysics Data System they
are given this choice, because the e-print and the journal article are treated
equally, since both are just one click away. In other words, the e-prints have
not undermined journal use in the astrophysics community and thus currently do
not pose a financial threat to the publishers. We present readership data for
the arXiv category &quot;astro-ph&quot; and the 4 core journals in astronomy
(Astrophysical Journal, Astronomical Journal, Monthly Notices of the Royal
Astronomical Society and Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics). Furthermore, we show that
the half-life (the point where the use of an article drops to half the use of a
newly published article) for an e-print is shorter than for a journal paper.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the following graph embedding problem: Given a
bipartite graph G = (V1; V2;E), where the maximum degree of vertices in V2 is
4, can G be embedded on a two dimensional grid such that each vertex in V1 is
drawn as a line segment along a grid line, each vertex in V2 is drawn as a
point at a grid point, and each edge e = (u; v) for some u 2 V1 and v 2 V2 is
drawn as a line segment connecting u and v, perpendicular to the line segment
for u? We show that this problem is NP-complete, and sketch how our proof
techniques can be used to show the hardness of several other related problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a fast 2-D block-based motion estimation algorithm
called Particle Swarm Optimization - Zero-motion Prejudgment(PSO-ZMP) which
consists of three sequential routines: 1)Zero-motion prejudgment. The routine
aims at finding static macroblocks(MB) which do not need to perform remaining
search thus reduces the computational cost; 2)Predictive image coding and 3)PSO
matching routine. Simulation results obtained show that the proposed PSO-ZMP
algorithm achieves over 10 times of computation less than Diamond Search(DS)
and 5 times less than the recent proposed Adaptive Rood Pattern
Searching(ARPS). Meanwhile the PSNR performances using PSO-ZMP are very close
to that using DS and ARPS in some less-motioned sequences. While in some
sequences containing dense and complex motion contents, the PSNR performances
of PSO-ZMP are several dB lower than that using DS and ARPS but in an
acceptable degree.

 <dc:description>  A modification of OWL-S regarding parameter description is proposed. It is
strictly based on Description Logic. In addition to class description of
parameters it also allows the modelling of relations between parameters and the
precise description of the size of data to be supplied to a service. In
particular, it solves two major issues identified within current proposals for
a Semantic Web Service annotation standard.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of computational terminology evaluation not
per se but in a specific application context. This paper describes the
evaluation procedure that has been used to assess the validity of our overall
indexing approach and the quality of the IndDoc indexing tool. Even if
user-oriented extended evaluation is irreplaceable, we argue that early
evaluations are possible and they are useful for development guidance.

 <dc:description>  Relying on the idea that back-of-the-book indexes are traditional devices for
navigation through large documents, we have developed a method to build a
hypertextual network that helps the navigation in a document. Building such an
hypertextual network requires selecting a list of descriptors, identifying the
relevant text segments to associate with each descriptor and finally ranking
the descriptors and reference segments by relevance order. We propose a
specific document segmentation method and a relevance measure for information
ranking. The algorithms are tested on 4 corpora (of different types and
domains) without human intervention or any semantic knowledge.

 <dc:description>  The paper describes the ALVIS annotation format designed for the indexing of
large collections of documents in topic-specific search engines. This paper is
exemplified on the biological domain and on MedLine abstracts, as developing a
specialized search engine for biologists is one of the ALVIS case studies. The
ALVIS principle for linguistic annotations is based on existing works and
standard propositions. We made the choice of stand-off annotations rather than
inserted mark-up. Annotations are encoded as XML elements which form the
linguistic subsection of the document record.

 <dc:description>  This report argues that, even in the simplest cases, IE is an ontology-driven
process. It is not a mere text filtering method based on simple pattern
matching and keywords, because the extracted pieces of texts are interpreted
with respect to a predefined partial domain model. This report shows that
depending on the nature and the depth of the interpretation to be done for
extracting the information, more or less knowledge must be involved. This
report is mainly illustrated in biology, a domain in which there are critical
needs for content-based exploration of the scientific literature and which
becomes a major application domain for IE.

 <dc:description>  We refine and extend an earlier MDL denoising criterion for wavelet-based
denoising. We start by showing that the denoising problem can be reformulated
as a clustering problem, where the goal is to obtain separate clusters for
informative and non-informative wavelet coefficients, respectively. This
suggests two refinements, adding a code-length for the model index, and
extending the model in order to account for subband-dependent coefficient
distributions. A third refinement is derivation of soft thresholding inspired
by predictive universal coding with weighted mixtures. We propose a practical
method incorporating all three refinements, which is shown to achieve good
performance and robustness in denoising both artificial and natural signals.

 <dc:title>The Capacity of Channels with Feedback</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a general framework for treating channels with memory and
feedback. First, we generalize Massey's concept of directed information and use
it to characterize the feedback capacity of general channels. Second, we
present coding results for Markov channels. This requires determining
appropriate sufficient statistics at the encoder and decoder. Third, a dynamic
programming framework for computing the capacity of Markov channels is
presented. Fourth, it is shown that the average cost optimality equation (ACOE)
can be viewed as an implicit single-letter characterization of the capacity.
Fifth, scenarios with simple sufficient statistics are described.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a simple framework for learning aggressive maneuvers in flight
control of UAVs. Having inspired from biological environment, dynamic movement
primitives are analyzed and extended using nonlinear contraction theory.
Accordingly, primitives of an observed movement are stably combined and
concatenated. We demonstrate our results experimentally on the Quanser
Helicopter, in which we first imitate aggressive maneuvers and then use them as
primitives to achieve new maneuvers that can fly over an obstacle.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to provide a sound framework for addressing a
difficult problem: the automatic construction of an autonomous agent's modular
architecture. We combine results from two apparently uncorrelated domains:
Autonomous planning through Markov Decision Processes and a General Data
Clustering Approach using a kernel-like method. Our fundamental idea is that
the former is a good framework for addressing autonomy whereas the latter
allows to tackle self-organizing problems.

 <dc:description>  Event-driven reactive functionalities are an urgent need in nowadays
distributed service-oriented applications and (Semantic) Web-based
environments. An important problem to be addressed is how to correctly and
efficiently capture and process the event-based behavioral, reactive logic
represented as ECA rules in combination with other conditional decision logic
which is represented as derivation rules. In this paper we elaborate on a
homogeneous integration approach which combines derivation rules, reaction
rules (ECA rules) and other rule types such as integrity constraint into the
general framework of logic programming. The developed ECA-LP language provides
expressive features such as ID-based updates with support for external and
self-updates of the intensional and extensional knowledge, transac-tions
including integrity testing and an event algebra to define and process complex
events and actions based on a novel interval-based Event Calculus variant.

 <dc:description>  The Health-e-Child project aims to develop an integrated healthcare platform
for European paediatrics. In order to achieve a comprehensive view of childrens
health, a complex integration of biomedical data, information, and knowledge is
necessary. Ontologies will be used to formally define this domain knowledge and
will form the basis for the medical knowledge management system. This paper
introduces an innovative methodology for the vertical integration of biomedical
knowledge. This approach will be largely clinician-centered and will enable the
definition of ontology fragments, connections between them (semantic bridges)
and enriched ontology fragments (views). The strategy for the specification and
capture of fragments, bridges and views is outlined with preliminary examples
demonstrated in the collection of biomedical information from hospital
databases, biomedical ontologies, and biomedical public databases.

 <dc:description>  We first formulate the problem of optimally scheduling air traffic low with
sector capacity constraints as a mixed integer linear program. We then use
semidefinite relaxation techniques to form a convex relaxation of that problem.
Finally, we present a randomization algorithm to further improve the quality of
the solution. Because of the specific structure of the air traffic flow
problem, the relaxation has a single semidefinite constraint of size dn where d
is the maximum delay and n the number of flights.

 <dc:description>  An elementary combinatorial Tanner graph construction for a family of
near-regular low density parity check codes achieving high girth is presented.
The construction allows flexibility in the choice of design parameters like
rate, average degree, girth and block length of the code and yields an
asymptotic family. The complexity of constructing codes in the family grows
only quadratically with the block length.

 <dc:description>  Aspect mining is a reverse engineering process that aims at finding
crosscutting concerns in existing systems. This paper proposes an aspect mining
approach based on determining methods that are called from many different
places, and hence have a high fan-in, which can be seen as a symptom of
crosscutting functionality. The approach is semi-automatic, and consists of
three steps: metric calculation, method filtering, and call site analysis.
Carrying out these steps is an interactive process supported by an Eclipse
plug-in called FINT. Fan-in analysis has been applied to three open source Java
systems, totaling around 200,000 lines of code. The most interesting concerns
identified are discussed in detail, which includes several concerns not
previously discussed in the aspect-oriented literature. The results show that a
significant number of crosscutting concerns can be recognized using fan-in
analysis, and each of the three steps can be supported by tools.

 <dc:description>  Message-passing iterative decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC) block
codes are known to be subject to decoding failures due to so-called
pseudo-codewords. These failures can cause the large signal-to-noise ratio
performance of message-passing iterative decoding to be worse than that
predicted by the maximum-likelihood decoding union bound. In this paper we
address the pseudo-codeword problem from the convolutional-code perspective. In
particular, we compare the performance of LDPC convolutional codes with that of
their ``wrapped'' quasi-cyclic block versions and we show that the minimum
pseudo-weight of an LDPC convolutional code is at least as large as the minimum
pseudo-weight of an underlying quasi-cyclic code. This result, which parallels
a well-known relationship between the minimum Hamming weight of convolutional
codes and the minimum Hamming weight of their quasi-cyclic counterparts, is due
to the fact that every pseudo-codeword in the convolutional code induces a
pseudo-codeword in the block code with pseudo-weight no larger than that of the
convolutional code's pseudo-codeword. This difference in the weight spectra
leads to improved performance at low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratios for the
convolutional code, a conclusion supported by simulation results.

 <dc:description>  Recent interest in networked control systems (NCS) has instigated research in
both communication networks and control. Analysis of NCSs has usually been
performed from either the network or the control point of view, but not many
papers exist where the analysis of both is done in the same context. In this
paper an overall analysis of the networked control system is presented. First,
the procedure of obtaining the upper bound delay value for packet transmission
in the switched Ethernet network is presented. Next, the obtained delay
estimate is utilised in delay compensation for improving the Quality of
Performance (QoP) of the control systems. The presented upper bound delay
algorithm applies ideas from network calculus theory. For the improvement of
QoP, two delay compensation strategies, the Smith predictor based and the
robust control based delay compensation strategies, are presented and compared.

 <dc:title>Mining Generalized Graph Patterns based on User Examples</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  There has been a lot of recent interest in mining patterns from graphs.
Often, the exact structure of the patterns of interest is not known. This
happens, for example, when molecular structures are mined to discover fragments
useful as features in chemical compound classification task, or when web sites
are mined to discover sets of web pages representing logical documents. Such
patterns are often generated from a few small subgraphs (cores), according to
certain generalization rules (GRs). We call such patterns &quot;generalized
patterns&quot;(GPs). While being structurally different, GPs often perform the same
function in the network. Previously proposed approaches to mining GPs either
assumed that the cores and the GRs are given, or that all interesting GPs are
frequent. These are strong assumptions, which often do not hold in practical
applications. In this paper, we propose an approach to mining GPs that is free
from the above assumptions. Given a small number of GPs selected by the user,
our algorithm discovers all GPs similar to the user examples. First, a machine
learning-style approach is used to find the cores. Second, generalizations of
the cores in the graph are computed to identify GPs. Evaluation on synthetic
data, generated using real cores and GRs from biological and web domains,
demonstrates effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  We illustrate the utility of the recently developed loop calculus for
improving the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. If the algorithm that
minimizes the Bethe free energy fails we modify the free energy by accounting
for a critical loop in a graphical representation of the code. The
log-likelihood specific critical loop is found by means of the loop calculus.
The general method is tested using an example of the Linear Programming (LP)
decoding, that can be viewed as a special limit of the BP decoding. Considering
the (155,64,20) code that performs over Additive-White-Gaussian-Noise channel
we show that the loop calculus improves the LP decoding and corrects all
previously found dangerous configurations of log-likelihoods related to
pseudo-codewords with low effective distance, thus reducing the code's
error-floor.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel iterative algorithm for detection of binary Markov random
fields (MRFs) corrupted by two-dimensional (2D) intersymbol interference (ISI)
and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). We assume a first-order binary MRF as
a simple model for correlated images. We assume a 2D digital storage channel,
where the MRF is interleaved before being written and then read by a 2D
transducer; such channels occur in recently proposed optical disk storage
systems. The detection algorithm is a concatenation of two
soft-input/soft-output (SISO) detectors: an iterative row-column soft-decision
feedback (IRCSDF) ISI detector, and a MRF detector. The MRF detector is a SISO
version of the stochastic relaxation algorithm by Geman and Geman in IEEE
Trans. Pattern Anal. and Mach. Intell., Nov. 1984. On the 2 x 2 averaging-mask
ISI channel, at a bit error rate (BER) of 10^{-5}, the concatenated algorithm
achieves SNR savings of between 0.5 and 2.0 dB over the IRCSDF detector alone;
the savings increase as the MRFs become more correlated, or as the SNR
decreases. The algorithm is also fairly robust to mismatches between the
assumed and actual MRF parameters.

 <dc:title>Sensor Scheduling for Optimal Observability Using Estimation Entropy</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider sensor scheduling as the optimal observability problem for
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This model fits to the
cases where a Markov process is observed by a single sensor which needs to be
dynamically adjusted or by a set of sensors which are selected one at a time in
a way that maximizes the information acquisition from the process. Similar to
conventional POMDP problems, in this model the control action is based on all
past measurements; however here this action is not for the control of state
process, which is autonomous, but it is for influencing the measurement of that
process. This POMDP is a controlled version of the hidden Markov process, and
we show that its optimal observability problem can be formulated as an average
cost Markov decision process (MDP) scheduling problem. In this problem, a
policy is a rule for selecting sensors or adjusting the measuring device based
on the measurement history. Given a policy, we can evaluate the estimation
entropy for the joint state-measurement processes which inversely measures the
observability of state process for that policy. Considering estimation entropy
as the cost of a policy, we show that the problem of finding optimal policy is
equivalent to an average cost MDP scheduling problem where the cost function is
the entropy function over the belief space. This allows the application of the
policy iteration algorithm for finding the policy achieving minimum estimation
entropy, thus optimum observability.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, a variety of effective chaos-based image encryption schemes
have been proposed. The typical structure of these schemes has the permutation
and the diffusion stages performed alternatively. The confusion and diffusion
effect is solely contributed by the permutation and the diffusion stage,
respectively. As a result, more overall rounds than necessary are required to
achieve a certain level of security. In this paper, we suggest to introduce
certain diffusion effect in the confusion stage by simple sequential
add-and-shift operations. The purpose is to reduce the workload of the
time-consuming diffusion part so that fewer overall rounds and hence a shorter
encryption time is needed. Simulation results show that at a similar
performance level, the proposed cryptosystem needs less than one-third the
encryption time of an existing cryptosystem. The effective acceleration of the
encryption speed is thus achieved.

 <dc:description>  We consider generalizations of Reed-Muller codes, toric codes, and codes from
certain plane curves, such as those defined by norm and trace functions on
finite fields. In each case we are interested in codes defined by evaluating
arbitrary subsets of monomials, and in identifying when the dual codes are also
obtained by evaluating monomials. We then move to the context of order domain
theory, in which the subsets of monomials can be chosen to optimize decoding
performance using the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm with majority voting.
We show that for the codes under consideration these subsets are well-behaved
and the dual codes are also defined by monomials.

 <dc:description>  Garcia and Stichtenoth discovered two towers of function fields that meet the
Drinfeld-Vl\u{a}du\c{t} bound on the ratio of the number of points to the
genus. For one of these towers, Garcia, Pellikaan and Torres derived a
recursive description of the Weierstrass semigroups associated to a tower of
points on the associated curves. In this article, a non-recursive description
of the semigroups is given and from this the enumeration of each of the
semigroups is derived as well as its inverse. This enables us to find an
explicit formula for the order (Feng-Rao) bound on the minimum distance of the
associated one-point codes.

 <dc:description>  Analysis of the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm for decoding one-point
codes leads to two methods for improving code rate. One method, due to Feng and
Rao, removes parity checks that may be recovered by their majority voting
algorithm. The second method is to design the code to correct only those error
vectors of a given weight that are also geometrically generic. In this work,
formulae are given for the redundancies of Hermitian codes optimized with
respect to these criteria as well as the formula for the order bound on the
minimum distance. The results proceed from an analysis of numerical semigroups
generated by two consecutive integers. The formula for the redundancy of
optimal Hermitian codes correcting a given number of errors answers an open
question stated by Pellikaan and Torres in 1999.

 <dc:title>Labeling Schemes with Queries</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Korman, Amos</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the question of ``how robust are the known lower bounds of labeling
schemes when one increases the number of consulted labels''. Let $f$ be a
function on pairs of vertices. An $f$-labeling scheme for a family of graphs
$\cF$ labels the vertices of all graphs in $\cF$ such that for every graph
$G\in\cF$ and every two vertices $u,v\in G$, the value $f(u,v)$ can be inferred
by merely inspecting the labels of $u$ and $v$.
  This paper introduces a natural generalization: the notion of $f$-labeling
schemes with queries, in which the value $f(u,v)$ can be inferred by inspecting
not only the labels of $u$ and $v$ but possibly the labels of some additional
vertices. We show that inspecting the label of a single additional vertex (one
{\em query}) enables us to reduce the label size of many labeling schemes
significantly.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of private computation of approximate Heavy Hitters.
Alice and Bob each hold a vector and, in the vector sum, they want to find the
B largest values along with their indices. While the exact problem requires
linear communication, protocols in the literature solve this problem
approximately using polynomial computation time, polylogarithmic communication,
and constantly many rounds. We show how to solve the problem privately with
comparable cost, in the sense that nothing is learned by Alice and Bob beyond
what is implied by their input, the ideal top-B output, and goodness of
approximation (equivalently, the Euclidean norm of the vector sum). We give
lower bounds showing that the Euclidean norm must leak by any efficient
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We have studied the update operator defined for update sequences by Eiter et
al. without tautologies and we have observed that it satisfies an interesting
property This property, which we call Weak Independence of Syntax (WIS), is
similar to one of the postulates proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors, and
Makinson (AGM); only that in this case it applies to nonmonotonic logic. In
addition, we consider other five additional basic properties about update
programs and we show that the operator of Eiter et al. satisfies them. This
work continues the analysis of the AGM postulates under a refined view that
considers nelson logic as a monotonic logic which allows us to expand our
understanding of answer sets. Moreover, nelson logic helped us to derive an
alternative definition of the operator defined by Eiter et al. avoiding the use
of unnecessary extra atoms.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Rank/Select dictionaries are data structures for an ordered set $S \subset
\{0,1,...,n-1\}$ to compute $\rank(x,S)$ (the number of elements in $S$ which
are no greater than $x$), and $\select(i,S)$ (the $i$-th smallest element in
$S$), which are the fundamental components of \emph{succinct data structures}
of strings, trees, graphs, etc. In those data structures, however, only
asymptotic behavior has been considered and their performance for real data is
not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose novel four Rank/Select
dictionaries, esp, recrank, vcode and sdarray, each of which is small if the
number of elements in $S$ is small, and indeed close to $nH_0(S)$ ($H_0(S) \leq
1$ is the zero-th order \textit{empirical entropy} of $S$) in practice, and its
query time is superior to the previous ones. Experimental results reveal the
characteristics of our data structures and also show that these data structures
are superior to existing implementations in both size and query time.

 <dc:title>Embedding Metrics into Ultrametrics and Graphs into Spanning Trees with

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the basic question of how well can a tree approximate
distances of a metric space or a graph. Given a graph, the problem of
constructing a spanning tree in a graph which strongly preserves distances in
the graph is a fundamental problem in network design. We present scaling
distortion embeddings where the distortion scales as a function of $\epsilon$,
with the guarantee that for each $\epsilon$ the distortion of a fraction
$1-\epsilon$ of all pairs is bounded accordingly. Such a bound implies, in
particular, that the \emph{average distortion} and $\ell_q$-distortions are
small. Specifically, our embeddings have \emph{constant} average distortion and
$O(\sqrt{\log n})$ $\ell_2$-distortion. This follows from the following
results: we prove that any metric space embeds into an ultrametric with scaling
distortion $O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. For the graph setting we prove that any
weighted graph contains a spanning tree with scaling distortion
$O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. These bounds are tight even for embedding in arbitrary
trees.
  For probabilistic embedding into spanning trees we prove a scaling distortion
of $\tilde{O}(\log^2 (1/\epsilon))$, which implies \emph{constant}
$\ell_q$-distortion for every fixed $q&lt;\infty$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we elaborate on a specific application in the context of hybrid
description logic programs (hybrid DLPs), namely description logic Semantic Web
type systems (DL-types) which are used for term typing of LP rules based on a
polymorphic, order-sorted, hybrid DL-typed unification as procedural semantics
of hybrid DLPs. Using Semantic Web ontologies as type systems facilitates
interchange of domain-independent rules over domain boundaries via dynamically
typing and mapping of explicitly defined type ontologies.

 <dc:description>  The Astrophysics Data System (ADS) provides an extensive system of links
between the literature and other on-line information. Recently, the journals of
the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and a group of NASA data centers have
collaborated to provide more links between on-line data obtained by space
missions and the on-line journals. Authors can now specify which data sets they
have used in their article. This information is used by the participants to
provide the links between the literature and the data.

 <dc:title>VPSPACE and a Transfer Theorem over the Reals</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Koiran, Pascal</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new class VPSPACE of families of polynomials. Roughly
speaking, a family of polynomials is in VPSPACE if its coefficients can be
computed in polynomial space. Our main theorem is that if (uniform,
constant-free) VPSPACE families can be evaluated efficiently then the class PAR
of decision problems that can be solved in parallel polynomial time over the
real numbers collapses to P. As a result, one must first be able to show that
there are VPSPACE families which are hard to evaluate in order to separate over
the reals P from NP, or even from PAR.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In multimedia, text or bioinformatics databases, applications query sequences
of n consecutive symbols called n-grams. Estimating the number of distinct
n-grams is a view-size estimation problem. While view sizes can be estimated by
sampling under statistical assumptions, we desire an unassuming algorithm with
universally valid accuracy bounds. Most related work has focused on repeatedly
hashing the data, which is prohibitive for large data sources. We prove that a
one-pass one-hash algorithm is sufficient for accurate estimates if the hashing
is sufficiently independent. To reduce costs further, we investigate recursive
random hashing algorithms and show that they are sufficiently independent in
practice. We compare our running times with exact counts using suffix arrays
and show that, while we use hardly any storage, we are an order of magnitude
faster. The approach further is extended to a one-pass/one-hash computation of
n-gram entropy and iceberg counts. The experiments use a large collection of
English text from the Gutenberg Project as well as synthetic data.

 <dc:description>  With over 20 million records, the ADS citation database is regularly used by
researchers and librarians to measure the scientific impact of individuals,
groups, and institutions. In addition to the traditional sources of citations,
the ADS has recently added references extracted from the arXiv e-prints on a
nightly basis. We review the procedures used to harvest and identify the
reference data used in the creation of citations, the policies and procedures
that we follow to avoid double-counting and to eliminate contributions which
may not be scholarly in nature. Finally, we describe how users and institutions
can easily obtain quantitative citation data from the ADS, both interactively
and via web-based programming tools.

 <dc:title>On Shift Sequences for Interleaved Construction of Sequence Sets with
  Low Correlation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pillai, N Rajesh</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kumar, Yogesh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Construction of signal sets with low correlation property is of interest to
designers of CDMA systems. One of the preferred ways of constructing such sets
is the interleaved construction which uses two sequences a and b with 2-level
autocorrelation and a shift sequence e. The shift sequence has to satisfy
certain conditions for the resulting signal set to have low correlation
properties. This article shows that the conditions reported in literature are
too strong and gives a version which results in more number of shift sequences.
An open problem on the existence of shift sequences for attaining an
interleaved set with maximum correlation value bounded by v+2 is also taken up
and solved.

 <dc:description>  The work described in this paper is a contribution to the problems of
managing in data-intensive scientific applications. First, we discuss
scientific workflows and motivate there use in scientific applications. Then,
we introduce the concept of cooperative processes and describe their
interactions and uses in a flexible cooperative workflow system called
\textit{Bonita}. Finally, we propose an approach to integrate and synthesize
the data exchanged by the mapping of data-intensive science into Bonita, using
a binary approach, and illustrate the endeavors done to enhance the performance
computations within a dynamic environment.

 <dc:title>Implementing a Unification Algorithm for Protocol Analysis with XOR</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a unification algorithm for the theory $E$ which
combines unification algorithms for $E\_{\std}$ and $E\_{\ACUN}$ (ACUN
properties, like XOR) but compared to the more general combination methods uses
specific properties of the equational theories for further optimizations. Our
optimizations drastically reduce the number of non-deterministic choices, in
particular those for variable identification and linear orderings. This is
important for reducing both the runtime of the unification algorithm and the
number of unifiers in the complete set of unifiers. We emphasize that obtaining
a ``small'' set of unifiers is essential for the efficiency of the constraint
solving procedure within which the unification algorithm is used. The method is
implemented in the CL-Atse tool for security protocol analysis.

 <dc:description>  Truth based entailments are not sufficient for a good comprehension of NL. In
fact, it can not deduce implicit information necessary to understand a text. On
the other hand, norm based entailments are able to reach this goal. This idea
was behind the development of Frames (Minsky 75) and Scripts (Schank 77, Schank
79) in the 70's. But these theories are not formalized enough and their
adaptation to new situations is far from being obvious. In this paper, we
present a reasoning system which uses norms in a causal reasoning process in
order to find the cause of an accident from a text describing it.

 <dc:description>  To understand texts written in natural language (LN), we use our knowledge
about the norms of the domain. Norms allow to infer more implicit information
from the text. This kind of information can, in general, be defeasible, but it
remains useful and acceptable while the text do not contradict it explicitly.
In this paper we describe a non-monotonic reasoning system based on the norms
of the car crash domain. The system infers the cause of an accident from its
textual description. The cause of an accident is seen as the most specific norm
which has been violated. The predicates and the rules of the system are
stratified: organized on layers in order to obtain an efficient reasoning.

 <dc:description>  In this paper a new RSS feed ranking method called NectaRSS is introduced.
The system recommends information to a user based on his/her past choices. User
preferences are automatically acquired, avoiding explicit feedback, and ranking
is based on those preferences distilled to a user profile. NectaRSS uses the
well-known vector space model for user profiles and new documents, and compares
them using information-retrieval techniques, but introduces a novel method for
user profile creation and adaptation from users' past choices. The efficiency
of the proposed method has been tested by embedding it into an intelligent
aggregator (RSS feed reader), which has been used by different and
heterogeneous users. Besides, this paper proves that the ranking of newsitems
yielded by NectaRSS improves its quality with user's choices, and its
superiority over other algorithms that use a different information
representation method.

 <dc:title>XString: XML as a String</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gilreath, William F.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Extensible markup language (XML) is a technology that has been much hyped, so
that XML has become an industry buzzword. Behind the hype is a powerful
technology for data representation in a platform independent manner. As a text
document, however, XML suffers from being too bloated, and requires an XML
parser to access and manipulate it. XString is an encoding method for XML, in
essence, a markup language's markup language. XString gives the benefit of
compressing XML, and allows for easy manipulation and processing of XML source
as a very long string.

 <dc:title>On the Fading Paper Achievable Region of the Fading MIMO Broadcast
  Channel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bennatan, Amir</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Burshtein, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider transmission over the ergodic fading multi-antenna broadcast
(MIMO-BC) channel with partial channel state information at the transmitter and
full information at the receiver. Over the equivalent {\it non}-fading channel,
capacity has recently been shown to be achievable using transmission schemes
that were designed for the ``dirty paper'' channel. We focus on a similar
``fading paper'' model. The evaluation of the fading paper capacity is
difficult to obtain. We confine ourselves to the {\it linear-assignment}
capacity, which we define, and use convex analysis methods to prove that its
maximizing distribution is Gaussian. We compare our fading-paper transmission
to an application of dirty paper coding that ignores the partial state
information and assumes the channel is fixed at the average fade. We show that
a gain is easily achieved by appropriately exploiting the information. We also
consider a cooperative upper bound on the sum-rate capacity as suggested by
Sato. We present a numeric example that indicates that our scheme is capable of
realizing much of this upper bound.

 <dc:description>  Much progress has been made on decoding algorithms for error-correcting codes
in the last decade. In this article, we give an introduction to some
fundamental results on iterative, message-passing algorithms for low-density
parity check codes. For certain important stochastic channels, this line of
work has enabled getting very close to Shannon capacity with algorithms that
are extremely efficient (both in theory and practice).

 <dc:description>  The Networked Control Systems (NCS) are complex systems which integrate
information provided by several domians such as automatic control, computer
science, communication network. The work presented in this paper concerns fault
detection, isolation and compensation of communication network. The proposed
method is based on the classical approach of Fault Detection and Isolation and
Fault Tolerant Control (FDI/FTC) currently used in diagnosis. The modelling of
the network to be supervised is based on both couloured petri nets and network
calculus theory often used to represent and analyse the network behaviour. The
goal is to implement inside network devices algorithms enabling to detect,
isolate and compensate communication faults in an autonomous way.

 <dc:title>Low Correlation Sequences over the QAM Constellation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Anand, M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kumar, P. Vijay</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the first concerted look at low correlation sequence
families over QAM constellations of size M^2=4^m and their potential
applicability as spreading sequences in a CDMA setting.
  Five constructions are presented, and it is shown how such sequence families
have the ability to transport a larger amount of data as well as enable
variable-rate signalling on the reverse link.
  Canonical family CQ has period N, normalized maximum-correlation parameter
theta_max bounded above by A sqrt(N), where 'A' ranges from 1.8 in the 16-QAM
case to 3.0 for large M. In a CDMA setting, each user is enabled to transfer 2m
bits of data per period of the spreading sequence which can be increased to 3m
bits of data by halving the size of the sequence family. The technique used to
construct CQ is easily extended to produce larger sequence families and an
example is provided.
  Selected family SQ has a lower value of theta_max but permits only (m+1)-bit
data modulation. The interleaved 16-QAM sequence family IQ has theta_max &lt;=
sqrt(2) sqrt(N) and supports 3-bit data modulation.
  The remaining two families are over a quadrature-PAM (Q-PAM) subset of size
2M of the M^2-QAM constellation. Family P has a lower value of theta_max in
comparison with Family SQ, while still permitting (m+1)-bit data modulation.
Interleaved family IP, over the 8-ary Q-PAM constellation, permits 3-bit data
modulation and interestingly, achieves the Welch lower bound on theta_max.

 <dc:title>Covering selfish machines</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Epstein, Leah</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the machine covering problem for selfish related machines. For a
constant number of machines, m, we show a monotone polynomial time
approximation scheme (PTAS) with running time that is linear in the number of
jobs. It uses a new technique for reducing the number of jobs while remaining
close to the optimal solution. We also present an FPTAS for the classical
machine covering problem (the previous best result was a PTAS) and use this to
give a monotone FPTAS.
  Additionally, we give a monotone approximation algorithm with approximation
ratio \min(m,(2+\eps)s_1/s_m) where \eps&gt;0 can be chosen arbitrarily small and
s_i is the (real) speed of machine i. Finally we give improved results for two
machines.
  Our paper presents the first results for this problem in the context of
selfish machines.

 <dc:description>  A data word is a sequence of pairs of a letter from a finite alphabet and an
element from an infinite set, where the latter can only be compared for
equality. To reason about data words, linear temporal logic is extended by the
freeze quantifier, which stores the element at the current word position into a
register, for equality comparisons deeper in the formula. By translations from
the logic to alternating automata with registers and then to faulty counter
automata whose counters may erroneously increase at any time, and from faulty
and error-free counter automata to the logic, we obtain a complete complexity
table for logical fragments defined by varying the set of temporal operators
and the number of registers. In particular, the logic with future-time
operators and 1 register is decidable but not primitive recursive over finite
data words. Adding past-time operators or 1 more register, or switching to
infinite data words, cause undecidability.

 <dc:description>  Embedded systems become more and more widespread, especially autonomous ones,
and clearly tend to be ubiquitous. In such systems, low-power and low-energy
usage get ever more crucial. Furthermore, these issues also become paramount in
(massively) multi-processors systems, either in one machine or more widely in a
grid. The various problems faced pertain to autonomy, power supply
possibilities, thermal dissipation, or even sheer energy cost. Although it has
since long been studied in harware, energy optimization is more recent in
software. In this paper, we thus aim at raising awareness to low-power and
low-energy issues in the language and compilation community. We thus broadly
but briefly survey techniques and solutions to this energy issue, focusing on a
few specific aspects in the context of compiler optimizations and memory
management.

the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics is working on a project to
microfilm historical observatory publications. The microfilm is then scanned
for inclusion in the ADS. The ADS currently contains over 700,000 scanned pages
of volumes of historical literature. Many of these volumes lack clear
pagination or other bibliographic data that are necessary to take advantage of
the searching capabilities of the ADS. This paper will address some of the
interesting challenges that needed to be resolved during the processing of the

 <dc:description>  In the emerging eScience environment, repositories of papers, datasets,
software, etc., should be the foundation of a global and natively-digital
scholarly communications system. The current infrastructure falls far short of
this goal. Cross-repository interoperability must be augmented to support the
many workflows and value-chains involved in scholarly communication. This will
not be achieved through the promotion of single repository architecture or
content representation, but instead requires an interoperability framework to
connect the many heterogeneous systems that will exist.
  We present a simple data model and service architecture that augments
repository interoperability to enable scholarly value-chains to be implemented.
We describe an experiment that demonstrates how the proposed infrastructure can
be deployed to implement the workflow involved in the creation of an overlay
journal over several different repository systems (Fedora, aDORe, DSpace and
arXiv).

 <dc:title>Pipelined Feed-Forward Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Calculation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Walma, Mathys</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper discusses a method for pipelining the calculation of CRC's, such
as ITU/CCITT CRC32, into a mostly feed-forward architecture. This method allows
several benefits such as independent scaling of circuit frequency and data
throughput. Additionally it allows calculation over packet tails (packet length
not a multiple of CRC input width). Finally it offers the ability to update a
CRC where a subset of data in the packet has changed.

 <dc:description>  We propose in this paper a new family of kernels to handle times series,
notably speech data, within the framework of kernel methods which includes
popular algorithms such as the Support Vector Machine. These kernels elaborate
on the well known Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) family of distances by considering
the same set of elementary operations, namely substitutions and repetitions of
tokens, to map a sequence onto another. Associating to each of these operations
a given score, DTW algorithms use dynamic programming techniques to compute an
optimal sequence of operations with high overall score. In this paper we
consider instead the score spanned by all possible alignments, take a smoothed
version of their maximum and derive a kernel out of this formulation. We prove
that this kernel is positive definite under favorable conditions and show how
it can be tuned effectively for practical applications as we report encouraging
results on a speech recognition task.

 <dc:title>Postinal Determinacy of Games with Infinitely Many Priorities</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study two-player games of infinite duration that are played on finite or
infinite game graphs. A winning strategy for such a game is positional if it
only depends on the current position, and not on the history of the play. A
game is positionally determined if, from each position, one of the two players
has a positional winning strategy.
  The theory of such games is well studied for winning conditions that are
defined in terms of a mapping that assigns to each position a priority from a
finite set. Specifically, in Muller games the winner of a play is determined by
the set of those priorities that have been seen infinitely often; an important
special case are parity games where the least (or greatest) priority occurring
infinitely often determines the winner. It is well-known that parity games are
positionally determined whereas Muller games are determined via finite-memory
strategies.
  In this paper, we extend this theory to the case of games with infinitely
many priorities. Such games arise in several application areas, for instance in
pushdown games with winning conditions depending on stack contents.
  For parity games there are several generalisations to the case of infinitely
many priorities. While max-parity games over omega or min-parity games over
larger ordinals than omega require strategies with infinite memory, we can
prove that min-parity games with priorities in omega are positionally
determined. Indeed, it turns out that the min-parity condition over omega is
the only infinitary Muller condition that guarantees positional determinacy on
all game graphs.

 <dc:description>  It is known that Tardos's collusion-secure probabilistic fingerprinting code
(Tardos code; STOC'03) has length of theoretically minimal order with respect
to the number of colluding users. However, Tardos code uses certain continuous
probability distribution in codeword generation, which creates some problems
for practical use, in particular, it requires large extra memory. A solution
proposed so far is to use some finite probability distributions instead. In
this paper, we determine the optimal finite distribution in order to decrease
extra memory amount. By our result, the extra memory is reduced to 1/32 of the
original, or even becomes needless, in some practical setting. Moreover, the
code length is also reduced, e.g. to about 20.6% of Tardos code asymptotically.
Finally, we address some other practical issues such as approximation errors
which are inevitable in any real implementation.

 <dc:description>  We provide a single-letter characterization for the capacity region of a
class of discrete degraded interference channels (DDICs). The class of DDICs
considered includes the discrete additive degraded interference channel (DADIC)
studied by Benzel. We show that for the class of DDICs studied, encoder
cooperation does not increase the capacity region, and therefore, the capacity
region of the class of DDICs is the same as the capacity region of the
corresponding degraded broadcast channel.

 <dc:title>Church's thesis is questioned by new calculation paradigm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hutzelmeyer, Hannes</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Church's thesis claims that all effecticely calculable functions are
recursive. A shortcoming of the various definitions of recursive functions lies
in the fact that it is not a matter of a syntactical check to find out if an
entity gives rise to a function. Eight new ideas for a precise setup of
arithmetical logic and its metalanguage give the proper environment for the
construction of a special computer, the ARBACUS computer. Computers do not come
to a necessary halt; it is requested that calculators are constructed on the
basis of computers in a way that they always come to a halt, then all
calculations are effective. The ARBATOR is defined as a calculator with
two-layer-computation. It allows for the calculation of all primitive recursive
functions, but multi-level-arbation also allows for the calculation of other
arbative functions that are not primitive recursive. The new paradigm of
calculation does not have the above mentioned shortcoming. The defenders of
Church's thesis are challenged to show that exotic arbative functions are
recursive and to put forward a recursive function that is not arbative. A
construction with three-tier-multi-level-arbation that includes a
diagonalisation leads to the extravagant yet calculable Snark-function that is
not arbative. As long as it is not shown that all exotic arbative functions and
particularily the Snark-function are arithmetically representable Goedel's
first incompleteness sentence is in limbo.

 <dc:title>The Application of Fuzzy Logic to the Construction of the Ranking
  Function of Information Retrieval Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rubens, Neil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The quality of the ranking function is an important factor that determines
the quality of the Information Retrieval system. Each document is assigned a
score by the ranking function; the score indicates the likelihood of relevance
of the document given a query. In the vector space model, the ranking function
is defined by a mathematic expression. We propose a fuzzy logic (FL) approach
to defining the ranking function. FL provides a convenient way of converting
knowledge expressed in a natural language into fuzzy logic rules. The resulting
ranking function could be easily viewed, extended, and verified: * if (tf is
high) and (idf is high) &gt; (relevance is high); * if (overlap is high) &gt;
(relevance is high). By using above FL rules, we are able to achieve
performance approximately equal to the state of the art search engine Apache
Lucene (deltaP10 +0.92%; deltaMAP -0.1%). The fuzzy logic approach allows
combining the logic-based model with the vector model. The resulting model
possesses simplicity and formalism of the logic based model, and the
flexibility and performance of the vector model.

 <dc:title>Crosstalk-free Conjugate Networks for Optical Multicast Switching</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Deng, Yun</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Tony T.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  High-speed photonic switching networks can switch optical signals at the rate
of several terabits per second. However, they suffer from an intrinsic
crosstalk problem when two optical signals cross at the same switch element. To
avoid crosstalk, active connections must be node-disjoint in the switching
network. In this paper, we propose a sequence of decomposition and merge
operations, called conjugate transformation, performed on each switch element
to tackle this problem. The network resulting from this transformation is
called conjugate network. By using the numbering-schemes of networks, we prove
that if the route assignments in the original network are link-disjoint, their
corresponding ones in the conjugate network would be node-disjoint. Thus,
traditional nonblocking switching networks can be transformed into
crosstalk-free optical switches in a routine manner. Furthermore, we show that
crosstalk-free multicast switches can also be obtained from existing
nonblocking multicast switches via the same conjugate transformation.

 <dc:description>  The k-modes algorithm has become a popular technique in solving categorical
data clustering problems in different application domains. However, the
algorithm requires random selection of initial points for the clusters.
Different initial points often lead to considerable distinct clustering
results. In this paper we present an experimental study on applying a
farthest-point heuristic based initialization method to k-modes clustering to
improve its performance. Experiments show that new initialization method leads
to better clustering accuracy than random selection initialization method for
k-modes clustering.

 <dc:description>  In a frequency selective slow-fading channel in a MIMO system, the channel
matrix is of the form of a block matrix. This paper proposes a method to
calculate the limit of the eigenvalue distribution of block matrices if the
size of the blocks tends to infinity. While it considers random matrices, it
takes an operator-valued free probability approach to achieve this goal. Using
this method, one derives a system of equations, which can be solved numerically
to compute the desired eigenvalue distribution. The paper initially tackles the
problem for square block matrices, then extends the solution to rectangular
block matrices. Finally, it deals with Wishart type block matrices. For two
special cases, the results of our approach are compared with results from
simulations. The first scenario investigates the limit eigenvalue distribution
of block Toeplitz matrices. The second scenario deals with the distribution of
Wishart type block matrices for a frequency selective slow-fading channel in a
MIMO system for two different cases of $n_R=n_T$ and $n_R=2n_T$. Using this
method, one may calculate the capacity and the Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise
Ratio in large MIMO systems.

 <dc:description>  The running maximum-minimum (max-min) filter computes the maxima and minima
over running windows of size w. This filter has numerous applications in signal
processing and time series analysis. We present an easy-to-implement online
algorithm requiring no more than 3 comparisons per element, in the worst case.
Comparatively, no algorithm is known to compute the running maximum (or
minimum) filter in 1.5 comparisons per element, in the worst case. Our
algorithm has reduced latency and memory usage.

 <dc:description>  MV3 is a new word based stream cipher for encrypting long streams of data. A
direct adaptation of a byte based cipher such as RC4 into a 32- or 64-bit word
version will obviously need vast amounts of memory. This scaling issue
necessitates a look for new components and principles, as well as mathematical
analysis to justify their use. Our approach, like RC4's, is based on rapidly
mixing random walks on directed graphs (that is, walks which reach a random
state quickly, from any starting point). We begin with some well understood
walks, and then introduce nonlinearity in their steps in order to improve
security and show long term statistical correlations are negligible. To
minimize the short term correlations, as well as to deter attacks using
equations involving successive outputs, we provide a method for sequencing the
outputs derived from the walk using three revolving buffers. The cipher is fast
-- it runs at a speed of less than 5 cycles per byte on a Pentium IV processor.
A word based cipher needs to output more bits per step, which exposes more
correlations for attacks. Moreover we seek simplicity of construction and
transparent analysis. To meet these requirements, we use a larger state and
claim security corresponding to only a fraction of it. Our design is for an
adequately secure word-based cipher; our very preliminary estimate puts the
security close to exhaustive search for keys of size &lt; 256 bits.

 <dc:title>The Mathematical Parallels Between Packet Switching and Information
  Transmission</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Tony T.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  All communication networks comprise of transmission systems and switching
systems, even though they are usually treated as two separate issues.
Communication channels are generally disturbed by noise from various sources.
In circuit switched networks, reliable communication requires the
error-tolerant transmission of bits over noisy channels. In packet switched
networks, however, not only can bits be corrupted with noise, but resources
along connection paths are also subject to contention. Thus, quality of service
(QoS) is determined by buffer delays and packet losses. The theme of this paper
is to show that transmission noise and packet contention actually have similar
characteristics and can be tamed by comparable means to achieve reliable
communication, and a number of analogies between switching and transmission are
identified. The sampling theorem of bandlimited signals provides the
cornerstone of digital communication and signal processing. Recently, the
Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition of traffic matrices has been widely applied
to packet switches. With respect to the complexity reduction of packet
switching, we show that the decomposition of a doubly stochastic traffic matrix
plays a similar role to that of the sampling theorem in digital transmission.
We conclude that packet switching systems are governed by mathematical laws
that are similar to those of digital transmission systems as envisioned by
Shannon in his seminal 1948 paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication.

 <dc:creator>Din, Mohab Safey El</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let f1, ..., fs be a polynomial family in Q[X1,..., Xn] (with s less than n)
of degree bounded by D. Suppose that f1, ..., fs generates a radical ideal, and
defines a smooth algebraic variety V. Consider a projection P. We prove that
the degree of the critical locus of P restricted to V is bounded by
D^s(D-1)^(n-s) times binomial of n and n-s. This result is obtained in two
steps. First the critical points of P restricted to V are characterized as
projections of the solutions of Lagrange's system for which a bi-homogeneous
structure is exhibited. Secondly we prove a bi-homogeneous B\'ezout Theorem,
which bounds the sum of the degrees of the equidimensional components of the
radical of an ideal generated by a bi-homogeneous polynomial family. This
result is improved when f1,..., fs is a regular sequence. Moreover, we use
Lagrange's system to design an algorithm computing at least one point in each
connected component of a smooth real algebraic set. This algorithm generalizes,
to the non equidimensional case, the one of Safey El Din and Schost. The
evaluation of the output size of this algorithm gives new upper bounds on the
first Betti number of a smooth real algebraic set. Finally, we estimate its
arithmetic complexity and prove that in the worst cases it is polynomial in n,
s, D^s(D-1)^(n-s) and the binomial of n and n-s, and the complexity of
evaluation of f1,..., fs.

 <dc:title>Finite-Dimensional Bounds on Zm and Binary LDPC Codes with Belief
  Propagation Decoders</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Chih-Chun</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on finite-dimensional upper and lower bounds on decodable
thresholds of Zm and binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, assuming
belief propagation decoding on memoryless channels. A concrete framework is
presented, admitting systematic searches for new bounds. Two noise measures are
considered: the Bhattacharyya noise parameter and the soft bit value for a
maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder on the uncoded channel. For Zm
LDPC codes, an iterative m-dimensional bound is derived for
m-ary-input/symmetric-output channels, which gives a sufficient stability
condition for Zm LDPC codes and is complemented by a matched necessary
stability condition introduced herein. Applications to coded modulation and to
codes with non-equiprobable distributed codewords are also discussed.
  For binary codes, two new lower bounds are provided for symmetric channels,
including a two-dimensional iterative bound and a one-dimensional non-iterative
bound, the latter of which is the best known bound that is tight for binary
symmetric channels (BSCs), and is a strict improvement over the bound derived
by the channel degradation argument. By adopting the reverse channel
perspective, upper and lower bounds on the decodable Bhattacharyya noise
parameter are derived for non-symmetric channels, which coincides with the
existing bound for symmetric channels.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we describe a general method for constructing the posterior
distribution of an option price. Our framework takes as inputs the prior
distributions of the parameters of the stochastic process followed by the
underlying, as well as the likelihood function implied by the observed price
history for the underlying. Our work extends that of Karolyi (1993) and
Darsinos and Satchell (2001), but with the crucial difference that the
likelihood function we use for inference is that which is directly implied by
the underlying, rather than imposed in an ad hoc manner via the introduction of
a function representing &quot;measurement error.&quot; As such, an important problem
still relevant for our method is that of model risk, and we address this issue
by describing how to perform a Bayesian averaging of parameter inferences based
on the different models considered using our framework.

 <dc:description>  We propose to use Tarski's least fixpoint theorem as a basis to define
recursive functions in the calculus of inductive constructions. This widens the
class of functions that can be modeled in type-theory based theorem proving
tool to potentially non-terminating functions. This is only possible if we
extend the logical framework by adding the axioms that correspond to classical

terminating and non-terminating computations and we show that common facilities
of the calculus of inductive construction, like program extraction can be
extended to also handle the new functions.

 <dc:title>Constructing experimental indicators for Open Access documents</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mayr, Philipp</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The ongoing paradigm change in the scholarly publication system ('science is
turning to e-science') makes it necessary to construct alternative evaluation
criteria/metrics which appropriately take into account the unique
characteristics of electronic publications and other research output in digital
formats. Today, major parts of scholarly Open Access (OA) publications and the
self-archiving area are not well covered in the traditional citation and
indexing databases. The growing share and importance of freely accessible
research output demands new approaches/metrics for measuring and for evaluating
of these new types of scientific publications. In this paper we propose a
simple quantitative method which establishes indicators by measuring the
access/download pattern of OA documents and other web entities of a single web
server. The experimental indicators (search engine, backlink and direct access
indicator) are constructed based on standard local web usage data. This new
type of web-based indicator is developed to model the specific demand for
better study/evaluation of the accessibility, visibility and interlinking of
open accessible documents. We conclude that e-science will need new stable
e-indicators.

 <dc:description>  We study properties of rank metric and codes in rank metric over finite
fields. We show that in rank metric perfect codes do not exist. We derive an
existence bound that is the equivalent of the Gilbert--Varshamov bound in
Hamming metric. We study the asymptotic behavior of the minimum rank distance
of codes satisfying GV. We derive the probability distribution of minimum rank
distance for random and random $\F{q}$-linear codes. We give an asymptotic
equivalent of their average minimum rank distance and show that random
$\F{q}$-linear codes are on GV bound for rank metric.
  We show that the covering density of optimum codes whose codewords can be
seen as square matrices is lower bounded by a function depending only on the
error-correcting capability of the codes. We show that there are quasi-perfect
codes in rank metric over fields of characteristic 2.

 <dc:description>  The methodology of context-sensitive access to e-documents considers context
as a problem model based on the knowledge extracted from the application
domain, and presented in the form of application ontology. Efficient access to
an information in the text form is needed. Wiki resources as a modern text
format provides huge number of text in a semi formalized structure. At the
first stage of the methodology, documents are indexed against the ontology
representing macro-situation. The indexing method uses a topic tree as a middle
layer between documents and the application ontology. At the second stage
documents relevant to the current situation (the abstract and operational
contexts) are identified and sorted by degree of relevance. Abstract context is
a problem-oriented ontology-based model. Operational context is an
instantiation of the abstract context with data provided by the information
sources. The following parts of the methodology are described: (i) metrics for
measuring similarity of e-documents to ontology, (ii) a document index storing
results of indexing of e-documents against the ontology; (iii) a method for
identification of relevant e-documents based on semantic similarity measures.
Wikipedia (wiki resource) is used as a corpus of e-documents for approach
evaluation in a case study. Text categorization, the presence of metadata, and
an existence of a lot of articles related to different topics characterize the
corpus.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a global method for estimating the motion of a
camera which films a static scene. Our approach is direct, fast and robust, and
deals with adjacent frames of a sequence. It is based on a quadratic
approximation of the deformation between two images, in the case of a scene
with constant depth in the camera coordinate system. This condition is very
restrictive but we show that provided translation and depth inverse variations
are small enough, the error on optical flow involved by the approximation of
depths by a constant is small. In this context, we propose a new model of
camera motion, that allows to separate the image deformation in a similarity
and a ``purely'' projective application, due to change of optical axis
direction. This model leads to a quadratic approximation of image deformation
that we estimate with an M-estimator; we can immediatly deduce camera motion
parameters.

 <dc:description>  The opening book is an important component of a chess engine, and thus
computer chess programmers have been developing automated methods to improve
the quality of their books. For chess, which has a very rich opening theory,
large databases of high-quality games can be used as the basis of an opening
book, from which statistics relating to move choices from given positions can
be collected. In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern
chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are ``comparable'' to
those used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out
analysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books one
compiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games. Our analysis
using several nonparametric measures, shows that, overall, there is a strong
association between humans' and machines' choices of opening moves when using a
book to guide their choices.

 <dc:title>The Delay-Limited Capacity Region of OFDM Broadcast Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wunder, Gerhard</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Michel, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, the delay limited capacity (DLC) of orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is investigated. The analysis is organized
into two parts. In the first part, the impact of system parameters on the OFDM
DLC is analyzed in a general setting. The main results are that under weak
assumptions the maximum achievable single user DLC is almost independent of the
distribution of the path attenuations in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region
but depends strongly on the delay spread. In the high SNR region the roles are
exchanged. Here, the impact of delay spread is negligible while the impact of
the distribution becomes dominant. The relevant asymptotic quantities are
derived without employing simplifying assumptions on the OFDM correlation
structure. Moreover, for both cases it is shown that the DLC is maximized if
the total channel energy is uniformly spread, i.e. the power delay profile is
uniform. It is worth pointing out that since universal bounds are obtained the
results can also be used for other classes of parallel channels with block
fading characteristic. The second part extends the setting to the broadcast
channel and studies the corresponding OFDM DLC BC region. An algorithm for
computing the OFDM BC DLC region is presented. To derive simple but smart
resource allocation strategies, the principle of rate water-filling employing
order statistics is introduced. This yields analytical lower bounds on the OFDM
DLC region based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and
ordinal channel state information (CSI). Finally, the schemes are compared to
an algorithm using full CSI.

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the foundations of the Calculus of Algebraic
Constructions (CAC), an extension of the Calculus of Constructions by inductive
data types. CAC generalizes inductive types equipped with higher-order
primitive recursion, by providing definitions of functions by pattern-matching
which capture recursor definitions for arbitrary non-dependent and
non-polymorphic inductive types satisfying a strictly positivity condition. CAC
also generalizes the first-order framework of abstract data types by providing
dependent types and higher-order rewrite rules.

 <dc:title>Termination and Confluence of Higher-Order Rewrite Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blanqui, Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the last twenty years, several approaches to higher-order rewriting have
been proposed, among which Klop's Combinatory Rewrite Systems (CRSs), Nipkow's
Higher-order Rewrite Systems (HRSs) and Jouannaud and Okada's higher-order
algebraic specification languages, of which only the last one considers typed
terms. The later approach has been extended by Jouannaud, Okada and the present
author into Inductive Data Type Systems (IDTSs). In this paper, we extend IDTSs
with the CRS higher-order pattern-matching mechanism, resulting in simply-typed
CRSs. Then, we show how the termination criterion developed for IDTSs with
first-order pattern-matching, called the General Schema, can be extended so as
to prove the strong normalization of IDTSs with higher-order pattern-matching.
Next, we compare the unified approach with HRSs. We first prove that the
extended General Schema can also be applied to HRSs. Second, we show how
Nipkow's higher-order critical pair analysis technique for proving local
confluence can be applied to IDTSs.

 <dc:description>  The main novelty of this paper is to consider an extension of the Calculus of

rules. We prove the strong normalization of the reduction relation generated by
the beta-rule and the user-defined rules under some general syntactic
conditions including confluence. As examples, we show that two important

Constructions which is the basis of the proof assistant Coq, and the Natural
Deduction Modulo a large class of equational theories.

 <dc:description>  In a previous work (&quot;Abstract Data Type Systems&quot;, TCS 173(2), 1997), the last
two authors presented a combined language made of a (strongly normalizing)
algebraic rewrite system and a typed lambda-calculus enriched by
pattern-matching definitions following a certain format, called the &quot;General
Schema&quot;, which generalizes the usual recursor definitions for natural numbers
and similar &quot;basic inductive types&quot;. This combined language was shown to be
strongly normalizing. The purpose of this paper is to reformulate and extend
the General Schema in order to make it easily extensible, to capture a more
general class of inductive types, called &quot;strictly positive&quot;, and to ease the
strong normalization proof of the resulting system. This result provides a
computation model for the combination of an algebraic specification language
based on abstract data types and of a strongly typed functional language with
strictly positive inductive types.

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Logic</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) we argue that the structure of
commonsense knowledge must be discovered, rather than invented; and (ii) we
argue that natural language, which is the best known theory of our (shared)
commonsense knowledge, should itself be used as a guide to discovering the
structure of commonsense knowledge. In addition to suggesting a systematic
method to the discovery of the structure of commonsense knowledge, the method
we propose seems to also provide an explanation for a number of phenomena in
natural language, such as metaphor, intensionality, and the semantics of
nominal compounds. Admittedly, our ultimate goal is quite ambitious, and it is
no less than the systematic 'discovery' of a well-typed ontology of commonsense
knowledge, and the subsequent formulation of the long-awaited goal of a meaning
algebra.

 <dc:description>  A protocol-independent secrecy theorem is established and applied to several
non-trivial protocols. In particular, it is applied to protocols proposed for
protecting the computation results of free-roaming mobile agents doing
comparison shopping. All the results presented here have been formally proved
in Isabelle by building on Larry Paulson's inductive approach. This therefore
provides a library of general theorems that can be applied to other protocols.

Constructions with functions and predicates defined by higher-order rewrite
rules. In this paper, we not only prove that CIC as a whole can be seen as a
CAC, but also that it can be extended with non-free constructors,
pattern-matching on defined symbols, non-strictly positive types and
inductive-recursive types.

 <dc:title>Rewriting modulo in Deduction modulo</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blanqui, Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the termination of rewriting modulo a set of equations in the
Calculus of Algebraic Constructions, an extension of the Calculus of
Constructions with functions and predicates defined by higher-order rewrite
rules. In a previous work, we defined general syntactic conditions based on the
notion of computable closure for ensuring the termination of the combination of
rewriting and beta-reduction. Here, we show that this result is preserved when
considering rewriting modulo a set of equations if the equivalence classes
generated by these equations are finite, the equations are linear and satisfy
general syntactic conditions also based on the notion of computable closure.
This includes equations like associativity and commutativity, and provides an
original treatment of termination modulo equations.

 <dc:title>Definitions by rewriting in the Calculus of Constructions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blanqui, Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents general syntactic conditions ensuring the strong
normalization and the logical consistency of the Calculus of Algebraic
Constructions, an extension of the Calculus of Constructions with functions and
predicates defined by higher-order rewrite rules. On the one hand, the Calculus
of Constructions is a powerful type system in which one can formalize the
propositions and natural deduction proofs of higher-order logic. On the other
hand, rewriting is a simple and powerful computation paradigm. The combination
of both allows, among other things, to develop formal proofs with a reduced
size and more automation compared with more traditional proof assistants. The
main novelty is to consider a general form of rewriting at the predicate-level
which generalizes the strong elimination of the Calculus of Inductive
Constructions.

 <dc:description>  Interleaved Reed-Solomon codes are applied in numerous data processing, data
transmission, and data storage systems. They are generated by interleaving
several codewords of ordinary Reed-Solomon codes. Usually, these codewords are
decoded independently by classical algebraic decoding methods. However, by
collaborative algebraic decoding approaches, such interleaved schemes allow the
correction of error patterns beyond half the minimum distance, provided that
the errors in the received signal occur in bursts. In this work, collaborative
decoding of interleaved Reed-Solomon codes by multi-sequence shift-register
synthesis is considered and analyzed. Based on the framework of interleaved
Reed-Solomon codes, concatenated code designs are investigated, which are
obtained by interleaving several Reed-Solomon codes, and concatenating them
with an inner block code.

 <dc:description>  The greatest challenge in maximizing the use of gene expression data is to
develop new computational tools capable of interconnecting and interpreting the
results from different organisms and experimental settings. We propose an
integrative and comprehensive approach including a super-chip containing data
from microarray experiments collected on different species subjected to hypoxic
and anoxic stress. A data mining technology called Peano count tree (P-trees)
is used to represent genomic data in multidimensions. Each microarray spot is
presented as a pixel with its corresponding red/green intensity feature bands.
Each bad is stored separately in a reorganized 8-separate (bSQ) file format.
Each bSQ is converted to a quadrant base tree structure (P-tree) from which a
superchip is represented as expression P-trees (EP-trees) and repression
P-trees (RP-trees). The use of association rule mining is proposed to derived
to meanigingfully organize signal transduction pathways taking in consideration
evolutionary considerations. We argue that the genetic constitution of an
organism (K) can be represented by the total number of genes belonging to two
groups. The group X constitutes genes (X1,Xn) and they can be represented as 1
or 0 depending on whether the gene was expressed or not. The second group of Y
genes (Y1,Yn) is expressed at different levels. These genes have a very high
repression, high expression, very repressed or highly repressed. However, many
genes of the group Y are specie specific and modulated by the products and
combinations of genes of the group X. In this paper, we introduce the dSQ and
P-tree technology; the biological implications of association rule mining using
X and Y gene groups and some advances in the integration of this information
using the BRAIN architecture.

 <dc:title>MIMO Broadcast Channels with Block Diagonalization and Finite Rate
  Feedback</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>H.1.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Block diagonalization is a linear precoding technique for the multiple
antenna broadcast (downlink) channel that involves transmission of multiple
data streams to each receiver such that no multi-user interference is
experienced at any of the receivers. This low-complexity scheme operates only a
few dB away from capacity but does require very accurate channel knowledge at
the transmitter, which can be very difficult to obtain in fading scenarios. We
consider a limited feedback system where each receiver knows its channel
perfectly, but the transmitter is only provided with a finite number of channel
feedback bits from each receiver. Using a random vector quantization argument,
we quantify the throughput loss due to imperfect channel knowledge as a
function of the feedback level. The quality of channel knowledge must improve
proportional to the SNR in order to prevent interference-limitations, and we
show that scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the system SNR is
sufficient to maintain a bounded rate loss. Finally, we investigate a simple
scalar quantization scheme that is seen to achieve the same scaling behavior as
vector quantization.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces Prawn, a tool for prototyping communication protocols
over IEEE 802.11 networks. Prawn allows researchers to conduct both functional
assessment and performance evaluation as an inherent part of the protocol
design process. Since Prawn runs on real IEEE 802.11 nodes, prototypes can be
evaluated and adjusted under realistic conditions. Once the prototype has been
extensively tested and thoroughly validated, and its functional design tuned
accordingly, it is then ready for implementation. Prawn facilitates prototype
development by providing: (i) a set of building blocks that implement common
functions needed by a wide range of wireless protocols (e.g., neighbor
discovery, link quality assessment, message transmission and reception), and
(ii) an API that allows protocol designers to access Prawn primitives. We show
through a number of case studies how Prawn supports prototyping as part of
protocol design and, as a result of enabling deployment and testing under
real-world scenarios, how Prawn provides useful feedback on protocol operation
and performance.

Based on the enhanced lemma, a sufficient and necessary condition for

 <dc:description>  The empty set of course contains no computable point. On the other hand,
surprising results due to Zaslavskii, Tseitin, Kreisel, and Lacombe assert the
existence of NON-empty co-r.e. closed sets devoid of computable points: sets
which are `large' in the sense of positive Lebesgue measure. We observe that a
certain size is in fact necessary: every non-empty co-r.e. closed real set
without computable points has continuum cardinality.
  This leads us to investigate for various classes of computable real subsets
whether they necessarily contain a (not necessarily effectively findable)
computable point.

practically is impracticable because requires transfer of the significant

 <dc:description>  A common approach to overcome the limited nature of sensor networks is to
aggregate data at intermediate nodes. A challenging issue in this context is to
guarantee end-to-end security mainly because sensor networks are extremely
vulnerable to node compromises. In order to secure data aggregation, in this
paper we propose three schemes that rely on multipath routing. The first one
guarantees data confidentiality through secret sharing, while the second and
third ones provide data availability through information dispersal. Based on
qualitative analysis and implementation, we show that, by applying these
schemes, a sensor network can achieve data confidentiality, authenticity, and
protection against denial of service attacks even in the presence of multiple
compromised nodes.

 <dc:description>  Intuitively, an (implementation) automata is simulated by a (specification)
automata if every externally observable transition by the implementation
automata can also be made by the specification automata. In this work, we
present a symbolic algorithm for the simulation-checking of timed automatas. We
first present a simulation-checking procedure that operates on state spaces,
representable with convex polyhedra, of timed automatas. We then present
techniques to represent those intermediate result convex polyhedra with zones
and make the procedure an algorithm. We then discuss how to handle Zeno states
in the implementation automata. Finally, we have endeavored to realize the
algorithm and report the performance of our algorithm in the experiment.

 <dc:description>  We show that several problems that figure prominently in quantum computing,
including Hidden Coset, Hidden Shift, and Orbit Coset, are equivalent or

over permutation groups, the decision version and search version of Hidden
Subgroup are polynomial-time equivalent. For Hidden Subgroup over dihedral
groups, such an equivalence can be obtained if the order of the group is
smooth. Finally, we give nonadaptive program checkers for Hidden Subgroup and

 <dc:description>  We introduce an application of a mobile transient network architecture on top
of the current Internet. This paper is an application extension to a conceptual
mobile network architecture. It attempts to specifically reinforce some of the
powerful notions exposed by the architecture from an application perspective.
Of these notions, we explore the network expansion layer, an overlay of
components and services, that enables a persistent identification network and
other required services. The overlay abstraction introduces several benefits of
which mobility and communication across heterogenous network structures are of
interest to this paper. We present implementations of several components and
protocols including gateways, Agents and the Open Device Access Protocol. Our
present identification network implementation exploits the current
implementation of the Handle System through the use of distributed, global and
persistent identifiers called handles. Handles are used to identify and locate
devices and services abstracting any physical location or network association
from the communicating ends. A communication framework is finally demonstrated
that would allow for mobile devices on the public Internet to have persistent
identifiers and thus be persistently accessible either directly or indirectly.
This application expands IP inter-operability beyond its current boundaries.

 <dc:title>Reversible Logic to Cryptographic Hardware: A New Paradigm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thapliyal, Himanshu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zwolinski, Mark</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Differential Power Analysis (DPA) presents a major challenge to
mathematically-secure cryptographic protocols. Attackers can break the
encryption by measuring the energy consumed in the working digital circuit. To
prevent this type of attack, this paper proposes the use of reversible logic
for designing the ALU of a cryptosystem. Ideally, reversible circuits dissipate
zero energy. Thus, it would be of great significance to apply reversible logic
to designing secure cryptosystems. As far as is known, this is the first
attempt to apply reversible logic to developing secure cryptosystems. In a
prototype of a reversible ALU for a crypto-processor, reversible designs of
adders and Montgomery multipliers are presented. The reversible designs of a
carry propagate adder, four-to-two and five-to-two carry save adders are
presented using a reversible TSG gate. One of the important properties of the
TSG gate is that it can work singly as a reversible full adder. In order to
design the reversible Montgomery multiplier, novel reversible sequential
circuits are also proposed which are integrated with the proposed adders to
design a reversible modulo multiplier. It is intended that this paper will
provide a starting point for developing cryptosystems secure against DPA
attacks.

 <dc:title>Combined Integer and Floating Point Multiplication Architecture(CIFM)
  for FPGAs and Its Reversible Logic Implementation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the authors propose the idea of a combined integer and
floating point multiplier(CIFM) for FPGAs. The authors propose the replacement
of existing 18x18 dedicated multipliers in FPGAs with dedicated 24x24
multipliers designed with small 4x4 bit multipliers. It is also proposed that
for every dedicated 24x24 bit multiplier block designed with 4x4 bit
multipliers, four redundant 4x4 multiplier should be provided to enforce the
feature of self repairability (to recover from the faults). In the proposed
CIFM reconfigurability at run time is also provided resulting in low power. The
major source of motivation for providing the dedicated 24x24 bit multiplier
stems from the fact that single precision floating point multiplier requires
24x24 bit integer multiplier for mantissa multiplication. A reconfigurable,
self-repairable 24x24 bit multiplier (implemented with 4x4 bit multiply
modules) will ideally suit this purpose, making FPGAs more suitable for integer
as well floating point operations. A dedicated 4x4 bit multiplier is also
proposed in this paper. Moreover, in the recent years, reversible logic has
emerged as a promising technology having its applications in low power CMOS,
quantum computing, nanotechnology, and optical computing. It is not possible to
realize quantum computing without reversible logic. Thus, this paper also paper
provides the reversible logic implementation of the proposed CIFM. The
reversible CIFM designed and proposed here will form the basis of the
completely reversible FPGAs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We give some semantic results for an epistemic logic incorporating dynamic
operators to describe information changing events. Such events include
epistemic changes, where agents become more informed about the non-changing
state of the world, and ontic changes, wherein the world changes. The events
are executed in information states that are modeled as pointed Kripke models.
Our contribution consists of three semantic results. (i) Given two information
states, there is an event transforming one into the other. The linguistic
correspondent to this is that every consistent formula can be made true in
every information state by the execution of an event. (ii) A more technical
result is that: every event corresponds to an event in which the postconditions
formalizing ontic change are assignments to `true' and `false' only (instead of
assignments to arbitrary formulas in the logical language). `Corresponds' means
that execution of either event in a given information state results in
bisimilar information states. (iii) The third, also technical, result is that
every event corresponds to a sequence of events wherein all postconditions are
assignments of a single atom only (instead of simultaneous assignments of more
than one atom).

 <dc:title>Migrating Multi-page Web Applications to Single-page AJAX Interfaces</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mesbah, Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>van Deursen, Arie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, a new web development technique for creating interactive web
applications, dubbed AJAX, has emerged. In this new model, the single-page web
interface is composed of individual components which can be updated/replaced
independently. With the rise of AJAX web applications classical multi-page web
applications are becoming legacy systems. If until a year ago, the concern
revolved around migrating legacy systems to web-based settings, today we have a
new challenge of migrating web applications to single-page AJAX applications.
Gaining an understanding of the navigational model and user interface structure
of the source application is the first step in the migration process. In this
paper, we explore how reverse engineering techniques can help analyze classic
web applications for this purpose. Our approach, using a schema-based
clustering technique, extracts a navigational model of web applications, and
identifies candidate user interface components to be migrated to a single-page
AJAX interface. Additionally, results of a case study, conducted to evaluate
our tool, are presented.

 <dc:title>Partial Evaluation for Program Comprehension</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blazy, Sandrine</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Program comprehension is the most tedious and time consuming task of software
maintenance, an important phase of the software life cycle. This is
particularly true while maintaining scientific application programs that have
been written in Fortran for decades and that are still vital in various domains
even though more modern languages are used to implement their user interfaces.
Very often, programs have evolved as their application domains increase
continually and have become very complex due to extensive modifications. This
generality in programs is implemented by input variables whose value does not
vary in the context of a given application. Thus, it is very interesting for
the maintainer to propagate such information, that is to obtain a simplified
program, which behaves like the initial one when used according to the
restriction. We have adapted partial evaluation for program comprehension. Our
partial evaluator performs mainly two tasks: constant propagation and
statements simplification. It includes an interprocedural alias analysis. As
our aim is program comprehension rather than optimization, there are two main
differences with classical partial evaluation. We do not change the original

 <dc:description>  This paper describes an approach for reusing specification patterns.
Specification patterns are design patterns that are expressed in a formal
specification language. Reusing a specification pattern means instantiating it
or composing it with other specification patterns. Three levels of composition
are defined: juxtaposition, composition with inter-patterns links and
unification. This paper shows through examples how to define specification
patterns in B, how to reuse them directly in B, and also how to reuse the
proofs associated with specification patterns.

 <dc:description>  We show how solution concepts in games such as Nash equilibrium, correlated
equilibrium, rationalizability, and sequential equilibrium can be given a
uniform definition in terms of \emph{knowledge-based programs}. Intuitively,
all solution concepts are implementations of two knowledge-based programs, one
appropriate for games represented in normal form, the other for games
represented in extensive form. These knowledge-based programs can be viewed as
embodying rationality. The representation works even if (a) information sets do
not capture an agent's knowledge, (b) uncertainty is not represented by
probability, or (c) the underlying game is not common knowledge.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study properties of rank metric codes in general and
maximum rank distance (MRD) codes in particular. For codes with the rank
metric, we first establish Gilbert and sphere-packing bounds, and then obtain
the asymptotic forms of these two bounds and the Singleton bound. Based on the
asymptotic bounds, we observe that asymptotically Gilbert-Varsharmov bound is
exceeded by MRD codes and sphere-packing bound cannot be attained. We also
establish bounds on the rank covering radius of maximal codes, and show that
all MRD codes are maximal codes and all the MRD codes known so far achieve the
maximum rank covering radius.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a new architecture for transient mobile networks
destined to merge existing and future network architectures, communication
implementations and protocol operations by introducing a new paradigm to data
delivery and identification. The main goal of our research is to enable
seamless end-to-end communication between mobile and stationary devices across
multiple networks and through multiple communication environments. The
architecture establishes a set of infrastructure components and protocols that
set the ground for a Persistent Identification Network (PIN). The basis for the
operation of PIN is an identification space consisting of unique location
independent identifiers similar to the ones implemented in the Handle system.
Persistent Identifiers are used to identify and locate Digital Entities which
can include devices, services, users and even traffic. The architecture
establishes a primary connection independent logical structure that can operate
over conventional networks or more advanced peer-to-peer aggregation networks.
Communication is based on routing pools and novel protocols for routing data
across several abstraction levels of the network, regardless of the end-points'
current association and state...

 <dc:title>On the Secrecy Capacity of Fading Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the secure transmission of information over an ergodic fading
channel in the presence of an eavesdropper. Our eavesdropper can be viewed as
the wireless counterpart of Wyner's wiretapper. The secrecy capacity of such a
system is characterized under the assumption of asymptotically long coherence
intervals. We first consider the full Channel State Information (CSI) case,
where the transmitter has access to the channel gains of the legitimate
receiver and the eavesdropper. The secrecy capacity under this full CSI
assumption serves as an upper bound for the secrecy capacity when only the CSI
of the legitimate receiver is known at the transmitter, which is characterized
next. In each scenario, the perfect secrecy capacity is obtained along with the
optimal power and rate allocation strategies. We then propose a low-complexity
on/off power allocation strategy that achieves near-optimal performance with
only the main channel CSI. More specifically, this scheme is shown to be
asymptotically optimal as the average SNR goes to infinity, and interestingly,
is shown to attain the secrecy capacity under the full CSI assumption.
Remarkably, our results reveal the positive impact of fading on the secrecy
capacity and establish the critical role of rate adaptation, based on the main
channel CSI, in facilitating secure communications over slow fading channels.

 <dc:description>  A cross-layer optimization approach is adopted for the design of symmetric
random access wireless systems. Instead of the traditional collision model, a
more realistic physical layer model is considered. Based on this model, an
Incremental Redundancy Automatic Repeat reQuest (IR-ARQ) scheme, tailored to
jointly combat the effects of collisions, multi-path fading, and additive
noise, is developed. The Diversity-Multiplexing-Delay tradeoff (DMDT) of the
proposed scheme is analyzed for fully-loaded queues, and compared with that of
Gallager tree algorithm for collision resolution and the network-assisted
diversity multiple access (NDMA) protocol of Tsatsanis et al.. The fully-loaded
queue model is then replaced by one with random arrivals, under which these
protocols are compared in terms of the stability region, average delay and
diversity gain. Overall, our analytical and numerical results establish the
superiority of the proposed IR-ARQ scheme and reveal some important insights.
For example, it turns out that the performance is optimized, for a given total
throughput, by maximizing the probability that a certain user sends a new
packet and minimizing the transmission rate employed by each user.

 <dc:description>  We present a new class of statistical de-anonymization attacks against
high-dimensional micro-data, such as individual preferences, recommendations,
transaction records and so on. Our techniques are robust to perturbation in the
data and tolerate some mistakes in the adversary's background knowledge.
  We apply our de-anonymization methodology to the Netflix Prize dataset, which
contains anonymous movie ratings of 500,000 subscribers of Netflix, the world's
largest online movie rental service. We demonstrate that an adversary who knows
only a little bit about an individual subscriber can easily identify this
subscriber's record in the dataset. Using the Internet Movie Database as the
source of background knowledge, we successfully identified the Netflix records
of known users, uncovering their apparent political preferences and other
potentially sensitive information.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the discrete memoryless interference channel with
common information, in which two senders need deliver not only private messages
but also certain common messages to their corresponding receivers. We derive an
achievable rate region for such a channel by exploiting a random coding
strategy, namely cascaded superposition coding. We reveal that the derived
achievable rate region generalizes some important existing results for the
interference channels with or without common information. Furthermore, we
specialize to a class of deterministic interference channels with common
information, and show that the derived achievable rate region is indeed the
capacity region for this class of channels.

 <dc:description>  The Doppler spectrum estimation of a weather radar signal in a classic way
can be made by two methods, temporal one based in the autocorrelation of the
successful signals, whereas the other one uses the estimation of the power
spectral density PSD by using Fourier transforms. We introduces a new tool of
signal processing based on Ramanujan sums cq(n), adapted to the analysis of
arithmetical sequences with several resonances p/q. These sums are almost
periodic according to time n of resonances and aperiodic according to the order
q of resonances. New results will be supplied by the use of Ramanujan Fourier
Transform (RFT) for the estimation of the Doppler spectrum for the weather
radar signal.

 <dc:description>  We provide a framework to bound the probability that accumulated errors were
never above a given threshold on hybrid systems. Such systems are used for
example to model an aircraft or a nuclear power plant on one side and its
software on the other side. This report contains simple formulas based on
L\'evy's and Markov's inequalities and it presents a formal theory of random
variables with a special focus on producing concrete results. We selected four
very common applications that fit in our framework and cover the common
practices of hybrid systems that evolve for a long time. We compute the number
of bits that remain continuously significant in the first two applications with
a probability of failure around one against a billion, where worst case

 <dc:title>Local approximate inference algorithms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jung, Kyomin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new local approximation algorithm for computing Maximum a
Posteriori (MAP) and log-partition function for arbitrary exponential family
distribution represented by a finite-valued pair-wise Markov random field
(MRF), say $G$. Our algorithm is based on decomposition of $G$ into {\em
appropriately} chosen small components; then computing estimates locally in
each of these components and then producing a {\em good} global solution. We
show that if the underlying graph $G$ either excludes some finite-sized graph
as its minor (e.g. Planar graph) or has low doubling dimension (e.g. any graph
with {\em geometry}), then our algorithm will produce solution for both
questions within {\em arbitrary accuracy}. We present a message-passing
implementation of our algorithm for MAP computation using self-avoiding walk of
graph. In order to evaluate the computational cost of this implementation, we
derive novel tight bounds on the size of self-avoiding walk tree for arbitrary
graph.
  As a consequence of our algorithmic result, we show that the normalized
log-partition function (also known as free-energy) for a class of {\em regular}
MRFs will converge to a limit, that is computable to an arbitrary accuracy.

 <dc:description>  A general lossless joint source-channel coding scheme based on linear codes
is proposed and then analyzed in this paper. It is shown that a linear code
with good joint spectrum can be used to establish limit-approaching joint
source-channel coding schemes for arbitrary sources and channels, where the
joint spectrum of the code is a generalization of the input-output weight
distribution.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization (MOACO)
algorithm called CHAC, which has been designed to solve the problem of finding
the path on a map (corresponding to a simulated battlefield) that minimizes
resources while maximizing safety. CHAC has been tested with two different
state transition rules: an aggregative function that combines the heuristic and
pheromone information of both objectives and a second one that is based on the
dominance concept of multiobjective optimization problems. These rules have
been evaluated in several different situations (maps with different degree of
difficulty), and we have found that they yield better results than a greedy
algorithm (taken as baseline) in addition to a military behaviour that is also
better in the tactical sense. The aggregative function, in general, yields
better results than the one based on dominance.

 <dc:description>  Voltage peaks on a conventional computer's power lines allow for the
well-known dangerous DPA attacks. We show that measurement of a quantum
computer's transient state during a computational step reveals information
about a complete computation of arbitrary length, which can be extracted by
repeated probing, if the computer is suitably programmed. Instant computing, as
we name this mode of operation, recognizes for any total or partial recursive
function arguments lying in the domain of definition and yields their function
value with arbitrary small error probability in probabilistic linear time. This
implies recognition of (not necessarily recursively enumerable) complements of
recursively enumerable sets and the solution of the halting problem. Future
quantum computers are shown to be likely to allow for instant computing, and
some consequences are pointed out.

 <dc:description>  An achievable rate region for the Gaussian interference channel is derived
using Sato's modified frequency division multiplexing idea and a special case
of Han and Kobayashi's rate region (denoted by $\Gmat^\prime$). We show that
the new inner bound includes $\Gmat^\prime$, Sason's rate region $\Dmat$, as
well as the achievable region via TDM/FDM, as its subsets. The advantage of
this improved inner bound over $\Gmat^\prime$ arises due to its inherent
ability to utilize the whole transmit power range on the real line without
violating the power constraint. We also provide analysis to examine the
conditions for the new achievable region to strictly extend $\Gmat^\prime$.

 <dc:title>DepAnn - An Annotation Tool for Dependency Treebanks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kakkonen, Tuomo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  DepAnn is an interactive annotation tool for dependency treebanks, providing
both graphical and text-based annotation interfaces. The tool is aimed for
semi-automatic creation of treebanks. It aids the manual inspection and
correction of automatically created parses, making the annotation process
faster and less error-prone. A novel feature of the tool is that it enables the
user to view outputs from several parsers as the basis for creating the final
tree to be saved to the treebank. DepAnn uses TIGER-XML, an XML-based general
encoding format for both, representing the parser outputs and saving the
annotated treebank. The tool includes an automatic consistency checker for
sentence structures. In addition, the tool enables users to build structures
manually, add comments on the annotations, modify the tagsets, and mark
sentences for further revision.

 <dc:description>  In 1985, van den Dries showed that the theory of the reals with a predicate
for the integer powers of two admits quantifier elimination in an expanded
language, and is hence decidable. He gave a model-theoretic argument, which
provides no apparent bounds on the complexity of a decision procedure. We
provide a syntactic argument that yields a procedure that is primitive
recursive, although not elementary. In particular, we show that it is possible
to eliminate a single block of existential quantifiers in time $2^0_{O(n)}$,
where $n$ is the length of the input formula and $2_k^x$ denotes $k$-fold
iterated exponentiation.

 <dc:description>  Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a widely used Information Retrieval method
based on &quot;bag-of-words&quot; assumption. However, according to general conception,
syntax plays a role in representing meaning of sentences. Thus, enhancing LSA
with part-of-speech (POS) information to capture the context of word
occurrences appears to be theoretically feasible extension. The approach is
tested empirically on a automatic essay grading system using LSA for document
similarity comparisons. A comparison on several POS-enhanced LSA models is
reported. Our findings show that the addition of contextual information in the
form of POS tags can raise the accuracy of the LSA-based scoring models up to
10.77 per cent.

 <dc:title>Approximate Convex Optimization by Online Game Playing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hazan, Elad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Lagrangian relaxation and approximate optimization algorithms have received
much attention in the last two decades. Typically, the running time of these
methods to obtain a $\epsilon$ approximate solution is proportional to
$\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$. Recently, Bienstock and Iyengar, following Nesterov,
gave an algorithm for fractional packing linear programs which runs in
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ iterations. The latter algorithm requires to solve a
convex quadratic program every iteration - an optimization subroutine which
dominates the theoretical running time.
  We give an algorithm for convex programs with strictly convex constraints
which runs in time proportional to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$. The algorithm does NOT
require to solve any quadratic program, but uses gradient steps and elementary
operations only. Problems which have strictly convex constraints include
maximum entropy frequency estimation, portfolio optimization with loss risk
constraints, and various computational problems in signal processing.
  As a side product, we also obtain a simpler version of Bienstock and
Iyengar's result for general linear programming, with similar running time.
  We derive these algorithms using a new framework for deriving convex
optimization algorithms from online game playing algorithms, which may be of
independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Object-oriented programming languages such as Java and Objective C have
become popular for implementing agent-based and other object-based simulations
since objects in those languages can {\em reflect} (i.e. make runtime queries
of an object's structure). This allows, for example, a fairly trivial {\em
serialisation} routine (conversion of an object into a binary representation
that can be stored or passed over a network) to be written. However C++ does
not offer this ability, as type information is thrown away at compile time. Yet
C++ is often a preferred development environment, whether for performance
reasons or for its expressive features such as operator overloading.
  In scientific coding, changes to a model's codes takes place constantly, as
the model is refined, and different phenomena are studied. Yet traditionally,
facilities such as checkpointing, routines for initialising model parameters
and analysis of model output depend on the underlying model remaining static,
otherwise each time a model is modified, a whole slew of supporting routines
needs to be changed to reflect the new data structures. Reflection offers the
advantage of the simulation framework adapting to the underlying model without
programmer intervention, reducing the effort of modifying the model.
  In this paper, we present the {\em Classdesc} system which brings many of the
benefits of object reflection to C++, {\em ClassdescMP} which dramatically
simplifies coding of MPI based parallel programs and {\em
  Graphcode} a general purpose data parallel programming environment.

error-correcting codes that attain the Singleton bound of network
error-correcting codes. The proposed algorithm is based on the algorithm by
Jaggi et al. We give estimates on the time complexity and the required symbol
size of the proposed algorithm. We also estimate the probability of a random
choice of local encoding vectors by all intermediate nodes giving a network
error-correcting codes attaining the Singleton bound. We also clarify the
relationship between the robust network coding and the network error-correcting
codes with known locations of errors.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two sufficient conditions to ensure a faithful evaluation
of polynomial in IEEE-754 floating point arithmetic. Faithfulness means that
the computed value is one of the two floating point neighbours of the exact
result; it can be satisfied using a more accurate algorithm than the classic
Horner scheme. One condition here provided is an apriori bound of the
polynomial condition number derived from the error analysis of the compensated
Horner algorithm. The second condition is both dynamic and validated to check
at the running time the faithfulness of a given evaluation. Numerical
experiments illustrate the behavior of these two conditions and that associated
running time over-cost is really interesting.

 <dc:title>Proof Nets and the Identity of Proofs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Strassburger, Lutz</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  These are the notes for a 5-lecture-course given at ESSLLI 2006 in Malaga,
Spain. The URL of the school is http://esslli2006.lcc.uma.es/ . This version
slightly differs from the one which has been distributed at the school because
typos have been removed and comments and suggestions by students have been
worked in. The course is intended to be introductory. That means no prior
knowledge of proof nets is required. However, the student should be familiar
with the basics of propositional logic, and should have seen formal proofs in
some formal deductive system (e.g., sequent calculus, natural deduction,
resolution, tableaux, calculus of structures, Frege-Hilbert-systems, ...). It
is probably helpful if the student knows already what cut elimination is, but
this is not strictly necessary. In these notes, I will introduce the concept of
``proof nets'' from the viewpoint of the problem of the identity of proofs. I
will proceed in a rather informal way. The focus will be more on presenting
ideas than on presenting technical details. The goal of the course is to give
the student an overview of the theory of proof nets and make the vast amount of
literature on the topic easier accessible to the beginner. For introducing the
basic concepts of the theory, I will in the first part of the course stick to
the unit-free multiplicative fragment of linear logic because of its rather
simple notion of proof nets. In the second part of the course we will see proof
nets for more sophisticated logics. This is a basic introduction into proof
nets from the perspective of the identity of proofs. We discuss how deductive
proofs can be translated into proof nets and what a correctness criterion is.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In evolutionary algorithms, the fitness of a population increases with time
by mutating and recombining individuals and by a biased selection of more fit
individuals. The right selection pressure is critical in ensuring sufficient
optimization progress on the one hand and in preserving genetic diversity to be
able to escape from local optima on the other hand. Motivated by a universal
similarity relation on the individuals, we propose a new selection scheme,
which is uniform in the fitness values. It generates selection pressure toward
sparsely populated fitness regions, not necessarily toward higher fitness, as
is the case for all other selection schemes. We show analytically on a simple
example that the new selection scheme can be much more effective than standard
selection schemes. We also propose a new deletion scheme which achieves a
similar result via deletion and show how such a scheme preserves genetic
diversity more effectively than standard approaches. We compare the performance
of the new schemes to tournament selection and random deletion on an artificial
deceptive problem and a range of NP-hard problems: traveling salesman, set
covering and satisfiability.

 <dc:title>The intersection and the union of the asynchronous systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vlad, Serban E.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - General Literature</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The asynchronous systems $f$ are the models of the asynchronous circuits from
digital electrical engineering. They are multi-valued functions that associate
to each input $u:\mathbf{R}\to \{0,1\}^{m}$ a set of states $x\in f(u),$ where
$x:\mathbf{R}\to \{0,1\}^{n}.$ The intersection of the systems allows adding
supplementary conditions in modeling and the union of the systems allows
considering the validity of one of two systems in modeling, for example when
testing the asynchronous circuits and the circuit is supposed to be 'good' or
'bad'. The purpose of the paper is that of analyzing the intersection and the
union against the initial/final states, initial/final time, initial/final state
functions, subsystems, dual systems, inverse systems, Cartesian product of
systems, parallel connection and serial connection of systems.

 <dc:title>Hierarchical Bin Buffering: Online Local Moments for Dynamic External

 <dc:description>  Local moments are used for local regression, to compute statistical measures
such as sums, averages, and standard deviations, and to approximate probability
distributions. We consider the case where the data source is a very large I/O
array of size n and we want to compute the first N local moments, for some
constant N. Without precomputation, this requires O(n) time. We develop a
sequence of algorithms of increasing sophistication that use precomputation and
additional buffer space to speed up queries. The simpler algorithms partition
the I/O array into consecutive ranges called bins, and they are applicable not
only to local-moment queries, but also to algebraic queries (MAX, AVERAGE, SUM,
etc.). With N buffers of size sqrt{n}, time complexity drops to O(sqrt n). A
more sophisticated approach uses hierarchical buffering and has a logarithmic
time complexity (O(b log_b n)), when using N hierarchical buffers of size n/b.
Using Overlapped Bin Buffering, we show that only a single buffer is needed, as
with wavelet-based algorithms, but using much less storage. Applications exist
in multidimensional and statistical databases over massive data sets,
interactive image processing, and visualization.

 <dc:title>Community Detection in Complex Networks Using Agents</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Community structure identification has been one of the most popular research
areas in recent years due to its applicability to the wide scale of
disciplines. To detect communities in varied topics, there have been many
algorithms proposed so far. However, most of them still have some drawbacks to
be addressed. In this paper, we present an agent-based based community
detection algorithm. The algorithm that is a stochastic one makes use of agents
by forcing them to perform biased moves in a smart way. Using the information
collected by the traverses of these agents in the network, the network
structure is revealed. Also, the network modularity is used for determining the
number of communities. Our algorithm removes the need for prior knowledge about
the network such as number of the communities or any threshold values.
Furthermore, the definite community structure is provided as a result instead
of giving some structures requiring further processes. Besides, the
computational and time costs are optimized because of using thread like working
agents. The algorithm is tested on three network data of different types and
sizes named Zachary karate club, college football and political books. For all
three networks, the real network structures are identified in almost every run.

 <dc:title>On Bounds for $E$-capacity of DMC</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Haroutunian, Evgueni A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Random coding, expurgated and sphere packing bounds are derived by method of
types and method of graph decomposition for $E$-capacity of discrete memoryless
channel (DMC). Three decoding rules are considered, the random coding bound is
attainable by each of the three rules, but the expurgated bound is achievable
only by maximum-likelihood decoding. Sphere packing bound is obtained by very
simple combinatorial reasonings of the method of types. The paper joins and
reviews the results of previous hard achievable publications.

 <dc:description>  In this work we are interested in the problem of scheduling and
redistributing data on master-slave platforms. We consider the case were the
workers possess initial loads, some of which having to be redistributed in
order to balance their completion times. We examine two different scenarios.
The first model assumes that the data consists of independent and identical
tasks. We prove the NP-completeness in the strong sense for the general case,
and we present two optimal algorithms for special platform types. Furthermore
we propose three heuristics for the general case. Simulations consolidate the
theoretical results. The second data model is based on Divisible Load Theory.
This problem can be solved in polynomial time by a combination of linear
programming and simple analytical manipulations.

algorithm seems comparable to previously known algorithms achieving the same

 <dc:description>  With the success of P2P file sharing, new emerging P2P applications arise on
the Internet for streaming content like voice (VoIP) or live video (IPTV).
Nowadays, there are lots of works measuring P2P file sharing or P2P telephony
systems, but there is still no comprehensive study about P2P IPTV, whereas it
should be massively used in the future. During the last FIFA world cup, we
measured network traffic generated by P2P IPTV applications like PPlive,
PPstream, TVants and Sopcast. In this paper we analyze some of our results
during the same games for the applications. We focus on traffic statistics and
churn of peers within these P2P networks. Our objectives are threefold: we
point out the traffic generated to understand the impact they will have on the
network, we try to infer the mechanisms of such applications and highlight
differences, and we give some insights about the users' behavior.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a model for generating time series which exhibit the
statistical phenomenon known as long-range dependence (LRD). A Markov Modulated
Process based upon an infinite Markov chain is described. The work described is
motivated by applications in telecommunications where LRD is a known property
of time-series measured on the internet. The process can generate a time series
exhibiting LRD with known parameters and is particularly suitable for modelling
internet traffic since the time series is in terms of ones and zeros which can
be interpreted as data packets and inter-packet gaps. The method is extremely
simple computationally and analytically and could prove more tractable than
other methods described in the literature

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to use a very simple queuing model to compare a
number of models from the literature which have been used to replicate the
statistical nature of internet traffic and, in particular, the long-range
dependence of this traffic. The four models all have the form of discrete time
Markov-modulated processes (two other models are introduced for comparison
purposes).
  While it is often stated that long-range dependence has a critical effect on
queuing performance, it appears that the models used here do not well
replicated the queuing performance of real internet traffic. In particular,
they fail to replicate the mean queue length (and hence the mean delay) and the
probability of the queue length exceeding a given level.

 <dc:title>Bounds on the coefficients of the characteristic and minimal polynomials</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dumas, Jean-Guillaume</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This note presents absolute bounds on the size of the coefficients of the
characteristic and minimal polynomials depending on the size of the
coefficients of the associated matrix. Moreover, we present algorithms to
compute more precise input-dependant bounds on these coefficients. Such bounds
are e.g. useful to perform deterministic chinese remaindering of the
characteristic or minimal polynomial of an integer matrix.

 <dc:description>  The Software Transactional Memory (STM) model is an original approach for
controlling concurrent accesses to ressources without the need for explicit
lock-based synchronization mechanisms. A key feature of STM is to provide a way
to group sequences of read and write actions inside atomic blocks, similar to
database transactions, whose whole effect should occur atomically. In this
paper, we investigate STM from a process algebra perspective and define an
extension of asynchronous CCS with atomic blocks of actions. Our goal is not
only to set a formal ground for reasoning on STM implementations but also to
understand how this model fits with other concurrency control mechanisms. We
also view this calculus as a test bed for extending process calculi with atomic
transactions. This is an interesting direction for investigation since, for the
most part, actual works that mix transactions with process calculi consider
compensating transactions, a model that lacks all the well-known ACID
properties. We show that the addition of atomic transactions results in a very
expressive calculus, enough to easily encode other concurrent primitives such
as guarded choice and multiset-synchronization (\`{a} la join-calculus). The
correctness of our encodings is proved using a suitable notion of bisimulation
equivalence. The equivalence is then applied to prove interesting ``laws of
transactions'' and to obtain a simple normal form for transactions.

 <dc:title>Why block length and delay behave differently if feedback is present</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sahai, Anant</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For output-symmetric DMCs at even moderately high rates, fixed-block-length
communication systems show no improvements in their error exponents with
feedback. In this paper, we study systems with fixed end-to-end delay and show
that feedback generally provides dramatic gains in the error exponents.
  A new upper bound (the uncertainty-focusing bound) is given on the
probability of symbol error in a fixed-delay communication system with
feedback. This bound turns out to have a similar form to Viterbi's bound used
for the block error probability of convolutional codes as a function of the
fixed constraint length. The uncertainty-focusing bound is shown to be
asymptotically achievable with noiseless feedback for erasure channels as well
as any output-symmetric DMC that has strictly positive zero-error capacity.
Furthermore, it can be achieved in a delay-universal (anytime) fashion even if
the feedback itself is delayed by a small amount. Finally, it is shown that for
end-to-end delay, it is generally possible at high rates to beat the
sphere-packing bound for general DMCs -- thereby providing a counterexample to
a conjecture of Pinsker.

 <dc:title>How to beat the sphere-packing bound with feedback</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sahai, Anant</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The sphere-packing bound $E_{sp}(R)$ bounds the reliability function for
fixed-length block-codes. For symmetric channels, it remains a valid bound even
when strictly causal noiseless feedback is allowed from the decoder to the
encoder. To beat the bound, the problem must be changed. While it has long been
known that variable-length block codes can do better when trading-off error
probability with expected block-length, this correspondence shows that the {\em
fixed-delay} setting also presents such an opportunity for generic channels.
  While $E_{sp}(R)$ continues to bound the tradeoff between bit error and fixed
end-to-end latency for symmetric channels used {\em without} feedback, a new
bound called the ``focusing bound'' gives the limits on what can be done with
feedback. If low-rate reliable flow-control is free (ie. the noisy channel has
strictly positive zero-error capacity), then the focusing bound can be
asymptotically achieved. Even when the channel has no zero-error capacity, it
is possible to substantially beat the sphere-packing bound by synthesizing an
appropriately reliable channel to carry the flow-control information.

 <dc:description>  When designing a distributed control system, the system designer has a choice
in how to connect the different units through communication channels. In
practice, noiseless and noisy channels may coexist. Using the standard toy
example of scalar stabilization, this paper shows how a small amount of
noiseless feedback can perform a ``supervisory'' role and thereby boost the

 <dc:title>Source coding and channel requirements for unstable processes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sahai, Anant</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mitter, Sanjoy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Our understanding of information in systems has been based on the foundation
of memoryless processes. Extensions to stable Markov and auto-regressive
processes are classical. Berger proved a source coding theorem for the
marginally unstable Wiener process, but the infinite-horizon exponentially
unstable case has been open since Gray's 1970 paper. There were also no
theorems showing what is needed to communicate such processes across noisy
channels.
  In this work, we give a fixed-rate source-coding theorem for the
infinite-horizon problem of coding an exponentially unstable Markov process.
The encoding naturally results in two distinct bitstreams that have
qualitatively different QoS requirements for communicating over a noisy medium.
The first stream captures the information that is accumulating within the
nonstationary process and requires sufficient anytime reliability from the
channel used to communicate the process. The second stream captures the
historical information that dissipates within the process and is essentially
classical. This historical information can also be identified with a natural
stable counterpart to the unstable process. A converse demonstrating the
fundamentally layered nature of unstable sources is given by means of
information-embedding ideas.

 <dc:description>  Distributed source coding is traditionally viewed in the block coding context
-- all the source symbols are known in advance at the encoders. This paper
instead considers a streaming setting in which iid source symbol pairs are
revealed to the separate encoders in real time and need to be reconstructed at
the decoder with some tolerable end-to-end delay using finite rate noiseless
channels. A sequential random binning argument is used to derive a lower bound
on the error exponent with delay and show that both ML decoding and universal
decoding achieve the same positive error exponents inside the traditional
Slepian-Wolf rate region. The error events are different from the block-coding
error events and give rise to slightly different exponents. Because the
sequential random binning scheme is also universal over delays, the resulting
code eventually reconstructs every source symbol correctly with probability 1.

 <dc:description>  In a remarkable paper published in 1976, Burnashev determined the reliability
function of variable-length block codes over discrete memoryless channels with
feedback. Subsequently, an alternative achievability proof was obtained by
Yamamoto and Itoh via a particularly simple and instructive scheme. Their idea
is to alternate between a communication and a confirmation phase until the
receiver detects the codeword used by the sender to acknowledge that the
message is correct. We provide a converse that parallels the Yamamoto-Itoh
achievability construction. Besides being simpler than the original, the
proposed converse suggests that a communication and a confirmation phase are
implicit in any scheme for which the probability of error decreases with the
largest possible exponent. The proposed converse also makes it intuitively
clear why the terms that appear in Burnashev's exponent are necessary.

 <dc:title>The necessity and sufficiency of anytime capacity for stabilization of a
  linear system over a noisy communication link, Part II: vector systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sahai, Anant</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mitter, Sanjoy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In part I, we reviewed how Shannon's classical notion of capacity is not
sufficient to characterize a noisy communication channel if the channel is
intended to be used as part of a feedback loop to stabilize an unstable scalar
linear system. While classical capacity is not enough, a sense of capacity
(parametrized by reliability) called &quot;anytime capacity&quot; is both necessary and
sufficient for channel evaluation in this context. The rate required is the log
of the open-loop system gain and the required reliability comes from the
desired sense of stability. Sufficiency is maintained even in cases with noisy
observations and without any explicit feedback between the observer and the
controller. This established the asymptotic equivalence between scalar
stabilization problems and delay-universal communication problems with
feedback.
  Here in part II, the vector-state generalizations are established and it is
the magnitudes of the unstable eigenvalues that play an essential role. To deal
with such systems, the concept of the anytime rate-region is introduced. This
is the region of rates that the channel can support while still meeting
potentially different anytime reliability targets for parallel message streams.
All the scalar results generalize on an eigenvalue by eigenvalue basis. When
there is no explicit feedback of the noisy channel outputs, the intrinsic delay
of the unstable system tells us what the feedback delay needs to be while
evaluating the anytime-rate-region for the channel. An example involving a
binary erasure channel is used to illustrate how differentiated service is
required in any separation-based control architecture.

problems. As traffic often changes from time to time, the problem of grooming
dynamic traffic is of great practical value. In this paper, we discuss dynamic
grooming of traffic in star and tree networks. A genetic algorithm (GA) based
approach is proposed to support arbitrary dynamic traffic patterns, which
minimizes the number of ADM's and wavelengths. To evaluate the algorithm,
tighter bounds are derived. Computer simulation results show that our algorithm
is efficient in reducing both the numbers of ADM's and wavelengths in tree and
star networks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we first introduce the concept of elementary linear subspace,
which has similar properties to those of a set of coordinates. Using this new
concept, we derive properties of maximum rank distance (MRD) codes that
parallel those of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. Using these
properties, we show that the decoder error probability of MRD codes with error
correction capability t decreases exponentially with t^2 based on the
assumption that all errors with the same rank are equally likely. We argue that
the channel based on this assumption is an approximation of a channel corrupted
by crisscross errors.

factorial language admits a unique canonical decomposition to a catenation of
factorial languages. In this paper, we analyze the appearance of the canonical
decomposition of a catenation of two factorial languages whose canonical
decompositions are given.

 <dc:title>On LAO Testing of Multiple Hypotheses for Many Independent Objects</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of many hypotheses logarithmically asymptotically optimal (LAO)
testing for a model consisting of three or more independent objects is solved.
It is supposed that $M$ probability distributions are known and each object
independently of others follows to one of them. The matrix of asymptotic
interdependencies (reliability--reliability functions) of all possible pairs of
the error probability exponents (reliabilities) in optimal testing for this
model is studied.
  This problem was introduced (and solved for the case of two objects and two
given probability distributions) by Ahlswede and Haroutunian. The model with
two independent objects with $M$ hypotheses was explored by Haroutunian and
Hakobyan.

 <dc:title>Anytime coding on the infinite bandwidth AWGN channel: A sequential
  semi-orthogonal optimal code</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sahai, Anant</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is well known that orthogonal coding can be used to approach the Shannon
capacity of the power-constrained AWGN channel without a bandwidth constraint.
This correspondence describes a semi-orthogonal variation of pulse position
modulation that is sequential in nature -- bits can be ``streamed across''
without having to buffer up blocks of bits at the transmitter. ML decoding
results in an exponentially small probability of error as a function of
tolerated receiver delay and thus eventually a zero probability of error on
every transmitted bit. In the high-rate regime, a matching upper bound is given
on the delay error exponent. We close with some comments on the case with
feedback and the connections to the capacity per unit cost problem.

 <dc:title>Most Programs Stop Quickly or Never Halt</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Calude, Cristian S.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Since many real-world problems arising in the fields of compiler
optimisation, automated software engineering, formal proof systems, and so
forth are equivalent to the Halting Problem--the most notorious undecidable
problem--there is a growing interest, not only academically, in understanding
the problem better and in providing alternative solutions. Halting computations
can be recognised by simply running them; the main difficulty is to detect
non-halting programs. Our approach is to have the probability space extend over
both space and time and to consider the probability that a random $N$-bit
program has halted by a random time. We postulate an a priori computable
probability distribution on all possible runtimes and we prove that given an
integer k&gt;0, we can effectively compute a time bound T such that the
probability that an N-bit program will eventually halt given that it has not
halted by T is smaller than 2^{-k}. We also show that the set of halting
programs (which is computably enumerable, but not computable) can be written as
a disjoint union of a computable set and a set of effectively vanishing
probability. Finally, we show that ``long'' runtimes are effectively rare. More
formally, the set of times at which an N-bit program can stop after the time
2^{N+constant} has effectively zero density.

 <dc:description>  There exist ample demonstrations that indicators of scholarly impact
analogous to the citation-based ISI Impact Factor can be derived from usage
data. However, contrary to the ISI IF which is based on citation data generated
by the global community of scholarly authors, so far usage can only be
practically recorded at a local level leading to community-specific assessments
of scholarly impact that are difficult to generalize to the global scholarly
community. We define a journal Usage Impact Factor which mimics the definition
of the Thomson Scientific's ISI Impact Factor. Usage Impact Factor rankings are
calculated on the basis of a large-scale usage data set recorded for the
California State University system from 2003 to 2005. The resulting journal
rankings are then compared to Thomson Scientific's ISI Impact Factor which is
used as a baseline indicator of general impact. Our results indicate that
impact as derived from California State University usage reflects the
particular scientific and demographic characteristics of its communities.

 <dc:title>Nonlinear Estimators and Tail Bounds for Dimension Reduction in $l_1$
  Using Cauchy Random Projections</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For dimension reduction in $l_1$, the method of {\em Cauchy random
projections} multiplies the original data matrix $\mathbf{A}
\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times D}$ with a random matrix $\mathbf{R} \in
\mathbb{R}^{D\times k}$ ($k\ll\min(n,D)$) whose entries are i.i.d. samples of
the standard Cauchy C(0,1). Because of the impossibility results, one can not
hope to recover the pairwise $l_1$ distances in $\mathbf{A}$ from $\mathbf{B} =
\mathbf{AR} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$, using linear estimators without
incurring large errors. However, nonlinear estimators are still useful for
certain applications in data stream computation, information retrieval,
learning, and data mining.
  We propose three types of nonlinear estimators: the bias-corrected sample
median estimator, the bias-corrected geometric mean estimator, and the
bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator. The sample median estimator and
the geometric mean estimator are asymptotically (as $k\to \infty$) equivalent
but the latter is more accurate at small $k$. We derive explicit tail bounds
for the geometric mean estimator and establish an analog of the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma for dimension reduction in $l_1$, which is
weaker than the classical JL lemma for dimension reduction in $l_2$.
  Asymptotically, both the sample median estimator and the geometric mean
estimators are about 80% efficient compared to the maximum likelihood estimator
(MLE). We analyze the moments of the MLE and propose approximating the
distribution of the MLE by an inverse Gaussian.

 <dc:description>  Traffic grooming is widely employed to reduce the number of ADM's and
wavelengths. We consider the problem of grooming of dynamic traffic in WDM tree
and star networks in this paper. To achieve better results, we used the
bifurcation techniques to the grooming of arbitrary dynamic traffic in a
strictly non-blocking manner in networks. Three splitting methods, including
Traffic-Cutting, Traffic-Dividing and Synthesized-Splitting were proposed. A
genetic algorithm (GA) approach based on these methods was proposed to tackle
such grooming problems in tree and star networks. The performance of these
algorithms was tested under different conditions in star and tree networks.
Computer simulation results showed that our algorithm is efficient in reducing
both the numbers of ADM's and wavelengths.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, our aim is to propose a model that helps in the efficient use
of an information system by users, within the organization represented by the
IS, in order to resolve their decisional problems. In other words we want to
aid the user within an organization in obtaining the information that
corresponds to his needs (informational needs that result from his decisional
problems). This type of information system is what we refer to as economic
intelligence system because of its support for economic intelligence processes
of the organisation. Our assumption is that every EI process begins with the
identification of the decisional problem which is translated into an
informational need. This need is then translated into one or many information
search problems (ISP). We also assumed that an ISP is expressed in terms of the
user's expectations and that these expectations determine the activities or the
behaviors of the user, when he/she uses an IS. The model we are proposing is
used for the conception of the IS so that the process of retrieving of
solution(s) or the responses given by the system to an ISP is based on these
behaviours and correspond to the needs of the user.

 <dc:description>  This is the second part of a two-part series of papers. In this paper, for
the generalized non-orthogonal amplify and forward (GNAF) protocol presented in
Part-I, a construction of a new family of distributed space-time codes based on
Co-ordinate Interleaved Orthogonal Designs (CIOD) which result in reduced
Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding complexity at the destination is proposed.
Further, it is established that the recently proposed Toeplitz space-time codes
as well as space-time block codes (STBCs) from cyclic division algebras can be
used in GNAF protocol. Finally, a lower bound on the optimal
Diversity-Multiplexing Gain (DM-G) tradeoff for the GNAF protocol is
established and it is shown that this bound approaches the transmit diversity
bound asymptotically as the number of relays and the number of channels uses
increases.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this two-part series of papers, a generalized non-orthogonal amplify and
forward (GNAF) protocol which generalizes several known cooperative diversity
protocols is proposed. Transmission in the GNAF protocol comprises of two
phases - the broadcast phase and the cooperation phase. In the broadcast phase,
the source broadcasts its information to the relays as well as the destination.
In the cooperation phase, the source and the relays together transmit a
space-time code in a distributed fashion. The GNAF protocol relaxes the
constraints imposed by the protocol of Jing and Hassibi on the code structure.
In Part-I of this paper, a code design criteria is obtained and it is shown
that the GNAF protocol is delay efficient and coding gain efficient as well.
Moreover GNAF protocol enables the use of sphere decoders at the destination
with a non-exponential Maximum likelihood (ML) decoding complexity. In Part-II,
several low decoding complexity code constructions are studied and a lower
bound on the Diversity-Multiplexing Gain tradeoff of the GNAF protocol is
obtained.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A Space-Time Block Code (STBC) in $K$ symbols (variables) is called $g$-group
decodable STBC if its maximum-likelihood decoding metric can be written as a
sum of $g$ terms such that each term is a function of a subset of the $K$
variables and each variable appears in only one term. In this paper we provide
a general structure of the weight matrices of multi-group decodable codes using
Clifford algebras. Without assuming that the number of variables in each group
to be the same, a method of explicitly constructing the weight matrices of
full-diversity, delay-optimal $g$-group decodable codes is presented for
arbitrary number of antennas. For the special case of $N_t=2^a$ we construct
two subclass of codes: (i) A class of $2a$-group decodable codes with rate
$\frac{a}{2^{(a-1)}}$, which is, equivalently, a class of Single-Symbol
Decodable codes, (ii) A class of $(2a-2)$-group decodable with rate
$\frac{(a-1)}{2^{(a-2)}}$, i.e., a class of Double-Symbol Decodable codes.
Simulation results show that the DSD codes of this paper perform better than
previously known Quasi-Orthogonal Designs.

 <dc:description>  Grid superscheduling requires support for efficient and scalable discovery of
resources. Resource discovery activities involve searching for the appropriate
resource types that match the user's job requirements. To accomplish this goal,
a resource discovery system that supports the desired look-up operation is
mandatory. Various kinds of solutions to this problem have been suggested,
including the centralised and hierarchical information server approach.
However, both of these approaches have serious limitations in regards to
scalability, fault-tolerance and network congestion. To overcome these
limitations, organising resource information using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network
model has been proposed. Existing approaches advocate an extension to
structured P2P protocols, to support the Grid resource information system
(GRIS). In this paper, we identify issues related to the design of such an
efficient, scalable, fault-tolerant, consistent and practical GRIS system using
a P2P network model. We compile these issues into various taxonomies in
sections III and IV. Further, we look into existing works that apply P2P based
network protocols to GRIS. We think that this taxonomy and its mapping to
relevant systems would be useful for academic and industry based researchers
who are engaged in the design of scalable Grid systems.

 <dc:description>  The complexity of round robin method of intraprocedural data flow analysis is
measured in number of iterations over the control flow graph. Existing
complexity bounds realistically explain the complexity of only Bit-vector
frameworks which are separable. In this paper we define the complexity bounds
for non-separable frameworks by quantifying the interdependences among the data
flow information of program entities using an Entity Dependence Graph.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the diagnosability of {\it stochastic discrete event systems}
(SDESs) was investigated in the literature, and, the failure diagnosis
considered was {\it centralized}. In this paper, we propose an approach to {\it
decentralized} failure diagnosis of SDESs, where the stochastic system uses
multiple local diagnosers to detect failures and each local diagnoser possesses
its own information. In a way, the centralized failure diagnosis of SDESs can
be viewed as a special case of the decentralized failure diagnosis presented in
this paper with only one projection. The main contributions are as follows: (1)
We formalize the notion of codiagnosability for stochastic automata, which
means that a failure can be detected by at least one local stochastic diagnoser
within a finite delay. (2) We construct a codiagnoser from a given stochastic
automaton with multiple projections, and the codiagnoser associated with the
local diagnosers is used to test codiagnosability condition of SDESs. (3) We
deal with a number of basic properties of the codiagnoser. In particular, a
necessary and sufficient condition for the codiagnosability of SDESs is
presented. (4) We give a computing method in detail to check whether
codiagnosability is violated. And (5) some examples are described to illustrate
the applications of the codiagnosability and its computing method.

 <dc:description>  An important problem to be addressed within Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
is how to correctly and efficiently capture and process the event/action-based
logic. This paper endeavors to bridge the gap between the Knowledge
Representation (KR) approaches based on durable events/actions and such
formalisms as event calculus, on one hand, and event-condition-action (ECA)
reaction rules extending the approach of active databases that view events as
instantaneous occurrences and/or sequences of events, on the other. We propose
formalism based on reaction rules (ECA rules) and a novel interval-based event
logic and present concrete RuleML-based syntax, semantics and implementation.
We further evaluate this approach theoretically, experimentally and on an
example derived from common industry use cases and illustrate its benefits.

 <dc:description>  The notion of 'presentation', as used in combinatorial group theory, is
applied to coded character sets(CCSs) - sets which facilitate the interchange
of messages in a digital computer network(DCN) . By grouping each element of
the set into two portions and using the idea of group presentation(whereby a
group is specified by its set of generators and its set of relators), the
presentation of a CCS is described. This is illustrated using the Extended
Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code(EBCDIC) which is one of the most popular
CCSs in DCNs.
  Key words: Group presentation, coded character set, digital computer network

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a downlink communication system, in which a Base Station (BS)
equipped with $M$ antennas communicates with $N$ users each equipped with $K$
receive antennas, is considered. An efficient suboptimum algorithm is proposed
for selecting a set of users in order to maximize the sum-rate throughput of
the system. For the asymptotic case when $N$ tends to infinity, the necessary
and sufficient conditions in order to achieve the maximum sum-rate throughput,
such that the difference between the achievable sum-rate and the maximum value
approaches zero, is derived. The complexity of our algorithm is investigated in
terms of the required amount of feedback from the users to the base station, as
well as the number of searches required for selecting the users. It is shown
that the proposed method is capable of achieving a large portion of the
sum-rate capacity, with a very low complexity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a method that learns to play Pac-Man. We define a
set of high-level observation and action modules. Actions are temporally
extended, and multiple action modules may be in effect concurrently. A decision
of the agent is represented as a rule-based policy. For learning, we apply the
cross-entropy method, a recent global optimization algorithm. The learned
policies reached better score than the hand-crafted policy, and neared the
score of average human players. We argue that learning is successful mainly
because (i) the policy space includes the combination of individual actions and
thus it is sufficiently rich, (ii) the search is biased towards low-complexity
policies and low complexity solutions can be found quickly if they exist. Based
on these principles, we formulate a new theoretical framework, which can be
found in the Appendix as supporting material.

 <dc:title>Coupling of quantum angular momenta: an insight into analogic/discrete

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the past few years there has been a tumultuous activity aimed at
introducing novel conceptual schemes for quantum computing. The approach
proposed in (Marzuoli A and Rasetti M 2002, 2005a) relies on the (re)coupling
theory of SU(2) angular momenta and can be viewed as a generalization to
arbitrary values of the spin variables of the usual quantum-circuit model based
on `qubits' and Boolean gates. Computational states belong to
finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces labelled by both discrete and continuous
parameters, and unitary gates may depend on quantum numbers ranging over finite
sets of values as well as continuous (angular) variables. Such a framework is
an ideal playground to discuss discrete (digital) and analogic computational
processes, together with their relationships occuring when a consistent
semiclassical limit takes place on discrete quantum gates. When working with
purely discrete unitary gates, the simulator is naturally modelled as families
of quantum finite states--machines which in turn represent discrete versions of
topological quantum computation models. We argue that our model embodies a sort
of unifying paradigm for computing inspired by Nature and, even more
ambitiously, a universal setting in which suitably encoded quantum symbolic
manipulations of combinatorial, topological and algebraic problems might find
their `natural' computational reference model.

 <dc:description>  An Extended Visual Cryptography Scheme (EVCS) was proposed by Ateniese et al.
[3] to protect a binary secret image with meaningful (innocent-looking) shares.
This is implemented by concatenating an extended matrix to each basis matrix.
The minimum size of the extended matrix was obtained from a hypergraph coloring
model and the scheme was designed for binary images only [3]. In this paper, we
give a more concise derivation for this matrix extension for color images.
Furthermore, we present a (k, n) scheme to protect multiple color images with
meaningful shares. This scheme is an extension of the (n, n) VCS for multiple
binary images proposed in Droste scheme [2].

 <dc:description>  Decentralized search aims to find the target node in a large network by using
only local information. The applications of it include peer-to-peer file
sharing, web search and anything else that requires locating a specific target
in a complex system. In this paper, we examine the degree-based decentralized
search method. Specifically, we evaluate the efficiency of the method in
different cases with different amounts of available local information. In
addition, we propose a simple refinement algorithm for significantly shortening
the length of the route that has been found. Some insights useful for the
future developments of efficient decentralized search schemes have been
achieved.

the incidence treewidth, i.e., the treewidth of the bipartite graph whose
vertices are the variables and clauses of the given CNF formula; a variable and
a clause are joined by an edge if and only if the variable occurs in the
clause. Our algorithm runs in time O(4^k k l N), where k denotes the incidence
treewidth, l denotes the size of a largest clause, and N denotes the number of
nodes of the tree-decomposition.

 <dc:description>  The management and combination of uncertain, imprecise, fuzzy and even
paradoxical or high conflicting sources of information has always been and
still remains of primal importance for the development of reliable information
fusion systems. In this short survey paper, we present the theory of plausible
and paradoxical reasoning, known as DSmT (Dezert-Smarandache Theory) in
literature, developed for dealing with imprecise, uncertain and potentially
highly conflicting sources of information. DSmT is a new paradigm shift for
information fusion and recent publications have shown the interest and the
potential ability of DSmT to solve fusion problems where Dempster's rule used
in Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides counter-intuitive results or fails to
provide useful result at all. This paper is focused on the foundations of DSmT
and on its main rules of combination (classic, hybrid and Proportional Conflict
Redistribution rules). Shafer's model on which is based DST appears as a
particular and specific case of DSm hybrid model which can be easily handled by
DSmT as well. Several simple but illustrative examples are given throughout
this paper to show the interest and the generality of this new theory.

 <dc:title>Lattice Quantization with Side Information: Codes, Asymptotics, and
  Applications in Sensor Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Servetto, Sergio D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of rate/distortion with side information available
only at the decoder. For the case of jointly-Gaussian source X and side
information Y, and mean-squared error distortion, Wyner proved in 1976 that the
rate/distortion function for this problem is identical to the conditional
rate/distortion function R_{X|Y}, assuming the side information Y is available
at the encoder. In this paper we construct a structured class of asymptotically
optimal quantizers for this problem: under the assumption of high correlation
between source X and side information Y, we show there exist quantizers within
our class whose performance comes arbitrarily close to Wyner's bound. As an
application illustrating the relevance of the high-correlation asymptotics, we
also explore the use of these quantizers in the context of a problem of data
compression for sensor networks, in a setup involving a large number of devices
collecting highly correlated measurements within a confined area. An important
feature of our formulation is that, although the per-node throughput of the
network tends to zero as network size increases, so does the amount of
information generated by each transmitter. This is a situation likely to be
encountered often in practice, which allows us to cast under new--and more
``optimistic''--light some negative results on the transport capacity of
large-scale wireless networks.

 <dc:title>A Scalable Protocol for Cooperative Time Synchronization Using Spatial

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Time synchronization is an important aspect of sensor network operation.
However, it is well known that synchronization error accumulates over multiple
hops. This presents a challenge for large-scale, multi-hop sensor networks with
a large number of nodes distributed over wide areas. In this work, we present a
protocol that uses spatial averaging to reduce error accumulation in
large-scale networks. We provide an analysis to quantify the synchronization
improvement achieved using spatial averaging and find that in a basic
cooperative network, the skew and offset variance decrease approximately as
$1/\bar{N}$ where $\bar{N}$ is the number of cooperating nodes. For general
networks, simulation results and a comparison to basic cooperative network
results are used to illustrate the improvement in synchronization performance.

 <dc:description>  We present a formalization of a version of Abadi and
  Plotkin's logic for parametricity for a polymorphic dual
intuitionistic/linear type theory with fixed points, and show, following
Plotkin's suggestions, that it can be used to define a wide collection of
types, including existential types, inductive types, coinductive types and
general recursive types. We show that the recursive types satisfy a universal
property called dinaturality, and we develop reasoning principles for the
constructed types. In the case of recursive types, the reasoning principle is a
mixed induction/coinduction principle, with the curious property that
coinduction holds for general relations, but induction only for a limited
collection of ``admissible'' relations. A similar property was observed in
Pitts' 1995 analysis of recursive types in domain theory. In a future paper we
will develop a category theoretic notion of models of the logic presented here,
and show how the results developed in the logic can be transferred to the
models.

 <dc:description>  CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, has operated an
institutional preprint repository for more than 10 years. The repository
contains over 850,000 records of which more than 450,000 are full-text OA
preprints, mostly in the field of particle physics, and it is integrated with
the library's holdings of books, conference proceedings, journals and other
grey literature. In order to encourage effective propagation and open access to
scholarly material, CERN is implementing a range of innovative library services
into its document repository: automatic keywording, reference extraction,
collaborative management tools and bibliometric tools. Some of these services,
such as user reviewing and automatic metadata extraction, could make up an
interesting testbed for future publishing solutions and certainly provide an
exciting environment for e-science possibilities. The future protocol for
scientific communication should naturally guide authors towards OA publication
and CERN wants to help reach a full open access publishing environment for the
particle physics community and the related sciences in the next few years.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the evolution of controllers for racing a simulated
radio-controlled car around a track, modelled on a real physical track. Five
different controller architectures were compared, based on neural networks,
force fields and action sequences. The controllers use either egocentric (first
person), Newtonian (third person) or no information about the state of the car
(open-loop controller). The only controller that was able to evolve good racing
behaviour was based on a neural network acting on egocentric inputs.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes MIMO systems with multichannel beamforming in Ricean
fading. Our results apply to a wide class of multichannel systems which
transmit on the eigenmodes of the MIMO channel. We first present new
closed-form expressions for the marginal ordered eigenvalue distributions of
complex noncentral Wishart matrices. These are used to characterize the
statistics of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) on each eigenmode. Based on this,
we present exact symbol error rate (SER) expressions. We also derive
closed-form expressions for the diversity order, array gain, and outage
probability. We show that the global SER performance is dominated by the
subchannel corresponding to the minimum channel singular value. We also show
that, at low outage levels, the outage probability varies inversely with the
Ricean K-factor for cases where transmission is only on the most dominant
subchannel (i.e. a singlechannel beamforming system). Numerical results are
presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

 <dc:description>  This article discusses ability of Linear Programming models to be used as
solvers of NP-complete problems. Integer Linear Programming is known as
NP-complete problem, but non-integer Linear Programming problems can be solved
in polynomial time, what places them in P class. During past three years there
appeared some articles using LP to solve NP-complete problems. This methods use
large number of variables (O(n^9)) solving correctly almost all instances that
can be solved in reasonable time. Can they solve infinitively large instances?
This article gives answer to this question.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a model and implementation techniques for speeding up
constraint propagation. Three fundamental approaches to improving constraint
propagation based on propagators as implementations of constraints are
explored: keeping track of which propagators are at fixpoint, choosing which
propagator to apply next, and how to combine several propagators for the same
constraint. We show how idempotence reasoning and events help track fixpoints
more accurately. We improve these methods by using them dynamically (taking
into account current domains to improve accuracy). We define priority-based
approaches to choosing a next propagator and show that dynamic priorities can
improve propagation. We illustrate that the use of multiple propagators for the
same constraint can be advantageous with priorities, and introduce staged
propagators that combine the effects of multiple propagators with priorities
for greater efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Toric codes are obtained by evaluating rational functions of a nonsingular
toric variety at the algebraic torus. One can extend toric codes to the so
called generalized toric codes. This extension consists on evaluating elements
of an arbitrary polynomial algebra at the algebraic torus instead of a linear
combination of monomials whose exponents are rational points of a convex
polytope. We study their multicyclic and metric structure, and we use them to
express their dual and to estimate their minimum distance.

 <dc:title>Hedging predictions in machine learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gammerman, Alexander</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent advances in machine learning make it possible to design efficient
prediction algorithms for data sets with huge numbers of parameters. This paper
describes a new technique for &quot;hedging&quot; the predictions output by many such
algorithms, including support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, kernel
nearest neighbours, and by many other state-of-the-art methods. The hedged
predictions for the labels of new objects include quantitative measures of
their own accuracy and reliability. These measures are provably valid under the
assumption of randomness, traditional in machine learning: the objects and
their labels are assumed to be generated independently from the same
probability distribution. In particular, it becomes possible to control (up to
statistical fluctuations) the number of erroneous predictions by selecting a
suitable confidence level. Validity being achieved automatically, the remaining
goal of hedged prediction is efficiency: taking full account of the new
objects' features and other available information to produce as accurate
predictions as possible. This can be done successfully using the powerful
machinery of modern machine learning.

 <dc:description>  This letter derives the asymptotic symbol error rate (SER) and outage
probability of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) maximum ratio combining
(MRC) systems. We consider Rayleigh fading channels with both transmit and
receive spatial correlation. Our results are based on new asymptotic
expressions which we derive for the p.d.f. and c.d.f. of the maximum eigenvalue
of positive-definite quadratic forms in complex Gaussian matrices. We prove
that spatial correlation does not affect the diversity order, but that it
reduces the array gain and hence increases the SER in the high SNR regime.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce the AMADEUS strategy, which has been used to
produce scientific writing tools for non-native users of English for 15 years,
and emphasize a learn-by-doing approach through which students and novice
writers can improve their scientific writing. More specifically, we provide a
9-step recipe for the students to compile writing material according to a
procedure that has proven efficient in scientific writing courses.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an environment for solving Prolog problems which has been
implemented as a module for the virtual laboratory VILAB. During the problem
solving processes the learners get fast adaptive feedback. As a result
analysing the learner's actions the system suggests the use of suitable
auxiliary predicates which will also be checked for proper implementation. The
focus of the environment has been set on robustness and the integration in
VILAB.

 <dc:title>On the Fairness of Rate Allocation in Gaussian Multiple Access Channel

 <dc:creator>Shum, Kenneth W.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The capacity region of a channel consists of all achievable rate vectors.
Picking a particular point in the capacity region is synonymous with rate
allocation. The issue of fairness in rate allocation is addressed in this
paper. We review several notions of fairness, including max-min fairness,
proportional fairness and Nash bargaining solution. Their efficiencies for
general multiuser channels are discussed. We apply these ideas to the Gaussian
multiple access channel (MAC) and the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC). We show
that in the Gaussian MAC, max-min fairness and proportional fairness coincide.
For both Gaussian MAC and BC, we devise efficient algorithms that locate the
fair point in the capacity region. Some elementary properties of fair rate
allocations are proved.

 <dc:description>  Whoever has had his cell phone stolen knows how frustrating it is to be
unable to get his contact list back. To avoid data loss when losing or
destroying a mobile device like a PDA or a cell phone, data is usually
backed-up to a fixed station. However, in the time between the last backup and
the failure, important data can have been produced and then lost. To handle
this issue, we propose a transparent collaborative backup system. Indeed, by
saving data on other mobile devices between two connections to a global
infrastructure, we can resist to such scenarios. In this paper, after a general
description of such a system, we present a way to replicate data on mobile
devices to attain a prerequired resilience for the backup.

 <dc:description>  In the distributed coding of correlated sources, the problem of
characterizing the joint probability distribution of a pair of random variables
satisfying an n-letter Markov chain arises. The exact solution of this problem
is intractable. In this paper, we seek a single-letter necessary condition for
this n-letter Markov chain. To this end, we propose a new data processing
inequality on a new measure of correlation by means of spectrum analysis. Based
on this new data processing inequality, we provide a single-letter necessary
condition for the required joint probability distribution. We apply our results
to two specific examples involving the distributed coding of correlated
sources: multi-terminal rate-distortion region and multiple access channel with
correlated sources, and propose new necessary conditions for these two
problems.

 <dc:description>  A new general decomposition theory inspired from modular graph decomposition
is presented. This helps unifying modular decomposition on different
structures, including (but not restricted to) graphs. Moreover, even in the
case of graphs, the terminology ``module'' not only captures the classical
graph modules but also allows to handle 2-connected components, star-cutsets,
and other vertex subsets. The main result is that most of the nice algorithmic
tools developed for modular decomposition of graphs still apply efficiently on
our generalisation of modules. Besides, when an essential axiom is satisfied,
almost all the important properties can be retrieved. For this case, an
algorithm given by Ehrenfeucht, Gabow, McConnell and Sullivan 1994 is
generalised and yields a very efficient solution to the associated
decomposition problem.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the design of an associative memory with feedback that is
capable of on-line temporal sequence learning. A framework for on-line sequence
learning has been proposed, and different sequence learning models have been
analysed according to this framework. The network model is an associative
memory with a separate store for the sequence context of a symbol. A sparse
distributed memory is used to gain scalability. The context store combines the
functionality of a neural layer with a shift register. The sensitivity of the
machine to the sequence context is controllable, resulting in different
characteristic behaviours. The model can store and predict on-line sequences of
various types and length. Numerical simulations on the model have been carried
out to determine its properties.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a coordination algorithm for mobile autonomous robots.
Relying upon distributed sensing the robots achieve rendezvous, that is, they
move to a common location. Each robot is a point mass moving in a nonconvex
environment according to an omnidirectional kinematic model. Each robot is
equipped with line-of-sight limited-range sensors, i.e., a robot can measure
the relative position of any object (robots or environment boundary) if and
only if the object is within a given distance and there are no obstacles
in-between. The algorithm is designed using the notions of robust visibility,
connectivity-preserving constraint sets, and proximity graphs. Simulations
illustrate the theoretical results on the correctness of the proposed
algorithm, and its performance in asynchronous setups and with sensor
measurement and control errors.

 <dc:title>Faster Streaming algorithms for graph spanners</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Baswana, Surender</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and an
integer $t\ge 1$, a subgraph $(V,E_S)$, $E_S\subseteq E$ is called a
$t$-spanner if for any pair of vertices $u,v \in V$, the distance between them
in the subgraph is at most $t$ times the actual distance. We present streaming
algorithms for computing a $t$-spanner of essentially optimal size-stretch
trade offs for any undirected graph.
  Our first algorithm is for the classical streaming model and works for
unweighted graphs only. The algorithm performs a single pass on the stream of
edges and requires $O(m)$ time to process the entire stream of edges. This
drastically improves the previous best single pass streaming algorithm for
computing a $t$-spanner which requires $\theta(mn^{\frac{2}{t}})$ time to
process the stream and computes spanner with size slightly larger than the
optimal.
  Our second algorithm is for {\em StreamSort} model introduced by Aggarwal et
al. [FOCS 2004], which is the streaming model augmented with a sorting
primitive. The {\em StreamSort} model has been shown to be a more powerful and
still very realistic model than the streaming model for massive data sets
applications. Our algorithm, which works of weighted graphs as well, performs
$O(t)$ passes using $O(\log n)$ bits of working memory only.
  Our both the algorithms require elementary data structures.

 <dc:title>A Relational Approach to Functional Decomposition of Logic Circuits</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Functional decomposition of logic circuits has profound influence on all
quality aspects of the cost-effective implementation of modern digital systems.
In this paper, a relational approach to the decomposition of logic circuits is
proposed. This approach is parallel to the normalization of relational
databases, they are governed by the same concepts of functional dependency (FD)
and multi-valued dependency (MVD). It is manifest that the functional
decomposition of switching function actually exploits the same idea and serves
a similar purpose as database normalization. Partitions play an important role
in the decomposition. The interdependency of two partitions can be represented
by a bipartite graph. We demonstrate that both FD and MVD can be represented by
bipartite graphs with specific topological properties, which are delineated by
partitions of minterms. It follows that our algorithms are procedures of
constructing those specific bipartite graphs of interest to meet the
information-lossless criteria of functional decomposition.

 <dc:title>A Logical Approach to Efficient Max-SAT solving</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Weighted Max-SAT is the optimization version of SAT and many important
problems can be naturally encoded as such. Solving weighted Max-SAT is an
important problem from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. In
recent years, there has been considerable interest in finding efficient solving
techniques. Most of this work focus on the computation of good quality lower
bounds to be used within a branch and bound DPLL-like algorithm. Most often,
these lower bounds are described in a procedural way. Because of that, it is
difficult to realize the {\em logic} that is behind.
  In this paper we introduce an original framework for Max-SAT that stresses
the parallelism with classical SAT. Then, we extend the two basic SAT solving
techniques: {\em search} and {\em inference}. We show that many algorithmic
{\em tricks} used in state-of-the-art Max-SAT solvers are easily expressable in
{\em logic} terms with our framework in a unified manner.
  Besides, we introduce an original search algorithm that performs a restricted
amount of {\em weighted resolution} at each visited node. We empirically
compare our algorithm with a variety of solving alternatives on several
benchmarks. Our experiments, which constitute to the best of our knowledge the
most comprehensive Max-sat evaluation ever reported, show that our algorithm is
generally orders of magnitude faster than any competitor.

 <dc:description>  The few available French resources for evaluating linguistic models or
algorithms on other linguistic levels than morpho-syntax are either
insufficient from quantitative as well as qualitative point of view or not
freely accessible. Based on this fact, the FREEBANK project intends to create
French corpora constructed using manually revised output from a hybrid
Constraint Grammar parser and annotated on several linguistic levels
(structure, morpho-syntax, syntax, coreference), with the objective to make
them available on-line for research purposes. Therefore, we will focus on using
standard annotation schemes, integration of existing resources and maintenance
allowing for continuous enrichment of the annotations. Prior to the actual
presentation of the prototype that has been implemented, this paper describes a
generic model for the organization and deployment of a linguistic resource
archive, in compliance with the various works currently conducted within
international standardization initiatives (TEI and ISO/TC 37/SC 4).

 <dc:description>  Confidentiality, integrity and authentication are more relevant issues in Ad
hoc networks than in wired fixed networks. One way to address these issues is
the use of symmetric key cryptography, relying on a secret key shared by all
members of the network. But establishing and maintaining such a key (also
called the session key) is a non-trivial problem. We show that Group Key
Agreement (GKA) protocols are suitable for establishing and maintaining such a
session key in these dynamic networks. We take an existing GKA protocol, which
is robust to connectivity losses and discuss all the issues for good
functioning of this protocol in Ad hoc networks. We give implementation details
and network parameters, which significantly reduce the computational burden of
using public key cryptography in such networks.

 <dc:title>A Decomposition Theory for Binary Linear Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kashyap, Navin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The decomposition theory of matroids initiated by Paul Seymour in the 1980's
has had an enormous impact on research in matroid theory. This theory, when
applied to matrices over the binary field, yields a powerful decomposition
theory for binary linear codes. In this paper, we give an overview of this code
decomposition theory, and discuss some of its implications in the context of
the recently discovered formulation of maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of a
binary linear code over a discrete memoryless channel as a linear programming
problem. We translate matroid-theoretic results of Gr\&quot;otschel and Truemper
from the combinatorial optimization literature to give examples of non-trivial
families of codes for which the ML decoding problem can be solved in time
polynomial in the length of the code. One such family is that consisting of
codes $C$ for which the codeword polytope is identical to the Koetter-Vontobel
fundamental polytope derived from the entire dual code $C^\perp$. However, we
also show that such families of codes are not good in a coding-theoretic sense
-- either their dimension or their minimum distance must grow sub-linearly with
codelength. As a consequence, we have that decoding by linear programming, when
applied to good codes, cannot avoid failing occasionally due to the presence of
pseudocodewords.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of bounded model checking (BMC) for linear temporal
logic (LTL). We present several efficient encodings that have size linear in
the bound. Furthermore, we show how the encodings can be extended to LTL with
past operators (PLTL). The generalised encoding is still of linear size, but
cannot detect minimal length counterexamples. By using the virtual unrolling
technique minimal length counterexamples can be captured, however, the size of
the encoding is quadratic in the specification. We also extend virtual
unrolling to Buchi automata, enabling them to accept minimal length
counterexamples.
  Our BMC encodings can be made incremental in order to benefit from
incremental SAT technology. With fairly small modifications the incremental
encoding can be further enhanced with a termination check, allowing us to prove
properties with BMC. Experiments clearly show that our new encodings improve
performance of BMC considerably, particularly in the case of the incremental
encoding, and that they are very competitive for finding bugs. An analysis of
the liveness-to-safety transformation reveals many similarities to the BMC
encodings in this paper. Using the liveness-to-safety translation with
BDD-based invariant checking results in an efficient method to find shortest
counterexamples that complements the BMC-based approach.

 <dc:title>Nonextensive Pythagoras' Theorem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Kullback-Leibler relative-entropy, in cases involving distributions resulting
from relative-entropy minimization, has a celebrated property reminiscent of
squared Euclidean distance: it satisfies an analogue of the Pythagoras'
theorem. And hence, this property is referred to as Pythagoras' theorem of
relative-entropy minimization or triangle equality and plays a fundamental role
in geometrical approaches of statistical estimation theory like information
geometry. Equvalent of Pythagoras' theorem in the generalized nonextensive
formalism is established in (Dukkipati at el., Physica A, 361 (2006) 124-138).
In this paper we give a detailed account of it.

 <dc:title>Efficient Threshold Aggregation of Moving Objects</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Anderson, Scot</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Revesz, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Calculating aggregation operators of moving point objects, using time as a
continuous variable, presents unique problems when querying for congestion in a
moving and changing (or dynamic) query space. We present a set of congestion
query operators, based on a threshold value, that estimate the following 5
aggregation operations in d-dimensions. 1) We call the count of point objects
that intersect the dynamic query space during the query time interval, the
CountRange. 2) We call the Maximum (or Minimum) congestion in the dynamic query
space at any time during the query time interval, the MaxCount (or MinCount).
3) We call the sum of time that the dynamic query space is congested, the
ThresholdSum. 4) We call the number of times that the dynamic query space is
congested, the ThresholdCount. And 5) we call the average length of time of all
the time intervals when the dynamic query space is congested, the
ThresholdAverage. These operators rely on a novel approach to transforming the
problem of selection based on position to a problem of selection based on a
threshold. These operators can be used to predict concentrations of migrating
birds that may carry disease such as Bird Flu and hence the information may be
used to predict high risk areas. On a smaller scale, those operators are also
applicable to maintaining safety in airplane operations. We present the theory
of our estimation operators and provide algorithms for exact operators. The
implementations of those operators, and experiments, which include data from
more than 7500 queries, indicate that our estimation operators produce fast,
efficient results with error under 5%.

 <dc:description>  We consider flocks of artificial birds and study the emergence of V-like

positioning rules to guide the birds' movements and demonstrate, by means of
simulations, that they tend to lead to stabilization into several of the
well-known V-like formations that have been observed in nature. We also provide
quantitative indicators that we believe are closely related to achieving V-like
formations, and study their behavior over a large set of independent

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two attacks against Achterbahn-128/80, the last version
of one of the stream cipher proposals in the eSTREAM project. The attack
against the 80-bit variant, Achterbahn-80, has complexity 2^{56.32}. The attack
against Achterbahn-128 requires 2^{75.4} operations and 2^{61} keystream bits.
These attacks are based on an improvement of the attack due to Hell and
Johansson against Achterbahn version 2 and also on an algorithm that makes
profit of the short lengths of the constituent registers.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we discuss and compare several policies to place replicas in
tree networks, subject to server capacity and QoS constraints. The client
requests are known beforehand, while the number and location of the servers are
to be determined. The standard approach in the literature is to enforce that
all requests of a client be served by the closest server in the tree. We
introduce and study two new policies. In the first policy, all requests from a
given client are still processed by the same server, but this server can be
located anywhere in the path from the client to the root. In the second policy,
the requests of a given client can be processed by multiple servers. One major
contribution of this paper is to assess the impact of these new policies on the
total replication cost. Another important goal is to assess the impact of
server heterogeneity, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. In
this paper, we establish several new complexity results, and provide several
efficient polynomial heuristics for NP-complete instances of the problem. These
heuristics are compared to an absolute lower bound provided by the formulation
of the problem in terms of the solution of an integer linear program.

 <dc:description>  The concept of k-anonymity, used in the recent literature to formally
evaluate the privacy preservation of published tables, was introduced based on
the notion of quasi-identifiers (or QI for short). The process of obtaining
k-anonymity for a given private table is first to recognize the QIs in the
table, and then to anonymize the QI values, the latter being called
k-anonymization. While k-anonymization is usually rigorously validated by the
authors, the definition of QI remains mostly informal, and different authors
seem to have different interpretations of the concept of QI. The purpose of
this paper is to provide a formal underpinning of QI and examine the
correctness and incorrectness of various interpretations of QI in our formal
framework. We observe that in cases where the concept has been used correctly,
its application has been conservative; this note provides a formal
understanding of the conservative nature in such cases.

 <dc:description>  Cultural heritage documentation induces the use of computerized techniques to
manage and preserve the information produced. Geographical information systems
have proved their potentialities in this scope, but they are not always adapted
for the management of features at the scale of a particular archaeological
site. Moreover, computer applications in archaeology are often technology
driven and software constrained. Thus, we propose a tool that tries to avoid
these difficulties. We are developing an information system that works over the
Internet and that is joined with a web site. Aims are to assist the work of
archaeological sites managers and to be a documentation tool about these sites,
dedicated to everyone. We devote therefore our system both to the professionals
who are in charge of the site, and to the general public who visits it or who
wants to have information on it. The system permits to do exploratory analyses
of the data, especially at spatial and temporal levels. We propose to record
metadata about the archaeological features in XML and to access these features
through interactive 2D and 3D representations, and through queries systems
(keywords and images). The 2D images, photos, or vectors are generated in SVG,
while 3D models are generated in X3D. Archaeological features are also
automatically integrated in a MySQL database. The web site is an exchange
platform with the information system and is written in PHP. Our first
application case is the medieval castle of Vianden, Luxembourg.

 <dc:description>  The decision tree is one of the most fundamental programming abstractions. A
commonly used type of decision tree is the alphabetic binary tree, which uses
(without loss of generality) ``less than'' versus ''greater than or equal to''
tests in order to determine one of $n$ outcome events. The process of finding
an optimal alphabetic binary tree for a known probability distribution on
outcome events usually has the underlying assumption that the cost (time) per
decision is uniform and thus independent of the outcome of the decision. This
assumption, however, is incorrect in the case of software to be optimized for a
given microprocessor, e.g., in compiling switch statements or in fine-tuning
program bottlenecks. The operation of the microprocessor generally means that
the cost for the more likely decision outcome can or will be less -- often far
less -- than the less likely decision outcome. Here we formulate a variety of
$O(n^3)$-time $O(n^2)$-space dynamic programming algorithms to solve such
optimal binary decision tree problems, optimizing for the behavior of
processors with predictive branch capabilities, both static and dynamic. In the
static case, we use existing results to arrive at entropy-based performance
bounds. Solutions to this formulation are often faster in practice than
``optimal'' decision trees as formulated in the literature, and, for small
problems, are easily worth the extra complexity in finding the better solution.
This can be applied in fast implementation of decoding Huffman codes.

 <dc:title>Nonsymmetric entropy I: basic concepts and results</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Chengshi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new concept named nonsymmetric entropy which generalizes the concepts of
Boltzman's entropy and shannon's entropy, was introduced. Maximal nonsymmetric
entropy principle was proven. Some important distribution laws were derived
naturally from maximal nonsymmetric entropy principle.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider tiling $\{p, q \}$ of the Euclidean space and of
the hyperbolic space, and its dual graph $\Gamma_{q, p}$ from a combinatorial
point of view. A substitution $\sigma_{q, p}$ on an appropriate finite alphabet
is constructed. The homogeneity of graph $\Gamma_{q, p}$ and its generation
function are the basic tools for the construction. The tree associated with
substitution $\sigma_{q, p}$ is a spanning tree of graph $\Gamma_{q, p}$. Let
$u_n$ be the number of tiles of tiling $\{p, q \}$ of generation $n$. The
characteristic polynomial of the transition matrix of substitution $\sigma_{q,
p}$ is a characteristic polynomial of a linear recurrence. The sequence
$(u_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is a solution of this recurrence. The growth of sequence
$(u_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is given by the dominant root of the characteristic
polynomial.

 <dc:title>The Formal System lambda-delta</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The formal system lambda-delta is a typed lambda calculus that pursues the
unification of terms, types, environments and contexts as the main goal.
lambda-delta takes some features from the Automath-related lambda calculi and
some from the pure type systems, but differs from both in that it does not
include the Pi construction while it provides for an abbreviation mechanism at
the level of terms. lambda-delta enjoys some important desirable properties
such as the confluence of reduction, the correctness of types, the uniqueness
of types up to conversion, the subject reduction of the type assignment, the
strong normalization of the typed terms and, as a corollary, the decidability
of type inference problem.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider systems of partial (multidimensional) linear
difference equations. Specifically, such systems arise in scientific computing
under discretization of linear partial differential equations and in
computational high energy physics as recurrence relations for multiloop Feynman
integrals. The most universal algorithmic tool for investigation of linear
difference systems is based on their transformation into an equivalent Groebner
basis form. We present an algorithm for this transformation implemented in
Maple. The algorithm and its implementation can be applied to automatic
generation of difference schemes for linear partial differential equations and
to reduction of Feynman integrals. Some illustrative examples are given.

 <dc:description>  We consider Dense-Timed Petri Nets (TPN), an extension of Petri nets in which
each token is equipped with a real-valued clock and where the semantics is lazy
(i.e., enabled transitions need not fire; time can pass and disable
transitions). We consider the following verification problems for TPNs. (i)
Zenoness: whether there exists a zeno-computation from a given marking, i.e.,
an infinite computation which takes only a finite amount of time. We show
decidability of zenoness for TPNs, thus solving an open problem from [Escrig et
al.]. Furthermore, the related question if there exist arbitrarily fast
computations from a given marking is also decidable. On the other hand,
universal zenoness, i.e., the question if all infinite computations from a
given marking are zeno, is undecidable. (ii) Token liveness: whether a token is
alive in a marking, i.e., whether there is a computation from the marking which
eventually consumes the token. We show decidability of the problem by reducing
it to the coverability problem, which is decidable for TPNs. (iii) Boundedness:
whether the size of the reachable markings is bounded. We consider two versions
of the problem; namely semantic boundedness where only live tokens are taken
into consideration in the markings, and syntactic boundedness where also dead
tokens are considered. We show undecidability of semantic boundedness, while we
prove that syntactic boundedness is decidable through an extension of the
Karp-Miller algorithm.

 <dc:creator>Jha, Sumit Kumar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>B.5.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This draft suggests a new counterexample guided abstraction refinement
(CEGAR) framework that uses the combination of numerical simulation for
nonlinear differential equations with linear programming for linear hybrid
automata (LHA) to perform reachability analysis on nonlinear hybrid automata. A
notion of $\epsilon-$ structural robustness is also introduced which allows the
algorithm to validate counterexamples using numerical simulations.
  Keywords: verification, model checking, hybrid systems, hybrid automata,
robustness, robust hybrid systems, numerical simulation, cegar, abstraction
refinement.

 <dc:title>On the Solution-Space Geometry of Random Constraint Satisfaction
  Problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For a large number of random constraint satisfaction problems, such as random
k-SAT and random graph and hypergraph coloring, there are very good estimates
of the largest constraint density for which solutions exist. Yet, all known
polynomial-time algorithms for these problems fail to find solutions even at
much lower densities. To understand the origin of this gap we study how the
structure of the space of solutions evolves in such problems as constraints are
added. In particular, we prove that much before solutions disappear, they
organize into an exponential number of clusters, each of which is relatively
small and far apart from all other clusters. Moreover, inside each cluster most
variables are frozen, i.e., take only one value. The existence of such frozen
variables gives a satisfying intuitive explanation for the failure of the
polynomial-time algorithms analyzed so far. At the same time, our results
establish rigorously one of the two main hypotheses underlying Survey
Propagation, a heuristic introduced by physicists in recent years that appears
to perform extraordinarily well on random constraint satisfaction problems.

 <dc:title>Capacity of a Class of Deterministic Relay Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cover, Thomas M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Young-Han</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The capacity of a class of deterministic relay channels with the transmitter
input X, the receiver output Y, the relay output Y_1 = f(X, Y), and a separate
communication link from the relay to the receiver with capacity R_0, is shown
to be
  C(R_0) = \max_{p(x)} \min \{I(X;Y)+R_0, I(X;Y, Y_1) \}.
  Thus every bit from the relay is worth exactly one bit to the receiver. Two
alternative coding schemes are presented that achieve this capacity. The first
scheme, ``hash-and-forward'', is based on a simple yet novel use of random
binning on the space of relay outputs, while the second scheme uses the usual
``compress-and-forward''. In fact, these two schemes can be combined together
to give a class of optimal coding schemes. As a corollary, this relay capacity
result confirms a conjecture by Ahlswede and Han on the capacity of a channel
with rate-limited state information at the decoder in the special case when the
channel state is recoverable from the channel input and the output.

 <dc:title>How Random is a Coin Toss? Bayesian Inference and the Symbolic Dynamics

 <dc:description>  Symbolic dynamics has proven to be an invaluable tool in analyzing the
mechanisms that lead to unpredictability and random behavior in nonlinear
dynamical systems. Surprisingly, a discrete partition of continuous state space
can produce a coarse-grained description of the behavior that accurately
describes the invariant properties of an underlying chaotic attractor. In
particular, measures of the rate of information production--the topological and
metric entropy rates--can be estimated from the outputs of Markov or generating
partitions. Here we develop Bayesian inference for k-th order Markov chains as
a method to finding generating partitions and estimating entropy rates from
finite samples of discretized data produced by coarse-grained dynamical
systems.

 <dc:title>A Low-Footprint Class Loading Mechanism for Embedded Java Virtual

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Operating Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper shows that it is possible to dramatically reduce the memory
consumption of classes loaded in an embedded Java virtual machine without
reducing its functionalities. We describe how to pack the constant pool by
deleting entries which are only used during the class loading process. We
present some benchmarks which demonstrate the efficiency of this mechanism. We
finally suggest some additional optimizations which can be applied if some
restrictions to the functionalities of the virtual machine can be tolerated.

 <dc:title>Using Existing Network Simulators for Power-Aware Self-Organizing
  Wireless Sensor Network Protocols</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Watteyne, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this document, we compare three existing simulation platforms (OPNET
Modeler, Network Simulator 2, Georgia Tech Sensor Network Simulator). Our
comparative study focuses on ease of use, scalability, ease of implementing
power consumption model and physical layer modeling accuracy, mainly.
Conclusions of this study are presented, and will help us decide which
simulating environment to use for evaluating power-aware self-organizing sensor
networks protocols.

 <dc:title>Formalising Sylow's theorems in Coq</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thery, Laurent</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This report presents a formalisation of Sylow's theorems done in {\sc Coq}.
The formalisation has been done in a couple of weeks on top of Georges
Gonthier's {\sc ssreflect} \cite{ssreflect}. There were two ideas behind
formalising Sylow's theorems. The first one was to get familiar with Georges
way of doing proofs. The second one was to contribute to the collective effort
to formalise a large subset of group theory in {\sc Coq} with some non-trivial
proofs.}

 <dc:description>  The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with its related extensions is the most popular
artificial neural algorithm for use in unsupervised learning, clustering,
classification and data visualization. Over 5,000 publications have been
reported in the open literature, and many commercial projects employ the SOM as
a tool for solving hard real-world problems. Each two years, the &quot;Workshop on
Self-Organizing Maps&quot; (WSOM) covers the new developments in the field. The WSOM
series of conferences was initiated in 1997 by Prof. Teuvo Kohonen, and has
been successfully organized in 1997 and 1999 by the Helsinki University of
Technology, in 2001 by the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside, and in
2003 by the Kyushu Institute of Technology. The Universit\'{e} Paris I
Panth\'{e}on Sorbonne (SAMOS-MATISSE research centre) organized WSOM 2005 in
Paris on September 5-8, 2005.

 <dc:title>Is the cyclic prefix necessary?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sharma, Naresh</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tikku, Ashok Armen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show that one can do away with the cyclic prefix (CP) for SC-FDE and OFDM
at the cost of a moderate increase in the complexity of a DFT-based receiver.
Such an approach effectively deals with the decrease in the number of channel
uses due to the introduction of the CP. It is shown that the SINR for SC-FDE
remains the same asymptotically with the proposed receiver without CP as that
of the conventional receiver with CP. The results are shown for $N_t$ transmit
antennas and $N_r$ receive antennas where $N_r \geq N_t$.
